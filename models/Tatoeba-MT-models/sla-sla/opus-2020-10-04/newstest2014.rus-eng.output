In China and the region, two men killed suicide
Previously, one of the hanged had already attempted suicide.
30 October, approximately 1-00, in the village of Lugovo on its residence in 1947, a man was born to commit suicide by hanging.
It is known that he had already tried suicide before.
What made the man a step unknown.
On October 31, at 11-50, a 41-year-old man, a Chinese resident, died in the place of residence.
No signs of violent death have been found, reports the IMD Press Service "Kineshemski".
The black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair the autoway system, many begin to see a solution in a small black box that is precisely built on your car's machine.
These devices that follow every mile-tracking and transmitting this information to the officials are in the centre of a dispute attempt to modernize an older US road financing system that has been undertaken by the planned authorities of Washington and the State.
Usually, the boring stage of road planning has unexpectedly produced intense debate and colored alliances.
The Liberians joined the environmental groups in lobbying the Government's right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you have driven, and even perhaps where you drive them, and then to use this information in the drawing of tax accounts.
Tea cheerleader movement in shock.
The American Union of Civil Freedoms is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions regarding private life.
Although the congress is still unable to negotiate, whether to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They think about the way for the next decade, you can move to the system where drivers pay for every mile of the road they travel.
Thousands of carriers have already tested these black boxes, part of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is really necessary for our country.
"It is not the question that we may have the right to choose," said Hasan Ihrat, Executive Director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which is preparing plans for monitoring by the state's authorities of miles by each Californian carrier, by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There are technologies for that already.
The need for this is accelerated by the lack of funds from the Government's Highway Building Fund funded by taxes paid by Americans on auto-fuels.
The Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars travel more than miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not risen for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to increase tax even one cent at high gas prices.
"The tax on gas simply cannot be saved," said Lee Mannic, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices have recently been installed on the vehicles for the testing of the failing payment system.
“It will be the best alternative in the long term” he said.
It is called a pleasant user wage.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as taxes will change the nature of travels to reduce the loading of roads and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The planned bodies in California are looking at this system in the development of strategies to achieve the targets established by the ambitious laws of the State to combat global warming.
However, a member of the Chamber of Representatives Bill Schuster (republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the Transport Committee, said that he also considered the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free Market members in the Reason Foundation are also excited to make drivers pay for each mile.
"It is not just a tax that will go to the black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President for Political Affairs, Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former United States Ministers of Transport, who called on the Congress to move in the direction of a mistaken payment in 2011.
The United States Senate adopted a pilot project last year worth $90 million, with approximately 10,000 cars involved.
However, the leaders of the Chamber of Representatives rejected this proposal because of the fears of rural legislators representing voters, who often have to travel a lot of miles in the daily life to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, go on their own way.
The greatest enthusiasm is shown in the state of Oregon, where 5000 drivers are attracted to participate in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for miles of race instead of gas taxes.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
It's in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with loading vehicles.
The I-95 coalition, which includes transport departments of 17 East Coast States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), examines how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been generally recognised.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, the drivers were concerned that the Government could monitor each step.
“The concern about the “great brother” and such things is a major problem”, said Alauddin Han, leading the strategy and efficiency management in the Nevada Transport Department.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests took a full move, the American Union of Civil Freedoms in Nevada warned on its website: “It will not be difficult to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices.”
There is no need to create a huge, massive technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to store records of daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of the several states in which difficult searches for low cost technology, which would allow the authorities of the state to take into account the car miles but without information about the location and time.
If you can do that, Han said, society will feel more calm.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
At first, the company did not contribute to the tax collection of state taxes.
It seeked to go to the developing market of auto-insurance, where the drivers were paid on the basis of a run.
But the devices it tests attract road designers because they do not use GPS and provide limited numbers of information periodically loaded with modem.
"The people will be more inclined to do this if you do not monitor their speed and follow their location," said Ryan Morrison, Executive Director of True Mileage.
There were several major mistakes in some of these pilot programmes of the State.
There are much less expensive and less impulsive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers experiment with the provision of various options to drivers.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they may completely renounce the device, deciding instead to pay the fixed collection based on the average number of miles that all inhabitants of the state.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea of cautioned public by making devices do more than less.
In New York, transport officials seek to develop a taxpayer that will also receive the parking charges, provide “payments as you drive” insurance and collect a real-time speed pool from other drivers that carriers could use to avoid traffic.
“Automobilists will be attracted to the benefits they will be offered”, states the construction document.
Some transport systems designers, however, are wondering whether all talks about error payments are just an enormous distraction factor.
In the city transport commission in the area of the Gulf of San Francisco, officials say that the congress could easily overcome the bankruptcy of the Highway Road Construction Fund by taxing gas taxes.
A supplementary single or annual tax could be taken from hybrid vehicle drivers and other persons whose vehicles do not use much gas to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery when all you have to do is accept aspirin” said Randy Rantschler, director of the Legislative and Public Relations Commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their private life and the number of other things.
EU is preparing support measures for Ukraine in the event of Russian economic pressure
The European Union has a reserve plan to ensure Ukraine with gas and agreement with the IMF on an emergency credit if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement at the Vilnius Summit.
The IMF has been negotiated on stand-by credit, and another EU official, directly participating in the negotiations, added that their aim is to conclude the agreement soon.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF Ukraine, there can be 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts questioned by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and IMF are able to overcome long-term disagreements on financing conditions.
It does not believe in the possibility of reforms necessary to obtain assistance, and the international S&P rating agency, which declined the sovereign rating of Ukraine on Friday by one degree, before the B- of B.
However, EU representatives say that IMF can be flexible in terms of credit, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country ' s financial support plan, the EU has a reserve option to ensure Ukraine with gas, which is now a suppressive part of the supplies from Russia.
It may be a gas from the North Stream, or a Slovakia reverser.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way if Russia isolates Ukraine.
Analysts believe that such reverse supplies in Ukraine can only be used within a few weeks and will likely reduce supplies to other regions.
"Mean EU and Ukraine countries are negotiated on how to create favourable conditions to enable Ukraine to import gas from other sources, not from Russia or from the same source, but by other routes," the source of Reuters added.
Russia outside the fight for car pollution
The attempts to address the transport problems of major cities were seen in most megapolises of the world from the second half of the 20th century.
In general, it was either their restructuring and expansion of roads, or attempting to reduce the demand for road trips, the number of cars and the time of use.
Singapur's example is widely known, where the auction is acquired with a strict acquisition of the number of private cars.
His price may be twice or three times higher than the price of the car itself.
The European cities, including London, have introduced payments for entry into the city center.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stutgart, the so-called green zones are introduced, where only cars with a certain ecoclass that also use high quality fuel (including biofuels or electrical vehicles).
The Beijing Environment Protection Agency, for example, approved in 2012 a total of about 250 billion Yuanas (approximately $40 billion).
As told by the Director of the Director of the Department for Transport Pollutants of the Municipal Environmental Protection Office of Beijing Lee Kuncheng, the main objective of the five-year target is to reduce air pollution by 20 to 35 per cent by 2017, to increase the number of private cars not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million), as well as to increase not more than 5 per cent of the use of fuel in one vehicle.
According to the Agency, it is now responsible for 22.5 per cent of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the programme is the limitation of the use of road transport and the introduction of additional taxes to the owners.
Furthermore, urban measures of "green five years" include acceleration in comparison with the rest of the country to the euro fuel standards, the introduction of the local system of ecostandarts and vehicles and fuel marking, the restriction on the entry of vehicles to the central city, the prohibition of the use of older vehicles (including high-speed) (including the establishment of encouraging financial programmes to replace old cars with hybrid or electrical vehicles), the development of electricity (including public and service), the development of public transport (including high-speed).
Beijing's vehicle innovation is also prohibited for all private vehicles to move within the fifth transport ring (almost the capital of the CNB six) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in a vehicle number) and the issue of registration signs for vehicles based on the lottery (e.g. in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of private vehicle registration permits in Beijing was only a third of the year 2010).
According to the current Environmental Protection Programme for 2012-2020, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 was 138).
According to Min приroda, 41 per cent of the emissions of pollutants in the urban atmosphere had in 2011.
In Moscow, for example, car emissions ten times exceed industrial and in St. Petersburg, nine times.
The RF is just beginning to think about the possibility of restrictive control of vehicles on the streets of the city.
The Director of the Institute for Transport and Transport Policy, Michael Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at discontinuing the demand for road trips are not popular, but they can be taken by society only if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem with the structure of its park, where there are two clusters of weak sensitive to any regulatory impact, official and personal vehicles, as well as vehicles of "privileged" users, whose total number is at least 200 thousand (about 5 per cent of the total Moscow park).
During the days of the ECOM Centre, the urbanists in St. Petersburg prepared a study on the balance of urban territories between housing, road coverage and the quantity of transport.
The main findings of researchers: the city center is provided by roads twice as much as the required, and most carists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them on parking for a long time or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed not to build parking, but to expand the car storage, but to reduce the passing part (to reduce the streets to become more friendly for pedestrians), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the territory of the historical security zone (about 3212 ha, covering a number of central areas of the city).
Punishment for unauthorized street trade in Volgode will grow at a time
According to urban authorities, the increase of fines will help to order in the Vologde and free the streets from natural tents and bowls.
Most street traders do not pay taxes, the product they carry out often does not pass appropriate sanitation control.
This means that the health of moisture is threatened.
Thus, the lower penalty limit for the citizens for unauthorized trade since November will increase six times from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, reports the press service of the Vлага Administration.
Goldman Sachs warned about the risks for the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned about increasing risks for the main driver of crude economic growth in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of insufficient consumer loans and mass reductions in workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather the structure of this growth.
Recently, it has been fully caused by consumption that almost does not reduce traffic," said the principal economist Goldman Sachs for Russia Clemens Graffe, presenting yesterday a quarterly report of the Russian economy.
The nominal salary growth in Russia is about 10 per cent.
With the inflation of 6 per cent, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at approximately the current level, the Goldman Sachs expects.
However, the rental of Russian companies is declined, so they are likely to be optimized for staff costs.
Today we see a significant increase in GDP salary: if the salary increases by 10 per cent, GDP is only 2 per cent,” explained Mr. Graffe.
Companies faced a reduction in rental capacity.
If it doesn't grow up, it can lead to dismissal and unemployment growth.
The Russian business cannot pay, comments the main economist Barclays Capital for Russia and CNG Vladimir Pantushin.
Unemployment near historical minimums, competitiveness for workers is high.
The employees must raise their wages to overcome or maintain the current staff.
The consumption in Russia is also living in a very rapid increase in demand.
Mr. Graffe believed that, due to extremely high consumer loans, this type of credit has not been affected by the country ' s multiplication economies.
"We have not seen the benefits of the economy from the increase in demand, money is not distracted by the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments," the economist said.
But the problem in the second is that Goldman Sachs expects an increase in insufficient loans.
They are mainly taken by poor people who have nothing to provide for.
Percentages for such loans are high.
As a result, they are not often returned," said Mr. Graffe.
Therefore, the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is a possible crisis of insufficient loans.
The Director of the Banking Institute of the WCH, Vasilij Solodkov, has already seen signs of agricultural banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to cheap resources they have, were forced to attract the population at high rates.
In response, the guests went to war and began to reduce credit rates, the economist continued.
Small credit organisations cannot loans at the same rate, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the hosts do not give up the demping, Russia is threatening a full banking crisis, believes Vasilius Solodkov.
The deprivation of a number of banks in recent weeks, the economist considers a mass crash.
"Impacts will not be able to succeed in such a situation: the Investment Insurance System was not initially relyed on the systemic crisis," warned the head of the Institute.
However, consumption will slow down and without a crisis of non-payment, it is believed in the investment, because of the refusal of the inventory and military salary indexed in the current version of the draft budget.
Partial impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of natural monopoly tariffs (and, as a result, reduced inflation).
But only partly: if investments do not grow (and the prerequisites are not yet available), consumption will still slow down, as assured by Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantushin from Barclays Capital has not yet seen a prerequisite for the implementation of pessimistic scripts.
"The main risk is still the fall of oil price," he said.
It estimates that Russia's economy will start to reduce with oil value below $90/bar.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the CB has not yet been able to reduce the interest rates in the economy.
A paradoxal picture is observed: inflation fell down, and banks began to raise rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the CB that announced the transition to the inflation Target," said Clemens Grafe.
The interest policy of the Central Bank on market rates does not affect, but only affects interbank credit rates.
"For CB, it's a collapse of all hopes," Clemens Graffe appreciated.
Money received at the BC auctions, banks use not to loan the economy, but to manage their liquidity
Once the rate is lowered, the currency rate is immediately changed, which means that the funds are trying to go to speculation against rubber.
" Early or later, the CB will realize that this strategy is not working," said Mr. Graffe and recalled that the State planned to put a ruble into "flood" by the end of 2015.
But either we have to do this earlier, or to raise the key rate of CB (5.5 per cent), he considers.
It estimates that the course of rubber is now artificially higher by 10 per cent.
I'm only one way to weaken, the expert's conclusion.
But if the CB dive into financialists a shadow of doubt that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the ruble weakening policy, it could break the rubl much stronger.
There was a second meeting of the peoples of South Ural in Chelabinsk.
The Forum is based on the Day of People's Unity, the 400th year of the restoration of the Russian State and the 20th year of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
Delegations from all cities and areas, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious religions, legislative and executive authorities participated in the work of the meeting, totally around 350 people.
The forum course aims at strengthening international consent.
We can show an example not only to other regions but also to other countries.
We don't have any differences or differences.
We live in full understanding," said Feofan, mytropolitan Chelabinsky and Goldoustowski.
A number of issues, including patriotism, cultural cooperation, were discussed during the meeting.
After the meeting, the resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theatre.
There was an exhibition of national and cultural associations in the Chelabin area.
Snowden is willing to cooperate with Germany in the issue of United States Intelligence
Edward Snowden, U.S. Intelligence Explorer, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the Agency of National Security of the United States and its director Keith Alexandr could not answer the questions of their activities.
The German Deputy Hans-Christian Strebelle met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was given asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
The letter from Mr. Snowden, who was presented by the representative of the media in Berlin on Friday, stated: “Although the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my Government continues to view the contrary to betrayment and strives to criminalize political statements by criminal accusations without protection.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In a letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the Government of the United States to renounce criminal charges against him.
The charges made by the United States Ministry of Justice include spying and stealing public property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Minister for Interior, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make it possible.”
The relations between the United States and Germany have become tense after allegations that the NSA was listening to Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy chairman of the parliamentary intelligence courier, said that if there is a possibility to hear Mr. Snowen as a witness, “without prejudice to his danger and incomplete relations with the United States”, it should be used.
Mr. Straubelle, a parliamentary representative of the Green Germany party, published his photograph with Mr. Snowden in his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strebelle said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden had testified in Germany, he would need guarantees that he would be there “in security”, said the deputy.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he encountered a " hard and permanent " campaign of persecution, which forced him to leave his house.
However, he said that he was encouraging by the global response to his political expressions.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-level officials, including in the United States, have considered the disclosure of the uncontrolled system of inclusive monitoring useful to society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities, “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will pay for manual wages
Frontier Airlines planned to take from passengers up to $100 for carrying a manual board on their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to begin to take up to $100 for hand bet and $2 for coffee or gasoline, although their announcement on Wednesday said that passengers would be able to keep the whole bank.
The new manual wage is distributed to the bags in the top bag sections, so the small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said that it would take $25 if the collection was paid in advance, and $100 if the travellers were to pay, only when they were coming to land.
The representative of Frontier, Kate O'Malley, said that the salary of $100 should make passengers take care of payments in advance.
"We do not want to pay for this," she said.
The airlines began to pay for the first and second bag to the luggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these assemblies are getting as much as they can, in a manual bet placed in the upper baggage segment, which often lacks space in these sections.
The congregations are one of the ways to make passengers move less to the ship.
O'Malley said that this new gathering isn't really for money.
The fact is that the most loyal Frontier clients claim that finding a place in the upper baggage sections is getting more difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline website will not pay.
This means that one passenger at the turn to the Frontier flight can be able to carry the bag free, while the next passenger in a sequence can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that the change in procedures on the website and the Frontier registration stocks were intended to guarantee that passengers would know about the collection before they arrived.
The new Frontier collection for the manual bet will not begin until summer, although the date is not yet set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other collections, but airlines love them.
They claim that the processing of the luggage is worth money, and passengers who need this service must pay for it.
Many in Wall Street consider the addition of baggage collections that airlines are taking enough money to cover aircraft costs after a few years of loss.
However, most of them did not deal with manual collections.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first manual collection three years ago, and another diskauter Allegiant Air later followed her example.
The only other aviation company with such a collection is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the Aviation Company advisor Jay Sorensen, who monitors the supplementary collections carefully.
According to his assessment in the report of December 2011, Spirit collects $50 million a year.
Sorensen, the former top manager of Midwest Airlines, was recently flying the Spirit flight, and he was wondering what he would find at the landing exit when passengers encountered an unusual Spirit collection for a manual bet.
"The landing process was the smoothest of the career I've seen in airlines," he said.
I was expecting to see the teeth scratch and the fight coming out of the land.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing went quickly."
Frontier also follows Spirit for $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who receive sodium or juice can keep the whole bank and that the flow of coffee will be provided free.
It will continue to distribute water for free.
US Airways tried to pay drinks for a short time in 2008, but denied it seven months after the passengers began to complain and no other major airlines followed it.
Frontier's initiative for hand-paid wages, when passengers don't buy tickets directly from the airline, is its last step to draw clients on their website.
Aviation companies are paid to online ticket sellers, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than tourism online agencies.
However, the Frontier went further in this area.
In September, she began to give twice the bonus miles a frequent traveller to customers who bought tickets through the online tourist agency.
On Wednesday, it cut the premium of miles to 25 per cent from the miles of the journey.
So, a thousand miles from Frontier, acquired from the online tourist agency, would make it possible to get 250 miles.
Furthermore, passengers can be elected in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a base of loyal clients in Denver's hometown, but its business is reduced and deprived.
The remuneration decreased by 9 per cent, and the summer opportunities decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published by the Parental Company of the Republic of Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the sale of airlines.
NSA blames “internal error” rather than hackers for ceasing the site
The National Safety Agency stated on Friday night that the termination of their website for several hours had caused technical disturbance rather than hackers, as it was said in the network.
“NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of the internal error that occurred during the planned update”, the Intelligence Agency reported in the official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Statements that a breakdown in work had been caused by a distributed type of “service refusal” [DDOS], are not valid.
Earlier this evening, the server monitoring systems registered that the NSA website had not worked at least six hours, and the website was still unavailable for some users.
The NSA representative previously reported ABC News that the internal secret network of the "no" agency had been broken.
No secret information is in danger, said the representative.
At least one online group of hacker activists stated that it was responsible for finding out from the NSA website through DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to squeeze the target site with traffic until the servers are reloaded and the site is out of line.
Hackers' tactics are relatively simple and attacks are not intended for invasion into the internal network of the target system.
Previously, the supersecret NSA, the formerly receiving the name “Not of such an Agency”, has been found in the centre of public attention and criticism in recent months after a row of discoveries on its widespread programs of monitoring abroad and in the country -- all the response to the NSA secret files stolen from the agency and published by the former ANB staff member Edward Snowden.
The growing debate around the agency has led to the fact that today's incident was the result of targeted hackers.
Bombardier arrival declines with the drop of supplies and number of orders for aircraft
The Bombardier, the Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported on Thursday the reduction of net profit by 15 per cent under the impact of the decreased number of orders and shipments of aircraft in the third quarter and contracts in its railway unit.
The company Bombardier, located in Montreal, also has not published any summer tests of its latest CSeries and has not provided new information on whether ambitious plans for the introduction of the aircraft will be implemented on the next September.
After the first flight of an experienced aircraft sample, held about a month and a half ago, he flew only three more times, which raises questions about whether the stage of schedule tests is ongoing.
The results did not justify the projections and resulted in more than 8 per cent decline in the Toronto Foundation.
Cameron Doerxen, analyst of National Bank Finance, reduced his assessment from " above the middle-night" on Thursday to "medium-night" because of the belief that the growth of shares was limited to the next quarter or two.
“Although the reduction of aircraft delivery was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed by the profits of the transport department,” said Doerxen in the review of the Fund market.
We believe that the Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries when the summer testing programme continues.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that the market will be more sceptic to the programme.
The Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will allow her to take a place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus are now dominated.
The first experienced sample of the aircraft was presented in March and for the first time flyed in September after a few months of delay.
However, CSeries' hard orders are not too large to 177, since potential buyers are waiting for summer tests to verify the claims of the company on fuel efficiency and potential economies of the new лайнer.
There are 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators.
The Chief Executive Director Pierre Bodwin was convinced that the Bombardier would reach its goal at 300 hard orders until the first plane was launched in commercial operation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured the analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward according to the plan.
“The test model of the plane has not remained on the ground longer than it was expected” said Bodwan during the telephone conference, adding that land tests and updates were planned during a simple plane.
All producers plan the tests differently.
We decided to take the first flight and make a break for updates, so we did.
This will take place during the whole summer testing programme.
The second of the five test samples should fly in the next weeks and all the others will soon follow it, as the company reported.
However, the analysts are skeptical about the statement that the first client will be able to run the CSeries plane 12 months after his first flight.
The Bombardier stated that it evaluated the term of introduction and would provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow summer test rate - although, apparently, and corresponds to the internal Bombardier - supports our view that the introduction into operation will be transferred to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerxen.
In the third quarter, ending on 30 September, the net income of Bombardier decreased to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents for the share last year.
The adjusted profits remained previous — 9 cents.
The gross income decreased slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected 10 cents for stock and gross income $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth world-wide aircraft producer reported that he placed 45 aircraft per quarter, less than the previous year, 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 planes.
The Aviation Division's pursuit portfolio amounted to $32.9 billion per 30 September, without changing from 31 December.
“In the aviation area, the results were in line with our goals, but the low number of orders and the general market conditions became an unpleasant factor”, said Bodwan.
The gross aviation income dropped by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the largest train manufacturer in the world, reported that gross income in the sector increased by almost 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport unit was $32.6 billion per 30 September, which was a little higher than the rate of 31 December.
The income of the transport unit had a negative impact on several major contracts.
The Guide stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier, which also announced that Google Patrick Pichett's principal financial director would enter the board of directors, fell by 8.5 per cent to C$4.83 in trades in the middle of Thursday.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the third world-wide commercial aircraft producer and the nearest competitor of Bombardier, reported on Thursday the reduction of the quarterly income by 10 per cent.
Sony counts on a lower annual profit
The Japanese Electronic Manufacturer, Sony's corporation, completed the past quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the profit forecast for the current financial year.
The results of Sony for the period from July to September 2013 were more embarrassing than expected in terms of the decline in demand for television, videocams and personal computers of Japanese corporation.
The Sony Television Business, in the second quarter of the first three-year operational profits of 5.2 billion yen, fell again to 9.3 billion in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronic market suffers difficult times, especially because of television demand reduction.
While competitors strive to seek a solution from the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main rivals, the Panasonic Corporation, has recently accented on industrial compilation: sales of companies are increasing highly, especially through road systems and environmentally clean technologies.
As a result of the end of the financial year ending in March 2014, Sony was counting to receive 179 billion yen operating profits against the expected 230 billion yen.
However, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts assumed that the indicator would be significantly higher and would be 221 billion yen.

Gen's speech was a stimulator for synapse education
Scientists from the University of John Hopkins and the Mount Sinai Medical School found a protein that led to the "gen speech" of Foxp2 to perform its function by stimulating the education of new links between neurons.
The study is published in Science, and the magazine can read its brief content on the website.
Gen Foxp2 is the first known gene, whose function is directly related to the speech.
It was successful in 2001 by identifying a family of several people who could not speak properly and sometimes even not understand each other.
Scientists found that family members had been disrupted by the work of Foxp2 gene, but how he performed his function, it remained unknown.
A new study showed that at least a part of its functions, Foxp2, has been a stimulator for the education of new brain synapses.
It implements it through another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of searching for factors that stimulate synapse education.
SRPX2 was one of the 10 similar genes found by the authors, with only Foxp2.
What SRPX2 really affects the vocalization, scientists confirmed in the mice experiment.
When the animal's gene activity was artificially reduced, they were less screaming when dividing with their mother.
If the gene activity was restored, the frequency of the sounds was also restored.
The mice has also been linked to the foxp2.
Animals with human copies of the gene were more active and low frequency than ordinary mouses.
However, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 is linked and, according to the SRPX2 managed by it, with purely " mechanical" properties of sound education or more thin processes.
Lawyer with cocaine dependence who warned the head of the criminal group of police investigations in prison
42-year-old Basarat Ditta provided information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarboro
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be disclosed.
It was sentenced to three years of prison by the Liverpool Royal Court.
The prestigious attorney who told the narcotics about a major police investigation because he feared to reveal his secret drug addiction was imprisoned for three years.
42-year-old Basarat Ditta has transmitted secret information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarboro on his investigation on illicit drug trafficking after he was threatened by his cocaine addiction.
The attorney named Bašo and called “cool attorney” was arrested at home in 2011 after a police surveillance surveillance operation for Scarboro, which he had before presented in a drug-related court.
The officers noticed that a 32-year-old Scarboro left three cocaine packages at the house of a lawyer in Blackburn County of Lankashire while he was at the dinner of the lawyers with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta “used ” drugs of class A regularly after the tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he tried illegally to obtain information on the arrests of two persons under Scarboro, as well as one of his associates.
All four suspects had been observed by the police during the extensive investigation of the criminal organization ' s heroin and cocaine acquisition in Lankashire, Cambria, Merciside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police rented heroin and cocaine in a series of £1.5 million and more than 200 thousand cash.
The 42-year-old Ditta provided information to the criminals because of the fear that his cocaine addiction would be disclosed.
Today, at the Liverpool Royal Court of Ditta, who works at the Forbes Solicitors legal company in Blackburn, he was ashamed of recognizing his guilt in two cases of intentionally impeding the implementation of justice in the three-week court in the Liverpool Court of the crown.
He recognized the storage of cocaine at one of the previous trials.
The disclosure of the lawyer occurred after the Scarboro research police discovered that he regularly spoke to Ditta on the phone from February 2011.
Two detectives were tracked by the suspect and discovered how he came to the house of Ditt in Blackburn and placed 60 per cent cleanness drugs in the black golf glove under the judicial trash box.
Shortly after Scarboro’s transfer, he repeatedly called Ditta, who was at the football stadium Iwood Park, Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; there were nine talks between them.
The court found that Ditta “used ” cocaine regularly after the tests found drug traces of class A in his hair, purse and on its credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later, but he denyed the use of cocaine, said he was talking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and insisted that their communication was a “lawful secret”.
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to extract several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and he also had a sample of hair.
At the police interrogation, he said he had a office, and his clients came to him for legal matters.
However, the court was aware that after the important arrests, he called the largest participants of illicit drug trafficking, a number of whom he had before presented in the court to tell what the detectives knew about them.
Anne White, in the accused speech, said: “If anyone knows that the law should not be violated, it is a criminal attorney.”
Mr. Ditta was accused of being abused by his criminal attorney because he had become too close to certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer that supplies drugs with his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations will certainly prove legitimate, as he was their lawyer.
However, this has significantly overcome the limits of the normal relationships of a lawyer and a client.
He prevented the police investigation as much as possible to allow those persons to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't respect his profession, but disgraced it.
He became too close to certain clients, particularly Scarboro, and had made doubts about his uninterestedness.
Ditta did not admit his guilt and said: “If I were a corrupt lawyer whom I am not and I would like to give the information to Mr. Scarboro, I would not wait 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the meeting, Officer Lee Holstead from Lankashire police stated: “Mr. Ditta became a criminal attorney as soon as he began to acquire drugs from organized crime.”
His appetite to cocaine made him unreasonably compromised and vulnerable to the purposes of the main criminal groups who had given him valuable information on police investigations.
Advocates should follow the highest standards of professional ethics and give public confidence and confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide his profession.
Mr. Ditt's investigation led the Lankashire unit to a particularly dangerous organized crime, which had already been sentenced on three cases of cocaine storage, and now also to prevent justice, demonstrating our desire to acquire a fair punishment for criminals.
Let this case be a warning for criminals that no one is outside the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarboro himself was convicted for 14 years after acknowledged his guilt in the treaty to supply heroin, cocaine and marihuana.
Another 35 persons involved in the deception were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
At Ditta's website, he organized a conversation in the form of questions and answers in which he said that his dream work was an attorney representing clients with death sentence in America, an ideal companion for him at dinner, Mohammed Ali, and the motivation in work is an inequality.
The Yaroslava stadium was not ready to receive 22,000 observers, noted police officers attending the CCD RFS meeting today.

Americans were listening to Japanese high-level officials
On Friday, 1 November, one of the representatives of the American Special Services, who preferred not to disclose their name, said that the States were listening to telephones of high-level officials of Japan.
This man confirmed that there were several points in the country of the sun in the coming sun.
He noted, however, that the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand did not carry out intelligence against each other.
He said that it was during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
Japan, like Germany, despite alliance relations with the Americans during the after-war period, is an intelligence facility, reported the NHK television channel.
None of the parties have yet commented on this information.
Recall, the news on the monitoring of United States Special Services for the Officer of the FRG last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA could have been listening to Merkel's phone for the past ten years.
The Chancellor itself, according to some data, took a very painful note of her audition.
She stated that allies who, in her view, were FGG and United States for decades unacceptable for such surveillance as the head of the Government.
In the meantime, Edward Snowden stated that he was willing to share details on the telephone calls of Angela Merkel with German prosecutor staff.
The German flew to Moscow specially to meet the former CIA staff.
Baskiria can put grain in trade not earlier than the beginning of 2014
The Baskiria, during the public procurement interventions, may produce grain for trade not earlier than the beginning of 2014, according to the Minister for Agriculture of the Republic, Nicolai Kovalko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
As far as the market price is higher, there is demand.
"The grain may be traded after New Year," he said at the press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that the current year of seed of agricultural crops under the harvest of 2013 was 3.1 million gas, including grain areas of 1.7 million gas, that was 3.3 per cent higher than last year.
Under the harvest of 2014, 550 thousand gas were seeded (in 105,000 ga more than in 2012).
Increased areas under the wheat and the triticale, the breed remained at the previous level.
In the IMD database, there is no Brother Circle grouping to which Lepsas was assigned in the United States.
The databases of the Russian Brother Circle Force Group, to which Washington was assigned to Gregory Leps, are not.
As the Interfax noted in the law enforcement bodies of the RF, after all the databases of the United States Ministry of Finance had been verified in the media, Gregory Lepsa had not been detected.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of a mith of the so-called “Russian Mafia” which seems to be acting abroad.
"And in the very name, the Brother Circle, there is some element of mysteriousness, there is an indication of a secret bed.
"It's all like a piar action," said the interviewer of the agency.
The Ministry of Finance of the United States announced on 31 October that it was the suspicion of the Eurosia Criminal Sindication of Artur Badaljan, Gregory Lepsveride, Vadim Ljalina, Sergei Moscalenko, Jacob Ribalski and Igor Slykov.
Persons listed on this list are suspected of links with some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered influential members of the criminal groups and are in the United States ' sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Gregory Leps is “a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislava Leontieva”.
In the producing centre, Gregory Lepsa refused to comment on the United States charges on the singer, named them " breed".
In 2011, the President of the United States, Barak Obama, took the Brat Circle Syndicate into " substantial transnational organized criminal groups " and commanded the minfine " to undermine and prohibit their global criminal operations " .
The introduction of humans into the black lists of the American minphine involves the blocking of its assets in the United States and the ban on business contacts with the people living in the States.

Turkey's policyman announced hunger against a wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began building a separator wall in the area of Nusaibin, south-eastern Turkey.
Local inhabitants and representatives of the Prosecutor's PMD have spoken sharply against construction.
The mayor at the border with the Turkish city of Nusaibin Aishe Hekhan announced a hunger, protesting against the construction of a separative wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, reported the RIA News in the press service of the Party of Peace and Democracy (MD) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly prosecuted protest demonstrations.
The head of Turkey, Muammer Gueller, first rejected the fact of construction, then stated that the wall was built to ensure border safety.
"Mer Nusaibina Aishe Hekhan, a member of the PMD, announced the hunger, thus converting its protest against the construction of the wall into a fatal fight," said the Party's press service.
The mayor believes that the construction of the wall has been designed to isolate the Kurdian population of two countries from each other, and the Kurds crossed the border freely during the half-century.

Venezuela will set a currency course for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency - Bolivar - in relation to a dollar for tourists.
The Bloomberg Agency reported this on 1 November with reference to the Governmental Decree.
Foreign travellers will be allowed to exchange the amounts equivalent to $10,000 for a year.
Venezuela will also allow to sell up to 25 per cent of the acquired bolivars in the country at the time of their departure.
The specific course of the ballivar for the dollar will be established later.
In February, Karakas had to devaluate the local currency up to $6.3.
However, one dollar in the black market is estimated in 57 boliviaries.
Since the beginning of the year, the Bolivar lost almost 70 per cent of its value.
Inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 per cent in September.
Oil Minister and Vice-President for Economy Rafael Ramirez stated on 18 October that Venezuela had no plans to devalve Bolivar.
According to the informal information provided by the Agency, Karakas may, however, decide to reduce the national currency rate after municipal elections in December.
The policy for the constraint of products and goods of broad consumption, as well as the high level of Venezuela's economies, resulted in a deficit of a number of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported that Venezuela had a lack of toilet paper.
Andrey Belmacz, director of the Southern Republic, noted that it would be difficult to tell how long it would take to find a new coach.
This post became vacation after Sergei Shepelov resigned.
The resignation took place just a few hours ago, so to say how long it would take to find a new coach, I'm not ready, ITAR-TASS brings Belmach's words.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We are studying all possible options.
The priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I wish not just to find a coach, but a man who will work in our club for a few years and get some results.
Kenyan Press Disturbed by Provocation Act on Media
“It is a terrible place, and there is a reason for the question: what may prevent the destruction of the Parliament of the independence of the judicial system in the future?” the newspaper reported, calling the law non-constitutional.
“This law is very cruel and punishable and we reject it”, said Cyrus Camau, director of the Capital Group, the mother company CapitalFM, which includes one of the most respected independent radio stations in Kenya and the news site.
He said that the new public media court would "be always addicted as it is the Government ' s continuation, and the limitations of content and advertising would harm Kenya's situation in the global economy.
"I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to dismiss this bill and return it to the representatives," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new law would essentially allow the Government to “contribute the media deadly” and the Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had been “a serious strike” and criticized the law as a “draconic”.
The adoption of the draft law is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security after the September attack of Muslim terrorists in the Westgate Trade Centre.
The Kenyan media caused anger by the authorities by translating the records of the observation cameras where the troops who were sent to the attack scene were allegedly robbing the expensive trading centre.
The response of the Chief of Police David Kimio was the challenge of two journalists and the media official to interrogate, although the call was cancelled after the media protests.
According to the new edition law, up to 20 million Kenya shillings can be punished, and individual journalists are up to one million, with an additional risk to be “exclusively from lists”, i.e. ban on obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The Court has also the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “one fine is enough to paralyze the work of the majority of FM-radiostants”.
It also stated that these measures could have a destructive effect on Kenya's so-called "free blogosphere " .
Politicians understand that by making the media silent, they will be able to do whatever they want to do is impunityless.
“No one will ever know,” wrote journalist Nation Mutuma Matthew, characterizing Kenya's media as a key source of restraining and balanced forces in public life.
“Politicians themselves will ruin the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
The Kenyan legislators were the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted for the cancellation of the reductions appointed by the National Payment Commission and the recovery of their large salary of about 532,000 shillings per month, one of the highest taxes in the world.
In the communal payments of crowneds, a new line of expenditure will appear - the capital repair of the house.
The most approximately for the standard two-room apartment since the new year will have to be compensated from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The precise norm will determine the Government of the region.
However, when you paint the approach, order the stairs or even replace the elevator, the residents will decide.
Such law has been approved by the deputations of the area of thought.
Vladimir Keynikov, chairman of the Vroneger Area Mind, noted: “In this case, there is also a need to be ordered - to establish a regularity of the capremont of houses, to accumulate non-government funds - which are often registered in Moscow, or in Orenburg, somewhere else, it will be the establishment of public control over the cost of the funds that the inhabitants gather for repair of many apartments.”
Under the control of the State now and the right-hand construction.
The law that protects from fraud has been approved by the final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4,5 thousand people were affected by unfair buildingers.
Most of the problems have been resolved.
By the way, the new law provides the rights and responsibilities for all participants of the inclusive construction.
Vladimir Keynikov, chairman of the Vronegian Area Mind, said: “Not a secret that the abuses in this sphere were also initiated in connection with the fact that in the 98s, the same debtors were caught, and in 2000s, the same debtors.”
People began to earn money for covering the layout, including those two laws.
Under Vronege, it is decided to build a temporary residence centre for foreign citizens to be deported.
The district Parliament adopted such a law not only under the pressure of the Federation.
At least dismiss the problems related to illegal migrants in the region.
In the past year, more than 100,000 aliens were raised to migration accounts.
But only every fifth has officially authorized work.
Where the others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Keynikov, chairman of the Vroneger Area Mind, said: "They have violated legislation but are not criminals."
There's no trial, and deportation is to be deported.
This decision was adopted by the Federation that, through regional resources, such places were equipped.
In the Voronez region, this is the Old Olshanka of the Semiluk region.
Well, the regional parliament has finally given new benefits to many children's parents.
First, families where they raise 5 and more children are fully released from transport tax.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million -- but that is the same amount of savings for many children.
Secondly, it is essential to those who adopt three and more babies since the new year will issue grants for housing.
For each family, the new law envisages 18 square metres, at a price of 30,000 per meter.
The family, for example, is a six - people - father, mother, family child, and three - adopted.
For them, according to the standards, the State acquires accommodation at 108 square metres, for 3,30,000 rubles.
For the left shore or the South-West Micro-Ray, it is quite acceptable.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage in the ray center.

Secretary of the United States: Special Services sometimes " went too far" in collecting data
The State Secretary of the United States, John Kerry, acknowledged that in the collection of data and audiences, American specialists sometimes " went too far," noted, however, that the media information of 70 million people in the media does not correspond to the reality.

Italian trainees retreat the way young people
Italian unemployment beats records.
The data published on Wednesday showed that 12.5 per cent of the inhabitants of the country had no work.
Such bad cases have not been held since World War II.
This is a number of times higher among young people.
40.4% of people aged 15 to 24 years of age have no employment.
According to the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is the preliminary retirement of older workers.
Such an experiment has already been conducted by the country's largest energy company, and the laws adopted allow regional authorities to provide part of the preliminary pension for stakeholders.
On the other hand, Italy awaits the common problem of the ageing population for Europe.
And economists are not sure that the advance rotation of staff will justify themselves.
What will lead to the construction of TPU in Moscow
Each year, the capital authorities promise to accommodate more transport-transmission nodes (TTPs).
By 2020, 255 PTPs were planned to be introduced.
Our correspondent dealt with the project.
A few months ago, the Smolenska Arbatsko-Pokrov line had a construction fence.
The sign said there was a transport-transmission node ongoing.
All of this was very strange, because no land transport is stopped next to Smolensk, and therefore it is not possible to move.
To reach the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, it is necessary to reach about 130 meters, including the land crossing through the Carmanic Street.
Smolensky's almost over now.
The flower bark, the disconnected stand for the papers, and the asphalt before the entrance changed the brush.
That's the whole transport node.
Transport nodes are being plane and capital, explained in the press service of the capital transport department.
The captain's TPU is not yet.
The plane suggests the construction of parkings, the conclusion of trade objects preventing passengers from moving, creating small architecture forms and accommodation.
In fact, the PTPs are not even carriers, but professional service providers from the capital repair department of Moscow.
The transport node is not necessarily a complicated structure, explains the Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the High School of Economy, Michael Blinkin.
At times, enough roofs over the head and a table to tell about the arrival of transport.
For example, the Isenevo subway has recently opened a fully valuable plane transplant node.
Let's go without the hatches, but with the parking lots and the tables that indicate when the bus is coming.
But in the pursuit of the quantity, the officials record anything in the PTP.
In 2011, the mayor planned to build all about 151 nodes, 59 of them with capital construction.
The plans are now up to 255 PTPs until 2020.
Of them, one and a half is promised to give up this year.
Although there is a TPU development programme in the city, there are no quality criteria, asserts Alexander Morozov, Co-Chairman of the City and Transport.
The number of objects is reported, but the quality of transplant on each of them is often deteriorating.
The criteria, in the expert ' s opinion, should be two: first, reduced time of transplantation, secondly, comfort.
First of all, the possibility of changing the mode of transport without raining.
In Moscow, however, when the TPU is designed, it comes straight contrary.
It's a bright example of the DNH subway.
Earlier, the suburban buses from the Yaroslave road came to the square before the main entrance to the WC.
Their stops were now transferred to the opposite side of Jaroslava to the street of Cosmonauts.
Further than the metro, far away from the monorals, but closer to the living houses.
The gift that the inhabitants did not want a car under the windows and complained about all possible instances.
The capital TPU in Moscow has not been taken immediately.
The first one started building five years ago at the Planner Metro.
The project was designed to be sampled.
And it was indeed a sample of how the transplant node given to investors was converted into a banal trading centre.
No, there's grounds for the buses, that's not going from the metro under the rain, and three floors of the car stations.
Truth is, the Chemical Trolleybus No.202 and No203 in the Moscow PTP were not essentially placed.
They've been displaced from the metro.
But there's more places to trade.
There's only 32 shops, and there's almost everything from the zoo to the carroom.
Well, actually, if any of the bus passengers would have to buy a new car on the road?
We always have a trade center when a capital PTP is built.
The situation has recently reached its logical completion when a part of the car has decided to be marketed.
Now, on the third floor, the "Planera" among parking spots is a fighting trade.
Vegetables, spies, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and guards who look evil at our photographer.
The transplant node has finally become a market.
The thing is, the "Planerna" meter had a market before, but it was taken off.
In the prefecture of the traders, they regretted and released the receiving parking of the transplant node.
Still, because of high prices there is always empty.
The funny thing is that the market was taken off to build a new plane TPU.
It's like a rocking.
The metro of Calužska was 50 meters away from the metro to the bus, says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the trade centre, it appears to have increased to 170 meters.
To get to the bus, it is necessary to go through the whole trading center.
After 22 hours he's closed, he's got to be circled under the open sky.
However, the designs in the Planner and Calužska will soon be shown as flowers.
In the middle of September, the Bureau's urban and land commission adopted planning decisions for the first eight capital PTPs.
Four of them will be 25 floors without two or three underground yards.
The main monster will grow at the Toushino subway, with 418.7 thousand square metres of the area.
Representants of the RGD Railway District Directorate, responsible for the construction of the TPU at the metro, have already told journalists that there are shops, hotels and apartments in the future.
At the same time, officials are assured that multidimensional parkings are mutted from third to half of the square.
Let's take for example the "national" garages.
Let's say the garage of 258 car places recently built on the International Street has an area of 8015 square meters.
So for the parking lot of 2.6 thousand cars, the Petrovsko-Intelligence car will take about 80,000 squares.
It's less than a third of the machine that they're going to build there.
Let's have one or two floors on all the grounds for the bus.
At least 150 000 square metres of commercial property remains.
And this, for a minute, is almost two GUMAs.
If the capital TPUs at stations and stations build railways, the other fields will be conquered by metropolitans.
They also promised that there would be many " functional appointment objects", including hotels, offices, and even sports rooms.
By the way, in the City Department of the property of Moscow, the journalists have recently told them that they are developing a draft decision that investors would be able to seek a PTP section directly to officials.
No contests.
Therefore, I said that transport issues for the city were priority.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the Harvard Station in Boston or Spayne in Toronto, as sure as Alexander Morozov.
There are trolleybus and tramways down to the ground and a distance from a metro train to a tramway is only 50 meters without way to the street.
There's no excess trade around.
But Moscow officials are thrown into extremes.
Either we're building anything, or we'll take 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Esser proposes to compare the insult of patriotic feelings to extremeism
For the legislative protection of patriotic feelings of citizens against the provocation and insults of " Just Russia " invites to compare the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to punish for it for five years of prison.
As the Notifications reported, such amendments to the legislation prepared by the Inventory Energy Committee, Oleg Micheev, have already been aimed at receipt of the Supreme Court and the Government.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments suggests that the emotional relationship of a person with the country whose citizen is the character of love for that country is responsible for its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Micah indicates, national legislation has sanctions for abuse over the formal signs of the State authority by flag and herb.
According to the parliamentary, the protection of Russians whose feelings may be affected and insulted by public symbols and other disrespectful manifestations of our country are not sufficient in Russian legislation.
As an example, it brings deployment to the Canon of the Victory Day of the Discussion, when some media personnel are able to question the heroic movement of the SSSR people in combating fascists.
Once the main global celebration, the 9 May Day of victory, this vakhanal is being deployed annually.
While practicing in astroomy and “alternative view” of history, some publicists have come to the view that it is unfortunate that the cultural Germans have not conquered the wild Soviet Union!
I believe that it is absolutely inadmissible in a country where the pride of history remains the primary “spiritual ” of the nation,” he regrets Oleg Micheev.
Furthermore, Micah said that the patriotic people in Russia were much more than religious, but the law punishes the insult of the feelings of the believers, and the insult of patriotic feelings can be practically impunited.
In the opinion of the people's elected, the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activities should be compared to the relevant punishment in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The draft law implies punishment for insulting patriotic feelings: from 100 thousand fines to 5 years of imprisonment.
The earthquake of 6.6 occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the area of Cokimbo in central Chile, reports the Reuters Agency.
The earthquake was located in the ocean depth of 10.7 miles and a distance of 54 miles south-west of the city, emphasized on the U.S. Geological Service website (USGS).
The pressures were fixed at 20:03 in local time (3.03.1 November) in Moscow.
Of the victims or of underground destruction caused until nothing is reported.
Recall, Chile is in one of the most seismoactive areas of the Earth, so the earthquakes of a different force there are not rare.
One of the most serious things happened in 2010.
Then the earthquake of 8.8 and the tsunami caused him to kill more than 550 people in Chile and to destroy 220 thousand buildings.
In addition, the most powerful earthquake in Chile has occurred in the latest history: the magnitude of 9.5 was fixed in 1960.
This natural disaster resulted in more than five thousand deaths.
Dmitri Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be considered fairly
Prime Minister of RF Dmitri Medvedev reported on Friday that the Greenpeace activists would be considered in strict compliance with Russian legislation.
France may have no doubt that the case will be dealt with by law, and we hear all concerns.
"We can guarantee law enforcement," said Dmitri Medvedev at the meeting with the Prime Minister of France, Jean-Mark Ero.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pizania, like the other activists, has been accused of huliganism.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture for the detainee," quoted Mr. Ero's RIA News.
"Our country cannot support activities that could harm the environment, no one has the right to violate laws," said, in turn, Dmitri Medvedev.
He said that the activities of any structures that are trying to influence technologically complex and insecure processes, including energy supply, are dangerous.
He emphasized that these objects were "as a dust bowl" and reminded of what happened in the Mexican Gulf, transmitted "RIA News".
UN announces new goals to overcome poverty
The United Nations should immediately work on a new set of challenges to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which have been formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats played a key role in improving the MDG ' s " sustainable development goals, which expired in 2015, before the UN Sustainable Development Summit started in Rio de Janeiro at the evening.
They were included in the outcome of the document signed by the world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Pan Gi Moon told the Summit at the evening that it is the time to “be above national interests”.
"I am pleased that the UN Member States agreed to launch and control the process of creating universal sustainable development goals - the CEP," he said.
These CEBs will be based on our progress in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, which will become an integral part of the development concept for the period after 2015.
I will make every effort to use the powers made by the Member States to integrate our vision of sustainable development goals that are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique increases due to the conflict of influenced people
Subsequently, at the top of them, the statue of Samara Mašel, the founder of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scandal peace slogans on one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Executive Director of the Investment Company.
As she feared the future of her country, she switched her business suit into a shirt decorated by “We demand security” in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday at the capital area of Independence.
During two weeks, almost daily reports of conflicts between Government troops and Renamo were one of the most cruel conflicts since the reconciliation was concluded more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once known rebel movement, which was supported by the white authorities of Rodesia, and then by the Government of South Africa of the Apartheid ' s Apartheid ' s age as part of the efforts to destabilize the independent Government.
After the 1992 reconciliation, it became a opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country would hardly regain a full conflict, but the recent developments made foreign investors and local investors nervous.
The rates are high for the rapid economies, since the opening of huge shelf stocks of gas and coal in the north-west may attract more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The Ruling Party of Frelimo, the leader of the political force since 1975, and the Renamo Party accuse each other of the incurred tension.
The Renamo Party argues that the Government has become a final collaborator, attacking its members in the Sophala province, the traditional salary of Renamo, on 17 October.
The attacks on former rebels then increased when government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, reported to the Financial Times Fernando Mazanga, representative of Renamo.
The Government blames Renamo for initiating conflicts, accusing the Party of the attack on soldiers.
President Armando Gabuza tried to disturb his concerns about instability.
Hebuza stated to the French Information Agency, AFP, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt as a " loser" who wanted to use "whatever he had left to try to prove that he could make his own decisions to the Government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid wars.
However, the concerns grew after the report that Mazanga said that Renamo had refused the 1992 peace agreement.
He informed the Financial Times that it meant non-compliance with the agreement by the Party of Frelimo.
" Our goal is to return to negotiations but with all seriousness," said Mazanga.
The previous negotiations between the parties have made little to reduce the tension that the series of collisions this year have increased.
“They are two powerful people (Gebuza and Dhlakama), who faced their heads," said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer of the Open University and expert on Mozambique.
None of them are good negotiators and none of them are willing to take the necessary steps.
The Renamo Party, which attempted to achieve electoral reform, has already stated that it would bouncote municipal elections for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for the next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt to acquire deficiencies and financial bonuss from the Government.
The share of votes for Renamo has declined since 1992, while the new Party -- the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which is based on the former Renamo member, is expected to improve its indicators in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gabuza, who had to leave the post next year, when his second term was over, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the president's position," Mazanga said.
It is not clear what Renamo is capable of, but it has already launched destructive and urgent attacks on police stations and cars on the key road leading from north to south.
Most of the conflicts were held in the Sophala province, which is several hundred miles north of Maputo, but includes the Bairo port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railways for about a week after Renamo threatened the attack on the railway.
Mazanga was embarrassed when he was asked whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
The Renamo Party wanted “to warn the international community that things in Mozambique were not doing very well”, said Mazanga.
Instability has increased dissatisfaction by the Government, and many are also concerned by corruption, slow development rates and recent abductions, said Fernando Lima, head of the independent Mediacoop media.
“People think that the Government and the President are responsible for the future, which should also find a solution to these problems,” he said.
Omar Sultuan, a participant in the demonstration, said that people simply want stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want the restoration of peace, they want free access to roads," he said.
A series of Prime Ministerial Film Shows will be held in Moscow
A series of films Arth-Mainstream, where audiences can see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before they arrived, will go to Rolan's cinema from 1 to 5 November, reports the RIA " News " with reference to project organizers.
The French director and actress Reim Kerichi "Paris at any price."
This is a story of the worker in the French capital of the model of Maya (Kerichi), which is deported to Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to the film, Kerichi will also show a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Dooke "Mebius", the melodramatic bayopic of Oliver Hirschbigel "Diana: Love History" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the main role and the main film of the Canaan Film "Life Adel" Abdeltiff Keshish.
The only Russian participant of Arth-Mainstream will be the winner at the Kynotaurus festival, the film of Alexander Veledenian Geographic Speaked on the motives of the one-name novel, Alexei Ivanov.
The primary role, the charming loser of the teacher, Victor Slukin, played in the film, Constantine Habensky, whose work was also marked by the Kinotaurus prize.
Children should study myths and legends as “models of life,” says the author.
The statements of Tora could show that “thick power cannot overcome a thick trick, ” and legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have dreams.
Saying that many myths will be “too wild, too scandalous and, in some cases, too vulnerable for school classes”, Crossley-Holland speaks for the “specific selection” of the relevant texts of age.
"I believe it is wonderful that myths and folks in America are already part of education," he said.
I've been proposing for the introduction of them in the training programme for 20 years.
He added that "excessive moralization" of authors and teachers "experiencing interest" in children, and the main ideas "subscribed" in exciting history.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the English-Saxon language, as well as wrote the Norwegian Myth Congress for Penguin and the British People's Tale, said: “You may, of course, have intentions, but you better keep them with you.”
Perhaps the great difference between the adult author who writes for adults and the adult author who writes for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or ended happyly, but it is necessary that the inherent understanding of good and evil be made.
And this must be sublimited; it is revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
Old principle: show, not tell.
A football fan was detained in the Vronegian area that broke the window in the waiting room
At 9:00 a.m. at the Grysi Vronegian transport police station, at 29 October, took off the passenger train of two Moscow football fans.
Following the game of the favorite team, the boys took a drunk debosh on the train.
Young people were delivered to the office of the police line at the Gryzi Station to establish a protocol on administrative offence.
The fans repented in their antisocial behaviour.
The police have formed administrative material on them and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and the station was waiting for his arrival.
Half the first night the fans left the railway station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly came back and broke the door window in the waiting room.
A transport police officer and a CHOP security officer "RJD" came to the ring of the broken glass.
They were able to detain a criminal who tried to hide from the scene of the incident.
South-Eastern LA staff of Russia have been verified.
The issue of the incitement of the criminal case is addressed, the senior referencer to the information and public links of South-Eastern LA of Russia on the transport of Sergei Olchovik.
Vitalius Mutko: Watermetes?
I think we've been back 15 years ago.
The Minister of Sports Vitalij Mutko expressed his view of disturbance at the tribunal during the Russian Couple Cube, Spartacus.
I'm an advocate of all of this to organizers of sports events: clubs, leagues, RFS.
But we see they took a second position.
They're waiting for someone to come and arrange it.
It's a very good position, but it's not exactly right.
We need to organize cheerleaders, clubs should invite their stewards, not let the case go.
We have now developed a special decision by the Government on the rules of conduct at stadiums.
After it's accepted, we'll deal with this whole thing.
But I still have to invite all soccer organizers.
I read Leonid Fedoun's interview.
State, please, let's get the law quick.
It feels like the Bavaria cheerleaders came to Yaroslavl and arranged it all.
And we're foreign observers.
In fact, it's awful to see the tribune fed out of the brand.
And it's in a country that's preparing for the world champion.
"I feel like we're back 10 or 15 years ago," said Mutko.
Snowden can be interrogated in Russia
The expert of the US Special Services Edward Snowden will probably not leave outside Russia to testify on the phone negotiations of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
As Interfax said on Friday, a source familiar with the situation could answer the questions of the German prosecutors in writing or eye in Russia.
Edward Snowden's exit outside Russia is practically excluded.
"In that case, he will lose refugee status and may be issued to Washington by the United States Allies," said the interviewer of the Agency.
" However, in principle, the FRG prosecution could send its representatives to the RF or transmit written questions to Snowden," added the source, adding that the issue should be developed at the inter-State level.
Previously, the German bundestag representative Hans-Christian Strebelle reported that Edward Snowden was willing to testify on the auspices by the US Special Services of the German Chancellor's negotiations.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in Germany.
The ClA's Expert Associate made it clear that he knows a lot.
Although the U.S.A.B.B.D. has blocked all its movements, Snowden is ready to arrive in Germany.
However, it is necessary to clearly determine all the conditions of his arrival," said the Strebel of the Euronews television.
Snowden's lawyer Anatoli Kucheren, commenting on the statement of the source of Interfax, said that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how.
The US Citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the United States National Security Agency (ANB) and the CIA, ran to Hong Kong in May 2013, and then published information on the secret operations of United States Services on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow through transit, but he was unable to leave the airport because his passport was cancelled by the United States authorities who had prominently prosecuted him, and remained at the Transit Areemievo airport before the beginning of August.
On 1 August, Snowden received a provisional asylum on the territory of Russia for a period of a year and on the same day he left " Sheremethevo " .
Yesterday, American attorney Anatoli Kucheren stated that his client had worked at the "group Russian company".
The NSA observed Angela Merkel last week by the German media.
According to journalists, Chancellor's telephone negotiations began to be accompanied by Americans in 2002.
The tracking station seemed to be in the United States Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, following the publication of these informations, stated that the monitoring of Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Ponomaries left "Free Russia"
The Deputy of the State Voice from the Party of Just Russia, a member of its office in Novosibirsk, Ilya Ponomarev, filed a statement of exit from the political organization.
As the parliamentary said, he made a statement to the new-siberian regional office of the party.
According to her statute, this automatically means that Ponomarev left the lines of "righteousness".
We're sitting there, drinking tea...
"Why many want to see the picture "Ilia Ponomarev puts a partilet on the table," but there is nothing that is such an era," the deputy commented.
Ponomarev noted that he maintained good relations with the regional office of " eseers " .
In the meantime, it was not intended to refuse the mandate of the Deputy of the State of Ilya Ponomarev.
He explained that, despite the exit of the party, he remained a member of the fraction and he could not leave it by law.
Reports on the intention of Elijah Ponomareva to leave the Party of Just Russia appeared on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitri Goodkov and Valerius Zubov would be expelled with him, but the latter had soon rejected the information.
Japan will discuss the conclusion of a peace treaty with Russia
The head of Japanese MIDa Fumio Kisida met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss issues relating to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to expressly exchange our views on further development of political dialogue, discuss issues relating to the conclusion of the peace treaty," said Kisida at the meeting.
Japanese Foreign Minister recalled that, after Prime Minister of Japan Sindzo Abe visited Russia, the relationship between countries became more warm and bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the RF would meet Japan in addressing complex political issues, wrote RIA News.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies solutions to the issue of disputed Northern Territorys.
Consequently, today, in Tokyo, protests are being undertaken to reimburse the country after World War II.
The Japanese capital drives cars from which the speaker says: "Return the northern territory!".
The police do not stop the protestants; they are watching the noise level not exceeding.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It can be brave to claim that New York is a place of birth of a stendap comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, an estrade artist, Frank Fay, who worked in the theatre Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to tell the jokes directly to the public in a conversation.
Faya's new innovation has been incorporated by other, very recently, the New York Comedian Festival.
The designed and coursed Caroline Hersh, founder of the stendap club Carolines, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, counting over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“The majority of these hedliners started in Carolines, and then made more success, reached a level where they were already too famous to speak at the club,” said Hursh.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year, the event includes Vanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the Standap for Heroes, the annual musical and commediate charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, where other Bruce Springstein, John Stuart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will appear.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedia has also expanded.
Several comics that attended the festival this year acquired popularity in a non-traditional way, for example, through small television shows such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Crowl was famous because of the role in the comedian show at a low-known cable television channel (e.g. the FXX theme of FXX), and now runs his own sketch show at Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate joined the actress in both the Saturday evening in direct air and the Parks and Rest Areas, although she is most famous in the series of the Marcel shoes.
And Crowl and Slate, as well as other young comedians with self-style style (realisticly pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, a vicious, focused on racial theme Camau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stendap comic, but then became a successful director on TV and the movies, as well as an informal comic historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he was a leading TV show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held in the Town Hall, in the centre of Manhattan.
“This city is definitely the central element of Larry's entire work,” said Steinberg.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes walked around a street between the two houses and thought, "If I'm out of money, I might live here."
Pakistanian authorities have launched negotiations with local Talibans
Pakistanian authorities have launched negotiations with the Taliban movement.
This was reported by the embassy of this country in Britain, where Prime Minister of Pakistan Navaz Sharif was visited.
The chief of the Government of Pakistan made a statement of negotiations with Islamic extremists during the meeting with the British Vice-Premier Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed the relations of Pakistan and India, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister reported that the Taliban movement dialogue began," said Pakistan's embassy statement in London.
- He said that he hoped and prayed for dialogue to earn in accordance with the Pakistan Constitution," the diplomats added.
Pakistan Taliban (Techric and Taliban) are allies to the one-named Afghanistan movement, but they act independently in the north-western regions of Afghanistan.
Pakistan Talibans seek to establish a Islamic State.
The Government of Islamabad had previously attempted to start negotiations with local Talibans, but the movement was denied the dialogue.
It stated that it would only go to negotiations if the authorities had taken the troops to permanently displaced areas where the Talibans operated and released from prisons of arrested Islamist.
Navaz Sharif arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, the British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistan Government and the Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai held a trilateral meeting in London, discussing the prospects of the peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil dropped up to $96 for a barrel.
The oil price continued to fall on Friday when the alarms about the education of large stocks had eclipsed by a communication showing that the Chinese energy production sector has become strong.
The U.S. Oil Oil Oil, in December, arrived by 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 for a barrel for later European time in e-markets in the New York market.
On Thursday, the contract went by 39 cents, which amounted to a drop in the price of October by 5.8 per cent.
The rich oil stocks have affected its value in the past weeks.
The Ministry of Energy stated on Wednesday that US stocks increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, more than 25 million barrels were filled with stocks.
However, on Friday, there was an indication of possible increase in demand, according to two reports of the Chinese industry that showed the inflammation of its activities.
This indicates that the reconstruction of the Chinese economy could continue to be forced after the third quarter growth rate increased to 7.8 per cent after the twenty-year minimum in the previous quarter.
The oil of Brent, the international oil, also used by US oil-processing enterprises, has reached 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel for the Intercontinental Market in London.
The Chief Coach of Colorado, Patrick Rua, explaining his decision to release the gollipper of Semen Warlamm since the first minute in the Friday match with Dallas, expressed his confidence that the recent night behind the retirement did not screw his confidence in the Russians, transmitted from Dallas the S.E.S.S.S.
And what should we wait for?" Rua said after the morning's breakdown, Lavin.
Of course, what happened is anxious to all of us, but we are sure of it and feel that it will be useful for it to go to the ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show his usual level.
So you're absolutely sure that the situation didn't affect the condition of the doorman?
We'll see today.
Our players will undoubtedly support Warley by helping him protect the gate, as it was in the previous matches of this season.
The main thing is, no one in the team is going to make any conclusions until the court finds out.
In Siberia, we should not be vegan: the heat tomato does not replace the juice
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, a reporter RIA News found.
People who are completely denied animal origin should not live in Siberia.
They do not have a winter without health loss, and no heat tomatoes are compensating for them, believe newly-sibir dietologists and doctors prior to the Day of Vegan.
Drink oil with litres
Strict vegetarianism, not only from meat and fish but also from milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashion of life.
However, dietologists are convinced that in Novosibirska and other Siberia, such strict nutrition standards are not useful for health.
Full refusal of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain unreplaceable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for plants.
At least milk or eggs must be included in the diet," surely dietologist Marina Bogy.
It gives an example of a fish containing an unreplaceable fat acid Omega-3.
The richest plant oil for them is lazy.
"To need it in the amounts necessary for humans, you need to drink with litres!" says the dietologist.
Medicines are confident that Siberians need to pay special attention to the winter.
In this season, vegetarianism is particularly questionable.
In our realities, there are high requirements for food.
To avoid freezing, it requires increased calories.
"If a person restricts himself on animal products, accordingly, it does not take this calories," said the expert.
A dietologist Olga Pozniak agrees with this.
It adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not a way out.
It is better for humans to feed primarily products that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is set for better adoption and reconciliation of these products.
And in winter, people wish not to bite a corn but a hot juice or something more,” explains the doctor.
She said that the vegans can eat, and they really benefit from different grapes, grapes, beans, local vegetables, apples left in the winter, frozen bovines.
But this is definitely not enough for full food.
According to Claudia Arifulina, the siberians in the organisms have the level of vitamins only in the middle of August to mid-September.
Full vegetarianism, in our severe natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees in the day, and in May, it is unfit.
The body needs energy for life, and this is primarily fat," says the medicine.
The doctors note that veganism is particularly harmful for children and pregnant.
Children grow, they need construction material, including amino acids.
And by sticking to vegetarianism, we give them incomplete.
Pregnants also need increased protein, vitamins and microelectrics in the menu.
"The Vegans don't get them," surely God.
Arifulina says that an adult person is free to choose anything, to play with the toys he wants.
He has already formed a body, a skeleton, an organ.
The children still have to eat full food.
If parents deprive him of some microelectrics or amino acids, choosing what he will eat, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of substances for brain development, the spectrum, the bones will no longer be restored tomorrow," she said.
All medicinal experts are composed of the low quality of winter growing in heat and imported vegetables and fruits.
What has been brought to us and grown in the heats contains less than the microelectrics we need in the open soil.
"The quantity of food is wrong," says God.
Arifulina also notes that imported and heat vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to gather large crops is damaged to quality.
"The apples do not become brown on the cut, the corn quickly yellow and swallow, the tomatoes are tasteless and inaromatic," the medical examples add that they are probably overwhelmed.
And they become suppliers, not vitamins, but cells.
The Siberian Institute for Physics and Technology of Agricultural Problems was disagreeable with that, the candidate of Vera Petruk.
It states that, with the right approach and compliance of all the standards and requirements in the heat, we can grow full vegetables.
If they try to expel a larger square meter, they will, of course, become more frequent and feed plants with mineral fertilisers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilisers are rapidly growing, the tomatoes are large, but are watery and unhappy," she explains, adding that the quality issue, first of all, depends on the conscience of the manufacturer.
The Court suspended the implementation of the decision on the practice of " stop-and-exit" at the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal of the Federal District suspended the execution of the judicial decision required to amend the " stop-and-except" programme of the New York Police Department and removed the judge from the case.
The Court of Appeal of the Second District of the United States stated that the implementation of the decisions of Judge Shira Shaindlin would be suspended until the results of the appeal issued by the city.
In August, the judge decided that the city violated the constitution in the way it implemented the street detention and interrogation programme.
The city filed an appeal on its decision and decisions on corrective measures, including the order to appoint a controller to help the police to change the practice of work and the training programme associated with it.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard the debate of the parties on the request to suspend the case.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge was required to withdraw because it violated the code of conduct of the United States judges and did not count on the need to avoid the demonstration of prejudice, partly due to a series of interviews in the media and official statements containing a public response to the criticism of the court.
The Judge decided that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, unjustly addressing the black and Latin Americans on the programme " stop-and-switch " .
It appointed an external supervisor to supervise large changes, including policy, training and control reforms, as well as to launch a pilot programme for television testing videocams in the police stations where most detentions occur.
In August, New York decided to cease the practice of storing names and addresses of people in which cases were stopped after the police check.
The debate on the appeal of the city should take place after 14 March 2014.
Tactics to stop and search were criticised by many civil rights lawyers.
“Saparation” has been practiced for several decades in a form, but the number of documented stops has rapidly increased in the administration of the independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684 330 people in 2011, most of which are black and Latin Americans.
In 2004, four people, all representatives of national minorities, have filed a collective case.
Participants of the change in the “Save-and-Safe” programme in the New York Police Department said that these changes would end the inadequate practice, create a more reliable and effective police service and may affect how other police departments implement this practice.
The opponents argue that the change will reduce the military spirit rather than criminality, will lead to unnecessary spending of money and will not address the global problem of complex conditions in the police because of the reduction of the number of officers by several thousands in the past decade.
The judge noted that it did not cease the practice of " stop-and-switching " which corresponds to the Constitution, but changed the way the New York police stopped people.
In the area of the Third Gallery, a pedestrian zone was opened
A new pedestrian zone appeared in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Third Gallery and takes a station two miles from the metro station Novokuzneska to the Moor Square.
All over the time, street torchers, flowers, stones, urnas and toilets are installed, deaf fences are cleaned and illegal advertising.
In addition to Clementovski and Laurusinian streets, which were already walking, five streets were closed for the cars — Ordinski tumor, the Great and Small Talmacheves, the Kaddashew Shore and the Moor Square.
Transportation on the streets of Marosayka and Petrowa is not limited.
In the Friday Street station, the New Communist Station to the Clementov Street, the conditions for pedestrians were established without the withdrawal of the movement and cutting of the passage part, transmitted by newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone, the Third Gallery, the temple of the priest of the Pope of Rome, the museum, the library, the monuments and other qualities.
Previously, the Trusted Travel, the Creators of the Mountains, and the Kuznecki Bridge, were fully walking.
The large Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone was opened in early September, was determined to close for weekends and celebration.
Coulson ran into a telephone to check the confidential communication.
The former editor of the newspaper News of the World Endy Coulson had allegedly used “the broken phone, tracking and resistance” in attempting to confirm false information about the novel of Charles Clark, who at that time served as the Minister for Interior.
The Prosecutor, the Royal Advocate Andrew Edis reported to Old Bailey's court that in May 2005 the News of the World received untrusted news that Clark was meeting with his “Adorable Special Adviser”, Hannah Polby.
The newspaper told the private detective Glenn Mulkeyr to break the Paulby voice mail and warned her at home to take an interview, but Coulson also called her and left voice messages, ” heard the court.
“The accusation believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, is not a person who will stand near someone's house, hoping to find someone sudden, he is a man who loves to offer the history to see what they say," Mr. Edis said.
He said that the News of the World had used three ways of investigating history: telephone breakthrough, monitoring and resistance.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second, he just needs to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the broken phones?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!"
The records of Clark's novel first attracted attention to the News of the World, when the source of sexually interested in Ms. Polby said, "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
The voting tape received from her phone at least three times was removed from the Mulcaire house in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on the computer of a private detective in which Ms. Polby and her sister were represented as Projects.
During the period when she was under surveillance, her grandfather and Ms. Polby received anonymous calls with requests to provide information about it, said Mr. Edis.
At that time, the former major reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherap monitored Ms. Polby's movements.
After leaving her a voting message on 18 June 2005, Coulson said: “I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and which I would very much like to discuss with Charles.”
Mr. Edis said that Coulson's involvement in this history took place on the same scenario as with other influenced people, such as the former Minister of Interior, David Blankettt.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson encountered with Mr. Blankett about the romance with a married woman, while he himself met with Rebecca Brooks, who was married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks denied the entry into an agreement with other people in order to break the phones from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulkeyre, Turlbeck and Weserap confessed in a telephone breakthrough.
Snowden claims that he is willing to communicate with the authorities of the FRG on the hearing case
The CIA expert Edward Snowden is willing to arrive in Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity for that, and to meet the RIA News representatives of the FRG authorities.
A letter from the former CIA officer to the FRG authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin presented on Friday to the bundestag Hans-Christian Strebelle, through which Snowden transmitted a message to the German authorities.
He met Snowden in Moscow first.
Four people were injured as a result of the fire on the Trust Street
As a result of the combustion in a collector in the centre of Moscow, at the Tvrđave Street, four passors were affected.
As Interfax reports with reference to the source in emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, the perpetrators were affected during the fire in a drilled underground transition.
As RIA News writes with reference to the head of the capital department of Paul Livinsky's fuel and energy holding, the electricity has now been fully renewed in all houses in the Trust Street.
Fire in a heat collector near the house of 15 on the Twerd Street took place at night on 31 October.
A strong smoke went out of the leather sewers, and the underground transition at the Armenia store was formed.
The explosion resulted in 11 homes in the Trust Street.
At 9:45 a.m., the moscow fire was eliminated.
United States cuts food for the poor
Food benefits for the four family are reduced by $36 per month
Since Friday in the United States, the financial supplies known as Foodstemps are reduced, since the relevant State programme is terminated.
Food benefits from the four family will now be paid by $36 a month less than before, the officials say.
This will affect 47 million poorest Americans.
According to the Reuters Agency, in 2012 the financial year, the benefit for one person was an average of 133 dollars per month.
Food aid costs in the United States have increased to 80 billion dollars a year due to unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14 per cent of the Americans rely on free food aid issued by Foodstamps, which had such a name from the previous times when they had the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate the growth of the economy and to help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicans in the Congress require further reducing the funds allocated to the programme, saying that it should be aimed at helping those who need more.
Food stores owners across America are concerned that reducing the cost of consumers will reduce.
The United States Congressmen continue to argue about how much more funding the Government can be reduced.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platformer for free
The Study of Blizard released a free platformer on the PC in 1994 Blackthorne.
The WW Insider reported this.
According to his data, the game was available at Battle.net in the Classical Games section of Blizzard.
However, some gamers note that only those users whose accounts are related to the US part of the service can now be downloaded.
The game is not yet available for Russian users.
According to the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC is not different from the original option of the game.
Saundrec to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne Platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, originally went to the SNES console.
His events were deployed on the Tuul planet, whose residents were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
One day, the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the light King Vlaros and become a single ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was saved from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to struggle with the accomplices of Sarlac and protect the inhabitants of the planet.
The original Blackthorne became the first game that the studio had released after its rename to Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, it was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne's publisher was Interplay.
There will be new machines in the Moscow subway.
But they'll sell tickets to passengers, not for money, they'll be seating.
One trip worth 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger in 30 seats.
The number of seats will calculate a special device through modern technologies, reports ITAR-TASS with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first equipment will be set at the Exhibition station on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of new ticket sports, the President of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexander Žukov, and the Olympic Champions of the Alexei Nemov and Elena Zamladikov, will be adopted.
Recognition of the National Security Agency strengthens the paranoid of corporations regarding public surveillance
The warm day at the end of August, the German police helicopter flew low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
According to the instruction of the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the Internal Intelligence Service of Germany, it was a task to photograph the roof of the United States Mission, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
The German media say that BfV was hoping to discover the adhesive device antennas, and these actions brought negotiations between the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Germany in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of the United States National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the United States did not use external intelligence capabilities “to abduct commercial secrets of foreign companies for American companies to improve their international competitiveness or to increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, a contractual employee who became a disclosure, began to publish his treasure of the U.S. intelligence secrets, the European Governments and companies' leaders are no longer sure if the director can trust.
Reports that the National Security Agency had monitored the Brazilian Petrobras oil company and had access to data stored from United States cloud services suppliers, including Google and Yahoo, raised the paranoid of corporations caused by the State's monitoring to new heights.
The latest drops were reported that Angela Merkel's phone was listening, perhaps for about ten years.
If the most powerful person of Europe can be a target, of course, potential targets are also business leaders.
Snowden has made obvious intense cooperation between United States Intelligence Services and Company.
I think it is quite likely that these data are used with mutual benefits.
“Germany must wake up”, said Oliver Grün, President of the BITMI Unitedation, representing the small and medium-sized IT company of Germany.
The German companies are convinced that the United States is now almost the same risk as China in the field of industrial spying and data abduction, according to the study published in July by the EY Consulting Agency.
In all documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, there were still no evidence that the United States had transmitted commercial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain information technologies and Internet opportunities, and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptic.
Someone in the German parliament says we have to create a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“It is not an option”, said Gusso Plattner, president of the German software company for the SAP business.
If there was a need for a powerful IT industry, it was not worth letting it die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidised in Germany, from car to cars and farmers.
Anything except IT industry.
Nevertheless, the scope and technical development of the United States spy agencies known as Snowden's discoveries have been a shock for some companies who have previously thought that the largest risk of monitoring is China.
The major developments occur in cloud technologies where European companies have better realized that data stored in the United States are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance Association, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused to use a cloud provider in the United States after the disclosure of the American programme for intellectual analysis of Prism data.
Jim Snabe, one of the Executive Directors of SAP, said: “We see consumers ask a new question that was not raised a year ago, namely: where my data are stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders claim that the latest communications are just a confirmation of what they already knew that the mighty States wish to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data should be protected at any price.
What happens to economic spy is not surprising.
He always had a place.
“It was a matter of discussion for many years and has not significantly changed in the current debate”, said Kurt Bock, Chief Executive Director of the Chemical Company, BASF.
The Americans are spying after us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are also spying on them because this is our national interests to protect our commercial businesses.
The leaders of corporations usually do not like to praise the responses they have taken, as it can give an advantage to the opponent.
The major companies have long acknowledged that taking a free flash on the exhibition or leaving the laptop without surveillance in the hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of the Audi Automotive Company, said that it has been a standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before the office meetings so that they could not be used as a surveillance device.
The Federal Constitutional Service recommends that firm managers consider using simple mobile phones during foreign travels due to smartphone vulnerability.
Mobile phones are subsequently thrown out.
However, there are concerns that small and medium companies remain vulnerable to invasion and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are leaders of the world market in their specific low.
“The small and medium companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access”, warns BfV report.
The United States has warned their own companies about economic spying from other countries.
The National Intelligence Summary of the United States in February placed France together with Russia and Israel in the second series of violents who hack for economic intelligence, after China, said The Washington Post.
The member of the German Prestigious Board of Directors reaffirmed that, when it comes to economic spying, “Frenches are the bigger.”
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency, reportedly said in the interview this month: “The services know well that all countries, even when they cooperate in combating terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Adolescent from Georgia, who died in “unexpected accident”, believes that their son was killed.
Adolescent parents from Georgia, whose body was found inside a twisted sports mat in his high school sports room, believe that their son was killed, said a family attorney on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the city of Waldosta of Georgia, was found on 11 January in a vertically standing mate in the back of the tribunes in his high school sports hall.
Investigators of the Sheriff of the Lundes District concluded that Johnson died on a tragic accident, but the family of a 17-year-old teenager contested that.
“They are absolutely confident that their son was killed,” said FoxNews.com Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacques Johnson.
They never believed he died as sheriff says.
“They believe that this is contrary to logic, physics laws and healthy senses,” Kramp said.
They think that it is a cover for the protection of man or people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was brought back to their body bag," he said.
The American Lawyer Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation of Johnson's death, noting that several key issues remained unanswered.
What caused death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at the press conference on Thursday.
I'll study all the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to learn the truth.
"I follow the opinion that there are sufficient grounds for official investigation," he said.
Moore told the reporters that the original autopsy showed that Johnson died as a result of the “pozitional asphyxiation”.
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, showed another cause of death.
“There are several questions to be resolved or clarified”, he said.
Moore added that if he discovered enough evidence to demand a criminal or civil investigation of Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Sheriff Office of the Loundes district was not available to comment when he was addressed on Thursday.
Judge of South Georgia provided on Wednesday to the authorities to publish all the videos of the monitoring cameras that the investigators had seen.
Adolescent parents said they were hoping that videos had a key to finding out how he died.
Spartacus: For information on persons who weigh the fascist symbol

Disease control and prevention centres made recommendations for children ' s allergy schools
Wednesday, the control and prevention centres published a list of food allergy recommendations in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations made by the Government of the United States, while the number of children of school ages suffering from food allergy is increasing.
Now one of the 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The control and prevention centres found that the proliferation of food allergy to children has increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The management provides information for schools about how to raise awareness of the teachers and the child ' s food allergy staff and how to assist in allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools maintain adrenaline stocks, mostly for injections, EpiPen's automatic medical syringe, be used to provide assistance with potentially deadly anaphilaxis.
The state legislative authorities have recently amended the Regulation to allow schools to make adrenaline stocks with less difficulties.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children with allergic reactions.
Children can say, "It feels like something about my tongue, it feels like I have hair in my tongue" or "tongue stick."
Inter-sexual parents can choose “indetermined sex”
Germany became the first European country that recognized the third sex of children born with external intermediate sex.
The newborn will no longer be assigned to male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to call any sex of such children, allowing parents to indicate the gender as “indetermined” or “indetermined” in their birth certificates.
The aim of the law was to remove the pressure from the parents that could have a rapid decision on gender-based gender-based and to counter discrimination of inter-sexual people.
A inter-sexual person, according to the BBC, said many years later: “I am not a man or not a woman.”
I'm going to stay the doctors with a bruise and scars.
Approximately one of the two thousand children born every year is not a boy or a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of approximately 60 pathological states that have been diagnosed as “Sexual Disorder”, as a collective term for people with atypic chromosoms, gonades (jajajajas or seeds) or unusually developed external sex organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
Gender identification is still insufficient, but most experts in the United States say that, if the gender cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and to accommodate it than to wait and monitor the child ' s psychological and physical development before the operation, if that ever happens.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Dreacher, specialized in gender identification issues, said that the new German law would "sound like a good idea".
Intersexual children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have threatening lives of violations that require operational intervention, but most children do not have” he said.
You can adopt a gender without surgery and then see how the identity develops.
Science of the child’s gender identity is not too accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people are homosexual.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes inter-sexual people as different from trans-sexual or transgender because their condition is not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to the male or female gender, but typically to both of them or not.
These characteristics may be demonstrated in secondary sexual signs, such as muscle mass, the distribution of hair sheet, breasts and organism; primary gender signs such as reproductive organs and genitalities, or in the structure of chromosom and hormones.
The report also gives a general perception of discrimination faced by inter-sexual and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of anxiety, cruelty and prejudice crimes.
The boys with gender deviations now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to put male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June, the 52-year-old inhabitant of Australia, Norrie May-Walby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as a “unspecified“ sexual status for life.”
According to the Ministry of Interior, the German passports will use the third label in addition to M and F to X, which is intersexual.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still conflicting, according to the news issue at France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators, this strongly expressed Catholic country, signed a petition on the exemption of the “gender theory” from school books.
The American Catholic Online website also expressed disagreement with the German law, stated that “in the situation where the world is involved in a new state where sex is the subject of choice and sexual activity is no, we turn two other stages of civilization.”
A mother of a newborn child from Maryland also informed the Baby Zone's Baby Zone website that she would prefer children to be gendered at birth.
“To grow a child is hard enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child,” she said to the parents' website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female sex bodies were called hermaphrodites, named by a beautiful Greek god, who had signs of both sexes.
And only ten years ago, the medical community considered gender as a sheet on which everything can be deleted and then drawn again.
But now many challenge the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identities are complex, and doctors sometimes make wrong choices, without knowing how the child will perceive the gender that he has taken when he grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called an urgent psychiatric case,” said Dreecher.
When such children were born, you didn’t call a psychiatrist; you called the surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with inter-type genitals was proposed by Dr. John Manny from the University of Jones Hopkins, who believed that gender was easy to change.
He introduced the term “gender identities” and claimed that the signals of the environment, including social — how parents grow up a child — were interacting with child genes and hormones, determining whether a person would consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case of 1966, known as “John/John”, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged during an unnecessary circumcision, to cassrate the child completely, remove his eggs and raise it as a girl.
"Mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but it was not," Dreacher said.
When he was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he committed suicide.
Dreacher said that some doctors are still "applying this model".
But in the 1990s, when the Internet came, the people who survived these gender-change operations declared themselves "inconscious."
That was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosoms but genitals of interim type.
The doctors were unable to determine whether he had a large clitor or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a man's "free life".
So shortly after his birth in 1976, the external sex organ and Bruce’s egg were surgeously removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones when he was 12 years old.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said, "ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
When he was 18, he was assigned to vaginoplastic.
But when he was depressed and realized something was wrong, he needed medical documentation.
What he learned was terrible.
I was sterilized when I was born, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a violation of sexual development, which did not allow his body to produce sufficient testosterone to normally develop genitalias.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, getting a testosteron injection and removed his breast.
The operation made him inferior.
He is now in the protection of others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to normalize perception of people with inter-sexuality.
However, Anne Temar-Mattis, Executive Director of the California Legal Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German Law “incentives to qualify labels and stigme”.
“Most activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a rapid decision and give the child an uncertain sex”, she said.
We are afraid that he will contribute to intervention.
We think it's better to accommodate a male or female sex and then wait.
But we haven't seen this law manifest, so all we can do is build assumptions.
Temar-Matis said that her organization supports the Australian law as it "lets adults make a choice for the third sex."
“Adolescents must have the opportunity to make their own decisions on formal sex” she said.
The German Law implies its adoption at birth.
This is a struggle in which small children should not enter this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to decide on their own body.
But Dr. Arlin Barrac, a mammogenologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with sexual infringement and who helps to hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law would "support" both parents and children.
The daughter of Baratz, Cathy, was born with male chromosoms, but she has a sexual disorder called “the syndrome of full insensitivity to androgens”.
Since her anderogical receptors were not working correctly, Kathy had female signs.
She's got a carpet, but there's no uterus or eggs.
Now, at 29 years of age, Cathy is married and is taking a child psychiatric office at Pennsylvania University.
Despite its inferiority, she hopes to become a parent by adopting or gestating surrogate motherhood.
“The law gives parents time to avoid rushing decisions themselves,” said Barac.
It gives them time to make some analysis and address the situation, as well as the interval of time before they write " male" or "woman".
In that case, you are fine — growing a child, loving a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't need to do an operation that is unreversed.
“It allows children to participate in the decision and removals the worries that moves their parents because they do not feel the right thing," she said.
In the end, the child will decide with which he or she are more comfortable, and that is great.
This gives children the opportunity to make a decision on their own.
The Chicago gateman Nicolai Habibulin emphasized that he realizes he should play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard on training.
In the last two meetings, Habibulin first missed six shabs from Tampa Bay, and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game, he was replaced after the fourth missed bat.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I haven't managed to do that, the CSNChicago says Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in training, I'm probably supposed to approach them as a game, and try to get better results.
You must study your past games and work on the shortcomings that have been.
There are some small components I need to improve, but I feel pretty good at training.
But somehow, after a few heads, everything turns into a snow coma.
Maybe I need to relax.
The gatemen -- I don't think I'm alone -- they're always trying to play a perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not excited.
No matter what's going on in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself so I can't miss that much.
Well, it's good my one-clubs support, but it's simple, I have to play better.
Two games are not the whole season, but I wanted to spend them much better.
But it happened.
I have to put that in the way.
I'm just gonna try to play the next match better.
There was a bus flying on Altai.
A PAZ flight bus turned over in the Rubcev region of the Altailand.
As a result, 13 people have been injured, reported in the regional ICS office.
Previously, the law enforcement authorities of the region reported 10 victims.
According to the Department, an accident occurred about 9 hours in local time on the Newnicolaevka Road, Višnevka, 1 mile from Novonicolaevka.
In the bus followed by Rubčevsk to Višnevka, 12 passengers and drivers were injured and were hospitalized.
Eleven victims were delivered to the City Hospital No.1 Rubcevska, two people were hospitalized to the CRB Rubcevska.
Medvedev expects the SSJ-100 plane to be placed in Europe
Russia expects that after the markets of Latin America and Asia, Superjet 100 aircraft will be placed in Europe.
"We hope that, as a whole, we will receive more than 170 copies of aircraft like this," says Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev, at the press conference with the Prime Minister of France, Jean-Mark Ayro.
The head of the Russian Government noted that francs colleagues had serious cooperation since it was a joint project.
We have discussed today some financial issues related to insurance, but we hope that after this plane is strengthened in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be placed to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he will be placed in France once," stressed the Russian Prime Minister.
SSJ-100 is a plane built by the Civil Airplanes of Suho in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
Liner is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high quality standards and comfort in a segment of 100 passenger places.
Energy of the Dnepropatrocy launched a unique program for saving... a nest of aists.
In ancient times, to bring to the court of the Aysts, the villagers on the high pillar set a wheel from a car, and the heavy nest was well held on it.
Such special resistance has not been placed for a long time, so the aeists loved the electoral lines - the branches of the branches are based on the wires, so the true house stands reliable.
Granny Anja, who has been living in the village of Ivanovka Petrikov for 20 years, began to observe the nest sitting down despite all the efforts of its residents.
The birds put on top new branches, and the lower layer is already propelled between the wire, and it's just going to fall.
Of course, a pathetic family of aysts, who were sitting at the courtroom every year, were extinguished and feeding three or four birds during the summer, but they would not want to stay without light.
Once the birds flew to warm edges, Ania called the Royal RES, which belongs to the resistance.
And I didn't even expect them to react so quickly.
When our experts arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest is still holding up, said the Technical Director of DTEC " Dneproblenerge" Sergei Berezovski.
There was a corrosion in the nest of 150 to 200 kilograms.
At any point, birds could die from electrical level.
In addition, locals have risked to stay out of light because of the wire damage.
The linear monters therefore started a nest rescue operation, not for the first time in our practice.
Scientists from the Dnepropetrov National University helped to develop a nest transfer scheme.
They were training for circuit network staff.
A famous daily ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised energymen at all stages of reconstruction of nests.
For the beginning, it was estimated that more than 50 real apartments were in an emergency area.
Their reconstruction was prepared by special metal platforms that looked like a crown.
The foundation was conquered by the branches, and then the old nest was transferred.
The experts believe that enough to put old branches as a basis for birds to know the nest and return to it.
After that, the aystists will build their own place.
The first nest was restored in the village of the New Moscow region.
In addition to the electricity, a new railway pillar was placed on it with an old, already covered nest.
The entire operation cost energy in nine thousand groceries.
The same settlement was held in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovski district in the courtyard of grandmother Anne.
The platform was established in the former place, but it had only been raised above the lines.
Ornitologists are sure that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice that their "party" was subject to capital repair.
Until the end of the year, the same reconstruction awaits four more nests in the Pokrovski and the Kingdom regions of the Dayproperty.
By the way, while some are saving rare birds, others kill them unfortunately.
On the day of the day, the whole area of the sad news, in the village of the Ust-Camenca of the apostolic district, on the day of the opening of the hunting of fasans, the bandioniers had shot the swan family in the local frost.
The noble birds were not afraid of people, the local inhabitants feeded them or injured them.
When the peasants heard the shots and ran to the beach, four beauty swans were already lying on the water of the dead.
At present, the officers of the Milition Division of the apostles find out who shot the birds taken into the Red Book.
Russian march becomes more popular
On 4 November, on the Day of People's Unity, Moscow will be agreed with the Mayor of the Russian Marsh.
According to the Levada Centre survey, the support of the Russian marches is increasing, already 40 per cent of citizens have a different degree of approving the idea of their conduct.
According to the Levada Centre, 40 per cent of the citizens are differently endorsed by the Russian marches; 11 per cent of them are definitely positive and 29 per cent are " faster positive".
In 2006, only 14 per cent of the Russians welcomed the popularity of the Russian marches, and the implementation of such activities had already been doubled (28 per cent) in December 2010.
"Decisively negative" to the Russian marches are only 7 per cent of the Russians, " faster negative" - 19 per cent.
Another 35% have failed to formulate their attitude to the share.
In this year, the mayor of Moscow agreed to conduct the Russian march by up to 15,000 people in Lublino, today the head of the Department of Security of the capital of Alexei Mayor.
This nationalist action takes place every year on the Day of People's Unity since 2005.
On the question of the sociologists, " Have you heard that the Russian marches are held in Russia on 4 November under the protection of Russian rights in Russia?", three quarters (75 per cent) have responded negatively.
Only every fifth Russian (20 per cent) knows about this share now.
It is noted that nearly a third of the citizens (31 per cent) were heard on the Russian march in December 2010.
Recall that three years ago, on 11 December, the Manage Square held a natural event of nationalists, which became a mass disorder.
The Levada Centre also asked the Russians about the celebration of 4 November.
In two years, the number of people who know the right answer (National Day) increased from 41 per cent to 49 per cent.
However, only 15 per cent of the citizens are gathered to celebrate this celebration.
Approximately the same (17 per cent) intends to celebrate the Day of October Revolution on 7 November.
Most citizens (62 per cent) will not celebrate any of these celebrations.

Communication: Obama's pre-electoral headquarters considered the exemption of Bayden for Hillary Clinton
According to the New York Times, the nearest advisers of President Barak Obama had secretly considered the possibility of substituting Vice-President Joe Bayden as a candidate for Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election list.
This opening is the brightest senzation of all the books Mark Galperin and John Heilman on the 2012 campaign "Double Staffs: Game has changed 2012."
The Times received a copy prepared for the exit of the book and reported on Thursday night that the neighbouring Assistants of the President conducted “maximum research in focus groups and public reviews at the end of 2011” to assess whether the exemption of Bayden could help to raise the hopes of both reelection.
According to the political reviewer The Times Jonathan Martin, the book gives detailed description of the attempts of high-level officials of the Bureau and the White House, namely, the former head of the White House of Bill Daily, to assess the impact of the vote by the former Secretary of Clinton Vice-President.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully protected headquarters in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only six of the nearest president's advisors, including Daily, the former head of Obama's pre-electoral headship, Jim Messin, and former seniors of the White House, David Axelrod and David Pluff, knew that the replacement was considered.
The book “Untimately doubled” claims that Daily was an initiator of the attempt to replace Bayden despite their “near personal relations”, but eventually he rejected the step when their data showed that the Clinton's added to the electoral list would not “may improve Obama's chances.”
In an interview with Martin Daily confirmed that the administration was really considering the possibility of replacement by Bayden Clinton.
"I was actively pronounced for considering a number of things, and it was one of them," Daily said to the newspaper.
You should remember that at that time the president was in a terrible shape, so we thought, "O God, what do we do?"
Although Daily described the study as “necessary verification”, Martin told the representative of CNN Anderson Cooper that the pre-electoral headquarters had invested enough in examination of whether this dividend would take place in the vote.
“The primary headquarters do not spend such money on surveys and focus groups unless they consider anything seriously”, said Martin in AC 360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team had studied the possibility of replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daily if his boss knew about the possibilities.
Although Daily said that he didn't think the president was "known" of the possible replacement, the former head of the administration admitted that "possibly" Obama knew.
Martin added that "Double Staffs" did not give a clear answer to whether the results of the political sensation had come to the Obama table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed that Obama had not been aware of the possibility of excluding Bayden from the electoral list.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
Do you want a lighting in the dark of the ice cream?
The British entrepreneur created the first ice cream in the world.
Charlie Francis used fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop light food.
He came to this idea by reading a scientific article on meduses, and convinced scientists in China to chemically reconstruct the lighting protein.
The ice cream reacts with the language of the one who eats it, increasing the pH level in the protein and making it light.
Chris says that since the ice cream starts to shine when it reacts to the warm mouth, that means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company, "Link me, I'm delicious," says, "It's an incredible thing, but it's still at the very beginning stage, if you're talking about production, so you'll get about 2 g of substance for a pound."
The protein that we use in ice cream is responding with your language with neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, it increases the pH level and the ice cream starts to shine.
We tested it over the past few months, and it seemed perfect to introduce him to Halloween, because it created such a wonderful shineing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've done because the luminescence of the meadow is four times more expensive than gold.
So every ball is worth me about 140 pounds.
But it's pretty nice to taste.
Charlie's experimental company located in Bristol is famous with its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and taste of dry gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, “I really want to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is definitely impossible because of the fracture caused by ice crystals, which consists of ice cream, but I think we can find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses fluorescent properties of the meadow synthesized by Chinese scientists
Avangarda Coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking of the preparation of his team for the KHL regular championship against Salavat, noted that Omici had a thorough analysis of the defeat of the Magnitogorian Metallurg.
The specialist emphasized that Awangard should focus on the defence game.
We were watching a video of the match against the METALLURG METALLURGH -- the official web site of "Avangarda" of Chebaturkin's words.
- We missed a lot of shabes, not a very nice moment.
They missed because of their mistakes, because of the failure to perform a game mission.
We knew the rival had performers.
Statistically, they've had five attacks, three bullets we've been slaughtered.
It's very good.
These errors were taken into account in preparing for today's game?
We and the boys understand each match carefully, we talk after the game, prepare for a new rival.
It's important that the installation be implemented.
Everyone saw the first time of the Metallurg match.
The game mission was performed, and the account was 2:0.
They missed the goal in the dressing room and began to be mistaken in the third period.
Given how hard the game was composed, there was no sense in the connection of defenders.
We need a whole team to defend.
Now Awangard has a long home series, the matches go in a day, the team's getting tired?
All teams are in the same conditions.
The main thing now is the realization of its moments and the performance of the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you do the installation, it's not so difficult.
Because of the new rules imposed by the Russian Customs, nearly a week on the border with Russia, there are hundreds of flours in turn.
Today, donetical officials promised to provide drinking water drivers and to establish bio-toolets
There were hundreds of flours in the borders at the entrance to Russia.
Such a situation has occurred because of the amendment of the customs rules of the goods.
Ukrainian borderers and customers confirmed that the Russian party was in line, which had not warned the innovation before.
Since 28 October, the authorities of Russia began to apply additional measures to ensure the delivery of goods, " said the Deputy Chief of the Eastern Customs, Vladimir Denisov.
The new sample document is applied in countries which have joined the Convention on International Transport.
The passpoints are working in a stronger regime.
The correspondent of the FACTOV visited the border and communicated with remote players who were hostages.
The prices in the Road Coffee Store at the Novoazsk passpoint are growing every day, as well as a row.
The trucks are in several rows, extending about two miles.
The Tagged Novoazovsk - Veselo-Veselo-Vasselk terminal provides one of the most important transport routes from the south of Ukraine on the international road.
From here, goods are sent to the Stavropol country of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday until midnight, the rules have been launched, and then they have introduced these rules, a remote shooter Alexei Glavanov (on the photo) who has been carrying a transit through Russia from Turkey to Kazakhstan and staying in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and insurance payments.
The amount depends on the value of the goods and the distance to which it is transported.
Minimum insurance - 4.5 - 5 thousand rubles (about 1100 - 1300 groceries).
Those traveling nearly (so we say Georgia, Armenia) with a load of up to $50,000, pay about 15,000 rubles (3800 groceries) and travel.
And the rest are stuck, because no one has that much money with them!
You can imagine that if the driver carries only four thousand dollars, but until Moscow, he needs 90,000 rubles (i.e. 23,000 groceries) to pay for transit!
The conditions for survival on the border are none, the remote players are situated near their cars.
In border shops and cafeterias, it's always expensive, but the prices like this, we've never met anywhere!
The sellers fought and quickly mounted them: 15 bracelets are worth a baton, seven groceries is a cup of coffee, 25 dishes is a soup.
A cafeteria is one.
And there's no toilet.
We're sleeping in the steps, and that's where we're going to the bathroom.
Not washing or shaving...
I can't leave the car for a week, my wife made it up for me.
For a week, another remote fighter Victor Scottarenko is comforting himself.
Will my car only come up in a week?
Why do you have a liter of water?
There's 11 and 15 groceries.
What, a bottle of crustale or a silver water?
We have coffee, not a store.
Take something else while there's, a seller's pair.
After the situation was launched in the media, Ukrainian drivers took the attention of the authorities of the region.
The Guide of the Amrosiev and Novo-Azov Raigosadministrations received a mandate to ensure that all those who are standing on the Ukrainian-Russian boundary, drinking water, the President of the Donetsk Obsegady of Sergei Dergunov.
Emergency troops are now under way.
Biotualettes will also be installed for human comfort.
According to the official, the problem related to the lines will be resolved in the coming days.
As the Press Service of the Donetsk Obligation Reports, as at 31 October, in international items, " Uspinka" and "Novoazovsk" were promoted accordingly by 32 and 68 cars.
FACTs will monitor the development of the situation.
Villnius suspected Moscow in trying to denounce the Lithuanian President
Russia intends to provoke information against the high-level persons of Lithuania and Eastern Partnership, such a statement to the BNS agency had made in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
Information is published on the DELF portal.
According to the communication, Moscow, in particular, is going to " talk" to the President of Lithuania, Dale Grybauskate and publish the fake documents found in the Russian Gosarchive, which are likely related to the facts from the Lithuanian leader's biography.
According to the Special Service, the Department of Public Administration of the President of Russia on interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries is analyzing the public management processes.
The structure is headed by the Eugeneum of the умерenkov, who visited Lithuania and participated in the Lithuanian People ' s Party ' s Meeting.
The Officer of the Department of W. Smirnov also seemed to be a participant in the operation.
According to the Special Service, Smirnov, under the cover of scientific work by the end of 2012, regularly arrived in Lithuania and contacted local politics, politicians and media representatives.
Smirnova is now not allowed to enter the country.
Before Lithuania, President of Lithuania, Gubauscate announced that she knew about the cooking information on her.
In her view, the main reason for which Lithuania was successfully chaired in the Council of the European Union and the " striking of the country to energy independence"
The Lithuanian leader had not criticised the actions of the Russian authorities before.
So she claimed that the Kremle for Lithuania was "insufficient respect".
Furthermore, Gribauscate accused the head of RF Vladimir Putin for moving to Lithuania "only demands".
Recall, in September, Rossenger suspended the import of Lithuanian milk into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the product was not in conformity with the sanitation and epidemiological standards.
The leader of Lithuania then stated that if Russia did not remove the ban, the Government of the country should prepare the WTO.
In the United States, the school director shot adolescents.
The director of one of the American high schools was literally desperate.
The man said he had to take his weapons and start shooting.
There was an incident in Tennessee.
As New York Post says, juvenile huligans were throwing the house of a man with a toilet paper.
As a result, the school director opened a teenager shooting, which resulted in a 15-year-old boy's wounds in his foot and arm.
Since the huligans were not in the territory of the director's property, he was accused of attacks under difficult circumstances.
The man was released from jail in $125,000.
Notice, the shooting of peaceful inhabitants in the United States becomes a terrible pattern.
A man literally opened a shooting in the center of Ridgecrest in the US state of California right across the streets.
After that, the criminal captured two hostages, hid them in the car's trunk and tried to hide.
Previously, a shooting was launched at the Newtown primary school in Connecticut.
Adam’s mother worked at school, she was a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat cupcakes, not to go to bed and make a maskard for our area.
Now I look more like a scratch.
I have not been calling for the last two years to distribute cupcakes in my apartment, and I probably won't be in this year.
However, the statistics show that I'm a white crow in Halloween.
According to the National Federation of Divorce Trade, most Americans — namely 158 million — would celebrate Halloween this year and spend $6.9 billion for candy, suits and decorations.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is the trends.
The National Federation for Discount Trade foresees that the costumes will take $1.2 billion from $6.9 billion.
This year, in the fashion, sexually unconscious objects.
Women are no longer required to be representatives of sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
With regard to men, I think we'll see a lot of zombies thanks to the Incoming Deads, and I'm sure that the astronauts in the Daft Punk group will fall into our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the suits that seek most often are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
There may be nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We put on our dogs last year, and, to my surprise, we were not the only ones.
Furthermore, according to the National Federation of Different Trade, Americans will spend $330 million this year for household suits.
That means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to cupcakes, we're not tiny.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to Nelsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, ice creams, milk duds, chewing candy Twizzlers and Clark Bar.
According to the United States Ministry of Trade, this is a great news for 41 million demanding children's candy that are prepared to conquer our areas.
Furthermore, we will buy, and we will not lie to ourselves, and we will eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is cupcakes in the form of corn grain; however, according to the National Association of Condients, almost 35 million pounds of them are sold under Halloween.
It's about 9 billion of separate corn grains.
It's a mystery I'm about to figure out.
None of the facts of Halloween as the ghost houses.
They have excellent titles, such as "Shooting at walls" (which, by the way, is in the present prison), "Woy and Shock" and "Home of Shock".
Furthermore, according to American Haunts society, there are 1200 officially recognised houses in America with ghosts generating about $500 million of income, and those amazing photos where you almost described, which your friend put on Facebook, and you can't clean up, and then the guy you like to see, and leaves a comment like a "class face expression".
And in conclusion, we'll talk about ducks.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Tickwa when we were kids, and the cutting of Jack's lamp is like a decoration of Christmas tree, what we've been doing since we were children.
Fortunately for us, the baby's fashion started in the turtle only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up, cutting these turtles, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. census Bureau, this year the Americans will spend about $106 million for tubes.
Jack's lighter, slowly drying on your wing, probably arrived from the state of Illinois, which raised 542 million pounds of turtle this year.
If you want the tasks more complicated, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in the city of Napa in California and try to cut any of their tickles at the weight of 2032 pounds.

A number of schools and hospitals had to be closed because of the poor force.
Four schools in Zimbabwe province South Matabelleland had to be closed because the students were attacked... goblins.
As a local elder said, children were panicked, and the continuation of classes turned out to be impossible.
The goblin story may sound like an invention of a child for a European, but in Africa it is a very serious argument to close school.
Adults are also afraid of unclean power.
In summer, for example, the hospital closed in Zimbabwe because the hospital was also attacked by goblins.

INTERFAX.RU refers to a informed source in the law enforcement bodies of RF.
"When reports of the United States Ministry of Finance of Lepsa appeared in the media on the lists of suspicions belonging to the Euro-Euro-Brate Circle Crime Syndication, we have examined all databases, but have not been found," said the interviewer of the Agency.

Cocker-paniel Ruby fled after she got into a small DTP
After three days of her career, a man who walked the dog
Firemen landed on the rope on the slope to save the dog from unministered destruction
The puppy was lucky to be saved after the fire teams were called to raise and deliver him to a safe place, after he was stuck at a height of 50 feet at a dangerous decline.
The nine-month cocker-paniel Ruby fled after her car accident on Sunday daily, and spent three days alone before she was saved from a career to Wednesday.
Her master, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at the Flappit career in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunify with Ruby, and thanked the fire rescue service of West Yorkshire.
They heatily searched for their missing dog and placed contacts on social network sites after she fled to career after a small accident.
About 14:15 on Wednesday, a star dog noticed Ruby, stuck at a height of 50 feet at a career departure.
The Technical Rescue Unit from the Clechiton Fire station has hurried to the scene of the incident, landed down on the ropes to save Ruby and used the transmission to raise it up the slope.
Andy Clayton, a rescue officer, said: “It was in a dangerous situation.”
It was right in the middle of the slope, 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move while she was rescued, she was completely cold.
But now she's okay.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was noticed is incredible.
Peter Lau, a rescue officer, said: “Ruby was very lucky to be saved.”
There was a probability that she could get a very serious trauma or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinary survey, and it was found to be fine, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Galifax, West Yorkshire, said: “The watch of salvation was terrible.”
I couldn't believe she was there at all.
It was amazing when she was in our hands again.

Firemen were great.
That was very courageous — what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson, from Kitley, added: “We were afraid that she could fall, but she remained there.”
Firemen were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.

George Kerevan: Break with Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another independence scary.
This time, we are warned that the independent Scotland will have to join the universal European free movement zone as a membership within the EU.
There are stories of passport controls in Berwick and the border with a thick line along the Adrian Val.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper indicated possible economic benefits from more free movements across the rest of Europe, although, as foretold, this did not appear in the titles.
No one also pointed out that EU member states were wasting a lot of time to turn their formal rules as they were comfortable.
Since Scotland is not currently in the Schengen Zone, continuation of non-compliance with the requirements will be a cheap derogation for Brussels in exchange for what he really wanted from the Scots.
So it's not a good story.
And it's so old that it's turned into stone: the first time I heard the duck about "independence means passport control" at least 40 years ago.
Still, there is an interesting moment that was lost when the old story was overwhelmed.
Why should independent Scotland at all comply with European commands?
Why change London's yoke into Brussels's yoke, especially now?
Here is the European news: the great after-war plan to unify Europe has finally stopped.
With the European crisis, the Europe project is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties acting against the EU or canceling the euro as a single currency are being forced.
Even in Germany, the European Sceptics Party Alternative for Germany, based only this year, appeared from nowhere and received nearly five million votes at September's federal elections, thus expelling the Free Democrats (nature of our Liberal Democrats) from Bundestag.
There was always an internal opposition to the federal Europe plan.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a breakthrough.
The strict savings measures introduced by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the chains imposed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency have led many to think that the Europe project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments work in excessive budget deficits was just for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members at the exchange rates profitable for German exporters — that German policies and wish to preserve.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, South Europe is in an advanced inconvenience of production opportunities compared to Germany.
The only means of saving is to cut off wages and public expenses, which is actively supported by Berlin.
The current budget and currency problems are a deeper problem of Europe's productive capacities.
As a result of the integration of the “green” energy measures imposed by Brussels, a cipher which means the subsidization of French and German energy companies from consumers, the European industry pays twice as much as electricity and four times more gas than in the United States.
These are paralyzingly disadvantaged price conditions, as we've seen in Grangemouth.
No freezing of wages in the world will stop the destructive victory of the cheap US slain gas over the European oil industry.
As a result, the rebellion, especially in France, was once the EU's most embarrassed party.
Following the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris at one level with Washington.
But Berlin is no longer needed in Paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy to Europe, leaving the ruined economy of France in a poor situation.
The EU-related Marin Le Penn National Front has just won decisive additional elections, dropping the ruling party of socialists into the third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24 per cent of votes, the timely warning of British labs that it cannot be assumed that the right division would automatically benefit the left.
What is Le Pen doing with its newly converted popularity among the French white working class?
She wished to use the EU elections next year to establish a block in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If that is very likely, the EU-controlled parties will receive support at these elections, the bloc will be able to take the dominant situation for the first time in the European Parliament.
This is my opinion: the rapidly growing moods against the EU and the single currency in Europe are merged together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something like a scattered Europe (suvereign) nations that liked General de Goll.
Germany and several dependent economies can save the euro, but France and Southern Europe will restore their own currency.
I assume that Britain is distant from this project, hoping to draw close to the United States.
Nevertheless, the increasing Washington interest in the Pacific indicates the probability that Britain will remain unaware in the Atlantic cold.
In what situation does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in fact) of Small England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, besides, send Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed in a more free European agreement provided that we maintain our currency.
Cooperation with other single-contributor countries will be easier in the non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of repeating Norway's experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Government of the Scotland National Party in Scotland is, unfortunately, the most successful political movement in Europe, aimed at a strong economy, which has received an impressive majority of votes in 2011 by objecting to the reductions of the costs proposed (and the realized) by the Leiborist Officer of Treasury, Alister Darling, and the resulting coalition of the Tory and Liberal Democrats.
Scotland would now be ridiculous to vote for independence only in order to take the measures of the hard savings imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early sexual maturity: ageing earlier
Afro-American and Latin American girls usually reach gender maturity before their white peers show research.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual maturity is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are guilty
Experts believe that obesity epidemic may be one of the early sexual maturity mechanisms
The tendency to early sexual maturity is not so expressed in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etherage is a journalist specialized in child health and family issues.
Should the mother be scared if her daughter starts to form breast irons and grow skull hair at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, the child endocrinologist, Dr. Paul Caplovitz, explained that these early physical changes were quite common to American girls and were a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time calming my parents -- that usually does not mean a rapid attack of full sexual maturity," Caplovitz said.
The apparent signs of development, such as growing breasts, skull hair and body smell, appear earlier in girls.
However, there was only a small decrease in the age of the menarch (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 and decreased from 12.75 in 1970.
“After the breast starts to grow, it is at least two or three years before the menarch”, said Caplovitz, also author of the book “Earliest sex maturity in girls: how to deal with this common problem.”
Time is the most precise check of how sexual maturity will progress.
A debate is being discussed as a gender maturity occurs, but it is considered “preliminary” when the breast increase is accompanied by a dramatical increase in growth to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop — that the pediatrician can monitor carefully.
More rapid progress can be a basis for analysing the endocrinolog to exclude serious problems, such as tumours or purse.
There are procedures to keep early menstruation and prevent another effect: pre-aging bones, which eventually can slow down growth and low growth in mature age.
Recommendations on medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on child age, level of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
The Capowitz is careful with medicines, but admits that “the pressure of sexual maturity may mitigate the behaviour and feelings of girls that they are different from their peers.”
Another big problem is that parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruations.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or even how they can deal with hygiene”, said Caplovitz.
“It was a shock, ” recalls one woman whose daughter began menstruation at 10 years of age.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from the school scared and upset that she was first among her friends.
There are many publicized theories about the causes of early sexual maturity.
Nevertheless, there is no consistent evidence that the hormones in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or sexual media are guilty.
Boys, like girls, have early sexual maturity.
Capowitz claims that the prerequisite, which has the highest weight, is an epidemic of fatty.
In 2001, it helped conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years, which links the number of fat in the body with the period of sexual maturity.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African and Latin American girls usually reach gender maturity before their white peers.
There are different explanations.
The world's early sexual maturity appears to affect everything: from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although the boys have hair on their face and skull appears in a younger age, the trend for full early sexual maturity is not as expressed as girls.
Other doctors involved in the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
Even in babies and children of affordable age, the appearance of bruises and skull hair occurs.
“We should be careful about how we define the genuine gender maturity occurs,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, child endocrineologist in the hospital of Gorieb in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be ashamed to receive guidance from the pediatrician about how to talk to their child.
“This may mean more early than it was expected to be,” explained Caplovitz.
If you remain calm, your child will usually react well.
Girls who bloom early need to confirm that even when this happens before, this process is a normal part of life.
Who's stuck in Chita, American Boeing is preparing for an exit.
In the Open Sky Treaty, observative flights over the territory of Russia and unplanned landing in Chita on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 in Moscow, will leave the city's aircraft on Wednesday.
The airport leadership permitted the departure of the board by receiving money for fuel.
As reported at the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan Wude.
Other data indicate that he will go to the United States.
The plane flying in Ulan Wood was reported to land in the Zabaikal Land due to fog.
Because of the unpaid accounts, he was not released from the Chita airport.
There are 30 people on the plane, including the crew, who spent two nights at the airport, reports ITAR-TASS.
As reported in the MID RF, under the conditions of the Open Sky Treaty, people are not entitled to leave outside the Chita airport, they can only take border control in two Russian airports in Cuban and Ulan-Ude.
The Open Sky Treaty was signed in 1992, with 34 States involved.
Observation flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, United States, Canada, Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty - Development of Transparency, Promotion of Implementation of Arms Control Agreements, Enhancing Crisis Prevention and Resolving Crisis situations within OSCE and other international organizations.
How many dead IC celebrity earned in the United States of the IC
The highest income rating of live celebrations was led by Madonna, who earned $125 million in 2013.
But it was "reflected" by the deceased Michael Jackson, whose post-death income was 160 million from October 2012 to October 2013.
It is noted that other famous ones who have lost the life of the world who have earned a few times less last year.
The second in the "constant" list of the most famous famous, composed by the Forbes magazine of the year, was Elvis Presley, 55 million per year, and a string below the comic booked by Peanuts Charles Schulz, with 37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, who had been leader last year, and the musician Bob Marley (18 million).
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein were also in the list.
The first bottle of Igor Gulayeva opened in Moscow
The first flagman bottle Igor Gulayeva in Moscow was opened on October 23.
The designer Igor Gulayev is familiar to the widespread public with its magnificent luxury products.
And now they can be evaluated by more fashion fans -- in Moscow, his first bottle was finally opened, which is why the designer and made a fun like a dolce vita.
I'm sure the most beautiful girls live in Russia.
So I am especially glad that I had a store opened in Moscow.
It's not just a office, it's a place where there's really a part of me.
That's exactly how Igor cut the red tape and invited all those who want to... take a look at the models!
Reactive aircraft manufacturers host the width of the seat when large orders are on the bench
A strong dispute on the width of the tourist class seats on remote flights between the leading aircraft producers, setting a tone for a severe confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Exhibition this month.
The dispute is around the width of the seats provided on long-way flights to passengers with class economies whose interests are not always in the centre of the attention of airlines, whereas the amount of the space for them plays a key role in allegations of the effectiveness of the recent airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus called on this week to introduce a sectoral standard that would provide a width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in class-case salons, but its main American competitor Boeing said that this should be decided by airlines.
The argue is at the time when aircraft producers are competing in the sales of their two-way remote aircraft, and the events of 17-21 November are expected to be highly recorded.
The back of the plane, especially whether 9 or 10 are sitting in a series, is central in the statements on the economic efficiency of new mini-aerobus projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will include 406 persons, based on the seats in the economic class more than 17 inches in width of 10 in each row.
Airbus said that the competitive version of its A350 would be transporting 350 people in the width of 18 inches per seat.
Aviation giants are often exchanged with technical impacts by advertising in professional press.
The Airbus is now referring directly to the public in front of the Dubai Airbus, where 777X is expected to be a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated the start of a new advertising war, showing to the financialists the slide, the three people in the restaurant with each other, called “We would you agree?”
"Boeing offers remote road flights in seats more narrow than regional turbine planes," said the Airbus manager John Lihi.
With changes in nutrition, people get weight, but the air seats have not changed.
Between the early 1970s, when the broadband Boeing 747 set the standards for modern remote travels, the average US man aged from 40 to 49 years increased by 10 per cent, according to the United States Department of Health.
The scope of the average American male of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to United States Health Service statistics.
Airbus claims that her competitor is adhering to the concept of the 1950s seats, when the average scope of the talia of those recently referred to as “reactive audience” has already been.
Airbus said it had ordered a study showing that an additional inch in the width of the seat improved the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing contests Airbus' seat size numbers and says that producers should not be involved in the decision on how airlines can find balance between tariffs and convenience.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the salon depends not only on the width of the seat.
“All is in fact focused on the provision of aviation companies and the possibility of doing what they think they should do to achieve success," Kent Craver said.
They don't want us to decide for them what will make them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
The issue for passengers is to increase the sidespace, but for suppliers this is increasingly a factor that can affect profits.
For this dispute, a racing for planes estimated at least $700 billion at catalog prices in the next decades is enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As the first reported by the Reuters agency in July, seat positions are exactly what warms the rivalry in the fight between the latest reactive aircraft.
Boeing, both Airbus and Boeing, claim 20 per cent increase in profit for one place in their last two-way remote models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
The statements of Boeing are partially based on the comparison of 10 local lines 777X with the original 9-local set of lines of constructive decision 777.
The victory in self-dependence is reduced compared to the 10-local composition currently used.
“The reason Boeing is to impress more places and make his plane more competitive than our developments," said Kevin Kenniston, head of the Airbus Comfort Division in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that salons with 10-long lines for existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a thick displacement, which can be hand-handed with lower tariffs.
“The seats of the width of eighteen inches would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, in commercial terms, the Airbus proposal was caused by the 777th model,” said Mary Kirby, the founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide chairs, but offer a directory of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
World-wide sellers of reactive aircraft even carry with them roulets to verify competitive planning.
With comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very thick salon for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 local lines, but says she has not sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for additional modifications of the salons, offering wider spaces for some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other producer of major modern aircraft, experts say, her call for a new marketing standard would hardly " fly" but could distract the wave of model 777X.
A new antinikin vaccine may reduce the satisfaction smoking process
Scientists have developed an antinikin vaccine that could reduce the smoking process of satisfaction cigarettes.
One dose of vaccine has been able to protect the mouse from a nucleus dependence for life.
There are further tests required before the start of human tests, which would take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from the College of Health, Weil Cornell, in New York, said that the first results were encouraging.
“We hope very much that such a vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who tried to quit testing all the methods available on the market today but have discovered that their никоtine dependence is strong enough to overcome it through these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus designed to provide genetic information to produce antinikin anti-teles.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
The antithels are tracked by any cells of nikotine in the blood by neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nucleus.
In the tests, the vaccinated mouses, which were subsequently given to Nicotine, continued their normal activity.
And the mice that had not been given the vaccine “relaxed”, and that is the sign that Nicotine had come to their brains,” say researchers.
These experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine magazine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they had antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to be done so often that they were expensive and irregular.
But the value of the new vaccine will probably be much lower, because it turns liver cells into antithels factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they would have a desire to try a cigarette by preventing a nicotine addiction.
But more likely it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start to smoke again, they will not be satisfied by the vaccine of Nicotine, and that can help them get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that additional studies were needed.
Oleinnikov: Third of the villages of Podmoskova is totally subsidiary
Vice-Guverner Submoskova Yuri Oleinnikov said that almost a third of the Moscow villages were fully subsidiary
Total funds from the regional budget are 187 settlements from 288.
In 2013, 187 villages from 288 received funds from the area budget.
The amount of funds in the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent subsidiary.
As part of the budgetary budget, 25 billion rubbers are transferred from the area budget," said Oleinnikov.
The Vice-Guverner also noted that only three urban settlements -- Mitiš, Edincevo and Puškino -- were more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
Income from rural settlements of many regions of less than 3 million rubles, "that is not enough."
The costs of the local administrative equipment in 88 submoskova settlements are more than 70 per cent, “decreasing the quality of services”, said Oleinnikov.
He had previously assigned the heads of the municipal forms of Podmoskova to consider what settlements need to be consolidated, mergered into urban districts or to change the administrative system.
These proposals will be reproduced by the end of January.
Before that, the Governor of the Moscow area stated that the administrative reform in Podmoskovje was planning to reduce the amount of subsidiary rural settlements.
Also, in Možaisk, Cashirski, Solarnochar, the Colomen regions, Luberzah and Kotelniks, there is a request for the empowerment of municipalities.
The discussion of this issue in the cities and regions will begin in November.
The President of Mossoldum, Igor Bryncalov, also stated that the upcoming admorform is planned for about 30 rural settlements in 12 areas of Podmoskovia.
This is linked to the fact that less than 178 rural settlements in Podmoskovje have a " acceptable" financial base and 100 subsidies.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide the great pleasure of her children being raised.
Despite the fact that Arbenina has given particularly much time to creativity and public activities, she still finds the possibility of hanging out with Martha and Artem, not only wasting time for their training, but also enjoying as much fun as possible.
During the last week, Diana had twice reported to her worshipers about her educational talents.
At first, she presented a photograph on Facebook that showed how she taught children to read.
And yesterday she chatted the fans, showed me how Artema and Marta put on Halloween.
The race is ready! Our first halloween," called Diana the photo of her children dressed in holiday suits.
What is unwise, because they are, like no other Russian boys and girls, related to this celebration because they were born in America.
Germany introduces "indetermined sex" in the registration of children in Europe
Germany will be the first country in Europe, where children born hermaphrodites will be allowed to be allowed in registration instead of male or female sex to indicate "indetermined".
The parents of the child will have the right to leave the count “pole” in the birth certificate incomplete.
Instead of "F" (woman sex) or "M" (male sex) parents may write "X" (indetermined).
This decision aims to avoid pushing parents to a rapid gender clarification operation.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborn in the world is born with hermaphroditis.
Tripodi denies that he is affected by Obide
The former Minister of Labour of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, will be an investigator of the anti-corruption supervisory body of the state.
Former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, opposed the change in the order of the sea rental at the request of his political teacher, Eddie Obejd, secretly owned the shares of three property objects in the state land.
The Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) extended its investigation on Friday, whether Mr. Obyd had lobbed the extension of the rental contracts for Sercular Ki, where the Obide family belonged to two restaurants and cafes, without tendering after the expiry of their term in August 2005.
She was now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi knew of the secret participation of Mr. Obide in property facilities, after the testimony of the former Deputy of the Administration of Mr. Tripodi Lynn Ashpoul on Thursday.
During a few years of discussions in 2005, the Government insisted that rent be made for an open competition.
The renters were against that, and they wanted longer rental periods.
In 2009, the contracts of the Sercular Ki rentals that brought the Obided family around $2.5 million per year were extended without exhibition for an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, minister for infrastructure and transport from February 2006 to November 2009, first spoke for open competitions.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obide, who, as recognized by Mr. Tripodi, urged the Government ' s rental policy to change.
The ICAC decrypted telecommunications in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obyd, Mr. Tripody and Steve Dunn, the senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under the leadership of Mr. Obide in the fishing department.
“Was there a question discussed during these telephone talks on the development of commercial rent policy?” asked Mr. Tripodi, assistant of Commissioner Anthony Willi.
“No”, said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not that.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obide.
According to a high official, Israeli military aircraft attack targets within Syria
The High Administration Officer in the Fox News interview confirmed that Israeli military aircraft had hit the target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night.
The official did not specify what it was for, but said that at least one.
Associated Press reports that the aim of the Russian SA-125 missiles was.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel was in charge of aircraft-related missiles within Syria.
Foreign vism workers of subclass 457 can be tested for “authority”
The “reliability” test for foreign visual workers of class 457 is being considered by the Government as it aims at expanding repressive measures.
This test, in the event of its adoption, will be applied by criteria aimed at preventing the use of visas of class 457 to fill in qualified posts or as a chase for the movement of family and friends to Australia.
The paper submitted by the Government was published today, while the former Lebarian Deputy Maxin McKue criticised the Government ' s rhetoric on foreign workers, saying that this could offend the neighbours of Australia.
“The rumors of the type of “foreigners are at the end of the turn” and “the work of the Australians” are a very unpleasant removal until the trade unions required the protected labour market”,” she said today to the Institute of Australia and India.
It historically meant that the white work was to be protected — and if some in the region saw the sounds of this historical artefact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The paper presented 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister for Immigration, Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration, Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka, where he met with officials on trafficking in persons, has already made five of the recommended changes and the others are in the stage of review.
If the credibility criteria are accepted, the applicant will be able to investigate whether “the candidate is true in conditions where the candidate is a relative or closely familiar owner or the person involved in the financing of the enterprise”.
Companies may also need to report on the number of visa holders of sub-class 457, since a small number of employees had been taken to work before.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lanka, who was looking for asylum, died allegedly from a heart attack after the arrival on a boat with refugees to the Christmas Island this week.
The nine - year - old son of this man was accompanied by him on his way to Australia, and since his father died on Wednesday, he was supported by a cousin who was also on the ship.
Australian authorities urgently sent a man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
A friend of Semen Varlamov stated that the hockeyist suffers from alcoholism
A friend of hockeyist Semen Varlamov Eugenea Vaurinouk stated that he suffered from alcoholism, transmitted by the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," said, in particular, a woman.
Recall that Vavrinuk was also a member of the Colorado Colorado Club for beating a holkyper in Russia.
She said the hockeyist pulled her out of her hair and beat her arms, breasts, stomach and neck after her attack.
Varlamov himself came to Denver's police and confessed to beating, describeing what happened.
He was arrested, but later he was bailed at $5,000.
The Court did not limit the sportsmen in the country's movements, but prohibited approaching Vavrinuk.
He was also threatened to be imprisoned by up to 6 years for domestic violence.
The British Government announced a study aimed at improving the economic impact for Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
Project HS2 envisages the opening of a high-speed communication with Scotland and Northern England, starting in 2026
The Minister for Transport, Barones Kramer, noted that the project would “unite Britain”.
Scotland's Minister for Transport, Keith Brown, said he was “adorned” of the prospect of working on the plan with the British Government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When the Second Stage is completed, lines will be held in Manchester and Lids.
In June, the Government reviewed the estimated value of high-speed line construction between London and Northern England from $32.7 to $42.6 billion.
The British Government, which negotiates with Transport Scotland, has ordered HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in the railway skills and reduce travel duration for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include an opportunity to overcome the way from Glasgo and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baronessa Kramer said: “Our aim for HS2 is to create a real national network that will bring Britain and its cities closer to each other.”
We're developing HS2 because the benefits that it will bring are huge.
Without it, we will face a crisis of skill in our railway network.
But it is also about transportation of cities to each other; 18 cities across Britain, including Glasgo and Edinburgh, will receive a better message by HS2.
Scotland Secretary Alister Carmichael added: “The announcement today is a good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scotland Government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support the integration of Scotland into the HS2.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed railway has all the chances of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland to a common argument for high-speed railway railway throughout Great Britain.”
We are therefore happy to work in partnership with the British Government to consider the options for the construction of high-speed railway in Scotland, the creation of benefits for all and the continuation of the Glazgo railway, Edinburgh, which the Scotland Government is already planning.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British ministers next year and the joint decision on the following steps.
Torius is a new hope for nuclear energy?
Governments throughout the world continue to think about how to ensure energy needs.
The combustion of hydrocarbons (here they are) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewed energy sources require large areas for generation.
The atomic energy is expensive without either but leaves a mass of expensive waste after it.
The scientists recently pointed attention to the torium - another radioactive element of the Mendeleeva system.
It meets around the world, and, as experts say, it does not leave waste to be stored for centuries.
Rules of use of electronic aircraft in Australia are still in force
The travellers of Australian airlines will also need to deactivate their plansheets and smartphones during the flight and landing, despite measures in the United States to mitigate the regulations on device data.
The Federal Aviation Management of the United States allowed American carriers to change their procedures in such a way that passengers could read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during the flight and landing provided that they remain in "Flight Mode".
The passengers can already do this during the majority of the flight, but many are irritating that they have no access to their electronic books during the flight and landing.
Australian carriers consider this decision that required US airlines to carry out a huge amount of work to meet new requirements, but indicated that they did not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Office also noted that they were considering this statement, but emphasized that limitations to the use of electronic aircraft in critical fly phases were still in Australia.
“The Office of the Security of Civil Aviation Flights currently has no special rules governing the use of electronic aircraft”, he said.
This issue is regulated by rules that require air carriers to ensure security at any time, and from passengers to comply with the safety rules provided by the crew members.
The Virgin company, which had already discussed with the Office of Aviation Safety of Civil Aviation to expand its entertainment system on board with Wi-Fi, was not opposed to change, but stated that it would follow the regulations.
“We would welcome the consideration of the Office of the Security of Civil Aviation Aviation Letters on the use of electronic devices, because we really believe that this will improve the quality of customers' services now when it is on our planes,” said the press secretary.
Qantas stated that the rules would be adhered to.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during the flight and landing, and we do not plan to change it soon," she said.
The provisions of FAU are extended to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly be carefully examining the decision of FAU and the reasons caused by it.
For the United States carriers, the impact of the decision will varies from airline to airline and depends on the age of their aviation park.
The carriers will have to prove that their aircraft have sustainability to radio interferences from mobile devices, as well as to review the benefits, training materials, manual and passenger instructions.
“After the airline checks and confirms the intervention of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as planches, electronic books and smartphones at any height,” said FAU.
In rare cases, the bad visibility of the crew will give guidance to passengers to disconnect their devices during landing.
Furthermore, according to the group ' s recommendation, more difficult devices should be placed under seats or in the upper baggage stations during the flight and landing.
The heads of Daguestan are heard in Cubana's notes of extremism
The football match between Angie and Cubany has come into a political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar and the Daguestan after the folks burned the Dagestan flag, and the Hymn of Cubana has sounded different.
The head of Daguestan, Ramazan Abdulatipov, invited the Republican parliamentarians on Thursday to appeal to the court, as the Hymn of the Krahnodar country appears to call for an international difference, in particular, to war with "basurmanans " .
Take the Hymn of the Krasnodar Land, which has been approved in 1995.
It's embarrassing, and no one's doing it.
"With thee in mind, as a mother of our own, for the enemy, for a basurman, we go to a death fight," for which such words should be recorded in a hymn, to consume one of those who believe in other believers," he expressed solidarity with the Abdulatype Chairman of the House of Hezri Shissaids.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now, the news from the ocean, which is from Syria, where, as we know today, Israel has been hit by Russian production missiles, which are reportedly designed to be Hezbolle.
Today, Syria has fulfilled the important condition to destroy its chemical weapons by 1 November.
This was made under the agreement reached by the mediation of Russia and allowed the United States not to carry out a military operation that they had succeeded in the summer.
More about the weapons and what this means to the Syrian President, our chief international correspondent Richard Angel will tell.
Washington stated that the Assad regime would be punished for this.
Over 1400 peaceful inhabitants, including hundreds of children, died of poisoning gas in August.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombs, but in the form of an agreement made by the friend of Asada, Vladimir Putin.
Syria will reject its chemical weapons by mid-year.
And today, it's important.
The Group of International Experts reported that Syria had withdrawn the alleged chemical production factories.
The longer term and difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and components.
As we understand, it's about a thousand tons.
Previously Washington said the days of Assad were counted.
I think Assad should leave.
The question isn't if that happens, but when it happens.
He's no longer legitimate and he's got to leave.
But Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are distinctive and badly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many are starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement was called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors were sentenced to the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself impressed a person prepared for cooperation.
Today, in Washington, US Ambassador in Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies from hunger, it is hardly easier for his mother to be killed by chemical weapons.
Assad's still holding up.
And turns the weapon into power.
The President of the RF established a separate Ministry of Building and PCH
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, created a new Ministry of Courier for Building and CCC, and invited his former Governor of the Ivanov region to head Michael Menu during his personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Men in the residence in Novo Oharevo, and I refused to head the new office.
The Press Secretary of Russia, Dmitri Peskov, explained that all the functions relating to construction and ZCH are transferred to the new Ministry of Minregion.
Michael Men, the son of the famous Orthodox Priest of Protoerea of Alexandra Me, completed the Moscow Institute for Oil of Gubkin.
Since 1995, his political career began -- he chose to the Moscow area's thoughts from the Sergeyevo-Posadian region, as a deputy of the State Doma, the first vice-premier of the Government of the Moscow, Vice-Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Mikhail Men was the Governor of the Ivanov area.
Lombard owners in Singapore are doing fine, while the middle class has difficulties.
In a lobby in the Bendemir Trade Centre in Singapore, Janani Amrthalinga puts a golden bracelet, ring and searches in order to pay his daughter's school training.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is invested there," said Mrs. Amrthalinga.
Although she earned S$3000 ($2400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family income is not sufficient, she says.
Indeed, the demand in various parts of South-Eastern Asia, where household debt increases, is that ValueMax, where it deals this week, became a third lobby registered on the Singapore Foundation.
The loan of jewelry products is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Ms. Amrthaling), but almost as cheap as unsupplied bank loans.
In Singapore, the lombards are usually estimated by an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, a little higher than 15.4 per cent offered in the United Overseas Bank, a local branch creditor in the same trade centre.
However, the lombards have the advantage that they do not require verification of credit capabilities or wage evidence and can issue loans faster than banks.
Therefore, millions of people throughout the region are turning into lobbyers because families feel pressure because of the increase in life and rapid increase in household debt and consumer debts.
After five years of sustainable growth followed by the global financial crisis and cheap credits under the free money-credit policy in developed economies, low and medium-income families are drawn into lobbys to compensate for reducing incomes to slow their economies.
This week, the Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, indicated an increase in the family credit shoulder, mainly due to the rise of mortgage, as a risk to Asian banks' creditability.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led this list from 80 per cent of GDP compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which had barely quit the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing reduction in exports and consumer demand.
“The point is that, with price increases, people in the middle and lower [income scale] will seek ways to fill their income wherever they can,” said Song Seng Woon, a CIMB economist, the Malaysia Bank.
The recorded high prices for gold in the past two years have increased the hurry that people put in their personal things because they use the opportunity to get money for their family decorations.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items established in 200 lombards of the public city are gold.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, let's put the gold chain on the grandmother and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest EasyMoney lambar operator observed the increase in the number of clients using its offices in recent months, up to 20 per cent.
The growth in the lombard business is that ValueMax, Bendemire office operator and 15 others in Singapore plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where he has four shops, but also outside Asia, said Yeah Lee Ching, Executive Director of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion of 60 per cent of the S$66 million that this week had taken as a result of the distribution of shares in Singapore's fund market.
While some creditors have criticized the fire for high interest rates, Ms. Yeah said that lombard did not only offer cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it also did not increase debt directly.
“Clients establish the objects they already own, and the monetization of personal assets does not increase household debt”, she said.
The foundation has a growing public recognition as a means to obtain short-term, secured funding.
And the lombards are not only the categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use the ValueMax offices, setting up gold slides or Rolex clocks, which can give up to 60 per cent of their purchase value in cash.
We see customers from all layers of society.
“They include rich persons who need to take money for a short time for commercial projects or investments or small businesses to overcome temporary cash difficulties”, said Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, the number of available medical institutions and their status is not important to the population but to the quality of medical assistance.
Implementation of the Tulian Health Advancement Programme for 2011-2013, the reorganization of our city's healthcare will enable the establishment of a optimum structure for the provision of health care to the population, including gynekological sick, pregnant and breeding.
Thus, after connecting with the garlic, there was a great opportunity to attract narrow specialists from the NGCB to consult pregnancy with various pathologies, to conduct additional surveys on the basis of the hospital.
During the modernization programme, the logistical and logistical base of the home has been significantly improved, a modern equipment corresponding to world standards has emerged.
Over these years, approximately 8 million rubles were allocated to capital renovations, and 112 units of equipment were acquired for 42 million rubles.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive post for the newborn.

Because of the development of telemedicine, the possibility of consulting gynekological patients, pregnant, birth women and newborn with district professionals was given.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechnians are arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been conducted since March of the year.
About 60 women complained about the Caucasians.

Saving package of $325 million for Tasmania
The Federal Government insists that a package of rescue measures of $325 million for Tasmania's weakened health system will be supplemented by strict conditions that guarantee that the Government will not spend the waste funds.
The Federal Minister for Health, Tanya Plibersek, announced that the Commonwealth ' s " urgent measures " to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the island state, a higher level of chronic disease and system restrictions.
The decision on funding for four years was adopted after the Government's consultations with the independent deputy of Tasmania, Andrew Wilke.
“The Government has proposed an emergency rescue package that, we believe, will address the specific problems facing the state”, stated today Ms. Plibersek.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for a plan-up company.
Another 2600 operations, including ortopedic and cataractic removal operations, will help to overcome retirement.
There are also money for hospitals taking patients without preliminary records in Hobart and Lonsestone to improve the quality of care after the stationary, medical training, mental health care services and the implementation of personal electronic medical cards in local hospitals.
“Those investments will go to the best doctors' implementation of the ideas of how to help Tasmania's health system better”, said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister urged the Government of Tasmania to work in a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will need to support current funding levels in order to receive funds from the Commonwealth and to report each month where it spends these additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the state is providing services as effectively as possible and effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilke said today that $325 million would not decide anything, "if there was no real reform that would put Tasmania's health system on a more sustainable basis."
Nevertheless, he commended the Government for replying to his request for urgent assistance, with which he first contacted the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the Federal Assistance Package will significantly contribute to the exclusion of the state's health system from critical state," said Mr. Wilky.
According to the Government, these additional electoral procedures have largely compensated for recent reductions.
But the Federal Health Opposition Representative, Peter Datton, believes that today's statement is a “decision, similar to a leucoplaster”.
“The reason for which we are here is that the Laborist Government has ejected $430 million from the health system,” he said to the ABC TV.
When the government takes off almost a half billion dollars and the Company invests 300 million, it cannot be pretending that it is good news.
Mr. Datton requested Ms. Plibersek to guarantee that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The screening of Gyom Nickle of Denny Didro's novel could be commended by exclusive fitting and historical details, but it was also more difficult to take it than it should have been.
The film in France, in the 1760s, tells the dark history of Susan, a young aristocrat, sent to the monastery of her family.
When it starts to rebel, it experiences extreme cruelty from the hands of the sadist and becomes an object of erotic fantasy for others.
The film never falls down to the fabric or sensation — and that's the problem.
Due to its serious celebration, the report risks to be a test like a wave and for the audience.
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons production, said the observer group
Syria destroyed the basic equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poisoning gas, the international observer group said on Thursday, while the severe collisions stood in the north of the country, not far from one of the facilities where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also, on Thursday, the Syrian group of activists stated that more than 120,000 have been killed since the start of civil war in the country almost three years ago.
The statement of the Organization on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The deadline of 1 November established in the Hague by the organization to destroy or “produce” all means of chemical weapons and mechanisms to mix chemicals with poison gas and fill them with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important scale in the ambitious graph that aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
Destroying equipment means Syria cannot produce new chemical weapons anymore.
Nevertheless, Damascu is yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
The country is believed to have about 1000 metric tonnes of chemicals and weapons, including sewage gas and nervo-paralytic gas, in particular.
This statement was made during a severe fight on Thursday in Safira, in which experts believed that the chemical weapons production object and its storage sites were reported in Britain by the Syrian Centre for Protection of Human Rights.
A group of activists who tracked losses through the Syrian network of activists said on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
The number was said to be 61,067 civilians, including 6365 children.
The Government said that 29,954 persons were members of the armed forces of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were pro-governmental warriors and 187 Lebanese warriors of Hezbolla.
Also among the victims, as stated in the statement, there were 2202 army convictors and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of them aliens.
According to the UN estimate of 25 July, 100,000 have died in a conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Asada's army fought in Safira for several weeks with rebels, many of whom were associated with Al-Qaeda.
The Centre stated that there were victims on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide specific data.
The fights emphasized the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors under the compressed term of their Syrian mission to rescue from the toxic arsenal in the midst of civil war.
The WHO statement, working closely with the United Nations, states that its team was “consumed now that it had verified and saw destroyed all the crucial products of production and equipment for mixing/free”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently being planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification by visiting 21 of the 23 objects declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two security seats, said the inspectors.
On Thursday, WHO stated that both places, according to Syria's statements, were “aborned and... subjects of the chemical weapons programme that were in them, moved to other places that have been verified”.
It was not possible immediately to determine whether the object in Safira was one of the two places that WHO Inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria presented a plan for the full destruction of its chemical weapons, which should be approved next month by the executive committee of the WHO.
"I welcome the courage and courage that you have all shown in the implementation of the most complex mission ever taken by this organization," said the Director-General of the Observer Group, Ahmet Uzumju, in the commentary published by the WHO.
For the third year, the civil war has faced rebels, mainly the Muslims, with the Government of Asada and its security forces, consisting of members of its sect of alabits, the reply of the Shiit Islam.
With regard to other developments, the head of the Centre of Rami Abdurahman said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in the SBI in the coastal province of Syria Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger for the objection to the organizers of the Bali terrorist.
The remaining alive and relatives of 202 who were killed as a result of the explosion of the bomb in Bali in 2002 responded angryly to the sentence issued to the last of the convictors before the court and claimed that Omar Patek should be shot.
The Dutch, who spent nearly 10 years running as one of the most searched people in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years of detention for his role in creating explosive devices used during the terrorist terrorist.
It may be released for 15 years if he receives a conditional release.
The 45-year-old defendant was recognized guilty of mass murders as a result of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, during which 202 people, including 88 Australians, were injured by dozens.
It was also found guilty of a number of other terrorist accusations, including the wave of the explosions of churches throughout Indonesia in the Christmas Canon in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a lifetime, although they could insist that a person called a "power" for his reputation of the master for the manufacture of explosives should be sentenced to death.
This decision accelerated the painful memories of the mother from Pert Jun Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the terror of the Patek and his associates nearly ten years ago.
She barely kept her tears, and she said Patek was to be sentenced to death.
"I really believe that he should follow the steps of other guys.
It must be before the shooting team," said Mrs. Cortin AAP.
“I must live every day, knowing that I will have no more grandchildren, and I will not see my daughters.”
The Sarah Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was launched in the parked van immediately after 11 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where the mortal terrorist exploded the bag made by the explosive, just 20 seconds earlier.
After that terror, he fell into a coma for a month and died three times, being connected to the lifecare system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the participation of three other members of the terrorist cell, Jemaa Islamia, responsible for the blood slaughter, — Amrozi, Muchlas and Mamma Sabble, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the most death penalty.
To save his life, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
To get 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds, it's not so much.
Patek is the last participant of the Bali terrorist in court.
It was hidden for almost ten years, but at the end of the time, he was detained in January 2011 in the Pakistanian city of Abbottabad, where the US troops killed the former head of Al-Qaida, Usamu ben Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent showed that the intelligence witnessed: Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in an attempt to restore the relationship between the terrorist groups of South-Eastern Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He did not give up," said Mrs. Cortin.
Until recently, he did not regret how much pain he had caused to others.
The sentence was issued at the 10th anniversary of the terror, which would be marked later this year in Bali and Australia.
“This year will be many tears”, said Mrs. Cortin.
The duck can still appeal to his sentence.
FAU: “The air passengers can now use aircraft (but not to call from the mobile phone)”
Aviation passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to speak on mobile phones, according to the long-expected new guidelines published in the Federal Aviation Management Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect the changes to take place immediately.
As such a change was made quickly, it would variete depending on the airline, said the FAU administrator Michael Werta at the press conference.
The airlines will have to show FAU how their planes meet the new guidelines and that they update their training tools for summer crew members and the regulations on the installation of devices to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already presented plans.
“We could endorse the expansion of electronic devices very soon,” said the FAU.
The passengers are currently obliged to turn off their smartphones, planes and other devices as soon as the door of the aircraft is closed.
They should not restart them until the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the captain will give 'good'.
The passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane falls down for landing and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
In accordance with new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic disturbances may allow passengers to use these devices during the flight, landing and management, FAU said.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft modified so that passengers could use Wi-Fi at large heights are expected to meet those criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Guides, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy will be securely implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve that), this will be an inadequate option," Gladying said.
We are sincerely tired of feeling “school jobs” when the issue comes to.
However, the Internet connection for surfing, exchange of emails, text messages or download of data will still be prohibited at less than 10,000 feet, the Agency reported.
The passengers will be invited to switch their smartphones, planes and other aircraft into a plane.
Thus, no word with friends is an intellectual online game that actor Alec Boldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when the case occurred: an actress was removed from the American Airlines aircraft for refusing to shut down the device while the plane was on the landing.
The harder devices, such as laptops, will still have to be placed in the baggage office, because they can trauma someone if they fly around the chamber.
Mobile phone calls will also be prohibited.
Regulatory powers on telephone calls belong to the Federal Communications Commission, not to FAU.
FAU may remove a ban on certain electronic devices during accommodation and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Transport Safety Council, National Transport Security Expert CBS News, said that mobile phones were still considered risky.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create navigation interferences, but thanks to the FCS we know that they can create mobile interferences when the plane is in the air”, said Rosenker.
The Industrial Advisory Committee established by FAU to examine the issue recommended last month that the Government allow for more broad use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on FAU has increased to reduce limitations to their use.
Critics, such as Missouri Clare McCaskil's senator, claim that there is no strong security cause for bans.
Conservation of restrictions is also increasingly difficult to ensure, since the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that until a third passengers forget or ignore the instructions to disconnect their devices.
FAU began to limit the use of electronic device passengers in 1966 in response to reports on navigation and communications equipment when passengers began to carry FM radio-receivers, high-tech gadgets at that time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and claimed by FAU as sustained to electronic disturbances.
Aviation companies are offering Wi-Fi to passengers for several years.
Aeroplanes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more sustainable to disturbance.
Most aircraft suppressing are adapted to broader use of electronic devices according to new guidelines, Werta said.
Today's electronic devices usually transmit radio signals much lower than previous generations of devices.
E-book reading devices, for example, only minimal signals in the review of pages.
But the signals become stronger when the devices load or send data.
Among those who seek to mitigate the use of electronic equipment passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company's representatives loaded a whole airline with their Kindle electronic books and flyed on it to verify the problems, but did not find them.
Members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings regarding whether the use of devices was a risk.
Douglas Kidd, from the National Aviation Assistance Association, stated that the distortions from devices were real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the Committee said that there were only individual communications from pilots that confirmed that the devices could create disturbances for aircraft, and most of these communications were very old.
Nevertheless, the Committee recommended that FAU allow pilots to require passengers to disconnect devices during landing equipment under limited visibility.
The group of representatives of the tourist industry welcomed these changes, calling them a reasonable step to meet passengers who are currently using many technological devices.
“We are glad that FAU recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with security and protection," said Roger Dou, Director-General of the United States Tourist Association.
Auto-schools will be able to conduct driver rights exams
The driver's examinations will be able to take private companies with their own computerised autodrome.
It is written by the Commissioner with reference to the draft decision of the Government on the authorization of vehicle management.
According to the newspaper, only about 30 such drones are currently in Russia.
Students of such " privileged" schools are expected to record internal test results.
The Gosavo Inspection will monitor the delivery of examinations every six months.
If more than 30 per cent of the theory examinations and more than 20 per cent of the field do not give up from the first time, such a school will be deprived of the privileges for six months.
Technical requirements for drones contained in the Government ' s draft decision shall enter into force from 5 November 2014.
The project also requires two-course driving.
From 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners for category A rights will have to conduct an examination in urban movement.
Furthermore, since 5 May 2014, companies would not be able to take foreign drivers to work with foreign rights.
Such workers will be required to receive Russian rights after the examination.
A bird transferred by air to a safe place from a storm installation in the North Sea is released back to wild nature
The bird flying air into the shore after it was found exhausted on the oil height in the North Sea, was released back into wild nature.
This water shelter was placed in the helicopter to Aberdin last month, and then was released by the Scotland Society for Prevention of Cruel Treatment (SPCA) in the rescue center in Haloa.
Colin Saddon, head of the centre, said: “This water sheep is probably a winter migrant from Northern Europe, who has fallen into the zone of strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently, the bird hanged up and found shelter on the oil hedge.
He added: “She was unable to fly again, so they called for help.”
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition until he was released.
Is Europe's elite ready to business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with an obligation to gather business representatives and to determine what changes the welfare and workplaces of Britain want to see in relations with the EU.
To this end, we ordered the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed over 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of business in Britain by size, sectors and regions.
Conclusions of the survey will be unexpected for many.
We have discovered that the overwhelming majority of enterprises are currently looking for export opportunities outside Europe, paying particular attention to countries that are modernizing and growing, while the EU countries are in a tranquility.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than waste time for a long and difficult process of reforming the confused EU institutions.
When they were asked about their views on specific political issues, from anti-monopoly regulation to production laws, most business leaders believed that the control of these key areas of competence should be restored to Westminster.
The general dissatisfaction was presented by the single market, and business representatives claimed that the costs of regulation from Brussels were now overcome the benefits of being in the trading zone of Europe, and even 40 per cent of the large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European companies.
The latest and most evidence is that our business managers' survey revealed that the obvious majority wishes that Britain take a course to change the treaty and relations with the EU based on trade rather than policy.
This result, which was observed among the enterprises of all sizes and largest business groups, shows that the business is insisting on a “sensitive change” that will bring powers back to Britain.
The rates are high - the achievement of changes in the treaty and more favourable conditions for Britain will ensure a 16 per cent voting to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not be doubted: this survey shows that the British business supports his plan to revise the conditions of membership of Great Britain in the EU.
It also indicates that the business expects that the revision will lead to a significant movement in the current balance of forces back to Britain.
The best conditions for the British business are possible and are increasingly necessary as the eurozone approaches a closer economic and financial unity.
The priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in Britain, and, as the results of our surveys show, for business, this means a strong focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels's regulatory activities.
United States Services listen to the Papa's personal phone
The activities of the Vatican are under a careful control of American specialities.
New documents from the collection of Edward Snowden indicated that the U.S. intelligence had been listening to all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and now he has a thorough care for Pope Francisco.
His phone started listening before he became the head of the Vatican.
The process of the new father's election was also monitored.
What was particularly important in the United States.
The specialist connected to the mobile phones of the cardinals that were gathered in Rome to choose another Pope.
There were also the phones of the residence where the conclave were living.
American spys were listening to all the main pretendents to the Pope's throne to prevent the appearance of the undesirable figures for Washington.
The Panorama magazine states that the “great ear of the United States” continued to take over the talks of the prelates until the conclave was completed on 12 March.
It is asserted that the Argentine Archbishop Bergolio has been appointed as the future of the Pope of Rome since 2005.
The American Intelligence also observed negotiations related to the elections of the new President of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine states that the United States Embassy continues to work with a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives receiving information on politics and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican reconciliatedly declared that it was not concerned with the American "powder", even if it was happening.
The U.S. leadership has no secrets to the holy fathers.
Snowbordist for the Olympic Monetary Special Photos
On Wednesday, the Russian Bank issued a memorial banknote devoted to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be passed by this winter.
Nominal banknotes - 100 rubles.
But bloggers are already actively ironised on the memory banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic monetary on 30 October, they noted that the picture of a snowboarder from the banknote was found in the photo banks.
In particular, in a free stockExchange stock, where this photograph was dated by 2005.
The same photograph is used in the lesson on the Photoshop published on the Russian Interview website on 18 January 2011.
Furthermore, it was already used for RugGear smartphone advertising.
The Olympic banknote was carried out in the blue blue gamma.
On the one hand, a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other, is the type of the Olympic Stadium and the Bird.
The author of the drafting of the banknote, Paul Bushuev, who won a contest among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts named Repina.
The presentation noted that several types of sports were dealt with -- mining, fristal and jumping from tramplin, but the snowboard was eventually chosen as it was relatively young sports.
According to the source of " Notifications " close to the CB, the regulator is not interested in the public's view of the widespread spread of the image of snowboarder from the Olympic Banknote and is currently studying the situation.
In Goznak, they are not too concerned about the noise around the Olympic banknote.
The Press Manager of the Service of Master Natalia Nikiforova stated " Notifications " , that all the reasons for the plagiat are funny.
The snowboarder of the banknotes turned to the right, on the photos in the network - left, - accurated Nikiforova.
A person on a photo session to create a monetary was taken off from different points, then a final picture was selected, a snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws were not circulated to the Olympic banknote since the artist received a job wage.
Experts believe that the discussion on the image on the Olympic Monetary is positive.
The recognition of the image on the banknote - plus for its promotion - considers the executive director of the NP " Rus Brand " Alexei Popovicev.
Proving the 100 per cent similarity of the portfolio images and in the photobanks is quite difficult, so the intellectual property claims against the image are unlikely to come.
The first Olympic banknote appeared in China to the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008, a memorial banknote was released in 10 Yuanas.
Russia decided to support this tradition.
Legislative bans forced the Russians to drink less beer
Russian beers have a bad mood.
They claim that the consumption of beer in the country in the future year will remain at the previous level, and that is best.
Although businessmen were initially counting on growth.
The current year is unsuccessful for them: sales have fallen by 7 per cent.
The chairman of one of the largest pivovar companies of the country, the President of the Council of the Russian Beerware Council, Isaac Shepps, at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute of Daily Requirement in Russia, which has just ended in Moscow.
It was discussed by the public market regulation.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already decreased by 18 per cent, since in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the management of the beer industry in production and trafficking of beer - a drink with a small alcohol - reported to the Sheps listeners.
In no country of the world there is such a severe restriction on the market of beer, unpredictable introduction of all new and new non-reasonable bans that are justified in allegedly combating alcohol abuse.
The beer visited that many legislative prohibitions to reduce alcohol abuse had no special influence, yet all new initiatives have been constantly encountered.
More than all of the beer producers have been hit by the prohibition to sell alcohol in the kiosk since this year.
"We lost 35,000 consumers immediately," said Isaac Sheps.
For the next year, beerwares have two predictions.
Optimistic is the one said by Sheps: sales of penny will remain at the previous level.
The pessimistic will fall by 2-3 per cent more.
In order to preserve their profits, businessmen are forced to leave the mass consumer's sorts to the "premium" class: the beer will be less, but it will cost more.
In the meantime, the radical consequences of the fall of sales with a small amount of spirt are not yet seen.
"I believe that the level of alcoholism remains approximately at the same level," said the doctor of Narcotics Alexei Stotnick.
True, the proportion of sick people who use surrogates of strong drinks, as well as those who have “spiro-containing tone drinks like Jaguar” has grown, while ten years ago prevailed by“ drinking” alcoholism.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford vehicle factory in Univolozsk.
As trade unions say, all fired have received compensation.
However, far more acute than workers' problems arise on the reduction of productivity in the region.
The Deputy of the District Zaxa Alexei Etmanov, at the meeting, said that some 600 people were reduced in the Ford Factory in Univološka.
He said that this had happened in September: then some 600 people left the factory on a voluntary release programme, which was developed together with the organization's trade union.
The workers who decided to quit on their own will were offered " gold parachutes " of several salaries.
Therefore, the overwhelming majority left their jobs on their own will.
However, according to Etmanov, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's a limit.
However, in the next two years, the authorities do not plan to adopt any programmes of support for areas of difficult enterprises," he explained, adding that the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction of jobs.
In Ford, this information is not objected or confirmed.
We're waiting for an answer from the company, and as soon as it appears, we'll have to publish it.
Discussions on the reduction of workers in the Ford factory in University have been a long time ago.
For example, 600 people have been known about the company's plans to fire in September.
The previous factory claimed the suspension of the production of cars.
For reasons, the factory called the fall of demand for the Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrost, after the nine months of 2013, industrial production in Lenoblasti decreased by 5.4 per cent.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, mobile cells can be used during the flight and landing of the plane
New rules for safe use of mobile devices during the elevatation and landing of the airline are approved in the United States, reports BBC.
The US airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and planchets throughout the entire flight, and new rules will begin to work by the end of 2013.
Nevertheless, the Internet connection for e-mail receipt and sending will be prohibited during flights below 3 miles.
Due to the danger of the disturbance of aircraft radio equipment, the hundreds of votes will continue to be prohibited.
Thus, passengers of aircraft will be allowed to read electronic books, play games on planchets and other gadgets and watch videos during internal and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be obliged to verify the safety of the use of electronic devices during flight.
Furthermore, airlines will have to convince the Federal Civil Aviation Management that they will be able to manage the suspective impact of aircraft mobile equipment and aircraft management tools.
According to the source, such as the United States, the current standards of use of electronic devices in flights will also be reviewed in Britain.
For the Russian Mafia in the United States, a new name, Brother Circle, has been finalized.
The black list of Russian mafia in America was filled with new names and four companies this week.
The Ministry of Finance has introduced three Russian representatives, two Uzbekistan citizens and the Israeli.
One of the Russians was a famous singer, Gregory Leps, who was suspected by the transfer of money to the group members.
However, 22 people involved in the “Bratian Circle” and six related organizations are in the black list of United States.
Nevertheless, many experts expressed doubts that such an organization existed.
“The Statement of the Brat Circle” is more likely to combine different criminal groups”, said earlier an expert on organized crime and professor of the University of New York, Mark Galleotti.
In his opinion, the Brother Circle reflects the popular perception of the Russian Mafia.
"I have not met anyone in the Russian law enforcement bodies or anywhere else to confirm the existence of such a criminal organization," the American Centre for Corruption and Organized Crime quoted Mr. Galeotti.
Mr. Galeotti also agrees with Professor of the University of George Mason Liz Shelly.
"If they act together, it is more like a criminal network but not an organization," the Centre for Corruption and Organized Crime said.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the Brother Circle was a majority of the nearest Russian thief in the law of Aslan Osoyan, known as Santa Hasan.
Criminal authority was killed in January this year.
Thus, the activities of Lasha Schushanashvili and Zechariah Kalashov, which filled the list in 2012, were closely linked to Grandpa Hasan, and another participant in the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was a nephew of Grandfather Hasan.
However, Mr. Galeotti noted that some individuals had no connection with Osoyan.
He believed that all of them were more common financial and criminal interests, such as drug supplies from Afghanistan.
In the meantime, the scandal around the inclusion of the Brother Circle, Gregory Leps, the favorite singer of Russia, Vladimir Putin, drew the attention of Kremlin.
Of course, we expect from our American colleagues to receive more detailed information, which has made such a decision, why it was brought to such lists," said the press secretary of the head of the State Dmitri Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of RF.
Just as the interests of all RF citizens, its interests will be protected.
Head of Gazprom Alexei Miller said that the pipeline in Bulgaria represents a new era in the gas field
The start of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria is the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said Chairman of Gazprom.
“Day has been a marked event: the construction of the Bulgarian gasproduct “South Stream”, the largest and important project in Europe,” said President of Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream is designed to diversify Russian export routes across Europe.
The Contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, in which most of the Russian gas gas is intended, increases the risk of ordinary routes, the officials say.
Miller stated that the direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been eliminated " forever " .
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream at a lower price, as soon as the entire project starts working in 2015.
Gazprom stated that construction should begin in other countries below the gas pipeline route by the end of the year.
The annual project skill capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA staff have been accused of sexual crimes before the charges against Jonathan Lord, as known by the Royal Commission
Two YMCA NSW officers were accused of sexual crimes against children before accusations against the childcare agency in Caringbach, Jonathan Lord, informed the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children in 2011.
However, the introductory statement of the Commission stated that “he had never dealt with cases of sexual violence against children within his organization”.
The Chief Executive Director Philip Hayer was asked about one case when the YMCA worker was accused of child pornography crimes, and the other case when the instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual crimes against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hayre told Gail Fernes, a lawyer assisting the Commission that he knew about the first case, but he didn't know the second.
He acknowledged that YMCA was also incorrect in the introductory speech for the Commission, claiming that “external YMCA checks were recognized as the first lines of YMCA for child safety”.
The reports submitted by the Commission indicated that YMCA was notified that it received the second of the four possible assessments from the quality audit carried out by the Department of Education and the communities in August.
Mr. Heir, who joined YMCA when he was 21, recognized that he and the lower leader had failed by hiring the Lord and could not provide a clear understanding of his staff ' s obligations relating to the violations of child security policies.
Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted of sexual crimes against 12 boys during two years of his work in YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr. Hair, however, rejected the assumption that the YMCA corporate ethics had prevented staff from reporting on the violations of the Lord in the field of child safety.
The workers testified that they had observed violations, including the fact that the Lord was alone with children, cared for them personally, put them on his knees, said he loved one of them and allowed them to play on his mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the leadership of the Lord and asked her to train her child protection because she was concerned about his behaviour, witnessed that Jackie Barnath, the Chief of Child Child of YMCA in Caringbach, who was the leader of the Lord, was “very scary and often difficult to access.”
The Executive Director said he did not accept the explanation of staff that they were uncomfortable to report the situation to their superior leaders.
Rather, he said that their friendship with the Lord led them to the thought of the need to report about him.
Mr. Heir said that he presented his view to the YMCA New South Wales Council that a lesson for the organization of " incident with Jonathan Lord" was not "referred to the provision of information" by staff members, and the Council agreed with it.
Mr. Heir said that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the appearance of charges was adopted by the Director-General of YMCA on Childcare, Liam Whitley.
He said that it was intended to prevent a broken number of evidence, but it was " overturned" and that decision had been badly implemented.
YMCA of the New South Wales was not safe for children during the work of Jonathan Lord during the period 2009-2011, informed the Commission of child planting, professor Steven Smallbone, from the University of Griffith.
He said there were " serious problems" in the collection, selection, instructions, training and control of staff.
The hearings were delayed until 20 December.
It's a fashion week in San Paulo.
It's not just a model, it's a real star.
Despite the fact that Giselle Bündschen had left a job for a while, distracting her motherhood, in these days and this week, she had arrived specially.
The absence of several months did not prevent her from retaining her place on the floor and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the most highly payable supermodel of the world.
This time she was participating in the Colchci mark.
The fashion week's final is usually the most interesting show.
It's like what the styleist Lino Villaventura organized.

Tony Blair said he would use the chance of returning as Prime Minister of Great Britain, but admitted that return was unlikely.
At the evening of an interview on the fifth anniversary of departure, a 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since he resigned in June 2007, after ten years as a leader, Blair significantly avoided the discussion of British policy, limiting the majority of his comments by foreign affairs and its role in the four Middle East peacekeepers.
Answering whether he would have returned to the Prime Minister, Blair, on the report of the London Evening Standard, said: “Yes, of course, but it would not happen, so...”
The Chief Coach of Milana Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret for no result in the 10th tour of the Italian championship of Lacio.
The expert also noted that failures at the start were caused by a series of injuries of leading players.
I'm so sorry that we didn't win it," the Tmw says Allegry.
The team played a nice match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first time, we didn't let Lacio do anything.
In the second, the Romans added, but in general, I can't say we lost our concentration.
I had to win.
In the past season, we met the championship in the League.
We are now out of schedule, but this is caused by a series of key football players.
Rammy and Honda?
They're very good players, with character.
However, our composition is still good.
Look at Cocoa, who held a high-level meeting.
The experts of consolidating activities moved to Cardiff to fight for the Year's Prize, knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready to show up three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a school student, just a few months before that, this kid with his shatland pony Toffy, had run through three tours to take the main prize, leaving 30 adults far behind.
The unseparated couple, the same growth, received high assessments for the appearance, behaviour and style of the annual contest, which is conducted by the Centre of Sannibank's horse sports in Radri city near Cardiff.
With a general view of the background of men and women in fine hats of cattles, he moved over his hat and was proud to spend a round of two-year-old Toffy.
The judges praised Fenton for his infantile ability to treat horses.
And Toffy received a higher assessment for his appearance and nature.
Fenton was given Toffy's third birthday in March last year, and since then he was working with the Shetland Pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, “Fenton and Toffy are making a great duet.”
They had a lot of rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a rose.
It was just his second talk with Toffy, and we were all excited when he won.
Completely unknown people in the arena considered it so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village, Nantiglo, near Abbe Vale in South Wales, is following his aunt Sharon Howels, who has been exposing horses for over 10 years.
Ms. Howels said: “All the audience was amazed, and everyone was crying for approval and screaming.”
He ran the sand all over the length of the arena and, although he looked so small, he did greatly.
Fenton is insane of animals — he loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
According to the beginning, he will soon be participating in the Loshadi of the Year, and I am sure that he will be doing well.
The representative of this annual horse exhibition said: “Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to treat his pony.”
They're a great team together.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and for their representation in the show ring.
They appreciate the conformity of the pony and the factory — Fenton and Toffy were best at the ring.
I'm sure Fenton helped his attractive dress, and he really looked well in his role.
Published invitation to the Chinese newspaper "reorganization"
The Chinese newspaper, issued on the first page of the call for release of the accused reporter ' s defense, should be reorganized, reports the press regulator.
The New Express issued in Guanchjou has made an unexpected public statement with a request for the release of journalist Chen Jungjou.
However, Mr. Chang subsequently admitted on the television that he took bribes for writing false articles on a public property company.
The New Express should now take place in the “process of the full correction of errors”, as the regulator reports.
The order for "fixing errors" came from the Guandun Press and Publishment, Radio, Cinema and Television.
The preliminary investigation showed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group issued several false reports on the Zoomlion market market from September 2012 to August 2013.
The “New Express Manual” was dezoriented”, said the regulator ' s statement.
He noted that it was decided to “propose administrative request to Chen Jungjou in the form of revocation of his reporting licence”.
He also “instructed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a full correction of errors in the New Expression and recommended that it investigate the situation of the responsible persons of the newspaper and to amend immediately the Guidelines of the New Express.”
Mr. Chang wrote several articles for the New Express, in which he claimed financial violations in the workshop equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two calls for his release on the first page, saying that it supports his journalism.
But Mr. Chang then appeared on a public television with recognition that he had published false articles for money.
“In that case, I have damaged Zoomlion, as well as the whole media industry and its ability to deserve public confidence”, he said to the CCTV public newsletter.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and glory.
I realized my guilt.
After Mr. Chen's confession, the New Express issued apologies on the first line, saying that the newspaper was unable to properly verify his reporting.
Recently, several high suspects have confessed on television.
Experts say that the practice of recognition in China remains widespread, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities to force anyone to self-consult.
U.S. Tunnel Detected — Mexico for drug traffic equipped with its own railway
One of the most complicated drug smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical railway systems.
The U.S. authorities described this tunnel at four feet wide as one of the most complicated secret movements they have ever discovered.
This zigzag tunnel, whose length is almost six football fields, ties stores near the city of Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (U.S.
This area is filled with unacceptable warehouses, which facilitates the concealed load of drugs in trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs, as the authorities said, had been transmitted unanimously through it.
According to judicial documents, law enforcement officers confiscated eight and a half tonnes of marihuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men who, according to lawguards, have been charged with marijuana and cocaine for dissemination.
In the case of conviction, imprisonment is threatened from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use large underground drenaging channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage found in San Diego since 2006.
Several largest tunnels have been discovered in Central Mexico after the harvest of marijuana in October, which has set the challenge of the cartels to quickly deliver their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of approximately 700 yards, equipped by railways, which went from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tihuana to two San Diego warehouses.

The British Police shall provide an extradition notification to Assanj
Today, the British police have notified the issue of the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, who hid in the embassy of Ecuador in London, and asked for asylum.
In Scotland Yard, they stated that they had supplied the 40-year-old Australian “official requirement to surrender” with a requirement to appear to the police station, adding that if this requirement was not met, he would continue to be arrested.
Assanju was threatened to extradite to Sweden for sexual offences after he exhausted his possibilities in accordance with the British law when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal to extradition earlier this month.
fearing that Stockholm will deliver it to the United States, he hid in the embassy of Ecuador in London on 19 June, requested that South American country of political asylum.
Scotland Yard "supplied a 40-year-old man an official requirement to surrender, which obligates him to arrive at the police station at the day and time at our election," said the press secretary.
It continues to violate the conditions of exemption under a bail.
The embassy refused to comment on the reporting of the police.
Assanj fears that it will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to make possible charges for spying after the publication of more than 250,000 American diplomatic deposits on the contrary to the WikiLeaks website.
A driver traveling at a speed of 130 miles per hour with hot drink between his legs is punished by 1,000 pounds
The car was punished on 1,000 pounds for driving up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between the feet.
35-year-old Andrew Howie from Tiptry, Essex, was observed by his Mercedes Benz on the road A120 in Braintry on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink for his legs.
In the world court, Colchester Howie recognized the charge of driving without due consideration and attention.
The addendum to its driver's seven penalty certificate resulted in a six-month ban on driving.
Howe also pledged to pay the costs of $90 and an additional collection for the assistance of victims of crime of $1100.
The tax for foreign real estate owners will lead to the londonian bubble
The penalty has carried out a preliminary assessment of capital tax measures, but awaits the final decision of Mr. Osborn, who in the 2012 budget introduced a State departure rate of 7 per cent for houses worth more than 2 million pounds and annual payments for buyers who decide to own houses in society rather than as physical persons.
At this point, the household's real estate in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which amounted to 708 million pounds in the financial year 2012/13, has already exceeded the total amount in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, North-West, Yorkshire and Hamber.
Mr. Cook stated: “After the increase of the household and the introduction of the related legislation against relief, it is very difficult to claim that the tax of expensive real estate is declined, regardless of the impact of the old municipal tax system.”
"But this may lead to some foreign investors who will not be willing to buy real estate in London or its current owners will not want to sell it," he added.
The value of the first-class real estate, the upper of 5 to 10 per cent of the housing market, in the rich south-western zone of London, which is extended from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by 11.8 per cent in the past year.
According to the research of Savils, prices in London continued to demonstrate a sustainable increase of 5.6% in the annual calculation, but they were eclipsed by the active “free market” with the inflammation of South-West prices in the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) of the city.
Scientists have made light on how the tail movements of the dog are linked to its mood.
Earlier studies showed that the satisfied dogs swing their tails to the right hand (the dog’s view), while the alarmed dogs waving their tail primarily to the left.
But now scientists say that other dog family members can observe these thin differences in tailing and react to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, neurobiologist from Trent University, said: “It is well known that people have the left and right sides of the brain differently involved in the formation of incentives that cause positive or negative emotions.”
This is where we tried to look at this in other types.
He added that as human, dogs have the right part of the brain controlled the left side of the body, and two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the diversity of tails of other dogs, researchers observed animals when they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the frequency of beating animals and analyzed their behaviour.
Perhaps soon we will understand why their tails are sometimes headed to one direction and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed dog videos with dogs, either naturalistic versions, or forcet, to get rid of any other distortive factors, and we could manipulate tail movements and tails more to the left or to the right.”
When the animals saw that in the rest of the dog was moving the tail to the right (willing the tail of the dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that their tail was slonging on the left, their heartbeat was involved and they seemed anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think the dogs were intentionally communicated with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dogs have learned from their experience of what movements they should be concerned and what they do not.
He notes: “If there are several meetings with other dogs and the frequent tails are related to more friendly behaviour, and the right side gives less friendly behaviour, the dog responds on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give to the owners, veterinarians and dressers a deeper understanding of the emotions of their animal.
The dog conduct expert John Bradshaw, an invitated scientific officer at the University of Bristol veterinary school, said that this was not the first study to verify whether the left and right dogs were relevant.
Last year, a group of scientists from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads left if they look at the aggressive dog, and on the right, if they look at a happy dog.
In another scientific work of the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “The dogs were more frequently approaching a dog of robots when the tail was left and not the right instead of getting anxious, the opposite behavior against the Italian study.”
He said that differences could be because dogs in various studies were not fully perceived by animals in movies or robots as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs react to these dogs, he explained.
“Although there are sufficient evidence that two brain hemispheres are used for different purposes, many details are still to be clarified and dogs are not exceptional”, he said.
However, taking into account the easiness that can be registered, we may soon understand why their tails are sometimes directed to one direction and sometimes to the other.

Pope Francis will call the first cardinals in February
Pope Francisk will bring new cardinals to the Catholic Church for the first time in his service on 22 February, as announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are the ones choosing the popes, so that France will appoint its first group of people who will eventually participate in the choice of his successor.
There is now 201 cardinal.
However, after the 80-year-old cardinal, he could no longer participate in the papal elections — the prerogative of the 120 " cardinal electrocutors " .
The press secretary of Vatican, Father Federico Lombardi, announced that before the san ceremony, the meeting of all current cardinals known as Constorius would be held.
“Papa Francisk decided to report earlier its decision to convey a conspiratory in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with the participation of cardinals from various corners of the world,” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero from the Catholic Voices Organization said that by February the number of voters would probably fall.
He said that the father usually calls as many cardinals as needed to reinstate the number of cardinals up to 120 and as many cardinals aged 80 years old as he wishes.
The consolidation will be of great importance in the next year, because it will be the first since the election of France in March this year, according to Valero.
At present there is a kind of prediction for Europe and especially for Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope of Cardinals from other regions of the world will be appointed to restore balance”, he noted.
In South America, 40 per cent of the Catholics live, but they are represented by a low number of cardinals.
These will also be the first selected cardinals since the formation of the Council of Cardinals by France, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, which is assigned to search for ways of reforming the church.
In the past, Dad made his own decision.
"Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that “all the possibilities” were to be approached by France to the cardinals for the council.
But we were not in such a situation before — all of this for us for the first time.
Valero said that the popes were usually posted as the Cardinal of Bishops from large incomes, but Frances was “a lot of surprises — so we don't know who he will call.”
GM revokes a number of new trucks in the United States to improve the backs of the seats
General Motors Co withdraws nearly 19,000 new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra models in 2014 to address the problems with manual control of the backs of the seats, as submitted on Friday by the U.S. regulatory authorities in the field of safety of the vehicle.
In some of the trucks, the front seats may have a defect in the rear slope mechanism.
As a result, the back of the seats does not meet the federal safety standards for the heads.
“When the car hits behind, the chief may not properly protect the driver and passengers by increasing the risk of injury,” states the National Administration for Road Safety website.
Revoked models were produced from 1 August to 10 September.
The release of GM Picaps began in June and was the most important launch of a car in serial production for the leading American autoproducer since its restructuring because of the bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the trucks about the defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration was unable to consider the notification of the owners of the 16-day termination of the Government ' s work, which reduced the increase in sales of vehicles in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were modernized for the 2014 model series, increased about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, as said by GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Picaps Silverado and 16,503 Picapa Sierra.
The GM shares on the New York fund market on Friday daily increased by 1.4 per cent to $37.47.
The screaming of the desperate voter of Obama
I voted for President Obama twice, dividing the hope of change
He said that Obama allowed the obstructionism of the Republicans to make no commendable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot be justified by the problem with the web site reformed by the Obama health system, drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memories are a sad reminder of what could be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student of the Second Medical Faculty of the Harvard University.
I read a terrible sad book these days.
I thought that this book would encourage me at the second class of the medical faculty, and it would restore my hope.
It is called "The Resistance to Win", and it is memoaries of the 2008 presidential campaign of Barak Obama.
When I end up writing reports on my patients tonight and laying in bed, this book brings me back when the politics inspired millions of people, and the speeches could be accompanied by spirit.
The election victory was exciting, and the leading news programmes took a break to reflect this historical moment.
My classmates cried from joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could only find.
A young team of strategies had to come to the White House, and the people were ready to change.
During the entry of Obama in 2008, its level of support was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
Return is a rough awakening, such as the exhaustion of the dream.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism — they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of the missing opportunities.
In the years that have passed since I left my first electoral bulletin, the changes have really happened.
That was what I couldn't imagine.
I give Obama the responsibility for his great and diversity achievements, from the adoption of the law on accessible medical assistance before the conclusion of our military from Iraq, the rule “Do Not Ask, Do Not Say”, the murder of Usama ben Laden.
Furthermore, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, public health choice and the closure of the base in Guantanamo among others.
But after a countless number of times when I was on the side of Obama's administration, protecting her from colleagues and classmates, I have ended up explaining that I can provide.
I've reached the point of political desperation.
The obstructionism of the Republicans cannot explain the authorization of auspices of foreign leaders or attacks by droneless children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the privacy of Americans by the National Security Agency or the persecution of exposers who disclose the wrong acts of the Government.
It cannot explain the murder of an American citizen, Anvar al-Avlaka, without court or investigation or non-compliance with the limits of public financing and expenditure during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of the report that the efforts made by the White House to make the media silent are “the most aggressive... since the administration of Nikson”.
And recently, he could not justify that it was not able to develop a simple web site for more than three years after the signing of the Law on Available Medical Assistance.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Should I be 18 years old to realize that leadership may contradict political campaigns that precede?
Apparently, the electoral position is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be formed by the opposition political party and accidental events such as the Newtown beating.
Nevertheless, all of the examples I have listed above showed that they were a large extent of their own choice of administration.
And that's what bothers me most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm about his candidacy.
The Mitt Romni was an incomprehensible and rude alternative, and it seemed to be unable to decide on its own policy or views.
I believed that, within my second period, Obama would justify the hopes that we have heard for so long.
However, when Obama was lower than 45% this week, returning to 2008 through this book was much more difficult.
This makes me miss many promises that have passed away.
This week, I read the part of the book that described how Clinton caused Obama a deaf defeat in the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At an analysis of the causes of failure, he told his staff that they should return to their normal goals and remain true.
“ I want us to regain our attraction, ” he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment belong only to Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Deputy Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in care for the child.
The Deputy Miliarder Clive Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest in care for the child because his daughters could be pregnant and benefited from this.
This mining magnate, which has an unresolved tax dispute of carbon emissions of $6 million, made this statement while he tried to avoid whether he had a conflict.
The Joint Party of Palmer can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial in the adoption of a decision on the cancellation of carbon taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could only have the ministers, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally win from political measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to a paying leave for the child, because if any of these daughters are pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they will get vacation or not," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the elections, the electoral commission officially announced Mr. Palmer as a winner in the fight against the Sanshine Cost electoral district Ferfax with 53 votes after the listing of votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a revision of the procedure for the summary of votes in elections to accelerate the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott Francis and Bridget.
Should a decision on these elections be taken two months after we voted?
“We need to have a more perfect system,” he said.
Why should we not have such a system that we can come, enter our data into the computer, vote immediately and get the results at 18:30 the same night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils for labelling in bullets.
Is that because they can delete the result if someone doesn't like it?
Use the pencil in our day seems strange.
The electoral Commission is examining e-voting opportunities and has recently published a joint discussion document with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his programme included an international airport for Sanschine Cost, and he would be " very serious" to treat his new work.
The State post provides for the service of society.
"We are not seeking any rewards but the gratitude of history for being able to serve this district at a critical moment," he said.
RBS removes two currency traders
The Royal Scotland Bank has temporaryly removed two traders from the work of its Monetary Operations Division, according to the information of two people familiar with the situation, which is another confirmation that the global verification of the regulations of alleged manipulation on the currency market is rapidly accumulated.
Some of the largest world banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperated with regulators in investigations related to the largest financial market in the world, a daily traffic of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS staff removed during the deployment of the investigation, which is revoked with a scandal related to manipulation with the liBOR interbank rate.
Having refused to comment on the withdrawals, the Bank confirmed that this month it received requests for information from the regulatory authorities.
“Our current investigation is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with FCA and other regulators," said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the informed persons said that the RBS had transmitted e-mail records and immediate messages received and sent by its former trader governing the British Authority, the Finance Control Office (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, quit RBS in 2010 and, as far as he knows, has been given leave to his current post of the European Monetary Trade Manager in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trades in Citi, left on holiday this week, while Matt Gardiner, former senior monetary trader in Barclays and UBS, was removed from work by the Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any violations.
Mr. Asher's immediate communications group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to informed persons.
The UBS Bank reported this week that it had taken measures against some of its staff after the Swiss regulator Finma said that it was investigating alleged manipulation on the currency market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six governing bodies in the world — the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antimonopoly Authority, the Ministry of Justice of the United States and the Hong Kong Monetary Management — are considering allegations that bankers had entered an agreement to affect the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal checks or have received requests from regulatory authorities to provide information known to the situation of the person.
Banks are looking for immediate communications and e-mails for several years in search of offences.
In recent years, the news of the verification has been incorporated by traders, one of the largest income sources of investment banks, which, however, has been faced with difficulties because the low volatility of the currency reduces the favourable opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation, saying that the broad and high-level currency market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that it is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the abundance of daily trades in the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the broader use of their internal platforms means that “you can start affecting the market at a very small price”.
This news came on the same day when the Credit Suisse Bank announced that one of its traders had fired the London market funds in the end of the last week, after the losses of almost $6 million.
The Bank immediately informed the relevant authorities and cooperates with its regulators.
“We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the issue was able to be localized”, said Credit Suisse.
The Supreme Court supported the Obama Health Law
The United States Supreme Court today decided that the Mark Act of Barak Obama on Health is a constitutional, which is the great victory of Obama's administration.
Following votes 5 to 4, the judges decided that individual orders under the law on the protection of patients and accessible health requirements for citizens to acquire medical insurance before 2014 or pay fines are constitutional in accordance with the powers of the Government on taxation.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined four more liberal members of the court, while judges of Sculia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The Court also left the remaining sections of this 2700-party law, and further decided that the requirement of the health law to enhance compliance with the Medicaid requirements, otherwise they would lose all federal funding of the Medicaid programme, was not unconstitutionally forced.
26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business have been filed by the law on the blocking of the draft law.
Each of the substantive candidate of the Republic has been decisively acting against the law during the 2012 primary election season, including the alleged candidate of Mit Romney.
Football is the cause of a difference?
In the State of the Open Tribunal, policies and experts discussed how to maintain national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals, it was also that no football in the Northern Caucasus, because this game is scandals and diversity.
Sergei Narishkin reminded of recent developments in Burulevo and said that policies and media should be correct in expressions to reduce " social tensions " in order to reduce social tensions.
He must have meant a recent scandal with Vladimir Girinovski, who threatened to surround Caucasus with a thick line if they weren't going to limit birth...
All speakers also spoke of measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries and on measures to harmonize relations between peoples in Russia, which contributed to the discussions.
Maxim Gregoryev stated that the events in Buruleve were a "modern conflict that could be predicted" but "we have too many people and instances" and that seven babysitters had no eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe has practiced for migrants for a long time, according to the public, has failed, and must be searched for its way.
Historian Yuri Petrov gave great hopes for a new united book of history.
"It is still necessary to create a country's history tool so that schools in Tatarstan know what people live in Daguestan, and on the contrary," he said.
Gennadius Zuganov has proposed criminal responsibility for the "creditment calls for Russia: "If in the United States you say radio that you should be given to Alaska Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years of prison!"
Vladimir Girinovski was very trying not to burn.
As usual, he accused journalists of all that have suffered from ill and sharp national problems to the public discussion: “It is not enough to say in the dust of debate!”
The Leader of the only Russian fraction, Vladimir Vasilev, immediately advised journalists to conclude the paper and to negotiate discussions carefully, and then the same commitments could take on themselves and policies.
We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration and a general order, said Mr. Vasilev.
As an example, he set out a law which lays responsibility for international peace in their territory.
But Lumila Andriqiko did not share the admiration of the law: there was no " clear idea of what migrant adaptation, its mechanisms and limits were.
So the subjects will treat the amount of these powers differently.
Furthermore, the municipalities have no staff necessary to address so complex issues, no funds, and the methodical recommendations they could use are not given to the centre...
The Head of the Review Committee on National Affairs, Gajimet Safaraliev, proposed a special department called “The Ministry of National Security”, which would address national policy issues.
However, Valerius Tishkov, who was headed by the same department, later abolished, was opposed.
It's enough to have a special person at the federal level, a "minister without a wallet" to be addressed if anything.
"We go around the edge, the missiles rip together, and it is very important for representatives of various ethnos and religions to speak together against provocations, and this work must receive valuable information support," said the representative of the RPC on connections with the universe Chaplin society.
None of the State's neutrality regarding dangerous ideologies, including religious, should be, in his opinion.
Here, Oleg Neilov introduced a discussion in the unexpected way: "The more talented people than in Chechnane or Daguestan, we still need to look for them, but they are pushed in the wrong way, wrong way," he said.
"It's the wrong road" is football development, "It's the football player beating the whole crowd, the flags burn, the companions rock each other...
Maybe we don't need that football?
There's another kind of sport -- the regby is called...
"They will not be equal in the world in such a sport!" said the arrival.
No one's going to play the ragby on Kavkaz!
You're still going to offer them the Kerling!
You need to know the national characteristics, it's like a load of Zaporožec to offer...
In Yaroslava, the moscow club representatives were divorced by wild behaviour in the tribunals, during the game with the local club.
Football will have to be banned all over the country...
The Chief of the RFS Disciplinary Committee, Arthur Gregorianz, reported that Kuban was punished by 500,000 rubles, transmitted by the S.E. correspondent Philip PAPENKOV from the Football House.
Such sanctions against the Red Club are applied for the flag of Daguestan by the chefs at the tribunal during the 14th home game against Angie.
At the meeting were representatives of both clubs, a person from RFPL.
We've been exploring all the materials available.
For the inadequate behaviour of the Kuban viewers, there are 500,000 rubles.
Against Google, Samsung, Huawei Patent Courts
A group owned by thousands of former patents, Nortel, filed a series of patent suits on mobile phone producers on Thursday, including the Google company, which was priced for the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Consortion of Rockstar, which purchased $4.5 billion of Nortel's patent, filed a complaint on the violation of patent rights in the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is shared in Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of seven patent violations.
These patents include technologies that help compare the key words of search on the Internet with their advertising, the claim states that Google's search business is the basis.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not available and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones working on the Google Android operating operating system, which compete violently with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered a original price of $900 million for the patents of Nortel.
Google has raised the proposed price several times, eventually offering $4.4 billion.
Having lost the case of the Nortel Consortion of Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12,5 billion, and partially the Motorola Patent Library was partially determining in that deal.
“Despite the failure to acquire auction patents of auction, Google has violated and continues to violates them”, states the judicial court.
Rockstar requires a higher reimbursement of Google losses, as he claims that the violation of the pathetic rights by Google is deliberate, according to the claim.
In Egypt, the first freely elected President oaths
Muhammad Mursey swears, but the day of his celebration would hardly mark the end of the political fight in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Mursey promised “new Egypt” when he sweared, became the first freely elected president of the country, changing Hosney Mubarak, who was thrown away 16 months ago.
At its inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursey also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab Peace and the fifth head of the State in Egypt after the monarchy was screwed about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before 18 judges in black coats in a court building on the Neil shore, built in the style of the ancient Egyptian temple.
“We strive for a better future, new Egypt and the second republic,” Mursey said during the solemn ceremony showed on public television.
“Day, the Egyptian people have established the foundations of a new life — absolute freedom, true democracy and stability”, said Mursey, 60-year-old American education engineer from the Brothers Muslimman, a fundamentalist group, most of its 84 years of existence, which was prohibited by an organization which served as a target for strong actions of the other Governments.
The building was protected by hundreds of soldiers and policemen when Mursey arrived with a small cottage shortly after 11 a.m. in local time.
Only a few hundred members gathered at the court building to welcome the new president, and, unlike the President's pump of Mubaraka's time, the movement was stopped for a short time to pass its autocolon on the usual live road, which connected the city to the southern hills.
While Mursey was ridiculed as a non-harismic “reserve wheel” of the Brothers, his personal prestige grew sharply since his victory and Friday speech, in which he tried to represent himself as a candidate not only of Islamic but also of all those who wished to bring the rebellion to the end of 2011 against the authoritary Mubarac.
"Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern State," Mursey said, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, judges in a surrounded wooden hall panel, where he oathed.
Later, Mursey went to the University of Cairo, where he had to speak his inauguration speech.
He was officially accompanied by a military orchestra who performed a state hymne, during which he stood at the standing “smirely”.
There was a military officer of the Feldmarchal Hussein Tantavi.
His arrival was met by the Army and the people, one hand, which was scanded by hundreds of people gathered in the university's main lecture room.
In 1908, the Cairo University of Islamic Student Universities in 1970 became a supplier of the Islamic Student Groups.
Mursey took a symbolic oath on Friday at the Tahrir Square, where the rebellion that completed the Mubarak's authority last year was born, and promised to return the powers of the President who had been deprived of the military council of the deprived leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court, rather than before Parliament, he has done the will of the military, and it is a sign that the fight for power will continue.
Mursey's speech on the Tahrir Square was filled with populist theatre gestures.
A further meeting of the Tumenian Manufacturing Association was held on the basis of the Yalutorov motor factory.
The presentation of a new line on the production of electrical pipes from the steel was made in the framework of the event.
As the commercial director Dennis Grybanov said, a marketing study on the marketing of permanent constructions in the Tumen area was conducted in 2011.
It was clear that the region consumed more than 50,000 tonnes of electric tubes per month.
After that, a decision was taken to change the fabric profile and installation of equipment for their production.
More than 7,000 tons of production have already been loaded this year.
Investments in the factory amounted to more than 120 million rub-lays,” said Dennis Grybanov.
A new state has been launched in October, which allows to increase the assortiment.
The factory produces both a small profile of a pipe that is used for the tangible ownership, small forms of construction and in furniture and large for the construction industry.
We are planning to make 50,000 tonnes of production a year, which would be about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen area.
Despite the transition to another kind of activity, the number of employees in the company has not decreased - now it is 157 people, planned to buy new equipment - increased staff by more than 50 employees.
The company is being re-trained, and the necessary professionals are collected from the already available.
The next year is planned to introduce a new long-range aggregate has become a thickness of up to five millimeters, which will reduce the supplies of the product, as well as another state, with the speed of production of the pipe to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, companies will be earmarked for the production of pipes used in housing and housing.
The management of the enterprise is a challenge to close up to 70 per cent of the Tumenian needs in this product.
The Deputy Director of Investment Policy Department, Leonid Ostroumov, in turn to producers, advised us to give greater attention to modernizing machinery enterprises.
This is also the form of public support for industry, which includes the reimbursement of the interest rates on credit for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of the leasing.
For the current year, 150 million rubles are allocated for these purposes, two thirds of that amount have already been spent.
The last Commission to consider subsidiary treaties shall adopt documents from enterprises until 15 November.
Furthermore, the budget is compensated for the participation of local producers in international shops.
For the next year, the budget provides 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate lising payments and credits for acquisition of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to the shops, 3 million for energy saving programmes.
To 72 million rubles of reimbursement of the procurement and payable equipment in the southern Tumen area for the oil complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumm, this form of support would be ceased in the prospect of, as the motivation of its introduction was to compensate the tax on the acquisition of useful digging, which oil companies paid in the area budget.
At present, they do not do so and grants become direct expenditure obligations of the region.
In view of this, the Government considers the priority of direct support for industrial enterprises, rather than the financing of the oil industry through them.
The assistance of the budget will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the situation in relation to oils.
The purchased equipment is a competitive advantage of the South Tumen industry, and it will be difficult to compete at the price of the average Russian lane, where the workforce is cheaper.
Furthermore, there is no question with the benefit of the new TNC-VR owner, the Rosneft company, which has not yet placed its orders in the Tumen businesses.
The Uwath Project Agreement expires in 2013, and no prolongation was made.
Southern areas specialized in oil-sector equipment are currently unable to form a purse purse for the next year.
The question remains whether taxes from Oil gained in the Uwath region will be made to the budget of the region or will be paid at the place of registration of a new owner of the seats.
Tomic will work 240 hours for the extremist film in the social network
The Lenin District Court of Tomska sentenced to 240 hours of the compulsory work of the city, which placed videos of extremist direction in the social network, RIA News reported on Friday by the press service of the district court.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man placed a video on his website in the popular social network, which was made into the federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case on the UKF " Actions aimed at engaging hatred and enmity, as well as the degradation of human dignity, has been committed publicly."
" The Lenin District Court considered this case in particular and recognised a man guilty of committing the above crime, imposed a fine of 240 hours of mandatory work," said the interviewer of the Agency.
She added that a man fully admitted his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians the price of goods after the signing of the Association with the European Union
Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nikolai Azarov, is convinced that the prices in the country will fall significantly after the country signs the Association Agreement with the European Union.
He stated that in communication with the readers of his website on Facebook.
I can definitely say that the prices are determined by a large number of factors, including the taxes.
Thus, after the signing of the Agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Zone, the level of customs e-mails to import goods from the EU will significantly decrease.
And that would mean that prices should also be reduced.
"This is about the goods that come from the EU countries," Azarov wrote.
With regard to other goods, the impact of the price agreement will not be so direct, but will be focused.
However, there should be no increase in prices.
Therefore, reports on billboards, which have recently appeared enough in our country, that the EU association is a price growth, it's not exactly that, or, more specifically, it's not that way," Azarov summarized.
Investigators are checking information on child abuse in Bisk
On 29 October, the media issued a report that a child's industries in the city of Biska had locked the child in the basement.
Investigators are currently able to find out all the circumstances and legally assess the activities of the children's garden staff.
After the accusation of a foolish bite, Eugenea Vasiljeva spoke
Eugenia Vasiljeva, who has been attached to a person nearly a year to the media, has never commented on the numerous publications in the press both of the kidnappings in the Minobron and its personal relations with the former Defence Minister Anatolio Serdukov, its poetry and its dependency on valuable things.
However, on 1 November, the Obrononservis case figurer violated the silence.
In the interview of Life News Vasiljeva, "Of course, it was one of the goals: to draw from me any negative information about the former Defence Minister."
There was a blackmail that I had to testify, or I was put in jail.
These threats have stopped for today.
Then we go to court, prove our innocence.
We are 100 per cent confident in winning.
The interview concludes that most of the words of Vassille were given to her that she had no interest in her taste.
The statement of the CF official Vladimir Markin was likely to be made that the collection of images collected by the Obrononservis case had been found.
Among the arrested property is a number of pictures that the master was confident in her deep knowledge of art.
However, the artistic expertise appointed by investigators after the arrest of these images has found that they have no artistic value and, simply speaking, are cheap counterfeits," Markin noted at the beginning of October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defense...
Then they admitted that they weren't stolen from Minobron, and they said I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
I think it's just a mess," said Vasileva.
On the question of whether she recognized her guilt in a 12th of her criminal episodes, Vasileva stated: "No, of course not.
There's nothing to admit.
Furthermore, there is no damage to the Russian Federation.
They're just misleading people, that's all.
Furthermore, in response to today's CF statement that Vasilev was avoiding examining criminal materials, a figure attorney stated that he and his client "does not let him know the materials of the case."
What has resulted in the discoveries of Vasille's domestic arrest, not yet communicated with the press?
Perhaps how could a woman not answer the accusation of bad taste?
Or did the Comsomolki journalist's rights claim that she "faced into a more large trans under house arrest" due to the reconciliation of Anatolia Serdukov and his wife and his return to the family's lono?
A famous military viewer "CP" Victor Baranese in his article "Serjukov returned to his wife?" wrote, "The followers do not exclude that after such a shock, she may be more interviewable in interrogations."
Previously, Vasiljeva had taken some charges of illicit sale of the real estate of the Mino-Defense.
The winter troubles.
What should be done in the garden before the start of frozening
In the fall, it is better to choose med-containing medicinal products, such as the 1% bordoic mixture or Abiga-Pik, Oxychom, Ordan, etc.
Do you think the tournaments have gone through the Internet?
The Flight Centre seems to have a reverse trend.
The company has updated its profit forecast for a full year and expects record income from vacation in Australia and Britain.
This tourist company now expects its substantial full annual profits before taxation to $325 to $340 million, compared to the previous projection of $305 to $315 million.
If current orientations are achieved, this will increase from 12 to 17 per cent compared to the record profits of $290.4 million received in 2011/2012.
Director Graham Turner said that the Flight Centre received 8 per cent of its profits in the first half of the year and started the second half-year with good indicators, especially on weekly visits in Australia and Britain.
“In the beginning of the year, we are working with profits in our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to have a record profit for the full year until the estimate of interest and tax contributions,” he said.
“Australia and Britain are in this way, which usually bring us the biggest profits.”
In Australia, long-term business was recovered, compensating a few weaker internal markets of corporate travels.
Similarly, in Britain, Flight Centre's business went well, while corporate clients spent less.
Her business in the United States compensated the losses suffered during the seasonally weak first half of the year, and the profits are expected for the third full year in a sequence.
Yesterday Flight Centre shares grew 3 cents to $38.20.
On October 31, barnaul police identified two game halls.

UMVD of Russia on Barnaul reported that administrative materials were made under the article “Illegal Organization and the conduct of gambling”.
Technically taken.
The materials on the facts will soon be addressed to the courts of the Industrial and Lenin regions of the city.
In Ekaterinburg, the criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Ekaterinburg, the police are searching for a criminal who had a violent dispute with two sisters.
They burned their bodies after the murder.
As reported by the New Region in the press service of the IURD RF on the Sweddlov area, the Ural capital in the Kyrov district of the triple-room house found bodies of two women with signs of violent death.
Soon the persons of the dead were established.
It turns out that these are sisters, one of them is the resident of Ekaterinburg for 44 years, the second is the 33-year-old inhabitant of the Orenburg area.
The burning apartment was taken off a few days ago.
His investigation was under personal control by the chief police region Mikhail Brodin.
Internal authorities have performed various murder versions, checking the alibis of previously convicted citizens and those inclined to such acts.
Furthermore, the purpose for which women took off their apartment and where they lived before than they had been working with whom they were.
Schools called for greater attention to math, spelling and grammar
The school courses of English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, the novel of the 19th century, romantic poetry and modern British art literature since 1914.
The examination will also be presented with “external texts” to encourage more wider reading.
The common course of English literature and language will be cancelled.
Since 2015, the students will be obliged to conduct a separate examination in language, with the urgency of selecting English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education should issue tomorrow new training programmes on English and mathematics — the first subjects to a radical review.
It will make changes to other main items next year.
A separate regulatory body in the field of tests of OFQUAL will present the revised structure of high-school graduation examinations, with a new evaluation system and less than a course of work.
During the summer, the Minister of Education, Michael Houv, said that it was “to reach a broad consensus that we should reform our examination system to restore public confidence”, insisting that school exams would be“ more complex, more ambitious and more strict”.
Studies show that English schools have less time in mathematics (116 hours per year, or three hours a week), than in most countries.
In comparison, Australian schools are given on average 143 hours a year, and in Singapore, there are approximately 138 hours.
While the formal requirement for no longer time in the mathematics schedule would be available, the sources in the coalition said that large school graduation mathematics examinations, combined with a higher rate in the rating table, would likely be an incentive to provide additional education schools on this subject.
Training will focus more on “real life tasks”, including financial mathematics.

Dmitri Medvedev: GDP growth rates are insufficient for State development
Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev considers that the GDP growth rate is insufficient for RF and is sure that the situation can be improved by simplifying business loans and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, reports Reuters.
We planned GDP growth in the area of 3% this year, perhaps a little more.
It's going to be less than 2% real.
In the background of the recession in a number of countries of Europe, it seems not very bad, but it is not very small for us, because the economic base is not as powerful as a whole of a number of countries, and in general, there must be higher rates in order to develop.
It is now very important that Russian companies, Russian business, receive normal credits at a normal price, are the first thing that must be done," the head of the Government stressed.

Travel in dirt, rivers and jungles to provide free medical assistance
Dr. George Bwelle provides free medical assistance in the rural area in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team have been conducting almost every weekend, taking hundreds of patients
In this West African country, not so many doctors — only one per 5000 people
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. George Bwelle is one of the 10 main heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of the other 10 main heroes to become the hero of CNN.
This person will receive $250,000 for continuing its outstanding work.
During 21 years, George Bwelle saw his father returning to life and again falling into unconscious condition, walking through hospitals that were not equipped properly to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaunde, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken hand, but the infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that reminded of himself for the rest of his life.
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, ” said George Bwelle.
If we had the money, we would have taken him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwellle had been accompanied by his father for years in full clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could receive.
“ It's hard, ” said Bwelle.
- You can leave the house at 5 a.m., run to the hospital to be first, but you're not the first.
A lot of patients.
Some may die because of what they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Father Bwelle ended in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, in Cameroon, only one doctor per 5000 people.
In comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413.
And even if the camonuans were able to turn to a doctor, many of them would not have been in the pocket.
Two of the five people in this country live under poverty, and almost three quarters of health costs are private.
“Their only problem is poverty, ” said Bwelle.
“And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy their life.”
Seeing his father’s suffering and many of his companions, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. George Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and worked as a judicial surgeon at Yaunde Central Hospital.
It also established a non-commercial organization of ASCOVIME, which organizes travel to the rural area on weekends to provide free medical assistance.
Since 2008, he and his volunteers have assisted almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, and up to 30 people are loaded in vans, tied to roofs and traveled across the cross-border area to visit village aid.
They don't always have luck.
Many of them had to push cars through rivers and dirt.
But when they arrived, they are met as real heroes: it is a holiday with songs and dances and best rooms that locals can offer.
The free health care in these villages is indeed a cause for the celebration, and Bwelle with its wide smile and unlimited energy is more than happy to join entertainment.
The next morning, the brigade starts taking hundreds of patients.
"We take 500 people in each trip," said Bwelle.
They come from all over the county in a radius of 60 miles from the village, and they come walking.
Each of these exit clinic provides variety of medical services.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can receive bowls, glasses, or free birth certificates — documents necessary for schools that many poor families simply cannot afford.
At the evening, the brigade performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually conducted in school, municipality or house; patients are rising and going to the after-operation zone to release the place for the next person.
Using a generator to light the equipment, Bvelle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
This is an intense rate, but the aim of the brigade is usually helping to support rural musicians.
"They beat the drums all night so we can stay awake and continue to work," said Bwelle.
On Sunday, members of the brigade return to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, comprising Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations last year, and they know that their assistance may be of great importance to those whom they assist.
One person explained that a free mushroom treatment operation would allow him to work again.
“ This will change the future for me and my family, ” said the man.
In addition to these clinical receptions on weekends and work at the hospital, surgeon Bwell also works at private medical clinics around Yaunda at night.
This second work, he said, provides 60 per cent of the financing of his non-commercial organization; the other funds are covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's asleep," said Cathy O'Malley, student of the second class of Dreksel University in Philadelphia, volunteer in Bwell Group.
He's always either in the hospital, or he's trying to earn money for the organization so that these campaigns can be continued.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, who arrived from the United States and Europe to join Bwell in carrying out his tasks, it is an opportunity for practices that they would never receive at home.
“We have been able to assist in operations where we were helping to remove blood dots or to hold tools for Dr. Bwelle,” O'Malley said.
As a second-class student, you would never have received that opportunity in America.
Students volunteers usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicines.
But when they arrived in Yaunda, their food, transport and training paid Bwelle.
"He is a hero, no doubt," O'Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is indefinite.
For Bwelle, almost the continuous loading of work is not a difficult test.
Helping others to live happily, to fulfill the promise given to their father is what brings him great joy.
“ I am so happy to do this job, ” said Bwelle.
- And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he can see what I'm doing.
I'm doing it to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME site and see how you can help.
Snowden agreed to testify about Merkel's surveillance
The bundestag representative of Hans-Christian Strebelle met Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the interview, the question was whether Snowden could be interrogated as a witness by the FRG prosecutor on the possibility of a telephone of the German Chancellor by United States specialist.
Snowden expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could be held either in Moscow or Germany.
He made it clear, said Hans-Christian Strabelle, that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Kit Alexander blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, first, it is necessary to clearly determine all the conditions of his arrival.
Meanwhile, American legislators began to take measures in response to the scandal around the United States spy programmes.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved yesterday a bill containing additional restrictions on the activities of the American Electronic Intelligence Department.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in the development and promotion of relations in all areas and areas.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Mackey, said to the journalists at the press conference on the meeting with the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ahmet Davutoglu, reported BELTA.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarus and Turkish relations in all areas and areas.
Belarus is also interested in this, so we agreed that the public governance bodies of the two countries would provide universal assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts," said Vladimir Mackey.
He emphasized that the Government of Belarus would create all the necessary conditions for this and make maximum assistance.
The Minister also reported that the Ankara held the next eighth meeting of the Belarus-Turkey joint intergovernmental economic commission, which resulted in the protocol.
The Parties have developed a road map of the Belarus-Turkey interaction, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy department, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade and investment areas, in industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, as well as in search for new forms and directions of interaction.
"The Protocol of the past meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented because Belarus and Turkey are treated as reliable partners," he said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, reported that the negotiations of the heads of the two foreign departments of the two countries had decided to continue to develop mutual collaboration and implement various projects.
The commodity between Belarus and Turkey, according to the Minister, should be increased and brought to a billion-year indicator.
Turkey is also an important partner in the field of investment cooperation, which needs to be developed further, since there is unuse capacity in that area, he believes.
Our countries have always had a very warm relationship, and we hope that they will further be strengthened and expanded.
As well as all the necessary conditions for trade and economic links and the successful work of Turkish companies in Belarus and the Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey will be established," said Ahmet Davutoglu.
Obama refused to speak on health
Among the storms of criticism, President Obama went up to his often repeated, unanimous promise that “if you like your medical insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people have received notifications of the cessation of services from their providers, the Republicans have recently criticized the president for misleading the American society.
Yesterday, Obama made some of his original public promise.
“The majority of people with medical insurance that works can preserve it,” he said in his statement in Boston.
With regard to what he called “renewal in news” on the cease-of-service, Obama called on those who received these notifications to find other options on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain best, integrated health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than they were predicted.
"You will receive more favourable conditions," he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the people who buy insurance themselves could be forced to change their plans because their coverage was not in accordance with the new standards required in accordance with the law on accessible medical assistance.
"Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve better," Sibelius said in the statement to the Energy and Trade Committee of Representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, who coercises the implementation of the Law on Available Medical Assistance, said that the launch of the Internet sales area was "very bad" since October.
“ I'm upset and upset just like everyone else, ” she said.
“I really want to regain your trust.”
The irritated Sibellius defended the phrase caught by the microphone that was sitting behind her associate at yesterday's hearings in the chamber after hot debates with a member of the Chamber of representatives of Billy Long, the Republican from the State of Missouri, on whether it is obliged to enter Obama's health programme itself.
After more than three hours of hearing, the Long urged Sibellius to say why the “architect” of the Law on Available Medical Assistance has not voluntarily denied the insurance financed by the Government for acquisition of a plan through HealthCare.gov, which it has now imposed to millions of Americans.
Rosbalt has deprived the status of the media for non-censorous defence
On 31 October, Mosgorsud decided to acknowledge the incorrect license on the registration of the Rosbalt Agency, " says Lenta.
In deprivation of the media status agency, Roscomnadzer insisted on systematic and gross violations of the media law.
During the process, an unpleasant precedent was established: the court considered it possible to close the media, in fact rejecting the issue in the right to contrarument.
What's "Rosbalt"
The Rosbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In subsequent years, the Agency opened the second main office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has missions in the countries of the former SSSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has been developing and functioning as a federal information and analytical agency.
By mid-2000, the agency included the most recognized private media in Russia.
Rosbalt had always been a very specific nish: the Agency ' s exclusive publications (and still comprised) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement bodies.
Discussions on the closeness of the publication of force structures continued throughout the existence of the agency.
Furthermore, Rosbalt had a wide range of sources in various offices, such as the project headed by Natalia Chaplin, the wife of Victor Churches.
The role of Chaplina in the Rosbaltom leadership is not clear until the end: it is often called “the project manager”.
The Director-General of the Agency is Laris Afonin, chief editor Nikolai Ulianov.
Recently, Rosbalt has not been in the federal media ratings, neither by quotation nor by the audience.
In October, the agency took the 25th seat in the rating of the Russian media website on the version of LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the median audience of the Rosbalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 views), the monthly monthly is about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the past five months -- notes of Kremlin's helplessness in relation to Ukraine, the death of the King and Shooting team, the funerals in the capital of Birule.
The Rosbalta conflict with Roscomnadzor began in July 2013, when the media law had been amended, which prohibited journalists from non-censorous defence.
The news revealed a banned lecture in two published videos (Jigit from Rednodar and Pussy Riot distorted oil shops) on the website.
The following parties describe differently.
The Rocome Supervisor, based on discovered video materials, accused Rosbalt of a gross and systematic violation of the media law and requested the Agency to take the licence.
The Rosbalt stated that the claims of the agency were inadequate: first, the films were not editing materials, secondly, their mother's words were masked and, thirdly, immediately after the warning of the film were removed from the site.
The representatives of the Agency appealed to Roscomnadzor's claims in the world court, and when Mosgorud adopted a Roskomnadzor suit on 22 October 2013, the complaints continued to be reviewed.
However, 25 of the world judge had not decided for “Rosbalt”: the chief editor Nikolay Ulianov was recognized guilty of violations of the Administrative Crimes Code and punished by 20,000 rubles - 10,000 for each film.
Apparently, this had prescribed the outcome of the hearing in Mosgorsud, if you rejected the thought that the outcome could have been imposed before.
The Court decided on 31 October to acknowledge the incorrect registration of Rosbalt, in fact deprived the media status agency.
We can't say that Rossbalt was alone during this opposition.
The Agency supported the Deputies of the State (Annex Alexandr Jarov, head of Roscomnadzor, signed 26 delegates on 10 October; the document itself was submitted under the Initiative of the CPRF).
The closure of the publication was stated by the head of the Russian Union of journalists, the university of Goddans, the President of the Moscow Union of journalists, Paul Gusev, and the Chairman of the Presidential Human Rights Council, Michael Fedotov.
Furthermore, Goddanov said that the leadership of the Roscomnadzor had even provided him with some guarantees that the license would not come before the license was withdrawn.
The Court of Justice of Rosbalt has shown that under whose jurisdiction the media in Russia is more secure today is a major issue.
Syria destroyed the haemorrhaging equipment
Syria has destroyed all the powers declared in the production of chemical weapons, acknowledged the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament, Damascus, was completed on the day before the deadline was established.
By 1 November, Syria had to destroy the production and other subsidiary facilities intended for the preparation of combating poisonants for use, transmitted by Bi-bi-si.
The destruction of poisoning substances themselves or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of the OCHO, poisonants are currently in sealed warehouses.
International inspectors sent to Syria after more than 1,400 people died in Damascus on 21 August during the chemical attack, according to the United States.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste their time - not to allow Syrian authorities to produce more chemicals - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition equipment.
These production powers will now be monitored carefully in order to prevent them from repairing.
The following vacation is the middle of November: by now, the OCHO and Syrians should agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of already existing poisoning substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where are they going to be destroyed?
Who will provide for this equipment?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by Western intelligence.
They will be willing to advise the inspectors of new verification facilities if they have reasons to suspect that Damascus is not completely explicit.
The United States believed that the shooting had been carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insists that this is the case of Syrian rebels.
The world community required Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached by Russia, to destroy or bring all the powers to the production of gas and liquids and to fill these substances.
Now that this phase is over, the next step should be the destruction of the already available in the Syrian army of chemistry.
It is estimated that there may be more than 1000 tons of nerve-paralytic poisoning substances, each sewage gas and other prohibited chemicals stored in several dozens of different places.
For its destruction, it is necessary that the OCHO and Syrian authorities agree on the action schedule for two weeks.
The Chief of Field Operations of CHO Jerry Smith stated that his inspectors "see the destruction of equipment."
"They have no possibility of further production or mixing chemical weapons," he said.
The WHO declaration states that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and made sure that the plants for the production of shells and poisoning substances were either destroyed or destructed.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to conduct inspection there, the document states, but the equipment was transported and verified by the SHO experts.
Smith said that the process of destruction of the haemorrhea infrastructure was " particularly difficult" because it had to work in the ongoing conflict.
At the beginning of October, WHO received the Nobel Peace Prize, however, Smith said that the time to celebrate it was time for inspectors until they were found to be too busy.
John Carrie said in his unprecedented confession that the United States spy “is gone unlikely far”
John Kerry demonstrated the mitigation of the protection of United States monitoring programmes by making an unprecedented recognition that in some cases the United States spying has “as far away.”
The Secretary also recognized that it was guilty, along with Barack Obama, that he was on the autopilot during a loud discovery of Edward Snowden on the spies of the NSA.
These information leaks put the United States Government into the centre of the diplomatic scandal with its allies.
On a video link at the open Government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “No doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the Government, have actually accepted some of the things that were happening on the autopilot because such opportunities had already existed — both during World War II, and in the very difficult years of the cold war, and of course, on 11 September.”
He then became the first high-level member of the Government of the United States, acknowledging that the United States spying had gone too far, but stressed that none of the rights had been violated.
He said: “In some cases it went unlikely far.
And the President is determined to put light on the issue and explain itself to people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there are no abuses against innocent people in this process."
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted from good motives and that his monitoring operations saved many lives.
He added: “We work in a new world where people are ready to explode themselves.
There is radical extremism in the world, unreasonable and determined to kill people, explode people and attack Governments.
What if you were able to take this over, stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, explosions of buildings and murders, because we have been able to find out about these plans in advance."
Meanwhile, US legislators will be engaged in Europe to help address issues related to the estimated United States spying abroad and to convince the Europeans to continue joint anti-terrorism activities with the United States, said on Thursday the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs.
Senator from the Connecticut state, Chris Murphy, said that he had been interviewing with members of the European Parliament and other persons this week and concerned about their threats to cease their participation in anti-terrorism organizations because of the disappointment in the surveillance of the National Security Agency.
“For the interests of national security of the United States, it is really important that the Europeans remain our participants with regard to our common anti-terrorism efforts,” said the democrat Murphy, who serves as the first time and is the chairman of the subcommittee of the Senate on European Affairs, in the Washington interview.
“I go to Europe to enable them to understand that we must continue to cooperate in the field of counter-terrorism, despite their anger on these NSA programmes.”
The news that the NSA collected millions of telephone calls in Europe has deteriorated relations with some United States allies, although the head of the Agency said this week that they were incorrect and reflected the lack of understanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the United States.
Other disclosures included documents published by Snowden showing that NSA monitored the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, protected spy activities against allies as necessary and said that it was a common case on both sides.
In the background of that noise, Murphy said that his office would organize a visit to the members of the Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and the two chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be reproduced in the coming days.
He said that the journey programme was still on the stage of development.
While Murphy stated that the journey was aimed at promoting relations, he said that some of the “good motives” would also be manifested.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in what spy programmes they used for many years.
“While we can change our monitoring programmes in order to better protect the rights of the Europeans, they should also agree that we are not the only ones who are engaged in intelligence”, said Murphy.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry should go to the Middle East and Poland on the challenges of hostility in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as intelligence activities of the United States.
In new compositions of public observer commissions, the impact of prisoners will increase
Today, the Board of the Public Chamber (OP) may approve new compositions of public monitoring commissions (UNC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If a voted option is adopted, rape lobbyists will increase their impact.
UNK is public structures that control the conditions of deprivation.
The cases of Sergei Magnetic and Leonid Rozjayeva, the worries in the colony in Colony of Copies - through the UNCC are advertising most of the resonance events behind the retirement.
Fight between human rights defenders and rape lobbists is under way for the control of UNC.
At the meeting of the ODP working group on the formation of UNCC, I proposed to make a criterion for selecting human rights experiences.
"It was not accepted and made lists without making criteria," said Valerius Borszev.
Borschev is the current President of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers - the universal Russian human rights defenders in prison.
As a deputy of the State of Apple, he developed a law governing the activities of UNCC.
The OP Council should vote for the composition of UNC in 43 regions of the country.
In 1800 vacancy sites, less than thousands are claimed, and in Ingushetia and Cabardino-Balcaria no competition was able to organize because of the absence of candidates.
The OP promises to organize vacant seats.
UNCC of Moscow is one of the few commissions with a competition, despite the new composition of 40 participants instead of 20.
According to Borschev, the current capital commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 forces, and the option at the vote in the OP changes the ratio by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to go to the capital commission.
However, a new composition could be reinstated by the representative of the Battle Brotherhood, Viceslav Kalinin.
He was a member of UNCC for three years, but he never visited prisoners.
Borschev believes that by appointing its chairman of UNC, forces would be able to make the work of human rights defenders untolerable, so human rights defenders did not exclude a collective exit from the Commission.
They believe that the promotion of forces is coordinated by member of UNCC, Anton Cvetkov, head of the " Russian officers " - an organization involving the interests of the Force Departments.
"I don't eat infants outside the tape," said the RBK daily Anton Cvetkov.
He denied that he lobbed the promotion of any lists and said that he would not interfere with human rights defenders to visit arrested opponents.
According to Cvetkov, he was not even interested in what list they voted at the OP.
The dissemination of the Borchev information he considers to be a form of pressure.
Possible success of human rights defenders is a planned change in the leadership of the CELABINE.
Her former leaders will be removed due to last year's troubling.
The Public Chamber concluded that the leadership of the local commission had ignored the problems of prisoners.
The UNK Rostova-Don can move from human rights defenders to rape.
From the new lists, the Chairman of Human Rights Chairperson of the Local Commission, but one of its opponents was found, despite the dismissal of the Federal Public Chamber for non-ethical conduct in May 2013.
The lists of the Moscow and Rapid Commissions of Borschev consider " a place for Kopeisk".
The exhibition of Tolokonnic Hope did not affect the UNK Mordovia ' s " force " , and only one human rights defender wanted to come into a new competency and had not even accepted competitive documents.
A member of the OP Board, Nikolai Swanides, told the RBK daily, voted against the proposed list, as it was disturbed by the situation in Moscow and Rostove on Don.
He sent his position to other members of the Council.
His colleague on OP Paul Gusev said that he voted for, as he liked the proposed Moscow list.
The compilation of UNCC lists was coordinated by the Deputy Secretary of OP Vladislav Grib, also a staff member of the FSIN Research Institute.
The mushroom told RBC daily that it did not consider the right to share candidates into human rights defenders and forces and not agree that the chairpersons of the commissions had sufficient powers to interfere with the work of its members.
The mushroom cannot predict the outcome of the vote of the OP Board.
If the proposed list is rejected today, the modified option will be made in the coming days of the vote.
Australian woman appeals against the prison term in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days of prison on the Phucket Island for false claim that she was attacked by a taxiist, appealed to a sentence and was released under a bail.
Stevie Rochel Bamford was initially recognized on 15 June by the Phucket Provincial Court as guilty of false investigation after the communication of the Thailand police that the local taxiist had attacked on Sunday on 10 June, while two other men held her.
However, the video cameras later revealed that she returned to her hotel safely after the breakdown of relations with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phouket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricing this story.
It was held in local police cells before the court.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-hour prison in the centre of the general regime in the area of Phucketa, not in a female prison for adults.
She is a daughter of the former player of the Australian League of Peter Tanx, who has contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “excessively concerned ” about the well-being of her daughter and was waiting for her return to Australia.
"It was obviously anxious time, but we hope that it will be safely home as soon as possible," Tanks said.
Bamford filed an appeal to her sentence and was released in a bail of 50,000 bats.
According to the reports in Australia, she is currently on vacation in the Krabi court zone in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford is currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to the increase of her sentence for up to two years and force her to stay in prison for adults.
However, after the recent murder of the Australian tournament Michel Smith in Phuket Thailand, it may also seek to restore its ruined tourism image, leading to an justified sentence.
Roman Senchin is now in Paris at the presentation of his novel Eltisheva, translated into French.
Recall, this is his novel that became the finalist of four prizes: "Bright Pole", "Russian Bucker", "National Bestseler" and "The Great Book".
Last year, a writer for this book was granted the prize of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is an undoubted leader of the generation of current thirty-year and 40-year-old prozaics.
Almost every publication of its rigid, constructed on the modern life material of stories and reports causes hot disputes among critics of the various directions.
It can be claimed that the joint articles on the prose and publicity of Senchina, its reviews and journal publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the end of the 1990s before the beginning of 2010.
The discussions on the works of “one of the most controversial modern writers”, according to the criticism of Sergei Chuprinin, mainly refer to the understanding of its participants under the word “literature” as they see the present and future not only of our words but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not include most articles and reviews from regional media and blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are generally given in the reduction in sections “Abzaci...”
