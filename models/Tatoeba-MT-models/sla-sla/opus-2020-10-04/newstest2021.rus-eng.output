Semilar v. Prosecutor: Cassation of the former Vice-Mer Tartu will be considered on 4 August
This means that the decision will probably be made at the beginning of September.
The courts of the two first instances to examine the case of Semilarska refused, but in April, the State Court adopted a complaint on the proceedings.
The Tartu Administrative Court returned a complaint to the complainant on 12 December 2019, since its authorization was not part of his jurisdiction of the administrative court.
The court's decision indicated that the complaint requires reimbursement of the damage caused during criminal production.
“The prosecutors and the departure court should regulate such matters”, explained earlier to the ERR press secretary of the Tartu vessels, Anett Kreitsmann.
She said that Valvo Semilarski appealed to this decision in the district court, which on 5 February did not change the court's decision of the first instance.
Now his word will have to be said by the Lord.
According to the Defencer Semilarski, jury lawyer Oliver Neess, his client had been unfoundedly suspected of bribes for about two years.
He now demands that the prosecutor reject the false allegations in his own address and repay the moral damage.
The prosecutor's statements on the special cases of the Lyuna District Prosecutor, Margus Gross, were caused in October 2017, when Semilarski, along with the other, was detained under suspicion of several crimes.
"Recall that when I was detained, the security and prosecution police immediately organized the press conference and informed the entire Estonian Republic that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most powerful local self-government bodies, were sold.
These public suspicions hanging in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now, when these allegations and suspicions were false, the prosecutor did not want to say anything about it," Similarski commented at the beginning of August 2019.
According to Oliver Neess, the prosecutor was outside the legal framework at the press conference, in which the prosecutor should act.
"Affirmation of lifting and corruption has proved false, but it is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, repeatedly emphasized in its rulings on Russia and in Lithuania that, at the stage of the investigation, the representatives of States should be cautious with the choice of words that suspects would not be presented in the role of criminals before the sentence.
The prosecutor is also obliged by the presumption of innocence, which was unfortunately not followed in this case against Valvo Semilarsky," said Nees.
“The public representation of Semilarka as a serious offender and bribery in circumstances where the facts under the suspicion of bribe are still revealed is unacceptable, which contradicts the presumption of innocence and injustice against the complainant”, added the lawyer.
As rus.err.ee wrote, the former Deputy Mayor Tarta Valvo Semilarski would not be responsible for bribery charges; the criminal proceedings against him were partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official was charged with a conscious violation of anti-corruption legislation in deals in particular large.
According to the prosecution, from 2015 to 2017, the former Deputy Mayor Tartu participated more than thirty times in the urban office meetings in decisions related to the firms operating in Tarta, with owners or leaders whose Semilarski was actively communicated at the personal level at the outer time.
According to Gross, in all of these cases, Semilarska had personal interests, and he had to be removed from the decision-making.
Previously, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor had issued Semilar suspicions of the receipt and violation of anti-corruption legislation in deals in particular large.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained with another Deputy Mayor Artem Suvorov, Central Party.
The Prosecutor and the Security Police then stated that there were strong evidence against both the mayors.
The two officials were then retired.
The case of Suvorov came later to a court which fully justified the policy.
The investigation on the case of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.

How the Economy will affect the decision of the CB to reduce the key rate
The Russian bank is expected to relieve the key rate.
It declined by 0.25 per cent, to 4.25 per cent of the year, a formally regular historic minimum.
In view of the return of the short reduction of the rate, as well as the tone of the CB statements and the updated projections on the Russian economy, the regulator views the economic perspectives more optimistic than before.
This means that the current loan-credit mitigation cycle could soon be stopped.
“We continued to mitigate money-credit policies, primarily in view of the still risks of inflation down from 4 per cent in 2021," said the head of the Russian Bank, Elvir Nabulin.
They are associated with a significant reduction in economic activity, internal and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, according to Nabulina, will take over a half a year.
It noted, however, that after the discontinuation of the constraints, economic processes were recovered: renewed energy consumption, consumer and investment demand, construction and emission of consumer goods, the annual reduction in transport, the production.
According to the CB accuracy forecast, in 2020 the reduction of the economy would be 4.5 to 5.5 per cent (up to 4 to 6 per cent), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 would be 3.5-4.5 per cent, in 2022 to 2.5 per cent.
Furthermore, the Russian Bank reviewed an annual oil price forecast up to $38 and 40 for Urals barrel in 2020 and 2021 accordingly.
Previously, the CB expected $27 and 35 for a barrel.
Finally, the Russian Inflation Bank project for 2020 was 3.7-4.2 per cent against previously expected 3.8-4.8 per cent.
The view of the Bank of Russia on the situation in the economy becomes more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the mitigation cycle, the economists for Russia and the CNG " Renesans of Capital" Sofia Donec and Andrej Melastenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has consequently reduced the key rate over a year and has fallen by 3.5 per cent since the beginning of the last summer.
At the last meeting, in June, the CB immediately reduced it to one percentage of inflation due to low rates of demand and the need to stimulate the delayed pandemic and its related economies.
The prospects for cash-credit policy are maintained (the next meeting of 18 September and the end of the year), but the limit is close, the main analyst of Rosbank, Eugene Koshelev, agrees.
The inflation risks also indicate the closeness of a pause in mitigation of the interest policy - distorted supply chains, possible increases in costs due to the prevention of the epidemic and more rapid (reasoning) demand recovery, he said.
In completion of the follow-up to the Bank of Russia, more attention will be required to the inflation processes during the harvest season, as well as the external volatility of geopolitical conflicts, indicates Koshelov.
In any way, the decline in the key rate will further reduce the rates for the most reliable borrowers, and perhaps the mortgage, said the senior economist of the Analytical Management of the Bank " Opening " Maxim Petronovic.
The correction of the rates will be less expressed than the reduction of the key rate, it clarifies.
The claims for claims may fall by 0.3-0.6 per cent during the second half of the year, the mortgage rates may be 6.2-7 per cent, not excluded by the Economy of the BCC Prime Minister, Anton Pocatovovic.
The average contribution rates, in his view, will also fall, in the coming months, may fall to 4.2-4.5 per cent (now only above 4.5 per cent).
Further, they may fall to 4% if the CB reduces the key rate of the fall, Pokatović considers.

The actor of the Russian Chiki series, who was accused of the " LGBT and feminism advocacy", responded to the film's claims.
The authors "recognized the sharpness of the subjects and didn't want to offend anyone," American Stephen Thomas Oxner said in a conversation with the publication of "Free".
"I think it's a story of power and common aspects of human life.
This has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism," said the actor who played the father of the boy who had changed into women's clothes.
He emphasized that “he is proud of work” and does not consider it a propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he was frightened by the response of some people to the story line of the series: for example, there was a case when “the man in a deep singing shot the picture and said that it was not true.”
"Then a few cases were when we met displeased locals who didn't understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so those who first came with claims began to help us," he said.
The case with the shooting, explains the publication, took place in Cabardino-Balcaria in September 2019: a drunk man attacked the car of the shooting group with weapons, and then he was arrested by police officers.
It was previously reported that Olga Baranac, a public authority for the protection of the family, had filed a complaint on the IMD and the Roskomnadzor for the service of more.tv, which placed the Russian Chiki series.
The Lamb accused the creation of the series of "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations and feminism", noting that the main heroins of the film are acting as prostitutes, and the series itself contains "the scenes of physical and psychological violence".
The Ombudsman was also disturbed by the fact that the juvenile character “in the series has a lot of attention to the homosexual sexual orientation.”
The comedial drama of Chiki tells about three prostitutes who started a new life and opened business on a friend's council.
