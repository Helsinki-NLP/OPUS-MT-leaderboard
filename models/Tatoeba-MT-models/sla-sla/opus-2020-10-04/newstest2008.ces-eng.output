Inflation in Europe jumped for food
The accelerated inflation targeted in the euro area is primarily caused by a continuous increase in food prices.
The November price growth in 13 eurozones was higher than expected, after 2.6 per cent in October the annual inflation of 3.1 per cent, the Luxembourg Statistics Authority of the Union reported.
The official prognosis was only 3 per cent, Bloomberg reported.
In contrast to the US, the British and Canadian Emissions Bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not reduce the basic interest rate by reducing raw material prices and declineing unemployment would lead to inflation spirals.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below two percent, however close to them.
According to one of the analysts, the ECB is in an absurd situation: the inflation must "restrain" in order to avoid doing anything later in this matter.
In Germany, a November inflation of 3.3 per cent of the 15-year-old record is represented; in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the euro zone has risen up because of rapidly rising food and energy prices.
The term prices of wheat increased by 88 per cent, and the soy course has also reached the highest value since 1973.
It was also necessary to pay significantly more for eating oil and milk products in 2007.
Oil price on world markets this year increased by 52 percent, and last month, there was a barrel of black gold nearly 100 dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will drop from this year's 2.1 per cent to 2.5 in 2008, but in 2009 it will already fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation level will remain in the following 3-4 months at approximately 3 per cent, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
The range of favorites of the Fidesh movement after a long-term stagnation has increased significantly to the beginning of December, so now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of socialists, the Gallup Institute has never measured 13 per cent of its support.
In the case of certain parties' voters, the difference would be more than two-third (71 per cent) support than the fifth support of the IFRS.
The MDF and SZDSS are, according to an examination under the threshold for entering Parliament: their support within the entire population is two per cent.
Among certain parties' voters, there is one per cent more favors of both camps.
The public's view of the economy has deteriorated even in view of the previous minimum - never the ratio of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be very bad, so high - 41 per cent, while 46 per cent, according to the other, is quite bad.
Families evaluate the change in their material situation after spring and summer hopes now more pessimistic.
As for the next year, the majority of the population counts with further deterioration and only a dozen improvements.
In December 71 percent of the questioned were judged, most of all the Gallup Institute's research, that the Prime Minister is doing his work rather bad than good.
Ferrence Gyurcsany believes or very trusts 13 percent of the questioned, while the share of favorites is 38 percent in Victor Orban.
The Prime Minister does not trust 54 percent at all, the President of the Fidesh Movement 27 per cent.
One of the indicators for the development of the political situation is how much the public believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be resolved without a change of government.
While last October's disturbances considered the government and the Prime Minister as demanding 35 per cent, this share is now only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) has seen solutions only in the release of new elections.
For the interest of the referendum, it is apparent that 60 per cent of the questionnaire responded to the question regarding their possible participation, that there would be no doubt, and another 20 per cent would have reported that it would probably come.
For comparison, the "parlamental elections of this Sunday" would certainly be attended only 55 percent and another 15% considers its participation as likely. The success of the referendum would be uncertain on the basis of current intentions.
The schoolmak would say not 74, doctor 79 fees and 84% hospital fees.
If we look at the same shares only in the range of people who promise their participation, then the introduction of school, fees in the doctor and hospital fees would reject 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, nearly five impressed Tesco
The Hypermarkets in the Budaörs Trade Triangle maintained a last year, an average of 16 per cent increase in price levels, with the difference that this year there was no increase in VAT.
Article of Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas consumption basket of Napi Gazdaság in the Budaörs Trust Triangle this year increased by 16 per cent, but in all hypermarkets the price increased notably over a thousand forints.
Since the prices in food supermarkets have already flyed in December, there has not been such a drastic embarrassment in the previous high base.
However, it is unhappy for consumers that what they could buy at a price of nine thousand forints will not be charged now for ten thousand.
The consumption basket of the Daily Economy in studied hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003 the consumption basket was 6,800 forints.)
The Unica and living fish price remained at last level, but it was very irritated by brutal breasts, nuts and mac.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistics Office, although we found a kilogram bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
The competition didn't go with the price of the product under 200 forensics.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of Coca Cola in the back bottle was under 200 forints, so only 257 forints were in stock.
Nevertheless, this year it appeared according to the consumption diary Napi Gazdaság Auchan as the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our estimates, she raised prices in the consumption diary of Napi Gazdaság in terms of the prices of Christmas Cora by 15, while Tesco and Auchan approximately 18 percent.
In comparison with last year's highest and lowest consumption basket, the difference was 12 per cent, while the growth between the lowest last year and the highest 21 per cent of the year.
In the forensics there was an increase in the average of 1,480.
The average increase in the prices of the loon resulted in 1,206 forints with the impact of prices on Christmas.
This trade process has just been distorted, and trade houses have clearly failed to decide how much price rates should be determined in individual products, as they have not been able to predict the impact of the change in consumption prices.
(If the trader plans the speed of the circulation of the product wrong, the price rate adjusted circulation may lose significant profits.)
Due to the VAT, the increase in the consumption basket price of Napi Gazdaság showed so extremely that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forins higher than in 2006, while the cheapest difference was made by 844 forints everywhere.
This year, the extreme difference has not occurred, the expensive basket was now more than 1,630 forints and the cheapest illustrated by 1,284 forints.
In comparison with the two Christmas seasons, the prices were disastrous, in less than 20 months the daily consumption in hypermarkets by more than 30 per cent.
(It, inter alia, does not fully confirm the data of the Central Statistics Authority: it measured in the case of several basic foods the increase in prices exceeding 30 per cent within 12 months.
Except flours, for example, in the case of eggs.)
However, in the last case, the consumption of the Daily Economy seems as unlikely as the price level of the product, which has been quite expensive in the last year, has proved to be based on the base, even in the worst case, the price growth of more than 10 per cent.
The flour suppliers are taking a stronger position than egg suppliers, a drastical increase in prices has been able to prosecute in international chains.
Hypermarkets in a golden triangle don't complain, they're still referring to a good year.
According to our experience, most customers are no longer interested in the prices in three visited trades.
They're shopping a quantum, taking permanent food after salary.
Wednesday morning, all three supermarkets formed long fronts for treasures, because the number of visitors increased rapidly.
However, as we know, the rural turn is lower, several international chains complain to research companies that markets remain for their plans, not only in the case of food, but also the lasting consumer goods.
In many places, it is preserved on disinfective means
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection were reported in hospitals, mainly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, bed overcrowding, surgery to stop personnel do not help, states the Prime Minister of the National Epidemiological Centre.
In many places, it is also preserved on disinfective means.
The traumatological department of St. John's hospital was recently diagnosed with the MRSA infection.
Bacteria resistant against antibiotics were discovered in a man who got into the hospital after a serious car accident.
The patient was isolated.
Similar infection occurred in the same place at the beginning of the year.
Patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but shortly afterwards he had to return with MRSA infection and because of the bacteria in his body, one important operation could not be performed.
By December 10th, 1 094 hospital infections caused by multiresistant disease originators were reported to the National System Nesocomialis Surveillance, Carolina Böröč, Prime Minister of the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multiresistant disease originators were safely registered in hospitals, others are not known.
Almost two thirds (683) of the infection were caused by MRSA, or methicilin-oxacilin with resistant golden stafilokoc.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria has a third of the people in the nose without having caused disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. neck inflammation, skin infection, early infection) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered overly or inappropriately, the bacteria that responds well to antibiotics of bacteria which is very resistant to antibiotics and which is rapidly spreading in unsuitable hospital conditions.
Especially in the case of transitional or persistent immune function in patients with a weak body, low body weight, or in patients aged may cause serious hospital infection, such as early infection or blood poisoning - sepsy.
According to Saint John’s high doctor, there is nothing special on MRSA infection, similar infection belongs to daily practices in the hospitals.
"The infection must not be replaced with the epidemic, the MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the originator of the disease is not investigated."
Resistance to antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, the treatment personnel treats them in rubber gloves and in the mask and we have antibiotics needed to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients administered to the hospital are first investigated whether MRSA is present in their body, however, can't always avoid the infection.
Sample collection is not in mode
Most of the hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, however, the contemporary conditions and conditions in home hospitals are not favourable for prevention and dissemination of multiresistent originators of diseases, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection is reportedly occurring in hospitals and homes for seniors, patients taken should be inspected and MRSA carriers should immediately isolate.
However, the collection of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not in fashion.
This also plays the role of the National Health Insurance Fund that does not finance this investigation.
Most cases have been discovered so when the patient is suffering from the MRSA infection, the primary of the epidemiological center said.
The European Union has strict recommendations for appropriate treatment of antibiotics in human health and there are also domestic directives for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
It is necessary to strive for antibiotic therapy to be targeted, or microbiological examinations should be conducted to prevent resistance against medicinal products, however, even hospitals should not be followed in all cases.
Microbiological sample collections are even more rare in the primary, respective ambulance treatment of patients, informed Carolina Böröč.
Store on disinfective means
Scientific evidence suggests that the MRSA is widespread among patients most often through health personnel.
Therefore, it plays a very important role in washing and using gloves and masks, but also in hospitals there are serious deficiencies.
MRSA is transmitted by a potato infection and touch, but in the conditions of domestic hospitals it is not always possible to isolate infected patients.
Rooms are often filled, beds are often very close to each other, even if from epidemiological perspective, patients should be at least 1.5 meters away.
As Karolina Böröč noted, we are unfortunately able to meet that in the hospitals that are in an inadmissible material situation, they are preserved on disinfective means, the nurses are few, and patients are a lot more likely to develop infections.
According to Karolina Böröč, where the necessary protective measures are observed, similar infections are proofly less or further dissemination of the originator of the disease can be stopped.
Government programme vs. MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents enormous expenditure for health insurance, so it fights everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has written an MRSA prevention programme, a respect for reducing its appearance.
Apparently, the programme is successful, according to the public data, MRSA infections in England show a decreasing trend.
The European Centre for Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC) is a variety of prevention of multiresistent disease originators (including MRSA), respect for hospital infections caused by these disease originators, among their priorities.
The police captain who caused a death accident was not drunk.
The official expert assessment in the case of the police captain XXII circuit that caused a death accident is completed.
It is possible to exclude that the police captain of the XXIInd region, who killed a walker on Tuesday and who resigned from his function, would drive under the influence of alcohol or deceptive substances, informed the speaker of the High State Representativeship of the capital of Attila Morvai on Friday after the completion of the expert judgment of this case.
The expert assessment confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which already stated that the former police captain had not had any alcohol before he sat behind the wheel.
On Tuesday in Lajose Kossutha, the former director of the Police Directorate of the XXII District, struck his own personal car on the turn of a fifty-fifty-year-old man who entered before him when the car was crossed outside the marked passage.
(The last appointed fact that the walker was crossing out of zebra is not a facilitating circumstances, the distraction car must also be preferred.)
After the carriage to the hospital, the walker died.
For these events, the district police director resigned and asked for transfer to service, according to the police's communication, because he was so distressed.
In the case, it is investigating the Budapest State Investigation Agency.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain has been cooperating with the State representatives investigating since the beginning.
Other 400 million euros for infrastructure
The agreement on three credit frameworks totally EUR 400 million for the support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as energy, signed on Friday in Budapest, the Minister of Finance Janos Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environmental projects implemented by the Cohesion Fund, a framework of EUR 300 million, with the Parties already concluded a loan agreement for a amount of 100 million, the signed agreement now concerns the use of EUR 200 million remaining.
Also, a loan agreement amounting to EUR 150 million is served for the budget financing of projects associated with education.
The EIB has approved for Hungary for these purposes totally 300 million euros, for the use of EUR 150 million remaining may take place later, with the extension of the credit contract.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a contract for 50 million euros, which the budget will use primarily for the research-development project of the Debrecian University.
There was also a talk about the fourth metro route.
The Parties agreed that, after Hungary agrees with the EU's funding details, it will return to whether and how the original contract should be modified.
According to Janos Veres, this may happen in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has funded a total of 113 projects in Hungary since 1990.
The interest of credits provided by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without an obligation commission shall be binding on EURIBOR.
Bulgaria is the reality paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is impressive - the attention of Europe is drawn to a slightly limited Balkan country.
What, where, and who buys forever the cheapest, however, rapidly irritating EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most searchable eastern European real estate shopping goal is now no doubt Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea coast.
From the mountains are the most in the Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosha course, on the sea coast, Albena, Golden Sands, Solar Coast, ancient cities Sozopol and Nesebar, but more people are also looking for property in the area of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, the interest of investors and the central part of the country will sooner or later - for example Big Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and he also buys more interesters in the area of the cheap town of Russia.
Also, the main city of Sofia is a promise of fake options, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best way to change in one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus become next to the summer and winter seasons to be searched for the road goals even in the next two years.
Foreseeable investors are already shopping in a large area, for example in the area of Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are trying to change their life and lifestyle at the same time.
Most customers come from England, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain, and more often from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors, Black Sea and ski paradise, and there are traditionally many Russian customers.
Foreign buyer lies split into three groups, says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settled people buy either renewed property worth 50-100 thousand euros, or dead old houses for 5-15 thousand euros that they renew.
They require good availability and communication opportunities, the closeness of the large city, trades and generally the local doctor is important for them.
The second category are chat buyers (Bulgaria has been set up among the first 10 German recreational goals in December).
The third group forms commercial investors who buy in hope of a rising value in the medium or long-term horizont.
Reproduction of real estate in the capital is continuous, because demand is increasingly strong.
While the lowest realities prices in Bulgaria are in the European Union, they have grown by 21 per cent a year in the past five years.
The increase in real estate prices significantly exceeds the growth of salaries.
Fodor and Hungarian 6%
According to the Minister for Environment and Water Economy, Gabor Fodor will be completed on Tuesday and after the medium official start, the international conference on the climate regime will continue to be negotiated by ministers after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world are referring to the Passport Map of Bali, dealing with efforts following the period of reducing emissions set out in the Kyoto Protocol applicable until 2012.
At this point, there is a violent debate between developing and advanced countries.
The United States also announced that they do not now want to deal with accurate numbers, although they are attached to the agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 25 to 40 per cent in relation to the state of 1990.
Another major issue of the conference is whether the grown countries will join other than emission reductions to provide both material and technological assistance to countries which are denied to it.
The Agreement was also born on grants for developing countries.
The grant fund, as set out by the Kyoto Protocol, will be guided by the 16-member Governing Council, probably within the World Environmental Protection Programme (GEF) at the United Nations - we can see Piac és Profit.
Hungarian 6%
The Minister for Environment and Water Economy, Gabor Fodor, named Hungary, supports the efforts of the EU to maintain a leadership role in the global climate protection efforts and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is obliged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent from the 1990 level, regardless of the success of the adoption of the 2012 agreement, and is ready to undertake up to 30 per cent reduction in the event that other advanced world areas, the respective countries will be willing to accept their responsibilities and obligations.
Gabor Fodor pointed out that the countries which joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had aimed at a 5.2 per cent reduction, with the 15 EU Member States then committed to 8 per cent.
The commitment of Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the years 1985-87, which will fulfil our country. - It is recalled in the press report of the Ministry of Environment.
In Bali it is a lot, because within two years, it is necessary to adopt an international agreement on long-term climate change policy, otherwise its entry into force would be safely moved until 2012. In that case, the commitments to reduce the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be linked to the new system of reducing emissions, which is also necessary in its latest report by the United Nations International Scientific Assembly on Climate Changes - IPCC, which is the Nobel Price of Peace.
This would result in delayed emission reductions and inevitable increases in the average temperature on the Earth by more than 2 degrees of Celsia, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and unavoidable consequences.
The British Army performs aboard on YouTube
The British military units announce on the server to share videos from actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, by which they themselves popularize.
First, YouTube loved British Air Force (RAF): Special Operation Units in Afghanistan have been recording videos from Taliban action since March 2006, BBC announced.
The miniature camera attached to the helmet are controlled by the aircraft command to control the fight operations in the area of Kandahar and then sent to London where they are transferred to the Internet.
Political message is inevitable
This is the form that 139 United States Air Force's Soldiers have already reached the Internet, and more than 75 thousand people have looked at their "canal".
The British Ministry of Defence registered on spring 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and announces the stock recordings in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and international peace units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Employment in Afghanistan
Air powers have published videos according to their original intention for the recruitment and according to the Ministry of Defence are also good to acquaint the public with the real objective of the presence of the army in abroad.
"The promotion published by this form, compared to traditional television advertisements, is almost worth nothing," the BBC expert informed Gordon Mackenzie's defence issues, "but there is also a certain political message, as a special form confirms the authorization of military action decided by the government."
The Americans have done a game
The Army causes concern that, in addition to carefully modified, censured recordings, amateur videos are also received on the server, which includes, for example, the death of soldiers: in some hypocrisy, "official" propaganda films, because the officers are talking about losses, but there is no bloody form of battle.
On the Internet, many videos from the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, which came up in a sharp place, however, the British army has arrived on them until now.
The Americans perform a little different - using a shooting game named America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can get through a more loyal simulation directly into the skin of soldiers.
The ministries will have Christmas with the tumbola and the pagans.
The Ministry of Work, Monica Lamperth, is apparently not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will organize a final working meeting for her colleagues, where she will say goodbye to her cupcakes and coffee in 2007.
In some ministries, a celebration with live music, somewhere it will enlighten the officials of the Christmas atmosphere with the tumbola and toast.
The party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and the Swedish table - so they enjoy the powerful.
The government's offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration this year will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it does not expect its employees.
On Christmas of orphans, children of falling soldiers will receive gifts at the Mission's Christmas, while family members of soldiers serving at the moment on foreign missions, but they will also arrange a reception for journalists.
The resort is devoted to the atmosphere of the end of the year 25 million.
The National Development Agency (NFDIST) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will be expelled against other resorts.
The GKM party is held in the centre of Jöv .Haza, with a total of 4,320 000 Forints and from six hundred employees of the Ministry is expected about three hundred and fifty guests.
The resort will stick to Christmas traditions at its celebration, but it will also occur to a variety of performances and will also lose the tombola.
The NFʹ Christmas cost 4,700 000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the State Justice Council (OIT) - the program had concerts and dinner.
The rental of the hall cost a million forints, the rest was made up for more than four hundred invited.
It appears that one NFDIST is invited to another Christmas celebration: that is arranged by the company providing the progress of the tends, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from Union money.
For that purpose, they rented the Wigsinhaz theatre building.
MAG and. s. did not confirm this information because we failed to reach a person concerned.
The suit is not necessary
The OIT building was not only hosted by the NFï but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which was organized by St. Lucia on 7 December.
However, OIT did not want money from him using its rooms.
Five hundred people attended the dance.
The party began with the health of the Minister, after dinner, it was possible to dance for the escort of live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the bal, none of the obligatory evening dresses or suits were required.
The Puritanian party is planning resorts for health, work and local self-sustainment.
The Ministry of Health organizes a programme and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in its own building.
The ministry of the work, Monica Lamperth, does not even officially send the workers to the Christmas party, but at the final working meeting.
It is counted by 1 800 guests who, according to the press department, only get coffee and pagans, so only 350 000 forints will be enough for the party.
The Minister for Local Self-Government Gordon Bajani will simply drink with his collaborators in the aule of the Ministry of Local Self-Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas meeting expected by 436 employees in its own large hall.
On Christmas party, it dedicates 2.500 forints to the guest - the total amount includes reception with Swedish tables and toasts.
Since Minister Janos Veres, celebrated PM workers like Christmas every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be missing, the officiality strengthens not only the ministerial speech but also the afternoon time of conduct.
The agricultural resort holds a new-year reception on 20 January, the ministerial Christmas is not accommodated.
The reception will be performed in the castle of Vajdahunyadwar in the City Gardens and, according to the Ministry's message, 1,000 forints are assigned for a person for a hundred guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception to which only relevant foreign diplomats are invited to be accredited in Hungary.
This annual reception begins with the short health of the Minister and ends with a tiny hospitality.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Cultural are not even organizing Christmas parties, the portal [orgo] the relevant press office has been communicated.
The price of Christmas celebration of the environmental environment in the press department could not be shared.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to a party in the Artcopy Museum.
Declines to the giant strike
The Association of Union Unions of the League, the Respect of the Comprehensive Union of Workshops (MOSZ) will create its strike committee on Friday to coordinate the Monday unlimited strike.
On Saturday, a protesting public meeting will be held on Monday - on the final vote on the Health Insurance Law - will be suspended.
The action will certainly cause a serious interruption of the transport, as the railway transport is almost completely stopped and in 13 hours, the employees of the Budapest Transport Facility (BKV) will also be striking.
On Friday afternoon, the League Association meets the Complete Union of Workshops with details of the organized Monday strike.
A stake committee of LIGA - MOSZ will also be established to coordinate Monday's action.
On Saturday, the protesting public meetings are held, and since Monday, the commissions joining the strike will stop the work for an indefinite period, unless there is a agreement with the government.
This means that there was not a deadline for the end of the strike that would begin on the day of the Parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Law.
If Parliament does not finally accept the health insurance law, the committees will immediately withdraw the call for the strike.
However, if the legislation is voted, the strike committee shall meet and decide on another procedure.
According to the Monday meeting of the Parliament, it is also possible that the health insurance law will be voted until late evening, if possible, night hours.
Because of the starting strike on Monday, it is possible to count on serious transport interruptions: the work will be stopped on the railway for an indefinite period, a part of the Budapest mass transport can be stopped in the morning and more than half of the Volan companies.
At the same time, in many places the country will also close half the road.
Many committees and civil organizations, whose list is constantly updated on the websites of the Liga Association, joined the strike.
Some organizations reviewed the strike for an indefinite period, others announced a temporary stop of work.
By the Thursday afternoon, Hungarian State Roads (MAV) and the Independent Union of Railroad Employers (VDSS) were unable to agree even on sufficient services, while at the beginning of the Christmas holidays, there are more people traveling along the railway.
According to previous communications, from the start of operation up to 13 hours in BKV, from 7 to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike will be organized by the Committee Union of Energy Industries of LIGA, to 2-, respect for the 2-8-hour suspension of work, the Committee Union of Pedagogs and the Democratic Union of Pedagogs.
Hungarian physicians will strike urgently across the country, the Democratic Union of Health Workers and Social Affairs (EDDSZ), which belongs to the Cooperative Forum of Co-operational Unions (SCEF), shall hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the Association of League is that the government revokes the proposal for a health insurance reform and submits a new concept to the public.
The second requirement is that a new retirement method be introduced gradually since the next year.
Thirdly, for the early retirement of the relevant workshops, the possibility of incorporation in the system has been provided before 2010.
The fourth reason for action is that the Independent Union of Railway Employees (VDSJS) under the Communities of the League, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economic and Transport on railway branches, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased the risk of the country
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, based on the support of the movement of Jobbik Magyarorshagert in August this year, according to the Division of Risk Analysing Division of the Institute of Political Capital, increased immediately in several respects the political risk of Hungary and the entire area.
The "related warning" of the company is written: in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that "I'm going to fail the ethnic tension between the Romanian and the Neroman population of Hungary can be a violent ethnic conflict in a short time".
The main reason is that the Political Strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely aimed at provoking such an action -- the research institute is supplied.
As it says, all of this can be explained to one of the greatest negligence of Hungarian political representatives: "The public discussion on the Roma issue left the public life representatives to radical and extreme political assemblies that could have constructed a political strategy in the Roman and Hungarian conflict."
This increases the problem, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the probability of arising violent conflict - the Institute judges.
In addition, the activities of the Hungarian Guard according to the Research Institute influenced the great attention of domestic and foreign media "to a significant extent the image of Hungary in abroad, particularly with regard to faith in the stability of the country and its democratic success".
The Institute recalls: part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which are increasingly public and vegetation since autumn 2006, is that several organizations have been created in Hungary since the summer 2007, which themselves call themselves "national domain".
"The social feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while they openly report - and armed - the readiness of their members to perform defensive tasks (in the case of food disasters, the attack of the authorities, the violation of order), in addition with the insistence of the police, the army, or the state," he adds.
He further notes: it all happens in a way that he seeks to pack up the various political efforts set up to resist the society to politics and parties into a civil coat.
Therefore, emphasizing civility and the form of the community in these consolidations does not only serve to avoid the legal scope of the judicial registration, but also to be a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk factor in neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, they point to Hungarian Guard immediately in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, ultranational political representatives of some neighbouring countries wish to apologize to their own anti-Hungarian policy by appealing to the Hungarian Guard.
This can all have an impact on the political stability of the area," he adds.
According to the Research Institute, Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks for the region have increased as a whole.
As it says, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are similar to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian Ultraright National Union (BNU).
The background of the Bulgarian Guard is the mass of Roma disturbance that exploded in one of the Sofia's neighborhoods (Krasna Poljana).
This BNU used to establish a guard with the aim of the organization is "national domain".
In the past 17 years, it said that there was a "Cycan terror" in Bulgaria, however, the state remained inactive and indifferent, recalls the Institute of Political Capital.
It adds that the initiative has caused a violent discussion of the Bulgarian public.
The increase in the risk of ethnic conflicts further states that some Bulgarian Roman organizations are not informed that their own garde will be formed to the sign of resistance.
Since the Hungarian Guard's activity presents similarities with the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that Hungarian Roma will respond to the threat in a similar way, by establishing its own domobrane, we can note the risks developed by the Political Capital Institute.
Attila Juhasz, research director of the Institute of Political Capital, introduced the press office: risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
As he said, the risk analysis is issued every year and if it finds something that might affect the risk change, they shall inform the public opinions, as in this case by issueing a warning of risks.
Holidays are not free everywhere
In Hungary the days of free are precisely laid down by the law and it has already become a general practice that work days are moving around the holidays, which is less expected for us next year.
There are no single holidays in the European Union or in America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishs national and state holidays and days of work peace.
Days of work of peace are mostly relevant to church holidays or significant historical events.
We also celebrate New Year: the last day of the old and first day of the new year is a work free - for the New Year, so that people can rest after Silvester.
In the course of the year, we have a total of 11 free holidays.
The national holiday is the 15th March celebrating revolution of 1848 and 23 October, the Memorial Day of the 1956 Revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the establishment of a state, May 1, work, 1 and 2 November, we remember the dead relatives and friends.
Besides, we have two days of Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays are rarely part of the calendar, there is a practice of moving the working day in case we are working only one day before the holiday or after it.
However, the price for the prolonged weekends is that we stay at the workplace and at school on the preceding Saturdays.
When the day that precedes or follows the holiday, we work for years, the Minister of Labour has been editing in a special declaration.
The legal regulation applies the same measure to all employers and employees, public employees and public workers in public service.
However, it does not concern companies and institutions operating without interruption or having regard to their purposes, they also work in the working days of peace.
This year, the work order will only be changed at the end of the year: from 24 December, life in the country will be stopped so much, as most people have experienced the day between Christmas and Silvestr in advance "work" or use the saved vacation.
In the next year, a few of our holidays will fall in the middle, respect for the end of the week, so the movements of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar turns around the holiday of work so that workers can stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday, 26 April, will be a working day so that Friday, on 2 May, can be a rest day.
The next move relates to the holiday of 23 October: Saturday, 18 October, will be worked instead of Friday 24.
But at the end of the year next year, it will be able to take full holidays, because since 24 December they will have almost everywhere on vacation, even though Silvester is in the middle.
Six scary little things you can piss off your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we will never receive, innocent lies that we will not even notice: it's all "saving" everyday days in the workplace.
The question is, if you get used to these little disadvantages, or put your gloves on, and the illustration situations that others can get angry, you will deliberately avoid yourself.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department," a colleague tells you.
That you've missed your possession for that?
In a better case, he regrets and trys to fix it, if possible calls to the marketing department and says that the message has forgotten to be transmitted (this is less common solution).
The most common thing is solved by one apology.
Before a embarrassing apologize, it is good to think about what you can prepare to your colleagues for unpleasant moments, and consciously try to prevent it.
Are you borrowing something that's not yours?
There's nothing more uncomfortable than you're dragging out for some writing, office or for your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember putting a sewage on your table yesterday, but he's gone by morning?
Or did you find your pen on the table of some of your colleagues that you thought were lost?
Without your permission, don't take anything from your colleagues, or they will be right to be angry with you that you're screwing up in their things.
Don't take the envelope or sticky papers from your office, because it may be uncomfortable when you end up early, and you will need them immediately.
Talking about a private life of colleagues?
There's no good solution how to stop spreading knocks.
Who, who did he do?
Where and why?
Don't tell everyone your news about the private life of your colleagues!
If one of them shares with you their most inner secrets, do not abuse his trust!
Lock up what you have heard, and in his absence, do not discuss it with your colleagues, even when others know his things.
You're reporting your absence for no reason?
If you call to the office and call on a strong headache you will report your absence, because you are not well, or you say that you would rather rest today, think that your work, your immediate tasks and work that they have a certain term will have to do for you someone else.
Watch your colleagues!
If you know ahead that the next day you don't go to work, or that something that may cause you to stay at home, let your colleagues and leaders not be confronted with your absence until the next day.
Broken, hygiene, telephone
Did you go to work where a colleague's hygiene will get you out of?
Have you become a witness of a telephone conversation, which would be better not to hear at all?
Don't interrupt your colleagues by singing, with a loud call (including over your head), or with your ass, with constant slaughter, with a loud dissatisfaction.
All of this may be disturbing even when they are not currently prevented from a project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you accusing the wrongs of the second?
If it is not in time or if you have forgotten to send an important letter or a message, do not blame your forgetty of another!
Don't renounce any chaos in the office and noise colleagues!
Recognize if you were wrong and someone paid for it, and fix the injury!
Ask me how you could fix this thing, fix the negligence!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Temperatures and poops: comfortable clothes on the house, but not in the office!
Don't take your clothes for free time, even if it allows your profession!
Don't be negligible, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in common dresses - and if your profession requires, nice and elegant!
When a person wants to meet, he ceases to be interesting
Driving in a regular morning trap.
From the radio will be a special melodie: violin sound to which electronic effects are attached.
I'm adding loudness.
Music changes the rate and the bass is added to the previous tone coloring, then the female congregation joins as a real jewelry.
At Mr2 station, it sounds a group of Zagar named Wings of Love.
The homemade musical life has not been smashing us with a quality electronic pop for a long time.
But suddenly, the stuck looks quite different because you're just listening to the new album of Zagara.
The discovery of Yonderboya, a couple of new and interesting productions originating from the domestic digital underground, the total image slowly changes, and although it is again in fashion a garage rock with its beating into the guitar, even the home electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balazs Zasager started in Five Cross and he also played in Yonderboi's band until he finally - perhaps because two dudazs didn't get into one sheet - he went his own way.
However, with its project (Zagar) and music that connects the elements of jazz, electronic dancing styles and popus, he began to run through until he was called to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
film Ference Töröka "Sezon").
His formation, playing in the beginnings in small clubs, recognized a wider audience after the magazine wan2 set up their first album of 2002 between 50 of the most important homeboards and declared Zagar in Yonderboya as such only domestic entities that could be selling even in the West.
Zagar and his band are no doubt "in course", although of course no one asked them if they were satisfied with this label.
The band reacted as it belongs: she made a new, better album.
Now issued album named Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths to them, although the name itself is trying to create a proportion with the starting flights in Fifty-Costle.
This is a verse from the song of the old band of Balazza Zasager.
The reference to ethical, flying would be on the spot, but next to the ethical breath of this music now appears - in line with the spirit, the trend of time - more guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, a singer of György Ligeti, who currently works in England with the The Puzzle group, presented at the premiere of the board in the park Millenaris.
Album also produced a real radio hit, thanks to Mr2 Petïfi station, playing the most recent time from morning to evening popular music, we began to ripping up the funny music of Wings of Love, recorded with six home singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything's all right?
The portal hvg.hu confessed Balazza Zasagera.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question is, how much remains what you play, border music?
Balazs Zsager: Definition border music means nothing to me.
I think there are two different cats of light music; not a mainstream and underground, not an alternative and pop, but a commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, sub-ground music can be flat, they say nothing, and just so it can come up for sale, which makes it commercial.
Of course, even a good pop song can be a source of sincere internal need.
In this spirit, the attitude is accepted, regardless of language and state borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience against your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, mostly from us to the west, the lighter music has greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people after 20, but also elders.
Many of the changes in light music around them are watched because they also consider it part of the judicial culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Do you care who, where and how much does your music listen?
B. Zs.: Of course, it is a good feeling that more people go to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
With us, music is not born for purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived more on concerts where mutual influence already works, but it is hiding only in unaffectable changing moments.
Still, I noticed that when a person wants to meet the audience, he has become more interesting since that time.
hvg.hu: How long are you going to follow Yonderboie's example?
He works solo, and he built his career rather from us to the west.
B. Zs.: We do not actually go his way, regardless of the fact that our music is sometimes trying to explain.
We are more team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
Of course, at first, our work could not be avoided by comparing Yonderboy's songs, since some of us separated from his band and went another way.
hvg.hu: The Wings of Love played the first place in the top of the station, Mr.2 Pet&Fi.
Many heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open a wider layer with a more popular style?
B.Zs: We didn't plan to write a hit to sell the board.
It's more about that song.
We meant it as an album final, which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose those six singers?
Why is it - what was the primary principle?
B.Zs.: The show was to create such a Gospel congregation.
Then the idea came to build this congregation from the solists of the home music scene with a good voice.
So this six-time congregation - that is, Sena, Edin Kutzor, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikø Hodos [Neo], Juci Nemeth - which we then baptized at Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is that exactly what you meant for the song, or did girls change something on it?
B.Zs.: The composition has been in the instrumental version for a long time, when the material came together on the board, we thought that something else would be necessary for this song.
The track of the accords led to joining a singing part.
That day the night I sang on him the music that the girls later learned.
It worked for almost the first time and awfully spontaneous thing.
I remember how it recovered, but of course the Diva needed it.
With my voice, it wouldn't work this energyly.
hvg.hu: As on the board, at the concert it seemed to be girls in the background.
They don't have solo (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own role, they sing totally together and aren't more loud than music, so music only does not perform their singing.
They were also standing back on the stage.
Is that deliberate?
B.Zs.: The fact that they stood behind was only due to technical problems.
The fact that we didn't want to share salt roles is deliberate.
And the song is about a little forgetting about our ego, where it belongs, where it belongs, and just letting ourselves with those wings, the wings of love to rise.
I wish this euforic state that we felt when the song was born, others felt.
hvg.hu: What was the most work?
B.Zs.: During the composition of music, actually, with no one, the harder pieces appeared rather in mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on a concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he long refused to work grooves, then everything was slowly found his place as in some puzzle.
hvg.hu: What new board song is your favorite?
B.Zs: It's still changing by concerting, even if I've already released the board.
Now it's Prophet is a fool, escape from the Earth and never the same.
The treasonal trader risked billions of minority
It's a defraudant.
This is what he names his excellent employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banking giant Sociale Géneral, the owner of the foreign Commercial Bank.
She lost about five billion euros because of it.
But it seems rather that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to compare his colleagues and, in addition, not capable.
Unlike all the large banking houses, he recognized the mortgage crisis at the US market.
"It's mentally weaker," the mouth of his supervisors, who sent the police on him.
However, as shown in Kerviel’s statement, the French media, such as Le Monde’s diary, was a man who had a profit of EUR 1.6 billion at the end of last year.
Crisis Not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in his statement.
In the summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros in the American crisis.
Because he felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to appear that so-called sub-prime mortgages provided to low-prime clients or those who had problems with payments will have problems in the past.
This crisis should not have an impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet it right.
At the end of the year, his profit came up to 1.6 billion euros.
"When I earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits and adds that he definitely didn't leave anything for himself.
In the entire interrogation, he confessed that he faked the records so that he wouldn't get it.
He even managed to freak out his bosses, even when he started to care about his store stores of Eurex.
Risk was a profit.
Was he afraid he'd come up with him?
Not at all.
"I thought the simple fact that I earned $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he take the will to risk so much?
He must have gradually developed himself in his position.
He entered the Societ General in 2000 just after he received the university in Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant of a broker, and in 2005 he became a separate merchant with a annual salary of $90,000.
Nevertheless, he knew he would never make as much money as the others.
"When I first interviewed in 2005, I knew they were looking at me.
For my education and for professional and personal development," Kerviel described to investigators.
But shortly after the entrance, the first great success came.
Thanks to allianz's shares, he made half a billion euros down at the bomb attacks on London.
And that was the launch mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you make money, we'll let you go.
"It's like a snowball," he said to the cops.
But the bosss said they knew about everything or were they more aware of.
"Where I earned money, they closed my eyes."
But then the wound came at the beginning of this year.
He lost a billion euros in the only day.
After the weekend in half January, he was trying to make it clear.
When he came to work on Monday, he hadn't worked at the bank anymore.
And the bank reported a few days later that he lost five billion euros.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
"I only chose four days in the past year.
The Makler who has no vacation is a merchant who doesn't want anyone to watch him in his records," Kerviel closed up.
Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
The Czech government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes yesterday by the representatives of the European Commission, from which the Czech Republic can gain 14 billion euros in the next years (approximately 365 billion crowns).
It is approximately half of the total amount that Czech Republic can gain from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns will go from seven operational programmes to regions.
Czech companies will be able to get about 100 billion crowns from the Innovation and Innovation Programme.
Most money, up to 150 billion, is going to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operating programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the funds that the CRC can receive from the funds.
These money will increase the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will earn the amount of 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Innovation and Innovation Programme should serve businesses and companies to acquire funds for innovation business.
Companies should gain funding for new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
The EU funds have already been retrieved by the PRC within the newly adopted countries among the least successful.
The 20-year penalty for the Expressor Nikaragui confirmed the court
The Court of Auditors in Nikaragua confirmed on Thursday the twenty-year sentence for the former President of the country, Arnold Aleman, who was convicted in 2003 for financial frauds reaching $100 million (about 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in a household prison on his haciend near a nikaragua metropole.
If the head of this Mediterranean State from 1997 to 2002 returns back to the nets, it is not clear at this time by the AP Agency.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérezová will now be dependent on the prison factors whether they will let Aleman serve his punishment at home or in prison.
For four years ago, the Court proved to Aleman regularly transfer government money to foreign business accounts in Panama.
These companies were fictional and accounts belonged in fact to his relatives and closest counterparts.
Some of these money then ended in the fund Aleman was founded to finance his election campaign in 2001.
So they approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
What is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget made by this government and accepted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
This one passed the support of the CHSSD for this year, because the Minister of Sobotka prepared it and the CHSD couldn't afford his deprivation.
Unlike the disturbing debate before voting about the government's inconfidence this time, nothing dramatic did not happen.
The Ambassador's House was traditionally overlooked, even though the most influenced, the law approved peacefully.
It's a paradox.
Each government begins and ends with individual chapters and items of the budget, whether someone likes it or does not like it.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but it is hidden behind the mighty rival of the opposition government.
This is medialy more grateful, and he is given much more attention in the media.
Politicians' guessing is much more interesting for the public than strict numbers.
The national budgets in the past socially democratic governments suffered three shortcomings that he cannot solve at once for 2008:
The first is the high share of the mandatory, so-called mandatory expenditure, not only pensions, but also the social doses approved by the quiet coalition of the ČSSD and KSCHM last year before the elections.
The second of them is deficit management as a result of not the first.
The third limit is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the deficit of the urban and municipal budgets.
However, the greatest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
He's public and relatively under control.
However, the temporary bomb is the deficit of the budgets of the cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to tax money, taxes and credits from the banks, have obtained additional investment resources, often without head, to issue bonds with which they have inappropriately owed their councils.
In the past years, they were able to pay these debts by the mass sales of energy and other divorce networks that they received from the State from privatisation.
They don't have this source now.
If we stick only to official and verified facts, we find out that:
Our economy has been going through for years, just like the rest of the world, the growth phase, which keeps praising the CHSSD.
This was a unique opportunity for her governments to make public finances fixed.
Instead, however, the State owed more.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have handled much more reasonable than our Republic.
It's a huge shame that falls mainly to the past governments.
We belong among countries that are at the global level at least threatened by poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes that, unfortunately, have been completely unnecessary in recent years.
Although a part of the nonsensitive populistic expenditure approved this year before the elections has been able to be cancelled, if there is no retirement boundaries in the nearby time, and retirement reform, there is a real end of any policy in this country, and no matter who rules, it will be just an office.
With a small excess, it is possible to say that government politicians become officials, mechanically dividing most taxed money to retirement and social dosages.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolutionary budget, but it can only suspend the pressure of normal expenditures by mandatory.
The planned deficit of 70 billion per year 2008 would be totally useless if the past governments had not equipped in the past ten years.
If we don't really want the government politicians to become just officials, then we must be patient and support this extremely strong coalition government that realizes that the State can issue only as much as it can get taxes and fees, peace to prepare other reform laws.
Only these will allow the progressive achievement of the balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada decided to combat the financial market crisis together.
The monetary markets will get over $100 billion through auctions.
In these auctions, the banks seek interest rate for which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send 40 billion dollars to the auction, and another fourty-twenty will be accessible to the European and Swiss central bank.
It is after the attacks of 11 September the first time the central banks of the individual States have agreed on a so-coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This step is to address the biggest problems of the economy, which is the growing lack of free capital that banks could borrow," Bernard Baumohl wrote in his report to clients from the Advisory Economic Outlook Group.
"The Coordinated Action of Central Banks reduced the probability of recess in the United States from 65 per cent to 50 per cent," Baumohl added in his report.
The banks have already lost $60 billion for unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analytics expect another billion losses.
"Central banks must really be afraid of what else can follow when they have decided for this procedure," ABN main economy AMRO Kieran Davies said.
"Sounds like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks have the most difficult access to loans, they will be more expensive to borrow to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to a recession with possible impacts on economic growth throughout the world.
The central banks have so decided after it has failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used to borrow money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about the mutual loaning of money, even though the United States, Canada and Britain had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another decline in interest rates," said the agency Reuters Greg Salvaggio from Temmus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the step of the central banks will contribute to the blessing of the crisis because it does not solve the main problem, which is the fall of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: Environmental debates are incredible
Global climate change should be most harmful for developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again expressed the issue of global warming.
The criticism has now taken place at the ending international conference of the United Nations on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he stated that the ecological debates were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only to the structure of the conference formed by a strange mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, but also a fundamental difference between the rétoric that conducts it and the reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it is just a fireworks of words that are a replacement for solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President emphasized that it was very important to him, and therefore it was so engaged for them.
He also expressed satisfaction about the fact that the book appears in the German translation, because, as he said, "I have often met only with the charics of my opinions."
So now the interested ones can read his unprecedented attitudes.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climateologist, but in his opinion, he had enough assumptions to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and assess professional dealings, has experience with statistics and is also a national economy.
At the main conclusions of the book, he pointed out that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal that there is no similar opinion of all scientists that the consequences of these changes are not too large and serious and therefore not a threat and that the efforts to influence climate development are inadmissible, ineffective and unacceptable.
Furthermore, as a person with totality experiences, he considers the unacceptable incitement of unproven opinions to others, which feels as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained the questions of the present people that it was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against military environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits".
On the same subject Klaus spoke in Vienna two months ago at Hayek's Institute.
The driver has failed to exchange 600,000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers have missed the period and have not been able to exchange an old driver's license that expires by the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for exchange to have the authorities reached their new license by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year, they would be on the road of hundreds of thousands of drivers without the right permission.
According to the authorities, the license has not changed mostly those who don't even want to drive anymore.
While the municipality reports a severe decrease in the interest of the exchange of drivers, the metropolitan authorities are incorporated and the interest in the exchange of licences this week has increased.
The magistrate takes about 2,000 clients a day.
There's approximately half an hour in front.
In Prague, the driver's license has not changed about 140,000 drivers.
Exhibition of a new license takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to request an issue within a short term of five days.
But in that case, the driver will add 500 crowns.
The motorcycles who will not have a mandatory exchange of the license by the end of the year and go on the road without a valid driver, will be in danger of the penalty since January.
The prosecutor will pay at least two thousand crowns.
But a cop can deal with the offence by dealing.
In the case of a proper offence, the penalty shall be applied to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, he could have received a penalty from the coroner and a man who won't go anywhere.
He could also pay for 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has previously called upon the authorities to be mild and retain the highest millennium penalty.
According to Karl Hanzelka, the spokesman's Ministry of Transport, but the ten-thousand penalties are no-one.
The driver's license is according to him a document where people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not a civil license that every person has to have valid.
People who don't want to drive should give up the driver's license.
It is sufficient to be transferred or sent by a recommendation to the competent General Authority.
Since the end of the year, they will stop paying for the documents issued between 1964 and 1993.
However, motorists must gradually exchange other types of license.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have time to exchange for three more years.
The validity of the documents issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are approximately 2.6 million other documents.
The court has reduced the penalty of detectives associated with Berdich.
Former cops Joseph Opava and Peter Konjarik, who are accused of criminal association with David Berdych gang, will go to prison for 13 and 10 years.
With definitive validity, the Prague Supreme Court decided, which thus reduced their penalties, one year and another by two years.
He originally threatened the detectives of the Prague Committee for Combating Organized Crime for 14 and 12 years.
Against today's decision cannot be revoked, only calling to the Supreme Court can be possible.
Although Berdich is also accused in this case, he is waiting for a first-instance verdict.
In other processes, however, he has already received penalties in the sum of over 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized in particular the participation of 19 guilty robbery, the Supreme Court today addressed the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused have refused to be constructed since the beginning of the investigation.
According to the Mediterranean Senate, police officers after the agreement, among other things with Berdich, were sending information to the criminals from police sources, covering individual robbery and helping gang members to avoid criminal liability.
The gang gave 30 percent for Opava and Konjarik for the lump.
It is in charge of criminal activity of a gang from 1999 to 2001.
Especially about robbery whose victims have often suffered serious health injuries, but also abuse of the power of the public actor and unauthorized weapons.
In the home surveys, the police discovered illegally held guns, steel bullets, laser targeter or self - fuel.
The gang was charged to be robbed by dozens of millions of crowns.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this process, the courts have already authorized the other Berdich robbery and a number of other people.
Other men in Berdich's neighborhood have been confessed in a different process, some causes have not yet come before the court.
The main treatment has been avoided by Thomas Pot and Maroshi Schulay, who remain in the Irish custody, where they are waiting for a definitive decision on their release to the Czech Republic to pursue.
Computer for children: 12 million
In exchange for children in the family, the lawyer of the damaged families, Igor Veleba, wants compensated 12 million crowns, plus judicial expenses.
For each mother after three million, for a father after two million and for a million children.
The hospital offers at least 200 000 for each parent.
The Legal Deputy of the Hospital Ondrej Dosubstan is therefore disagreeable with the proposal of Veleba.
"We reject this requirement, it is very high," said He after today's meeting.
"But to make an opinion on the anti-proposal, we need an expert assessment that the anti-party has made.
Let's find out if it's worth it.
But we do not believe that it will be in hundreds of thousands for all," he emphasized Dost.
The amount should be moved between 100,000 and 200 000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the cause, the family from Jabloń wanted every month when she did not raise her biological daughter, a million crowns.
He served Veleb as a basis for negotiations on a compensatory expert assessment that he was designed by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motola.
Children’s parents according to psychology and psychiatric experts suffered mental injury and stress in different degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even though they were confronted with regrets that they did not stop newborn substitutes.
Women are dealing with the reality of the experienced trauma, and what is happening right now, summarized the contents of Veleb.
Veronica and Nikola have been exchanged by sisters in the Trebic family last December 9th.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nicolas to Chermak's to Pribislavic and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslavi Trojan to Jablońovo.
Haytman Heights Miloš Pushed handed over each of the families at the end of October 100 000 crowns to compensate for expenditures that they had a problem of the trebian hospital that the country created.
All hospitals in Czech Republic are insured by the law to account for damage.
In the case of doubt, they must touch the reserve fund, and they may request the author’s assistance.
The courts have yet awarded relatively low compensation, the sums were counted according to hundreds of thousands, especially millions of crowns.
Soup lost Valash Kingdom
Soup pain lost a dispute about the Valash Kingdom mark.
According to the judge of the island district court, the King of Valash used the first time, but the project built a long work team around Tomah Harabish, who cooperated with the actor.
Soup did not attend the meetings today.
According to his lawyer, the cause is probably not over, and the client renounces.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabish and his team are parasited at the popularity of the Soup Bol," said the juice's lawyer after the process.
According to him, all of the words of the Kingdom of Valash will be reconciled by actors and comics.
Harabish has the same view.
"There's almost a ten-year work behind us.
The search for money and the invention of action," he said.
He thinks it's the cause of a dispute of money.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and could have something out of it.
They want to parasite our work," he added.
Lucrative Business
According to the court, the King of Valash used Soup for the first time in his television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by the actress of Radoslav Quick Fortune.
But then it was not related to the intention of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish lost the idea of exposing valish passports.
The original recessional action has resulted in trade and lucrative business activities to which Harabish then initiated the establishment of the Valash Kingdom.
In 1997, Souva agreed to give its name and signature in passports and even offered their owners discounts in visiting his farm and theatre show.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
Today, the Judge also stated that Harabish only used a naked idea that Soupka published in the manoeuvre for his business purpose.
"The Popularity of Boleslava Polyum of the Valash Kingdom project certainly helped," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabish and his team, who was intensely committed to him.
Cooperation of today-faithed parties continued until 2000, when Harabish organized official coronation in the Holy Spirit.
But since then, between Pouva and Harabish, the disputes have been accumulated, which elect "King Boleslav I".
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken by the singer Jarmila Schulaková as the queen's mother.
In 2002, the Supa filed on Harabish and his company of lawsuit, which the court rejected today.
It could clearly bring Harabish to a dispute about the throne and half of the princess.
The new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to tell the details and the term yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be like a royal ride to Slovak.
The King should be elected for a certain time.
Even Mr. Soup can log in," Harabish added.
Test Peugeotu 207 SW 1.6 VTi: missing prejudices
Honestly, I've never found much of Peugeot 206.
His driving characteristics were nothing much, the quality of ordering, management, and the production could also be labelled as a subsequent.
But on the market, there is now a successor of Peugeot 207, and he's much better.
And the SW van is still a little further, and I'm not left to think better than I think.
When I tested the classic hatchback of Peugeot 207, I complained for example about the head space on the back seats.
It's over here by complaint, because the caroserium van means that there's no longer going to be two-foot long in that direction.
In the world's flight
I'm going to pass the interior very fast so I can't repeat myself too much.
It's a totally designed design where I have the only lift to the poor middle tunnel.
I'd appreciate a little more design invention here when the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and there are times when we could complain about short seats or restraints.
Side leadership also has improved significantly against model 206.
As to the space, there is a sense of increase in the caroserium dimensions.
In the van, the already mentioned lack of space over the head.
Bug bags in the trunk
So the main thing on this car is his trunk.
I have to assess it as very well-accessible (including through the interpretation of the back window) and as a pleasant compensation.
Deaf places are equipped with restraints that are an ideal compromise.
It does not imply, it can be stretched and maintain harder objects.
But let's stop together over the hug.
It is according to the tables in the basic arrangement 428 l, which is rather a mean value against competition.
But not against the Czechest sales car of this class - the damage of Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with a new generation of the youth of the product, then we find that Peugeot remains with many famous 52 liters.
On holiday to abroad or when the carriage is loaded, this value is to be critical.
But if I had to raise the positives, I still have to mention the entire floor after the second row's folding or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with an explosive four-wave volume of 1.6 l with 88 kW performance.
And to tell the truth, that's what a 16-year-old girl should look like, starting a family hatchback.
She's quiet, she has little consumption, and she's mainly dragging.
If I compare her to the harmful period that leckdy works like she's got a screwed garment, I can only be excited of it.
The price will comment
Car price is not human.
However, we must remember that we tested a goodly equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The base price of the car with a 14-hour burner for 329 900 CZK will still go away.
Our aggregate is worth 410 900 kilos, which is quite enough.
Tested equipment Premium will then fit equipment for another 80 000 Kč above.
But we still had airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic removal launch, electrical control of the back windows...
It's just a car cost all over 531 900 Kč.
It's a lot, but count the supplementary equipment at Fabia and you'll get a very similar number.
So there's nothing left to decide for the mark.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools is unsuccessful
In British schools, children from Eastern Europe are gained, which causes concerns for further development of local education.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans is yet encountering a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and children of the original population are increasingly violent.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is well illustrating the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovenian immigrants begin to be degreeed.
The quarrels, the bullshit and the fights between the students have moved into relations between parents.
The situation went so far that the police detained a Slovak woman in Chatham, who beat a ten - year - old student.
The guilty defends the boy offended her by racist obsessions.
The police had to interfere even after the attack of two 12-year-old girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls were allegedly honoring racist notes and throwing stones on him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started swimming at us.
When I told him to let it go, the apples and pearls came upon us, and then he discovered his ass," she described another unpleasant event for the Times, the mother of the Slovenian students.
The complaints are on both sides.
One of the local residents even marked disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe for the fight for survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools between locals and immigrants is starting to be tense.
In Britain, 70,000 Slovakians have been registered here for work.
About 30,000 Slovak students then attend British schools.
Cuba The Beautiest Caribbean Island
For visitors, he is indeed the island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can happen to you if you choose correctly.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or sea, calm as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waitress offering pizza, ice cream and drinking cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf a rulet.
On the islands in the Caribbean, you will find it in a full and even richer calculation.
Only on one island, but you will find much more and that island is Cuba, the greatest and most beautiful of the Great Antiles.
For the Spanish, Cuba was the garden of their conquest of America.
Colombius called it the most beautiful place that human eye ever saw.
Hawana became a warehouse and translation of treasures that the Spanish in America robbed and transported to Europe.
And then the American era arrived.
The National Hotel grew up at the end of 20 years.
He was let by one of the chiefs of the American Mafia Lucky Luciano because everything in the United States was a crime (e.g. for prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were mine.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Hawana, high houses grew up, driving cars that belonged to the cultivation symbols of the 1950s of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a seat in San Francisco de Paula, a piece of Hawana, and he had his yacht in Coymar.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio, their signs of the showbusiness star and the politicians from all over America were left.
What about today?
On the walls in Havana Bodeguita, you can leave your autograph.
In the expensive hotel bar, the National will mix your cocktail according to your wish.
And those 50-year-old cultural cars are driving down Hawana so far because once imported syringes and fiaths in that salt and wet air have been rotten.
As Hawana is, especially her oldest part, significantly cruel, yet there are not so many beautiful colonial memories as there.
Other places are also transformed into beauty, like Trinidad.
Since the travel movement brings so much money needed, its development is green.
In the past 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana but especially on Varader, on the coast of Holguin and on islands like Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another libosco that is unique in the world and is especially appreciated by the lumps.
Third of the extensive plants were tied to sugarcases along the narrow railways of the pairs and motor trains.
Their car park has not been renewed for many decades, so there are functional machines whose classrooms are only in the museums.
Where are you going?
The most famous places most Cuba visitors will not pass.
So Varader or Hawana don't have to be a lot of describing.
I hope to remind you that in Hemingway’s already mentioned village there is a museum, and who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
Vinyales Valley One of Cuba's most remarkable corners is Vinyales Valley in the west of the island.
Bull vegetation grows from a calcium floor.
Mogots, calcium homoles and rocks rise from the bottom of the valley, and their fertile lands are captured in their dusts, so that the wind rocks are covered by thick growth.
The valley is a place where perhaps the most quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
With his final form you can meet if you visit any of the Havanese factories to produce cigars.
Maybe someone's gonna get interesting to know that the chile part of Major Zeman was rotated there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Fame and wealth brought him a trade with slaves and sugar.
Richness has become a beautiful and exhibition of a small town.
The colonial Spanish architecture, clearly affected by later French settlers, has almost changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Mountain of Escambray, is so far away that in the 1950s there was no road that would connect the country with the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay away.
Nothing happened there, and that's why nothing broke, everyone was glad to have a roof above his head.
If a person on Trinidad has more time than one afternoon, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the nearby area, such as Playa Ancon Beach, or the valley of Cukrovars.
In the evening, it belongs to Casa de la Musica, who lives after darkness, and music in it quiets over the wound.
Baracoa
The town in the east of Cuba is some of the most beautiful ones on the island.
This view has certainly affected the road itself.
Both roads that lead from Guantanam must overcome the high and partial mountains and pass through the nature that the human activity has almost not seen.
The Eastern island of Cuba has written UNESCO through its unbreaked nature to the list of world heritage.
They do the best chocolate in the church, they have Columbus Cross (in fact arising about a hundred years after Columbus float) and from the hill where there is a place of a castle and today's El Castillo Hotel, there are several table mountains, of which the most famous is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, mountains of Sierra Maestra, the Bay of pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Cabaret of Tropicana, the sanctuary of the Cuban patronate Caridad del Cobre, the santeria, the African religions that recognize descendants of some of the slaves, could all be described.
But as they say right, you better see once.
The unions in Afghanistan are passive, hard Americans.
Many soldiers and lack of the necessary equipment affect the progress of the mission in Afghanistan according to the United States.
The NATO Minister of Defence, Robert Gates, should plan a specific plan for the next summer.
The mission in Afghanistan does not take place according to the idea, the representatives of the countries in the Southern part of Edinburgh agreed in Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban movement, eight States involved today also discuss other plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week, through Robert Gates Defence Minister, the NATO units called for greater activity, the United Kingdom has seen the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and strengthening development assistance.
"The development in Afghanistan is massive, but the military force can only be a part of a solution.
The next is to allow the population to start further economic and security development themselves," the British Defence Minister Des Browne said to the BBC station.
Ninety percent
The activities of the Afghan rebels are the highest in the past five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 per cent in the Southern Helmand last year, even by 60 per cent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, of which about a quarter in southern territory.
However, according to the United States, allies have reached the same limit in the organization and equipment of units.
In particular, they ask for other helicopters, soldiers and experts for training in the Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the specific goals for the next time and ways to achieve them," Gates said.
Similarly, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
"I am not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of soldiers and equipment that we need, and that's not enough," Reuters De Hoop said to the agency at the conclusion of class talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's Passive
Among the countries participating in the past months, disputes also have been disputed whether all all the allies are taking the maximum in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticised for passiveness.
"The Germans have relatively numerous representations in Afghanistan.
But they are planted in areas where minimal violence and fighting rights are not as high as we are in the south and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
This week, the British Bullwar list Sun marked German soldiers as lazy men.
"Afghanian screwed up: Germans play while our boys fight," Sun wrote in a material filled with pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild went into an attack and printed a picture of the British unit at the football match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The state debt will be ditched on a bilion in 2009
Each Czech Republic owes more than 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to the end of September 842.7 billion crowns.
The government planned to borrow 159,2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry has reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns, thanks to better development of the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic increased to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
In nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
Since June, however, it decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Thus, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its state debt data from the beginning of October.
Each Czech Republic owes over 84,000 crowns.
Over the last year, the State owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"Meanwhile, the lower deficit for the next year seems to be able to overcome the bilion crown border until 2009.
The debt should be held between 900 billion and a billion crowns next year," said analyst Patria Finance David Marek for the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, analyst Next Finance Vladimir Pikora observes: "To exceed one billion we could get over the year 2009.
When exactly it will depend on the next budget we don't know yet.
If it turns out that the situation in the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move to 2010.
But I don't suppose that change," he said.
Bonds grow
The state debt is the debts of the central government and is primarily accumulation of State budget deficits.
The state debt is financed by cash instructions, national debts, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
Foreign debt of the State this year has increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123,3 billion crowns.
The so-called state debt trade at the end of September reached 803,3 billion crowns and fell by 13.7 billion crowns since June.
The average payment of state debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt between the first and third quarter has increased by 13 percent, which is really a lot of how the economy works.
Interestingly, growth is generated mainly in bonds where 20 percent increases.
It's bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that it will deal with something when retirement reform is here," Picora's data commented.
Better than expected
From the financing and management strategy for 2007, the government planned to borrow 159,2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry has reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns, thanks to better development of the state budget.
The amount is primarily the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion crowns.
Furthermore, it is the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency 13.3 billion crowns, a 10-million remuneration reserve, the financing of state debts for 43 billion crowns and the payment of loans from the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion crowns.
A woman is supposed to be brought to court today in Chartum for giving her name to a belly bear.
The British teacher, judged in Sudan for the insult of Islam, was sentenced to 15-day jail on Thursday night by the Chartum Tribunal and expelled, as stated by her attorney.
The British was accused of letting six to seven - year - old students give the bear bear the name Mohamed despite the prohibition of any display of the prophet of Islam.
She was subjected to the punishment of wounds by the bee.
This British 40-year-old teacher, acting at the Unity of High School in the Sudan Chartum, was arrested at her home on Sunday and accused of the insult of Islam and the rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Law, after the parents of several students filed a complaint with the Judanese Ministry of Education.
Our story begins in fact in September, in the month of the seventh month, when the teacher asks his six-seven-year-old students to choose a name for a classie bear bear.
"The children's mouth will be eight names, including Hasan, Abdulah and Mohamed," said Robert Boulos, director.
After a vote in class, 20 of 23 children finally choose as the favorite name Mohamed.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the Muslim prophet, but most of all, it is a very widespread baptism name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by a label: "My name is Mohamed."
The bear himself had no label with that name, but the problem is in the presentation of the prophet as an insult of Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues, Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said that she knows her well and that she would never do anything that could be insulting for any religious faith: "I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he said only "innocent doubt."
This view is shared by many students of teachers who describe it as "very careful to their students" and add that "without the class they speak of religion."
Recall that the Christian name Mohamed is also the second most commonly given Christian name in Great Britain, in English, in fourteen different ways.
This baptism name, often chosen by Muslim families, represents a way of worshiping the prophet (often being made to the firstborn).
But what are the rules for the use of this baptism name?
Is it possible for example to give toys?
Of course, it's a matter of interpretation.
During the last round of the negotiation of this Wednesday in Vienna, they did not reach an agreement on the future province status.
Finally, it's a failure.
The Serbs and Kosovo Albanians ended on Wednesday morning in Austrian Baden the sixth and at the same time the last round of conversations without being able to overcome different views of the future status of this separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both parties were unable to reach the status agreement," said the European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger during the press conference in Vienna.
His U.S. Visner emphasized that peace in the area is "in a bet" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristina to ensure their commitments to keep peace and to be prepared after negotiations.
"We do not expect violence at the nearest time, but we enter into a difficult period," he added, "it is obvious that the situation is tense."
The negotiation ends on 10 December
The negotiators of the Trinity, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last talk to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90% of the Albanian speaking population, could be shown in a clearer light on December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexandr Bocan-Charchenko are to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
The interviews in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and simultaneously the last round of negotiations since the UN, in August this year, the Trinity was committed to a new negotiation.
The Americans and the Europeans are counting that the interviews will be terminated on December 10th.
The Russians who have already blocked Kosovo's independence in the UN Security Council have insisted on continuing the negotiations after the most established term.
"Russia was and remains accorded to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Bocan-Charčenko.
Unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of governance of the international community, the West considers Kosovo's independence under the EU's oversight as the only unresolved solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is ready to declare its independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
"Oh, unfortunately, we have failed to make a deal," the President of the Kosovo Seediu's self-government announced in the research hotel since Monday, where this "last chance dealing."
Hashim Thaçi, former rebel commander of the Kosovo Albanian and the future Prime Minister of the Province, expressed regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan submitted by Belgrade "is the past that led to murders and deportations."
"Domain Effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic believes that the compromise still comes into consideration and warns the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of the possible unilateral independence of the province.
Belgrade is particularly afraid of the "dominary effect" in the area that is still unstable as a result of wars for independence in the 1990s.
"For Serbia, however, it doesn't mean," he said, "the compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has the right to veta.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"For Serbia only a solution from the Security Council is acceptable," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica said.
"This meeting took two years.
It must end as it began: on the ground of the Security Council."
The reporters Fatmir Sedjiu replied that "the last word of status will have the Kosovo Parliament" and added that if a unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian speaking inhabitants would be "on agreement" with the West.
Bush made an agreement on the Israelis and the Palestinians
At the beginning of an international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, convened from his popuda, US President George Bush announced that the Israelis and the Palestinians finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas agreed at the immediate initiation of negotiations with the intention of once and for all to solve 60 years of the lasting dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them make a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy "terrorism infrastructure" and Israel must end colonial activities, Bush declared and reminded the obligations that come from "travel map" to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The Chief of the White House emphasized that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian self-government of Abbas have aimed at "closing a peace treaty that will solve all unresolved issues without exception, including central issues".
This declaration includes three issues that are in the core of the dispute between the Israelites and the Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled in the conflict in 1948 from their homes in the territory of today's state of Israel.
Abbas took the words after the American President and pointed out that the subsequent negotiations were "a total and thorough" and that it touched all aspects of the solution, by mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, inter alia."
Then the tribunal appeared to be the Olmert, who expressed the opinion that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that it should "settle for it to be closed during 2008."
Bush defined the end of 2008 as the term for the realization of his "vision of two States", the Palestinian and Israeli, existing by themselves.
Saudi Arabia stated that it had accepted the commitment from Bush before she decided to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis was a success for Washington, launched a proposal adopted by all Arab countries offering Israel peace in exchange for leaving all Arab territories taken for war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "cross crossing in the Middle East History, especially because he fights the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," the Prince Saud judges in an interview provided by an Arab speaking journal to a saudi capital protected by the Saudi.
According to the prosecutor, the police don't take responsibility.
What exactly happened Sunday?
As it is always in such tiny reports from black chronicles, the official versions do not conform to what is spoken among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation, the General Inspection of the French State Police (Inspection generale de la police nationale, IGPN), the police car traveled on Sunday shortly after the 17th hour of Louise-Michel Street in the village of Villiers-le-Bel.
"The vehicle was not in the intervention regime, but it was on the patrol and traveled at a speed of 40 to 50 km/h, with no sidelights turned on," the police source explains.
The Green Motorcycle of the Kawasaki mark, "not registered and therefore without permission to ride in public communications" (read below), managed by two young men without a helmet, traveled "so high speed".
"The motorcycle hit from the left to the police car after he didn't give a favor to the right," a policeman said.
The test of alcohol mile in the blood carried out on the vehicle crew has shown negative.
The condition of the car (breaked ancestor, broken front glass, broken strikes) testifies the rapidness of the stroke.
Marie-Therèse de Givry responded very quickly by the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (Republique de Pontoise) and announced yesterday morning that IGPN had committed an investigation by "the acts of unintended killing and not providing assistance to persons in danger", whose direction is also taken by departementale de la with the raw publicity du Val-d'Oise (the director of the District Police Department of Val d'Oise).
At the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGPN investigation expels, in this stage, the police's responsibility for the accident.
Three witnesses of the accidents who were questioned on Sunday night confirmed the "versions of the police, because the minimotor approached them rather quickly to the left."
Some kind of rice, no doubt caused by shaving clipsons on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained screwed up until the police car was able to brake.
Vehicles have been secured and will pass through technical expertise.
Both victims were autopsy on the body yesterday.
What happened, right after that?
Yesterday, the Villiers-le-Bell rapidly broadcasted talks about the police to leave the crime scene without providing the first aid to two young men.
In all caution, IGPN also had to exclude "every serious offences" at this point.
"It is a more difficult aspect of the investigation that requires more search and with which you need to be very careful," police source stressed.
The "Liberation" journal met with the eyewitness of those moments that followed after the accident.
One of his windows leads right where the accident happened.
"We and my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, immediately ran down to try to resurrect them," the Witness said.
We couldn't do anything."
Then he saw a "cleaning, totally frightened cop.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young men, and the fourth spoke on the phone."
It faces the rapid tension and certainty that the situation of young people is hopeless, the police were taken by the car of the colleagues who arrived in the meantime.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left."
They also massaged their heart, but in vain.
"Let no one claim that the police authorities do not hurry to help young people.
These young people were provided with first aid.
The firemen are here immediately.
The prosecutor emphasized everything was done for their saving.
Tension in Pakistan grows
The Pakistanian police in Monday suppressed the first demonstration from the announcement of the exceptional state by General Musharaf, two days earlier.
In the city of Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating the measures taken within the exceptional state were injured by granates with tear gas, which, according to witnesses, used regular forces.
The last names answered by stones, which hurt several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were called.
Similar scenarios like Karachi and Rawalpindi, where cops attacked and injured lawyers.
Several of them were to be called.
In Islamabad, the High Court's attorneys called after the general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opponents, warriors for human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
The accession streets to the Supreme Court were overrun on Monday morning, with a view to preventing the meetings.
Other demonstrations were to take place in Multan (medium) and Peshawar (Northerwest).
On Monday, the movement of lawyers was acquired by the support of the religious parties assembled in the politically strong alliance of Muttahid Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "invited the population to send flowers to judges who have opposed the exceptional state and waste to those who made an oath before Musharafe".
Musharaf's promise doesn't work.
The Pakistan Supreme Court is a direct target of an extraordinary measure announced on Saturday night.
In the next days, the legality of the re-election of President Musharaf in an indirect presidential election, which took place on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry was removed and replaced.
"All we're witnessing is illegal, constitutional and against the judgments of the Supreme Court," the official stated in the Journal of The News.
The promise of Parviz Musharaf to surrender the leadership of the army and become a civilian president "does not pay" after the introduction of a special state, the Deputy Minister of Information, Tariq Azeem, announced on Monday.
It was expected to give up military uniforms until November 15th, when his first presidential mandate was completed.
The Minister of Information also confirmed that January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also reversed the last speculation in the country, according to which the representative of the head of the army was to order President Musharaf's home prison.
More than a third of pregnancy still forms unexpected pregnancy
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %), as well as misplanted or unexpected.
More than one pregnancy from three (36%) is today unexpected, it expresses studies conducted by the French Institute National d'études demographiques (Ined)- State Institute of Demographic Studies, 40 years after the adoption of the law of Neuwirt, which has legalized anti-conception in France.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %), as well as misplanted or unexpected.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization, still show 5% to 6% of failure, Indied estimates.
Anti-contracting law has only allowed a better "fertility control", the Institute states and notes that the level of use of hormonal contraception for women between 20 and 44 years has reached 60% today from 5% in 1970.
Finally, eight of ten births are well planned today.
One pair of five has even calculated for a month exactly and if possible on spring, which is considered the most pleasant annual period for the birth of the child.
Remarkable repair of the space station
More than seven hours of work in the universe needed astronaut Scott Parazinsky and members of his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) to relieve an outstanding solar panel that was necessary for further scientific activities of the station.
It was a risky output to the universe that collected records about the length of duration, distance from housing modules, the speed with which it was planned and the measure of "culturality", which the astronauts have made to repair.
The difficulties occurred on Tuesday, while the astronauts from the Discovery ship exposed the Harmona module, a large war office designed to install a European and Japanese scientific laboratory (see the frame).
This module is some kind of landing mole for the lab modules.
However, they need power to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to move the 17th-apoltonian power-producing module by means of solar panels already located on the ISS, so that it could cocktail at its final position.
After it was moved, the crew began to unload the module's 70-metre solar panels.
And in that, one of the panels, which lifted as a pulling harmonic, resulting in the cable scratch, was damaged on a plane nearly one meter.
The discharge was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
The astronauts who were originally to perform the discovery control exit and then go to fix another solar panel whose rotation system had a disorder, were forced to devote to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazinsky who was elected to fly to the end of the robotic arm of the ship added to the station's shoulder, and made repairs.
It's one of the best "spacewalkers" (a space walker) of the American Aviation and Universe Office (NASA).
High, solid, very contrary, has very well-formed breasts and long arms.
When he was 46 years old, this original job was authorized by a doctor to "operate" a "injured" solar panel.
After he examined the damage, he cut off the wrong cable and connected to the damaged places of some kind of "drogs".
Helped him with another "spacewalker", which remained near the comparison chamber, and from inside, other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, commander of the crew.
The tools he used, the mini-cocked isolation means, to prevent the electric shock from the solar panels produced by several hundred volts, they invented, and the astronauts made on the board of the station.
After the operation was complete, Scott Parazinsky waited for the panel to be completely distributed and then invented his tools and returned to the inside station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts returned to the Discovery ship to return on Wednesday, as planned, to Earth.
EADS actions weaken
The EADS actions are sensitively lost on the Paris Bureau after this air and defence industry announced that it would have to spend 1,2 to 1,4 billion euros to face the delay of A400M aircraft.
EADS lost 4% and now is on the Paris Bureau on 21.96 euros.
The financial group was forced to re-evaluate its predicted production results for 2007 as a result of delays resulting from slow progress towards the development of the A400M motor engine, which is the condition of the starting flight.
The price for reducing the delay in the military cargo aircraft supplies, announced in October, was calculated "to 1,2 to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than a billion for Airbus", the material company of the European EADS constructor announced.
For these costs, the EADS, next Thursday, when presenting its quarterly results, will be forced to announce a new vision of profit before the deduction of interests and taxes (EBIT).
The group also stated that the new cost assessment corresponds to a six-month delay.
Recall that the production results of the EADS in 2006 fell by 86 % in particular due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely the giant A380 aircraft.
The group initially assumed that the first delivery of A400M of the French army would be delivered to the French army in October 2009.
Decision for status quo
Sunday elections will take place without a stressful expectation: the Russians mostly choose President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming that, after the end of a very little free campaign, its aim for stability, and its authority.
Today, three days before the elections to the Parliamentary House, Russian President Vladimir Putin will inform the voters at public law stations the television message whose content is kept in secret.
It makes it a position of the leader of the United Russia, the procremelic party, which will allegedly celebrate the victory.
When the Ambassador of Foreign States accepted yesterday, the president did not let anything out of him and satisfyed the next attack on the West accused of interfering -- his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we wish the honorable, perhaps the most transparent and most open choices, the choices without the least defect of beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, it's not like that.
They condemn the campaign noted by different pressures.
The Leader of Communists Gennadius Zjuganov says that "they never made such dirty elections, nor for Jelcin."
After repressing demonstrations from the last weekend, the former world's champion in Gary Kasparov's chess, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, he continues to have a ban on his attorney.
"The Russians remained the mentality of the Homo Soviet"
Two more open questions are profiled in the background of these parliamentary elections of simple intense expectations:
- "Who will become Putin's successor at the presidential office?
The Official Journal published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; public candidates may be represented by 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third mandate in order.
However, no follower appears.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
He'll be Prime Minister?
Or by the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powered parties of the United States of Russia, who chooses the government and the president?
Anyway, the departing power wins all lines in parliamentary, as well as in the presidential elections.
It's tradition.
"The Russians remained homo-sovietical mentality, and they do not feel to be masters of their fate," sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center of Levad, believes.
The historian Nikolaj Koposov from St. University in Sankt Petersburg notices the time-related connections: the civil society has gained, in this country, Christian five centuries after Europe, late; the famous common spirit has delayed the creation of individualism.
After Liberal Reforms of the 1990s, "Putin has imposed a paternist model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, rather, that this new paternizm has not carried terror but some economic welfare," Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians today "will give up personal responsibility" which they proved shortly after the SSSR breakdown.
"Why to think?"
This phenomenon concerns all social layers, including the trade world.
Even the official elite intends to maintain status quo: 65 governors (the total number of 85 heads of the Russian regions) are directed by local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, like in the 1990s, a synonym of chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also, in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote extremists.
The conclusion of Tamary Redničko, 40-year-old professor: "Why to think?
Those who are in power are not so bad, so why change them?"
Loaded Memory
After more than sixty years in the confidential regime, the Nazi archives from Bad Arolsen, which face the fate of 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, are opened to the public.
47 million archive documents stored within 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were accessible only for "humanitar" purposes, which means individually and namely, on request of the former victim or its authorised persons.
Eleven States authorised by the archives management, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed on their opening to scientists and historians in May.
Since the ratification process of this agreement is over by all States, opening yesterday has efficiency.
Sensitive information
Free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow them to explore "specially the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the health of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comite international de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently there were several countries, including Germany, against the availability of these named public documents, due to the sensitive nature of some information.
What are predicted homosexuality or mental infections of certain deportation victims.
Registers of concentration camps or arresters compiled by Gestape have been gathered after the war for practical purposes to find deported or forced work of the subjected civilians, to bring them evidence of their interaction in order to open their way of compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are dealt with dozens of individual requests.
However, for part of the Scientific Community, access to Bad Arolsen is only a limited benefit.
"None of these documents can be expected significantly new," said in 2006 Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism of Berlin Technische Universität.
EU and India want to appoint free trade contracts in 2008
Currently, bilateral trade between Europe and India reaches almost 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is the first business partner in India and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are expecting the signing of the free trade contract in 2008, announced by the European Commissioner for Trade, Peter Mandelson and his Indian skills Kamal Nath.
In April last year, the EU Foreign Ministers gave the Green Commission to launch negotiations in order to sign free trade contracts (accords de libre échange, ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asia (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India is now reaching almost 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is the first business partner in India and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, to the ninth EU trade partner.
"The Free Trade Agreement is a great deal of both economies" and "Indea gets a better marketing access to 450 million prosperous Europeans," said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giant will change "47 billion euros in goods" and "10 billion euros in services", said this week, Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission in New Dilli, regretting that the bilateral trade "not yet has reached its entire potential." The EU and India meet at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Dilli, with the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durao Barrosy, on Friday.

The English bank took awareness of the concerns and offered 10 billion pounds in the five-week auction
On Thursday, the English Bank has shown that it intends to mitigate the current concerns that the conditions on the credit market will be reinstate and announce the offer of 10 billion pounds in the five-week auction for a basic interest rate of 5.75 %, an offer applicable in an unusual long term.
"In order to facilitate the concerns under which the conditions on the financial markets will be very inadmissible at the end of the year and give banks greater certainty in the way to ensure its cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period, which begins on 6 December as a five-week operation on the open market," she announced in the communication.
The Bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the financial market on 6 December in 12.15 GMT until 10 January at a basic interest rate.
It seems to be the first time that BOE pumps cash on the financial market in the five-week operation on the open market.
It usually takes a week.
BOE adds in its communication that "is ready to implement further measures to maintain interest rates between the banks at the same level with its basic rate.
The inter-bank interest rate was on Wednesday at 5.829 %.
The three-month interest rate was 6,6 %, which is the highest number from 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to the tax rates that dismissed banks from the use of this offer.
According to certain speculations enhanced by the currency course towards the euro, many have preferred to decide for the amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, Union for Human Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) are refused to deal with the proposals of Socialists (PS) on purchase capacity
The UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss on Thursday the individual paragraphs of the socialist proposal of the Communities Law, which equals the rejection of the text.
At the agenda of the draft law, the text of the draft law was received within the so-called socialist "nest" (the meeting initiated by a single Membership club) and contained a ten of measures taken in the PS Presidency Tuesday, including an increase in employment premium by 50 %, renewal of tipples, transport check or rental regulations.
Since UMP and NC voted against the negotiation of individual paragraphs (180 votes to 115), the meeting was concluded after the general debate that became an opportunity to exchange views, sometimes more alive, between most and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's TV performance on purchase.
The Chief of Members of PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club will reiterate these proposals in full in the form of supplements to the amendment proposal of the Finance Act, which will negotiate the House next week.
A new festival is born
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presents in Philadelphia forms a new festival, this promotor/producer Vineland Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival of the Republic of the British Order Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it is honour to work with a man who inspired the current Festival Movement in America without any excess," said Charlie Jones from the C3 Billboard.com server.
C3 produces a Chicago festival Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland in New Jersey is a summer target station of campers.
The festival should take place from 8 August to 10 August at a private farm of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Festival of the Republic, earlier known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most famous festival directors.
In 1989, the Reading Festival Cormidates in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people annually.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added to his portfolio Leeds Festival, then in 2006 the Festival of the Republic founded the Latvia Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn is also in charge of production, licenses and organisational tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which is now capable of up to 177 500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 calls Glastonbury "the most inspiring event" that he's ever experienced and says that his company and Melvin Benna are working coherently on giving the region a festival event of European style.
"Originally, we chose Philadelphia as a market and together with the Fairmount Parks Commission we worked hard to set up a festival in the centre of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We have been with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by the project.
Unfortunately, however, because of the current city’s leadership, we have been put into politics, Charlie Jones adds.
"Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are about to set up a great festival in a unique place that will serve the people of Philadelphia as a result."
C3 Presents resurrected Lollapalooza in the Chicago Grant Park in 2005 after they arrived at the festival scene by organizing the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The gross markets of both events for 2007 were $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals are in the city environment.
"European model of Melvin Benna Festival occurs in the village, while our festivals are more in green areas in cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to conquer both concepts in a certain way in order to create both the impression of the rural festival after the European and city after America."
Vineland is nearly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland Municipality, including the mayor, is excited to support the implementation of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The last appointed refuses to give up the terms of the agreement, however, says, "they are sufficiently advantageous to allow them to invest in such a event and welcome the festival that he will have, hopefully, for a long-term period."
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will capture 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been dispatched to groups, but nothing can still be confirmed at the time the program was just given to the press.
"Vineland will have a rocky breath, but music there will be a spectrum to attract a wide spectrum of the audiences, if possible," says Carlie Jones.
Partners of C3, who received the Price of Top Independent Promoter in the last year of Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood's film studio to Montreal when the Terminator himself stands against it...
This convincing mission is one of the missions of the delegation.
However, his mandate is "politically difficult" because governor California Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it hard for the Governor to fall into the nails?
"You need to be careful, it's a industry who decides where he's going.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal favourable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer those which they will consider best," he said.
Festival Commitment
However, for this moment, Denise Turcotte is the priority of promoting the local film.
The hunting for Oscars has already started.
At all West Coast festivals, whether these are festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattl or San Francisco, it will be about, presenting québec movies, alerting them and ensuring that directors provide interviews.
The age of darkness had a good publicity a few weeks ago at the 30th anniversary of Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January, he will be presented at Palm Springs International Festival.
Shake hands with the Devil is offered in Santa Monica and will be presented in November 30th anniversary of Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month also Québec presented four short-term and four full-night movies at the American Film Institute of the Fest.
Will it be at the end of the year on the maraton market? Experty divided the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks left by the end of the administrative year, and the investors have hands with me in expecting that there will be a traditional maraton at the end of the year.
But this year, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
The Bank of Banif believes that "the month of December on the bureau has a positive progress in statistical terms".
However, it is not appropriate to create predictions exclusively on the basis of statistics, in particular because markets are searching, at least in short term, certain doubts."
These experts do not assume that the bureau has been broken over the past weeks, and they state that "the burz market is maintaining the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest in relation to the missing guarantee alternatives, especially the solid income affected by the impact of the turnover on quality securities, both in long and short sections".
They therefore believe that the bureau will have a more calm progress, not without volatility, "usually because there is no known impact on the probably falling rates of the FED (Federal Reserve System), given the high level of oil prices and the risk of inflation pressures".
Javier Barrio, head of the BPI bank in Spain, agrees that it is not the right time for a courageous declaration that it will be a maraton.
"There are no reasons for joy," this expert assures.
Ibex lost nearly 4% of the maximum values recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15 945.7 points.
Still, all experts don't have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could end a year closer than 16,000 points by transcouping portfolios and traditional pension contributions that happen annually at this time.
However, this expert suggests that this year everything will be a little different, since he believes that the maraton will happen early, in the second December week after the extended weekend at the Day of the Constitution.
The mentioned analyst does not believe that volatility would affect marketing.
Federico Olucha, analyst of Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching the technical level and "this is why we can observe the reflection of the index resulting from the US reports on the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analytics are consistent with the selection of titles that will ensure that Ibex is brought to the new maximum cats.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that this year is a row on strong titles.
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco provides that growths will go hand-handed with banking and industrial sector.
Building companies will also be able to enrich on this marathon if it happens.
"ACS has been regaining its position for several months and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will go the same way," the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be forward in the last part of the year by increasing sales during the Christmas selling period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that technology will also be very good, even though they are not too represented in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December was only in two cases of failure.
The real maraton took place at the end of the year 2003, in the administrative year, when the burz markets ended the crisis caused by scratching the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 returned 28.17%, December recorded increase by 6.68%.
We'll see if 2007 will be the fifth profit year (before Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether he can have his maraton at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular bank will be opened 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Bank Popular decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred placed in the most trading parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max mark, are a great change for the bank.
Also for other Spanish entities, because it is the first group that decided to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening time of its branches until 20:30 hours and open on Saturday from 10 to 20:30 hours.
BBVA, another group that also several times assured that he wished to extend the opening time of his branches, has not yet decided to this step.
Meanwhile, it will conclude an agreement with the Boards on the cancellation of the opening time 75 % of its offices on Saturday in exchange for the extension of the opening period for one afternoon, even though not for the public.
The results of this experience of the Popular Bank will be crucial for other entities to be attached to this initiative, which supports the opening period of trade, or not.
That's exactly the objective of the project that the Popular Bank has set up.
To acquire individual customers who go to these places for their shopping, smaller and medium-sized companies, farmers and trades from the selected streets where the branches will be opened.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain in about 18 months, because it is not about opening new branches, but only adjusting the existing.
For this reason, the bank modernizes the branches already in its business zones by adapting them to the client profile in individual streets.
This means that the extension of the opening time is supplemented with another concept of the branch space and with a new, more current design in lighter colors.
The Business Director of the Bank, ANgel Rivera, assures that this restructuring is not a big investment, but a larger burden of staff, since it goes from six employees to the branch office to eight to nine.
The branches will even equip spaces for meetings of small and medium companies and will sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
Bank Popular has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Angel Rivera explains.
The branches were selected in the Madrid streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Via and according to River, it seemed to be a happy choice.
Bank Popular currently has 2500 branches.
And another 60 specialized for immigrants operated under the Mundocredit mark, also has a very long opening time and opened even on Sunday and on holidays.
PopularMax branches will not monitor BBVA model when a number of its branches offers a large scale of non-financial products.
'We don't want to compete with our clients,' says River.
They just agreed with Telephonica to sell cell phones through external staff.
Telecinco first doubled the value of its rival Antena 3
We did it.
This sentence was expressed yesterday by Paolo Vasile, executive President Telecinco, of his satisfaction in the conclusion of the trade, when he found that the television that he was running has doubled his rival value of Antena 3.
Only one thing ruined his joy: 'What I am sorry is that it didn't happen because we could grow more, but because we fell less,' he said.
And he emphasized that, thanks to the weak market, we have fallen less.
Telecinco ended the trading by 2,54% yesterday.
This profit moved their loss in the past part of the year to 15.66%.
The bureau value of this company controlled by Mediastom (with 52% capital) with the participation of Vocent (other 13 %) is to reach 4,488,88 million euros according to Bloomberg's data.
Her contestant Antena 3, who fell by 1,52% yesterday and totally fell by 40.5% since January, has a half value of 2 193,46 million.
The value of other telecommunications companies that have been evaluated is 3.571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2.518.53 million Prisa (Cinco Días) and 1.779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile comparison with Antena 3, we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is, how much we can do on the same market, at what price and how we estimate it in tracking."
Telecinco announced last week that this year she counts on overcoming a billion gross revenues from the advertisement become the first TV channel, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, the executive President Telecinco and Publiespaña, a branch that ensures the advertising of the group.
If the predicted data were really targeted, this TV channel would have recorded the increase of the advertising turnover by 3.6% in 2006, compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% (and reached 734.4 million), while the net revenues of this TV increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors to which the analysts are focused is the best relative development of Telecinco on the market, which has already been retained: in 2006, this company, President of Alejandro Echevarría, shared 100% of its profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that even though it is soon to decide, this coefficient could change after buying 33% of Endemol together with its Mediaset mother firm.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to satisfy our shareholders who have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market in these moments is exhausting.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced his estimates on Telecinco’s profits in 2008 4% and 7% in 2009.
This is caused by, they explain that the estimated growth of income from 0.5 % to 8.4 % in 2008 and from 5.5 % to 5.1 % in 2009.
The same company reduced the anticipated profit of Antena 3, which was 4,5 % in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.
3 opinions
Article 1 is replaced by the following:
Ibersecurities: it recommends that both titles be purchased primarily on the basis of an increase in dividend and a long-term sustainable potential.
‘Article 2
Caia Madrid: it evaluates better Telecinco (group) than Antenna 3 (continue) because of its "public advantages" and the growth of trade.
‘Article 3
JPMorgan: In both cases it recommends that they do not appreciate them, because they face "like threats" (soiled market and the worsen economic environment).
Congress approved the transposition of the MiFID from 1 November
In conjunction with parliamentary negotiations, which have been concluded today by the vote of the Congress on the novels included in the draft law, the Government has subjected the public hearing of the new law to both enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the individual parties have similarly raised the efforts of Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to guarantee the protection of investors and detailed regulations of the activities of entities necessary for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which amends the Treasury Act, proposes the modernisation of the financial markets and also strengthens the protection of the investors, improves the supervisory powers of the State Commission for the Market of Securities (CNMV) and supports cooperation between individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation allows the provision of financial advice services to both specialised companies, both physical or legal persons, and creates a new type of companies providing financial services (ESIS), financial consultation (AFI), which are attached to securities, mediator offices with valuable papers and portfolio management companies.
Furthermore, the number of systems for operational operations with financial instruments is expanded by connecting multilateral trading systems and the internalisation systems of orders to compete to the current market markets.
The Act further compels companies providing investment services to disseminate information on the key aspects of their commercial profile, exposure to risk and risk management and requires a report of all operations carried out to simplify the supervision by the CNMV.
During the deliberation in the Congress Commission, several amendments have been included to ensure that securitised claims are considered "complicated" financial instrument in view of high-risk risks for the investor, which has been demonstrated by what happened in the United States with high-risk mortgage debts (subprime).
Furthermore, the transfer of the directive was used to legally deploy functions that can be held by the bacalari in the economy and management of the business 30 years after the Royal Decree approved in 1977, which entails the professional functions reserved for economies.
At the same time, the Senate set up new professions in the financial sector, such as the intermediary who will work out externally, will not require CNMV authorisation and will be able to provide services for trade in products and customers for various investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised ISC increased by five tens in November to 4.1 %
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the European Union Inflation Index, provides preliminary information about the development of prices in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to Eurostat policy and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data in time and quality comparable with those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator is calculated by using the same process that is used for the Harmonized Consumer Prices Index, but using different statistical modelling methods for estimates of information that are not yet available during the publication.
The Spanish INE (State Statistics Institute) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only orientative, and therefore it must not necessarily be consistent with the final data incorporated on 14 December this year.
"ISC will continue to be maintained at relatively high level"
The second vice-president of the government and the Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, declared that the November increase in ISC to 4.1% is a "temporary number", but also predicted that the price index would continue to be relatively "level" in the next months.
In any case, Solbes in Congress's balloons specificated that "although it is not a favourable number," the inflation diferenceal of Spain against the currency Union has been still "more or less" in the past two years.
He also explained that November "has been less surprised" than the previous month when the government did not count on such a high increase.
"We expected approximately 4% value," the Minister of Economy said to the presentation.
Virgin plans to earn with Northern Rock 42 billion euros within three years
Since the Northern Rock bank entered the crisis in the mid-September and had to loan an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its contributions fell by more than 50% to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros).
The Bank then managed records of more than 25 billion pounds, which gradually decreased by the uncertainty of customers in the course of two and a half months, even though the government offered a 100 per cent guarantee for the money and extended it until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin company, which replacs the name of the entity with its commercial financial mark Virgin Money, needs to obtain about a quarter of the revenues invested in the British banks in the next three years, so that it can gain the remaining 18 billion pounds and achieve 30 billion targets.
The group of Richard Branson, known in the United Kingdom by its impressive advertising campaigns, plans to spend 50 million pounds (approximately 70 million euros) annually for advertising and marketing to achieve its goals.
The Northern Rock Bank marked this week the offer of the Virgin Consortion, which forms three other companies, such as those who prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor Totany arrested for alleged corruptive practices in construction
Today, the Civil Guard has detained the current mayor of the city of Totan (of the People's Party) because of its alleged involvement in corrupt practices in the construction that were discovered this week.
A secretary of the board and the chief of the local police was arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced in May this year Juan Morales, the current human messenger and the mayor of the community, who, according to the research sources of Cadena SER, could be the head of the entire business.
The police continue to monitor the buildings of the board and the construction committee and not to exclude further arrests in the next hours.
Furthermore, the lawyer Juan Morales, the chief suspect of corrupt practices in the construction that were discovered at the beginning of this week, was accused.
As Caden SER informed yesterday, the Human Advocate of the Member of Juan Morales, who was verified, arrested at the time of leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
In addition, according to the research sources, the investigation of Morales' alleged selection shall provide for its signing of the construction agreement with a galician construction company which has been overqualified by 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently detained.
Bono accepted the offer of a State headed by the PSOE candidate and, if they win, the President of the Congress
Former Minister of Defence, José Bono, accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of Socialists José Luise Rodriguez Zapater to stand in the next general elections leading to the candidate PSOE (Spain Worker Socialist Party) in Toledo and, if socialists win the general elections, he becomes President of the Congress.
So, at the press conference, the PSOE secretary for the organization of José Blanco and Bono itself announced it after the meeting with Zapater, which took place today on noon in the federal site of the party.
The executive chief has reasoned the former minister that in political life "is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best."
He further noted that "yes, it seems" that this La Mancha policy will be the candidate of the Socialist Party to the President of the Congress, if the socialists win in the next elections.
As President of the Congress, Bono would replace Manuel Marín, who published his decision to non-continue in the next general elections and to leave his active political career so as to be able to fight climate change in university education on 15 November.
Former Minister admitted that the President of the government constantly insisted on him to return to the high-level policy that he left two years ago.
He further stated that, as citizens know who will be the Deputy Minister of Economy, if PSOE wins elections, his party wanted to inform the "transparent form" who will be chairman of the Congress.
If Bono gets this function, he hopes that the House will turn into a "home of respect and not a scream" and aims to "will be more like citizens".
"Sometimes, unfortunately, the only place in Madrid, where there is no peace and peace to speak, the congress, the President of the Government in the Senate, at one occasion, was interrupted 26 times."
He also expressed commendable words to the current President Manuel Marin and "his good work" and did not yet imagine himself in his place so that he did not decline to what his opponents might consider as "majesty".
Climate Propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to ruthless persecution, both those who view skepticly his predictions and those who prefer other political and social fights must prove firm cohesion.
Furthermore, the leader of the movement that is the chairman of the government like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and is even going to sign the "new treaty with the planet".
This proposal forces him to explain why the activity or inactiveness of his government have contributed significantly to the failure of Spain to fulfil the Kyoto Protocol in the European Union.
Who is responsible for this non-compliance, in which sectors this is happening and why his government, the government of the contract, did not stop it.
Furthermore, it makes him as clear as possible to explain to the Spanish what measures he plans to take to reduce climate change.
Which companies will be damaged, which habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective savings will have to take and what economic consequences it will have.
In other words, who sacrifices himself and who pays for saving the planet.
But we haven't waited for such explanations, we can't wait.
It's just because you have to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures are unpopular.
Dear, uncomfortable and threatening businesses and private accounts.
Even one cent of the gasoline price proposed by the PSOE (Spain Workshop Socialist Party) seemed so risky to Zapater in terms of elections that he hastened to reject it.
In other words, it's to save the planet so that it doesn't stand for anything, pure propaganda, passwords missing any real meaning.
Impact phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And the contracts with the planet; this gentleman is so useful for the election campaigns that he doesn't even speak, blames, does not require, but is decoration of the ownerships and awakens him.
If it is limited to being a virtual contract party and does not ask us to ride the bike and cool with the windscreen.
Mayor and Chief of Local Police Totany detained for suspicion of corrupt practices in construction
As the research sources informed, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the city of Totan, the "human" of José Martínez Andreo, the chief of the local police, the secretary of the city of the city of the City, and one businessman in hospitality, for suspicion of committing crimes in construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and transferred to the Council, in which its premises are now placed together with a number of policemen who have also joined the Commission for the construction and the urban economy business with industrial lands and apartments.
These three arrests arrived at six last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, during the overqualification operation of Vice over 2 million hectares of agricultural soil on the ground suitable for the establishment, so that the Galician Nouaria, after paying illegal commissions during the last election period, could build 4,000 homes.
Furthermore, two other persons were not arrested, but were accused of a shorter proceeding in the court of the first instance of the city of Totana.
Six first arrested were passed to the court today.
According to information sources, the former mayor of Totany is investigated and today a member of the autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, the owner of the real estate office, registered today in Totana and his current friend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous area.
Manuel N.A., director and owner of the group of Nuaria, a lawyer and a businessman from Viga, was arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra province), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to that group and despite the payments were transferred.
The investigation is conducted by a group for criminal offences in the construction of the Civil Guard Operations Unit, whose members, except arrest, also conducted eleven examinations, mostly in companies related to arrested, with the seats in Madrid, Vigu, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid Province) and Totana.
In Totana, only one person was trapped in the area of a very famous company owner for products from poultry meat that could serve as a mediator.
The Nuaria group was assigned to the position of the largest residential complex of the city of Totana, which would represent building more than 5,000 homes, golf fields and two hotels with "spa".
The company gained 2,2 million square meters of soil in Totana, which was requalified and its project had to double the settlements of the community with 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group forms companies such as Autes and Inomonuar, which are devoted to support the market in real estate, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Corunj, Venezuela and the Fernando el Catolico square in Vigo, Hogartel, which is devoted to direct marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.
And that's what happens.
Article 1 is replaced by the following:
If you don't mind, we'll leave the Book of the month, and we may be attacked by other appreciation and competition in the meantime.
I already got something in my head.
Guys, life is a change.
Of course you can come with ideas.
‘Article 2
Our Finnish writer sends us this comment from yesterday's issue of the most important Finnish newspapers Helsingin Sanomat (by the way at the beginning of the PISA report on the education level in the world), which refers to what the newspaper printed on November 18th, the same day when the book of Blackburn was criticized in the same way:
"The content of the subject of philosophy entered public discussions in connection with the tragedy in school in Jokela.
The victim killer, a high school student, quoted in his texts of Platon and Netzsche.
Hekka Elo, the philosophy council, asked the Helsingin Sanomat pages to take critical opinion on Platon and claimed that it was not necessary to discuss Netzsche in the mandatory basic course of philosophy in high schools."
‘Article 3
One colleague informs the introduction of a crime offence of downloading from the Internet to the criminal law:
A. The download of one song would be a criminal act with a rate of six months to one year.
On the contrary, when you cut down in a shop of boards below 400 euros, it is considered just an offence (§ 623.1).
B. If you leave up to 1,000 euros in the store, the robbery is already a criminal offence, but the penalty rate is lower than downloading (art. 234 of the Criminal Law).
C. If you steal the car and return it after 40 hours, the criminal rate is still lower than downloading (art. 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in the fights than the exchange of compacts.
Participating in exclusion has a rate from three months to one year (§ 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange of compacts would be a rate from six months to two years
(§ 270 of the Criminal Act).
E. Sexual disturbance in employment is considered less serious than downloading a film on DVD according to § 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The unauthorized distribution of copyright films is secondly punished than the provision of pornography to youth materials (§ 186).
So if my colleague's not wrong, someone's got a hand.
‘Article 3
My physician pushed me one of his articles on strange research called "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
The feelings that cause the monthly payment of employees depend on how many colleagues earn.
The study was conducted at the Bonne University through magnetic resonances on the томographic and results are published in the latest issue of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and the manager of the Group of Views of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The largest activation was happening when the researcher responded correctly and his colleague was wrong."
Research workers observed that if they both succeeded, they received the same salary, the activation was mild, but when one got a double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.

What insurance is suitable for me?
Insurance of a car protected by the driver in case of an accident is a significant cost which depends on different factors such as age, status, sex, length of hold of the driver's license, type of vehicle to be secured or used, etc.
Having a car is just a start.
Selecting the appropriate car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to figure out what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between insurance and insurance.
This commitment takes into account the form of a insurance contract which provides that the insurance undertaking will receive an agreed insurance amount at a certain level for taking account of the injury payments in case of an insurance event.
Insurance is the insurance price which is fixed in the light of different factors such as age, status, sex, the length of holding the driver's license, the type of vehicle which is insuranceed or used, etc.
Insurance companies are fixing their prices on the basis of statistics, so the more likely there is a crash, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both 25 years old and women must pay lower insurance, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index in view of their caution.
The same way, on the basis of the controls, the insurance company concluded that persons living in a marriage have less crashes than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of rides, thus likely to have an accident.
The rate of driving increases the probability.
There are many variables that insurance providers consider when they set the insurance price.
Therefore, the driver must examine the situation well to choose such insurance as the best matches his insurance profile.
We will show here the most important variables for the choice of the type of insurance, which, in addition to the type of insurance, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of fifty-five have met with different disadvantages such as lack of experience in management and short hold of the driver's license when they want to arrange insurance at an available price.
Although the ideal for good cover is insurance against all risks, there are even cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose insurance against all risks with a insurance discount in order to obtain insurance coverage of all risks, but at a more acceptable price.
This type of contract would assume the client's participation in the remuneration of the insurance event.
"The part of the remuneration of the insurance event provided by the client will be established in advance in the determination of the insurance price, which would be higher and less participating," explains Luis Noguera, headquarters of First Europe in Spain, the Internet insurance mediator.
Another option is the insurance extended to other operating participants by ensuring the client against the damage caused by other persons, but not against the damages on his own car.
Furthermore, it would be insuranceed against stealing, fire and loss of vehicles.
Recommendation.
If you're aged twenty-five, try to be careful and avoid the crash as possible, because it will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce insurance in the future.
The bonus is the reduction of the basic rate of the insurance company.
On the contrary, minority is an increase in the basic rates mentioned.
"Bonus and little will depend on the insurance and its profit.
If the insurance had a good year, it would be able to afford to increase the bonus," Noguera explains.
After the border exceeding twenty-five years, the drivers have easier when they go to contract insurance, since the client's risk index is reduced, thanks to the experience gained.
For this reason, it is most recommended that insurance be arranged against all risks of discount.
"Young people are usually unable to use the experience gained in advance at the time of the crash, and not in the management," the director of the European society in Spain assures and adds that most of the crashes occur in the second year of the proceedings when the "new fear has already been overcome."
However, if the client is married but still has no children, it is better to arrange insurance against all risks if his economic situation allows.
Insurance families are considered to be a client with the lowest risk index and therefore their illustrations will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be the insurance against all risks of the insurance discount (which could amount to 300 euros) or at a high bonus, the insurance extended to other operating participants, starting in the third year from the purchase of a vehicle.
"Their management is more calm and their purchasing is higher, so they can afford to acquire the highest discount," says Luis Noguera.
Insurance is recommended for the retirement of all risks of the insurance discount (which amounts to EUR 150) or the insurance extended to other operating participants if a high bonus has been achieved.
It should be said that car insurance is important not only because it protects drivers in the case of a crash, but also because it represents a significant cost, which is a good reason for a proper study of the possibilities of insurance, which would be the most suitable for us in relation to our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get on AC Milan point that means 8-final
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their powers this Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium in an effort to obtain a point that they lack to achieve their relevant objectives in the conclusion of the Champions League, because it would be the first to Italy and the Scots would decide on the location.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured the procedure in the fifth remisis game in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but he needs one more to make sure that Shachtior will not get before him with six points that will play with Benfika, who has four points.
These two games of group D will be played a week before the sixth bike ends, since AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where the 13th in the semi-final, in an effort to reach the final that plays the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed before the others and the indecisive outcome of the Giuseppe Meazzy stadium seems to be the most likely, even though both men try to fight for victory, because the Italians won't want to tactize on homeland and Celtic knows that after the win, he would be the first and secure a better place in the 8-final.
The man Gordon Strachan could have enough for the process even if the Shachtior does not win, but cannot rely on it, because at the same number of nine points Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow last week (2:1), but won in the first direct fight (2:0).
So the AC Milan players will try to ruin the evening to Scots who believe that the second time they get into the semi-final in the reorganized Champions League just as they beat them in the same match in the last competition with the goal of Kaka in prolongation (1:0) after state 0:0 in the basic time.
Hope to win "rossoneri" will be the Shachtior for whom it is worth winning only if Celtic loses, both for the 8-final process and for the continuation of the EUFA.
Benfica, although it's the last and there's no possibility to continue the highest European competition, could win a third place by one victory, so she would play in EUFA.
The first concert in the Spice Girls tour attended 20,000 people in Vancouver
The Spice Girls group started in Vancouver (Canada) before 20,000 viewers of their first tour since the time it broke in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sports Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver declared that their group's re-connections are "great".
About 20,000 people bought tickets so that they could be present to a concert that also included a video that lies with the history of this group, which caused sensation at the end of the 1990s.
Return and world tournaments occur at the same time as the new album they are released by EMI in Spain, which brings the choice of their main successful songs, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared at the stage of decorationed bracelets given to them by Posh Spice, British footballist David Beckham.
This sportsman was in the audience flooded by GM Place, even though the nervous Victoria forbidden a few days ago.
Before Victoria Beckham's presentation, she said about the British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what she thinks of the show."
"Sports Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "for the disputes between us" caused two years later the dissolving of the five-party group, has also shown its nervousness at the meeting with the journalists two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw the world's public opinion changed, the view of Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made my decision," she said to Chisholm about the reconnection of the group that she had dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that through time, "the things have come straight and we all love each other."
But many things have changed since Spice Girls had last come together in 1998.
So in the beginning, according to the TV, the group flew to Vancouver by Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived, the troops of the babysitters were expecting them at the airport.
Five have a total of seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (5th and 7 December).
It's going to be in Madrid on December 23th.
Anxieties for a new gas argue between Russia and Ukraine
There is a dispute between Russia and Ukraine about the gas prices, thus increasing the risk that Russian supply of this fuel can be affected to Western Europe.
Most Russian fuels exported to the European Union (EU) are guided by pipes across Ukraine and any dispute between these two countries is closely monitored.
Kyev warned that if Moscow raises the gas prices to Ukraine, Russia will account for higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between these two last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kyev and Moscow comes when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state owned the gas monopol, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says that Ukraine will have to account for more, because he agreed to pay up to 50% more for gas that he gains from the neighbouring Turkmenistan.
The analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its gazpro supplies.
"It is important to us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," the Ukrainian Minister of Economy, Anatolij Kinah, said to the Agency Reuters.
"The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees (to Western Europe) across Ukraine."
The last larger dispute between Moscow and Kyev caused a reduction in supply from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a rude fall of exports to Western Europe, which rapidly increased prices.
The Russian gas represents one quarter of the supply to the European Union.
Russia has the biggest gas supplies in the world, but much of them remains insufficient.
As a result, Gazpro is supplementing its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian Republics.
NHS "must control foreign employees"
The supervisor said that the Scotland NHS compartment must improve the control of criminal registers for extra-European employees.
The recommendation from the President of the Highest Control Office Robert Black arrived after a foreign doctor acting in Scotland was connected to June's attacks on the Glasgow airport.
Mr. Black is also afraid that the Scotland NHS has no precise idea of the quantity of foreign staff employed.
But his report emphasized that the other key checks were conducted in order on the sample of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Control Authority was concerned immediately after the June attacks on the Glasgow Airport on staff acquired from countries outside the European Economic Area.
The 18-year-old Bill Abdullah, Iraqi doctor in Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone hired Jeep in the door of the main terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a videobridge accused of the connection to attempts to bomb attacks in Great Britain.
The NHS compartment is expected to verify foreign staff in terms of qualification, experience and authorization in Great Britain before its employment.
Although the Scotland health committee uses Disclosure Scotland to control criminal registers, this agency has no power to obtain such information outside Britain.
The report of the President of the Supreme Control Authority states, besides other recommendations that the Commission should be allowed to guide the Directives of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with control in several countries.
"Although we have found that a part of the staff records contained evidence of these checks, they are not conducted regularly," the report noted.
Mr. Black said that the Scotland NHS in many concurs with its own policy of pre-employment checks, but also added: "Our report warns the areas where the system could be improved so that the availability of accurate information on the quantity of foreign staff could be made."
BMA President Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment controls would identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employment checks in the Scotland NHS work well and is not clear what further value those comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities announced that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, of whom the large majority are doctors and sisters.
However, the President of the highest control authority pointed out that these numbers would be apparently higher because the Commission had a problem identifying staff with a residential authorisation.
The survey also found that the introduced control procedures for NHS bodies in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lotian are largely carried out.
They included passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scotland government is currently processing the policy and directive of pre-employment controls for foreign workers of NHS.
The Ministry of Health, Nicola Sturgeon, said, "I wanted to do this work immediately after the terrorist attack on the Glasgow Airport."
She also added that the Scotland Government, in conformity with the health commissions, considers the recommendations of this report and ensure that the best procedures occur in the updated pre-employment control directives of all personnel - including the foreign - planned to issue the next month.
Joy Division controlled film prices
Control, a lifetime film about the dead singer Joy Division Ian Curtis, collected five prices on British Independent Film Awards, including prices for the best film.
The prices were also obtained by the Star Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse until Curtis, director Anton Corbijn and the next role of Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was appointed the best actress for the thriller notes about the scandal.
And a bond star Daniel Craig got Variety award for getting a British movie on the world scene.
Prices were feasted in London Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis's way to glory with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at 23 years of age.
This black-white film - whose soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was only 3 million pounds.
But he got the Dutch photographer Corbin, known earlier by an iconic package of U2 Joshua Tree, two prices - for the best director and for the best debuting director.
Rock music was focusing on another value - because Julien Temple's film on Clash Joe Strummer got a prize for the best document.
Viggo Mortensen won a coat for the best actress as a driver of the Russian Mafia boss in the London thriller David Cronenberg East Promise.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation built on the roles of hard men, won Richard Harris's price for an unusual benefit to the British movie.
This fiftiethman, among whom films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, currently films another piece of Indiana Jones - Kingdom crystal skull.
Winstone said he was proud of this price, named after the star of Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me," he added.
"I've been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, the great actor of his time, I'm very honored."
Independent film prices known as Biffs are granted by a jury sitting in the movies, actors and festival organizers.
Between the standing and the Bif are Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people for terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that she arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing immediate attack on oil equipment, as well as on spiritual and security facilities.
The state television of the largest oil exporter reported that one of the cells wanted to scatter missiles into the country.
Al-Kaida sympathetics have led a campaign against monarchy, United States allies, since 2003, from invasion to Iraq.
The television report announced that the 8-militants' cell led by a foreigner planned an attack on oil equipment in the Ash-Sharqiyah Province.
Saudi Arabia builds a rapid reaction unit on the strength of 35,000 members to defend the device from an unsuccessful attack of al-Kaida on the world's largest oil processing factory in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted the Ministry's internal statement: 18 arrested members belonged to the cell led by the "expert for missiles" that slipped into the country.
Furthermore, she stated that the warriors planned to pass eight shots into the kingdom.
22 detainees were to prepare murders of spiritual and security workers.
The government urged the clergy to try more to prevent Saudi from going to Iraq to join al-Qaid militians fighting alliance and the Shiit government supported by the United States, which the conservative Sunnity Saudi considers to be a sayer.
Al-Qaidian militants believe that the authorities cooperated many spirits in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
Militanti - supported by leaders of Al-Kaida, Saudia Osamia bin Ladin to focus on the Western Saudi government - focused on foreign housing complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war was a huge effort in security forces in the past... five months," state television spokesman of the Ministry said.
It was also arrested by a 16-media cell in Medina, aimed at promoting "takfiry thoughts" - the ideology of Sunnith Muslim radicals, which supports violence against Muslims marked as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the arrested were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militants.
The climate on Venus may be a view to the future of the Earth
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus could once be a pleasant place for life.
The data from the circuit European station show that the planet is even more similar to its own twin of the Earth than it was thought before.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbour of the Earth.
These two worlds are approximately the same size and are circled by similar roads, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, the conditions of Venus were similar to those on Earth and could have been resident.
But the frightened glass effect caused by carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and the lower rotation speed sent Venus a completely different way of development.
Today there is a planet without water, the temperature on the surface is hot enough for the drowning of lead and is desolate by storms and winds of hurricane power.
The findings from the European Space Agency, Venus Express, who studied the planet for one year, offer medium view of how the Earth could develop in the event of disaster climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Physics of the Oxford University and one of the heads of Venus Express mission said: "It's more clear why the climate on Venus is as different than the Earth, even though the planets themselves are different.
"Our new data allow us to build a scenario in which Venus started as well as the Earth, perhaps with the population, billions of years ago."
The police held the "both uranium"
Kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched uranium, was arrested yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
The police speaker stated that three people were arrested and the material was investigated.
He did not confirm that it was a wealthy uranium, but said that the substance could be sold for a million dollars (480 000 pounds).
Still incorporated
Mitt Romney said for presidential candidates it is not worthy to answer questions from a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican presidential candidates subsequently agreed with the YouTube debate, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on the video and passed them to the candidates.
None of the questions sent on Wednesday 28 November was as comical as a snowman who asked democrats for global warming in the second party's debate on YouTube.
However, the questions and answers reflected many of the state of the Republican Party on the elections next year.
It is not clear exactly how CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, chose clips that were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest time dedicated to the one theme, was focused on immigration.
This theme is one of the strongest Republicans.
CNN asked the panel of undecided voters to turn the wheel when they heard something comforting: the voter recorded the tops of the consent when the candidates spoke of hard access on the borders.
The hardest and the longest exchange of views occurred between Rudy Giuliani, the chief state candidate, and Mr Romney, who went forward in key quick votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation of a man who was soft at the illegal immigrant as a primator of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his house.
These two struggle particularly urgently when the questionnaires asked if one of the candidates would support "amnestia" (to give illegal immigrants a normal position and the possibility of citizenship).
Other candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, the California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorada, have been able to throw their mill into this topic.
None of these two have a chance to be nominated, but they're both in the game, perhaps for starting to be on alarms about immigration sooner and stronger than the others.
At least the candidates have the same opinion on immigration: greater strictness on the borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, together with the fears of poisonous toys from China and other concerns with the environment, helps the Republicans to forget or minimise the dispute between liberty and Christian conservatives.
But the debate began to be very unpleasant when there were other subjects.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he used to support the holding of guns.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the technique of simulated heating should be considered torture.
A questionnaire asked whether the candidates believe each word in the Bible.
By means of this, Mr. Giuliani concluded that even though the Bible is his favorite book, he may not believe literally the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questionnaire asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all the assumptions first in a recent study in Iowa due to his long-term Christian conservation - said that death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too clever to candidate, making himself laugh.
The fight remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee's growth in Iowa is covered with recent successes in gaining money and the loud joy of Ron Paul in the middle debate.
These two have flipped from the bottom, because both parties still cannot agree on more famous and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates unified the party very soon and convincingly with a winning report of American size on the lips, wandering on both wings of the parties.
This time the side is split up and the result is far from clear.
Labourists’ pains
Gordon Brown again found a trap that could fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it's a custom in British political scandals, this is not particularly rigid.
It doesn't seem to be selling some orders, no accounts in the Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers have been scratched.
But a barricaded Gordon Brown would be able to do without revealing that a rich entrepreneur has masked the contributions of the Labourist Party in the amount of 650 000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) under the names of other people, and that the party has not announced it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided the elections and insulted the British intelligence by claiming that this decision was not affected by the investigation, there was hope that he would ensure a resistant and effective government.
Instead of how Mr. Brown made it more funny, the President of Liberal Democrats, the former fearful Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unsaved rescue of the Northern Rock Bank showed weaknesses in management and a blank judgment under fire.
The wrongly contemplated proposals to change the tax law connected companies against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people has revealed unrepresentable administrative law enforcement.
The three retired Generals launched a rebellion in the House of Lords; they protested against the scratches in military expenses, because they argued that being the commander of armed forces was a partial job.
Now there are multisecond gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of Labourers (and their former guardian of internal discipline), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown would go unreasonably to his end.
Despite this, governments can reach the point of conversion that they seek to be ruling difficult.
The people don't trust politicians, and they don't like them, but mostly they'll dismiss their inconfidence if the new team takes over it.
When it seems clear that some prime minister is probably not going to improve anything, and it doesn't have to be long in the office, this is a dismissal: the state administration becomes a hole, the ministers start to do briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government becomes unconcentrated and defensive.
In one direction, Mr. Brown's position is particularly complex, because he can't take the position of a new coin against other political leaders.
Whatever he wanted to be away from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, Northern Rock's problems and financial records are related to the decisions that Mr Brown has made as the Minister of Finance.
And even though he wasn't directly involved in Blair's poverty, such as a long investigation of the financing of political parties caused by "value for money", the voters can easily judge that he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's distress is not as bad as they look.
They're not as horrible as conservatives do.
As for Mr. Bean, no one died or exposedly deceived.
And the treatment, as painful as it can be, is to provide what Mr. Brown always promised: a reliable, solid and lightly brutal government.
The latest disturbance around political gifts is a good example.
The Garboid Mr Abrahams, who compares his gifts with charity, says he did not wish for his charity.
That could be true, but it wasn't his decision.
The laws against anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those who rule in the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abrahams' procedure, but he did not know that he was illegal, will certainly be questioned thoroughly; as well as John Mendlesohn, the main labourist seeker of the money that he learned about the inferior gifts in October.
But yet Mr. Brown is not involved; there's nothing that suggests that he knew about these blobs, even though the main part of the payments took place until after his entry in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the job yet.
He very quickly condemned this violation of the law by his own party, but he made a decision by pursuing an effective instrument, a committee for the examination of this matter - led by the bishop of retirement and the judge.
In this case, lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's about the police.
Furthermore, there are other things that Mr. Brown has to do, for example, to find a permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has none for six months, and to proceed with the actual reform of the financing of political parties.
This would require labourists who are close to collaborating with conservatives and may even give up their special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a dedicated party like Mr. Brown.
But he should face several simple facts.
Conservatives now have a proper prospect in their research; he has two years to get the voters back; and the only way to win is to be inadequate integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Does the crisis of underlying mortgage affect the American credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, naturally around they start excitedly mixing the backs.
Now that the US real estate market floods, the predators focused on the credit card market there.
The Goldman Sachs analyses say that the losses on credit cards, if other variations of consumer loans have been infected from underline mortgages, could reach $99 billion.
The voltage signs are clear.
Increased number of cases of incompetent payments (at more than 30 days delay of payment) and described accounts (accounts which the provider considers inexcessive).
The HSBC bank announced last month that the US market of consumer loans lost $1.4 billion - also because of non-solvent loans on credit cards.
But it's too early to panic.
The cancelled accounts and the inability to pay are still not enough.
According to Moody's assessment agency, 3.89% of the payment failure rate in the third quarter was almost a whole percentage point below the average.
The worsening rates can be partially explained by technical reasons.
The amendment of the American Privacy Bankruptcy Acts of 2005 resulted in a severe decrease in the number of reported bankruptces that have made a large part of the losses on credit cards; the number of reports (and thus the number of receipts) would therefore increase, regardless of whether the general conditions for the borrowers had deteriorated.
The sector also demonstrates a good rate of payment, which shows how much consumers will pay monthly from their debts.
And trust in securities secured with credit cards is firm, despite paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup research company predicts that the volumes of their emissions in 2007 will be 25% larger than the loon.
Direct paths to spread infections between the underlying mortgage and the credit card market are definitely existing: when loans are drying in real estate, consumers are rather owed through credit cards.
However, credit cards issuers rather look at the cash flow than on the value of the handling objects, so the falling prices of households must not necessarily mean a change in the confidence of the borrowers.
They may even be advantageous for borrowers.
Consumers' motivation to pay mortgages drops when their property value falls under the loan value; as a result, the debt on the cards is moved up on the list of prioritys to pay.
Card issuers can also respond faster and flexiblely to more violent conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of rapid change in the prices of the handling objects.
"It will not happen that one beautiful morning we would just reevaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, the financial manager of Capital One.
Although the risk of explosion in the style of underlying mortgages is low, the risk of gradual weakness is far more real.
If the lower prices of homes and debt reductions push America to a recession, the credit card sector will stand before the darker future.
Watch out for the backs.
British bankers admitted guilt for Enron's case
Three British bankers who were supposed to be judged for their role in a fraud related to the former financial manager Enron Andrew Fastow, changed their statement on Wednesday and confessed guilt.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally guilty of seven accusations of fraud, when Fastov and the 2000 Fast were to participate in the financial fraud -- to enrich on the account of their employers -- were denied.
They were supposed to be before the court in January.
However, during the trial before the U.S. County Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each confessed to one fraud.
The case of these three former managers of Greenwich NatWest, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, has been drawn on the front pages for two years, which took place in the publishing proceedings.
In the United States, their case is one of the unlocked parts of the investigation started after Enron crash in 2001.
The charges raised against them in 2002 warned Mr Fastow that he was aimed at a government investigation on Enron's crash.
The prosecution against bankers -- who deserved the nickname "NatWest Trinity" -- claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to establish a fraud together with Fastov and his former chief director Michael Kopper.
The company Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron's partnership branch controlled by Fast, which was architect of a lot of enron frauds that stuck Enron in the spiral direction to declare bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank evaluated its share in this branch of zero, but our three British knew that it really was worth it.
The company under Copper's control bought the bank's share in this branch for $1 million.
Incriminated bankers paid Kopper's share in this company $250,000.
According to the charge, Fastow fakely informed Enron that the energy company would pay for its share in the Greenwich NatWest branch.
Of course, 20 million of them actually went with the British bankers, Fastow, and others.
The bankers received 7,3 million in charge and Fastow, Kopper and others improved about $12.3 million.
In January 2004 he confessed Fastow's guilt in two cases of conspiracy for his role in the destruction of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently in the execution of a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper's been executed for three years and one month in a Texarcana facility.
All three British were moving on bail on $1 million that ordered them to stay in the United States for the coming court.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, was declined into the bankruptcy in December 2001 after the years of accounting tricks were no longer able to hide billions of debts or to report failure speculation as profits.
The crash cancelled thousands of jobs, over $60 billion of market value and more than $2 billion in retirement insurance.
The founder of Enron Kenneth Lay and former chief manager Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the fall of society.
Skilling is in execution of more than 40 years of punishment.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were deleted after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow non-power
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with the Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient volume of fuel for continuous flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, begins with $54 million.
For some of the Russian wealthy, it is, of course, tiny for return.
"He can carry up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, Deputy Gulfstream.
"But none of them are interested in so many places, because it's for a narrow family or a business president."
Mr. Firer was sitting in the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Milioner Exhibition, which is the four-day orgy of the exhibition in the mammut exhibition center on the main city periphery.
In addition to Gulfstream, they built more than 200 other luxury suppliers who hoped that the freshly rich Russians would drag on everything from the mahagon of exhaust yachts after diamonds decorated cars that would not be ashamed of even 50 Cents.
Mr. Firer carefully looked at the clear orange Porsche in the side station.
"That's a nice car, but they're against us fives and tenants," he said.
"In the United States, Russia is the second largest market of private aircraft."
On the waves of oil, money is gained in the Russian capital, just like when Dallas had his days.
"We went through the same stage in the '80s, when some Americans grew rich and dragged to Europe, where they were viewed as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a listener to the fourth year in the Davis Centre of Russian and Euro-Asian Studies in Harvard.
Just as Saudi firers from the '70s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians become the most significant world's spending.
The most exclusive luxury marks are looking for their part on this clondika.
In another place in Moscow this week, the Luxury Industries Conference of Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of the LVMH Group, was attracted to exchange ideas about how to sell expensive goods on the markets such as the Russian.
(The International Herald Tribune is held by the Conference, owned by the New York Times Company.)
According to the list of richest people, Russia has a magazine of Forbes 53 billion people with a total of $282 billion.
The local main Institute in the field of Center for Economic and Financial Research also issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, which says that there are 103,000 "second" millioners in Russia whose property is $670 billion.
(The World Bank states that 15.8% of the Russians lived under the existing minimum in 2005.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of the London jewelry David Morris.
She was on the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this mark, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfectly modified and men are all for all the fortune."
When they walked in the evening dress on Sunday night hall, the 11-year-old Evgenia Yumatov and five-year-old Lightlana Turovcová called themselves and their clients a millionaire.
"I looked at those cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatov, who was clothing as a veteran of red carpets, next to whom Joan Rivers looks like a homeway.
The venue seemed to be focused primarily on fresh riches, marked Russian buyers who are willing to sit down for a few hours in the road to walk through a warehouse that screams Cadillacy Escalade, platin fish, ice cream Mövenpick, bullet tables for peace, apartments in Dubai, screams of Gund and spray.
Members of the simple public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in what mark is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the Dutch Producer of Porcelain Royal Delft before the reproduction of Rembrandt's image from manually painted blue tiles in overlife size.
"Certainly the Russians are more interested in gold."
And, indeed, these salesmen say that the Russians with old money (as Russian standards are 10 to 15 years old) have moved to a few famous labels limited by editions that would never appear in the shopping industry.
Even a few thousand people, no matter what millionaires, ambassadors of millions, or simple tourists, flooded fair halls every day.
And some of them were shopping.
The first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, stated Roman Ershov, local general manager of King Koil's bed, that he sold two mattress of silk, cashmire and cotton, cut by golden threads, after $70,000.
Also, the first day said Mikhail Lyubimov, a sales manager of A1 Moto, which equipped high-end cars with high-end alarms that his company sold clearly orange Porsche for the Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, who wishes to manage luxury cars that he sold three nets into cars in the style of connected grind bracelets for Rolls-Royce Phantomy after $55,000.
He showed to the reporter the car bike designed for the Russian casino owner, which had an extortion of the Swarovski crystals so that it looked like a rulet.
Price: $22,000 for four like that.
"The Russian millionaire who wants bikes from the swing skin or the portrait of his wife from the cubic zirconium, he still doesn't have to ride on those bikes," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll put them in his garage about 30 to 40 cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" currently means nothing very exclusive, given the great increase in the prices of this property.
"If you bought a apartment three or four years ago in Moscow, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if not in cash," he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend wealth on the stand operated by the Russian Alliance Continental, which deals with assets management.
The company raised four red phone boxes of the British style, ripped out the columns of false banknotes worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, a marketing manager, said that his team printed 500,000 false banknotes for the Veletrh of Millioners.
The colleagues stopped throwing around a bunch of money, or letting their friends take pictures with their mobile phones, as they rest in the middle of their replacement wealth, or just pulling out a few millions of pockets.
"You know, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey may be caused by a corrupt operation
It was a day before Thanksgiving, when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of this restaurant About something healthier and watched the ambulance that came to the white new English house of two houses below the West Scott Avenue.
The police patrol's car connected soon.
And then another.
"Then I saw the judicial doctor's van arrived," said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant controller.
"In that moment I knew someone died."
The authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, executive assistant of the Newarian police department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether she died because of the procedure performed by an unlicenced plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide in the house of 212 on West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused Ms. Arroy's death, and they hope that toxicological tests, whose results must not be known, will help solve the mysterious death that the Newar Police led a wave of sadness.
Ms. Arroy was the assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"It was a loyal, lonely and hard worked," Mr. McCarthy said about Ms. Arroy in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She'd protect me."
Mr. McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroy was a wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newarian police officer who worked for the Commission to control alcoholic drinks, and that he left two sons 14 and 11 years old and a daughter of no ownership.
Eileen Walsh, speaker of the Union County, Theodora J. Romankova, said that detectives were trying to find out if Ms. Arroy died of the consequences of unlicenced surgery.
"It's one of the possibilities," Ms. Walsh said.
"Investigation continues."
The authorities reported that they arrived home at about 3 p.m. at 21 p.m.
November and they found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was declared dead at the scene.
More than a week later, the authorities continued to say little about their investigation or the owner of the house, which is allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh didn't tell me if the authorities heard Ms. Caster.
The investigators are trying to determine whether the part of the house was used as office.
In the middle of Miss Caster's house, with a ruined pink cereal in the garden and a Dalmatine screaming back, no one answered.
In front of the doors that led to the basement, the blue barrel with the label "Ethyl Vanillin" was throned in the open garage, which was used as a replacement of vanilla in food and cosmetic.
Two mountain wheels hanged on one side of the hooks.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived after 25 years in the New York Police Department in Newark, Ms. Arroy provided him with invaluable help in testing the untolerable and severe political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'That or this one you should be careful," he said.
"She was here every time I came, and she was there when I left.
It was embarrassing."
The hope that the Fed will reduce interest rates leads to strengthening the world's storms
The stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after the market's hope that the Federal Bank will try to calm the loan conditions by further reducing interest rates were strengthened by reliefing the statements of the vice-president of the US Central Bank.
The storms jumped up in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the second in line behind Ben Bernank, President of the Fede, said that in response to continuing pressure on financial markets, the governing factors must be "flexible and pragmatic".
In the context of the obvious effort to calm the irritated markets in the middle of the indications of reliving credit effort, Mr Kohn said that the recent rebellion "partially reversed some improvements in the operation of the markets to the end of September and October".
Furthermore, he stated that if increased instability continues, the possibility that the financial conditions of the household and companies will continue to be worsened.
Investors consider these statements as a signal that the Fed is ready to add additional fresh capital doses to the US markets, and perhaps further reductions in interest rates to stabilize credit conditions.
These notes also helped calm Wall Street in the middle of the other bad news of the American economy, when the sales of apartments in October showed recorded low numbers.
The consequences of the financial opinion were underlined by the notification of the Bear Stearns Investment Bank that it would cancel 650 jobs, which are 4% of its world labour force, in the context of reducing costs for compensation for severe losses caused by the unrelated bet to provide underlying loans for residence in America.
Only 20 of these places are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the Industrial Index of Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or 2,55 per cent, and closed to 13,289,40, while the more used S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 per cent.
London index FTSE 100 increased by 165,5 points, or 2.7 per cent, and closed to 6 306,2, with the value of British blue chips increased by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6 per cent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 per cent.
Before some time, the credit tension on the markets has been demonstrated fully after the auction of three-month monetary packages of the European Central Bank was lending these funds to the European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, most since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and release overstanding money on the London Money Markets has increased by the rates of three-month British inter-bank loans "Libor" rising after continuous growth since 12 November to their maximum from the end of September - 6.59 per cent.
England must decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas here, one almost as hard as the other.
Who's going to be number six on the board for England this weekend in Candy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context, nothing less relevant than the first test against Sri Lance, who's going to make this decision?
The second question is that David Graveney, chairman of the Electoral Commission, who is held at this post at the best of the time borrowed, has Peter Moores, the chief coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with a decision to help and because the table of Hugh Morris, the chief manager of the English team, is beginning to be filled with applications on the post of the national electrocutor, not necessarily for full time.
The one who won't be built in the sixth place on the stick will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sports at all.
It's not easy to find what one gets to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets over the lower level, sometimes because of lack of happiness rather than skills.
Not only in the cricket is the choice difficult and requires an assessment that must always be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
Is it fair about Shah, if so?
We could ask the same in other areas, let's say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young leaders with good education and review in the field, should be promoted in the committee - the place is only for one.
Who should say what level is right for cricketers if he can't drop or swim to the next one?
Naturally, numbers have a great impact on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
In the team, the cricketer has to catch the captain's view at the right time, if he should take a wicket, and the sticker needs a regular chance at starting positions, if he should ever make an impression as a single cricketer.
Captureing the electoral view is more complicated.
For example, in the last season, there were many better people, James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seemed certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and thrown as a crocheter.
Anderson took 32 wickets in first grade at 33 runs on each.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same secret average, but they both had their moments at the highest level and hoped in the next.
If he's playing at the Asgiriya Shah stadium, or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can interrupt or reach the career both, or it must not have a great influence.
Four years ago on Sri Lance played Gareth Batty in each Test and in the first class he was giving good performances, five wickets and 40 vacations, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time fought for his place, who eventually became a stable Test Criketor, which was also, although in Australia against Australia recorded two hundred points, perhaps still underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another debate on today's training purely at the Assyrgiya stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's more experience in front of Bopar's youth buiness.
There are arguments for both of them.
For Shaha speaks his bright and valuable debut Tests shifts at 88 points in Bombai and 32 hundred in the first grade, compared to the six Boparov, who is, at twenty-twenty years older and has excellent statistics against spins.
However, Shah made two shifts in May against the Caribbean in the Test on Lord's, his home field in Middlesex, just ten races, together with the immediate rejection of the electorals, when Vaughan wanted to take him back to another match, his burning seemed to have taken away something from the elan that was so obvious in Bombay.
In addition, the Essex universal has joie de vivres in bones.
At the cricket field, he's not afraid of anything, and his behaviour outside the field symbolizes a recently converted car with a pulp to four wheels at the exhibition day of the car sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He exported light wounds and apparently shock, but as the first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his fellow player, who watched it down to ask him excitedly, "Have you seen it?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, its medium-speed pinches on these fields that seem to fit, distribute effectively and burn self-consciously and manually.
Selecting the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is different.
Maybe it's the real art of choosing.
Personally, I'm struggling to get Bopara his chance now, and I don't want to say that Shah won't excellent, unless, as the Seilon tea tickets suggest, it's the one who's going to play here next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qada
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria came to Bagdad yesterday and washed out the fugitives who had arrived or expired the visa period, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the weapons who expelled them from their homes.
The Mansour bus station was before 800 people came from Damascus in the official government convoy on a dozen buses full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned privately.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors killed in Bagdad," Sabah al-Kubaisi, Sunnit doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, because of what happened in Bagdad and how safe he is now.
"They say that Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he said, he meant the Shiitian militia of the Military Spiritual Muktada al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to stop the fight.
Casim al-Atwani, an eighty-year-old Shiit teacher from the most sunny area of Amaria, returned with his two children, because he couldn't renew Syrian visas and because the regime did not allow the Iraqi to work.
His Shiiti neighbours in Amaria called him to help the local homeland with the support of the US army to push al-Qaeda out of its positions in the west of the capital city, and to insist that he returns.
One of the newly arrived from Jordan is the leader of the Sunny and Shiit tribe, whom from his home in Sleikh in northern Bagdad expelled a granate attack after insisting on his fellow citizens to resist al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
"After night, a few friends called me and told me that they were traveling in Sleikh's militia against al-Qaeda and that he needed me and supporting my boys.
That's why I came back today," Sabaah, 20, Alu Obeidi.
Many have spoken of the attractiveness of calming in the capital after strengthening the US military presence and the growth of local "groups of enslaved citizens", which are defending their quarters by arms.
But there was more talk about returning the obstructions around visas and loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqi fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, an 11-year-old father of three children, expressed a loud suspicion shared among refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shiiti Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to limit the visas of refugees and forced them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people fled from Iraqi sectarian killers.
"All was fine before Al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving Iraqi visas to return to Iraq," said the Sunnit pensioner.
"I can't trust the government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
The partial reason for the weakness of violence is the fact that the sunshine were expelled from the Shiiti regions, and on the contrary, which reduces tension in many places.
There are concerns that the sudden influx of refugees again sighs the sectary tension and leads to another fight.
Little Sara, good education
The smallest common country of Germany plays leadership in professional education, even excels international focusing on its high schools.
Only in one educational area, Sara is concerned about the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"A man who doesn't come from Saraya, I explained yesterday after 50th that we are not any French" -- this self-ironic password in Saraya appears on the posters at the 50th anniversary of this smallest common country's birthday.
However, France and Luxembourg play in the Sarai education system, which is a great role in monitoring the education of the Colin Institute for Economic Research (IW) in the fifth place.
High schools are so traditionally working closely with surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 in France.
At present, students can end the study with a double or even triple degree.
Which corresponds to the properly high share of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
In fact, the average number of Sara's children is accepted in high school - many of them are not even studied at high school.
"Axel Plünnecke, educational expert IW, is used in Saraya.
By obtaining more than every fifth youth's right to study at a school school, Sara is more than 7% above the German average.
In comparison with the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Saraya to combine practical and academic education.
The possibility of studying two vertebrates, given the number of inhabitants, is the best in Germany.
Despite practically oriented education and the rising demand, the number of graduates in engineering by a third has fallen in the past years.
Therefore, the Saar Ministry of Education has now commanded high schools to form a promotion campaign for engineering.
"After the first study of Pis we conducted several reforms in universally educational schools," the Ministry of Education said.
Therefore, the government has conducted comparison tests throughout Germany.
To begin to learn as soon as possible, the last year of maternal school is free - a model that is also taken by other common countries.
If the results of the students are significantly improved, they will show up to future comparison studies.
In the implementation of the study of Pisa in 2003 the risk students decreased from 29 to 20%.
However, Sara has not improved as much as other common countries.
Bavori can count better.
And to disappoint Sarah, the studies of Pisa do not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, Sara could be a point in this area.
Because the neighbours' language is obliged in high schools - even though the inhabitants of Sarakia are not French.
The clock moves hours
If you don't see, the hours will go to Venezuela differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chavez lets the hours move in this South America country half an hour ago.
Meanwhile, in Spain, Chaveza becomes a ridiculous figure.
The Official Journal of Venezuela informed that the hours, according to the new law, would be moved by minus four and a half hours in opposite the world's time.
The South America State will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
The hostage, the enemy of the United States, has reasoned his decisions, among other things, by the United States of the world's time zone division throughout the hours.
In the middle of the local time, Chavez also announced that, due to the cause of hostages, he interrupted relations with the neighbouring Colombia.
This left nationalist stated that as long as Alvaro Uribe is President of Colombia, he will not have any relations with him nor with the Colombian government.
"For my self-esteem, I can't," said Chavez, promoting the reform of the Constitution, which the citizens of this oil country must vote on Sunday referendum.
This reform would make Chavez stronger his power in the country.
The argument led to Uribe's decision to withdraw Chavez's commission to negotiate in Colombia with marxist rebels on the release of hostages.
Uribe by his decision Venezuela "swimmed into his face", criticised Uribe Chavez on Sunday.
In Spain, they're all talking about Havez.
The new mobile call here caused a disturbance: "Por qué no te callas" (Why aren't you silent anymore?) - that sounds like a sentence that has been downloaded from the Internet for more than half a million people.
It was spoken by the Spanish King Juan Carlos, who was in the recent Ibero-American top summit by the loud notes of this left populist so angry that he was silent in this way.
The Germans are threatened by lower payments in 2007
According to the prognosis, German employees are threatened to reduce real remuneration over the strong conjuncture this year.
The experts reasoned their pessimistic prognosis for a number of reasons.
According to the estimates of the Hans Böckler Foundation, employees can really count on getting lower remuneration than last year.
"The guilt is a small increase in salary, increase in tax from added value and increase in food and energy prices," said Bild Gustav Horn from the Research Institute of IMK (Institution für Makroökonomia und Konjunkturforschung).
The new burdens on employees may also be expected in the field of unemployment insurance.
The Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück newspaper Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung said that by the new year, the planned reduction of insurance contributions to unemployment to 3.3% is proper and reasonable.
However, the Social Labour Agency should not again fall into such difficulties to require loans or contributions from the community's youth to quote the newspapers of this socially democratic policy.
On Tuesday, it was published that the price explosion of food and oil products has expelled inflation on its highest state in the last 13 years.
In the annual comparison, the price increased by three per cent.
Venus is a hell of a twin of the Earth
Despite its life's enemy atmosphere, Venus Earth is more similar than it is expected. The European Space Sonda Venus Express on Venus has recorded phenomenons that appear in the winter on Earth: lightning in the atmosphere and wind faiths in the fields.
For nearly three decades, scientists have been aware that they're shineing on Venus.
Now the European probe Venus Express has brought evidence - captured electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightnings fly from the dark to the cloud of about 56 miles, wrote in a scientific magazine of Nature Christopher Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles.
According to the famous theory, the originating material could have created life on Earth by lightning. The storm reportedly caused reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, basic stones of life.
On Venus, it was not like, "If life existed there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, atmosphere is approximately a hundred times thicker than on Earth and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 °C.
"The venus may be the hell twin of the earth, but he's a twin," said Russell.
Why Venus, which is the earth of the material and size so similar, began to develop completely differently, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
Since no sonda has been sent exclusively for Venus study since the early 1990s, the start of Venus Express in November 2005 was a militant in the research of this planet.
According to scientists, the latest results of research that approached several articles of Nature did not emphasize only the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighbouring planet is more like the Earth than it was expected to be," Esa reported.
In addition to already known wind faiths in the northern field, scientists found a dark faith in the South Pole, which turns substantially faster.
This phenomenon reminds the air streams on the earth's northern hemisphere, writes a research team under Guiseppe Piccioni from the Italian Instituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second inner planet of our solar system is almost the same material as the Earth and the average of 12,100 km is almost equally large.
This planet, called Supper or Evening, will surround the sun in almost 225 days.
But it turns much slower around its own axis, and one day on Venus, it lasts 243 days on earth.
Although Venus’s surface temperature of 460 °C and the pressure of 92 bars of the Earth is not reminded, scientists come from the fact that both planets have emerged under very similar conditions.
The water was gathered, but the earth remained in the oceans, while from Venus disappeared into the universe.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is tied on Earth in carbonates, most of the atmosphere forms Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalilama
The Communist President Köhler requires the termination of side disputes for the adoption of the Dalilama at the Office of Office.
He did not directly criticize the SPD for her attacks on the Chancellor after a meeting in September.
Communist President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and calls for a great coalition to end the quarrel around the adoption of the Dalilama.
"We should not be presented outside as a nation that is not united in this issue," said Köhler to the economic newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed understanding for the decision of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to adopt Dalilam in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me," said Köhler.
The Social President stressed that everyone knew that Germany had to maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but it did not prevent the Merkels from stopping when it was embarrassed to create a new policy against China.
"The Joint Officer did not release the traditional policy of the united China.
China also knows that," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) made an indirect manifestation of his disagreement with the adoption of the Dalaislama, and he was attacked by a series of coalitions.
Steinmeier, among other things, complained about the "good" foreign coalition policy.
Following the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the office, German-Chinese relations have deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of the German Minister of Finance, Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but it also freezes the so-called Strategic Dialogue of Foreign Ministries in both countries according to the SPIEGEL magazine.
The Chinese President of the Government, Wen Jiabao, called upon Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the adoption of the Dalilama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan Spiritual Leader, emphasized Wen Jiabao’s position in China.
The words and acts of the Dalilah showed that Tibet and other Tibet regions, which are also located in China, are attempting to separate from China.
Schäuble warns against similar disturbances that have occurred in France
The street battles with the police, the shootings, the burned cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns about similar disturbances that exploded in France.
We must do everything to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not grow in violence on the street, calls the Secretary-General's Interior.
The barricades burned, the bullets fired the police. After serious youth disturbances in France, the general Minister of Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar development in Germany.
"We have to ensure that social tensions are not created in our places that will break out in violence.
We have to take this seriously," said Neue Press in the Cannover newspaper.
Not every young man has been able to deal with a rapid change in social fact.
The public government, the countries and the community are already working hard on removal of problems, said Schäuble.
Which doesn't only mean integration of migrants.
"From the summit on integration after the Islam Conference, we record the first success."
However, security is still in place.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable with those French.
In the past nights, youths were seduced with the police in the northern suburbs of Paris with hard street fights.
Even in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were burning.
The larger integration efforts of the German government were required by the Turkish municipality President in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the disturbance in France, Kolat warned against "imitating effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, it should be done.
The collat pointed out that among people under 25 years of age from migrants' families, the unemployment rate is "indirectly high".
In particular, it is necessary to ensure a larger number of study opportunities.
The collate emphasized, "We must give youth hope."
However, the President of the Turkish community added that in Germany, unlike France, there is greater social control of families.
Furthermore, many youths of migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
He said, "But we have to be careful."
We need to "swiftly allow young people to start working and learning."
Meanwhile, the night remained in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel mostly calm.
There were hundreds of police officers in the plant, and over the area the helicopter flyed with lights.
The authorized authorities reported three arrests and several burned waste basket and cars.
Since yesterday, some 1,000 regular forces have taken care of peace.
The police will interfere as long as it takes, informed the Minister of the Interior of Michelle Alliot-Marie after visiting the suburb.
There were about 80 police officers in the neighbourhood of Villiers-le-Bell injured on Tuesday.
The next night, the troubles of Toulouse were caught.
A Sunday car accident caused disorders, where two youths lost their life.
According to the initial findings of state representation, the police are not guilty of the deaths of youths.
In Angela's empire "Clouds"
The chancellor's reality's remote output documents that the coalition is programming at the end and that we cannot expect anything more from it.
In what country does this chancellor actually live?
After her uncomfortable, indispensable and contently poor performance at the general debate of the Federation, we must establish: not here - not in this country that it should finally manage.
To regret that she's too focused on foreign policy, Angela Merkel answered once a very arrogant sentence.
It's provincial, she said, showing that she didn't want to understand what the critics were about.
In the Gentlemen, she obviously showed how much she deserved.
From Merkel, he was not even really interested, including the feeling of problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Cloud" was presented: a politics that arrives over the others who flee into foreign policy and also expresses it softly.
For example, climate protection: it is praised for the conclusions arising from the summit in Heiligendam, but does not say how the climate goals should be achieved in Germany.
And at all, such a wave - so much insympathy, the President of the CDU would forgive herself two years ago.
Now it's limited to a planned phrase that could increase her popularity among people.
This approach damages its image of pragmatics, which does not need flattering because the problems are solved.
But in Angela's empire "Clouds" are internal political problems a border issue.
Children's poverty and concerns of people with low remuneration?
She remained with a few side sentences to these topics.
It's worth noting how often Merkels are talking about children's supplies.
The Merkel must start from the beginning three times to make it possible to say at least partly the right sentence.
As soon as things start to be very specific, they're stumbled as in a completely strange area.
Attack Division
The discussion of the Republican Presidential candidates in Youtube has been exploited in the case of the favorites of Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney in a rapid discussion - and both of them must now be afraid of an extraordinary candidate.
The tension of both candidates is already on the first subject.
Mitt Romney is throwing his rival, Rudy Guiliani, that he made New York "a refuge for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani quickly responds to sharp regrets: "I believe his own house was just one of these shelters," he answered and predicted to the former governor Massachusetts that he had privately hired immigrants without documents.
Since the Republican base has no clear favorite yet, eight presidential candidates use these debates on CNN mainly to discredit their rivals.
Half-minute, online users filmed and through Youtube, the sent videos serve only as such helps on a key theme.
"It is exactly the policy of isolationism that we allowed Hitler to take power," John McCain predicted to his rival, Ron Paul, who is the only one who is promoting the immediate withdrawal of armies from Iraq.
The Vietnamese veteran McCain does not save his regrets or Romney for refusing to condemn a tormental method of interrogation called "Waterboarding", where heating is simulated.
The reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg show that neither war in Iraq nor torture is among the important themes of the campaign.
The public is acquainted with an applause when conservative values are administered and the future tax increases are rejected.
It turns out where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"I was wrong at that time," Romney explains brokenly and asks the website base and the television audience to forgive for being an advocate of the abbreviation in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to express itself to the literal Bible interpretation.
Musharaf rules in civilians for the first time
A day after he resigned from the position of the top commander of the army, the Pakistanian ruler Musharaf made a president's oath.
This ends eight years of military government in Pakistan.
President of Pakistan Parviz Musharaf made a president's oath on Thursday and remained in the presidential office for another five years.
The Pakistan TV was transmitting a live ceremony in the presidential palace in Islamabad capital.
Musharaf swore to honor the constitution and to pursue the good of the nation.
In the middle, his superior army commander handed over to his trustee, Ashfaq Kiyani, thus undergoing international pressure, especially by the United States.
Eight years after an unblooded military turn, the former general is ruled for the first time as a civil head of the state.
By withdrawing from the position of the top commander of the armed forces, Musharaf fulfilled one of the main requirements of opposition and West.
Another central requirement is to revoke the exceptional state that Musharaf announced on 3 November.
According to the Supreme State Representative Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharaf will cancel the exceptional state soon after its oath, and will fulfil another of the Western requirements.
The Supreme Court of the County, which Musharaf, after declared the exceptional state at the beginning of November, accompanied his favoured lawyers, rejected all objections on the controversial re-election of the head of the State of October 6th.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the attack on a military convoy in the tribal area of North Vaziristan and four more were injured.
The speaker of the army said the bomb exploded on the road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of Krautrock are returning
The famous German group of the '70s plays again. Three members of the Harmonia Group regained their electronic synthesizers at the concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live 1974, a cut from the most successful band period.
They've already been significantly familiar in abroad.
The released sensation is then at the performance of three settled gentlemen who appear at the beginning as if they were just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables, and mostly buttons.
Thirty-sixteen-year-old Dieter Moebius sits in a snowy shirt in the middle.
On his left, there's 17-year-old Michael Rother who has a laptop and a guitar ahead of him.
Thirty-seven-sixteen-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who is focused on synthesizers, is from the view of the viewers on the right.
Everyone contributes to sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes there is a traditional song that definitely doesn't occur.
It doesn't seem to bother the musicians too much.
Among the lovers of Krautrock caused a significant disturbance to the Harmonia band.
The repeated questions show that this name is part of the collective awareness of the pope, but it is definitely not enough run to make someone suffering for this band for twenty-three years.
But why couldn't the German celebrate his still alive legends from the 1970s?
And especially when the musical style, the wrongly called Krautrock, in England and in America, is more valuable than in its own country.
When in 2003 the musical business gave the rest of the Colin group Can the price of Echo for life work, the hall was full of questions about German pop fans.
Furthermore, when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked for their speech to the groups of La Düsseldorf and Neu!, the surprise of the audiences no longer knew the border.
Michael Rother later, at the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts, sat with them at the stage as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worshiping abroad is one thing.
With the memory of the Harmonia band, we overcome memory for nothing, this trio existed only for two years, and even at that time there was no influence that others later had.
Moebius and Roedelius played with Conrad Schnitzler under the promised name Cluster before.
They played first in the basement of the Berlín theatre Schaubuhne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for the gramophone company led by the church.
Rother shortly helped with the Kraftwerk group, but the reputation gained as a guitar in the band of Neu!, which at that time may have been the most radical German group.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of the Cluster band to the exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Old Weserhoff, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of the community who fled the city.
They didn't live here as ideologically as in the communities I, where Roedelius was still allowed to loop like a nanny.
It was rather life in such a spitewego artistic being.
The name for the art is allegedly derived from the name of the Harmonia Ottenstein site, whose badge was reportedly found in the trash.
Harmonia kept a lot of it.
The first album was called "Music from Harmonia" and the next "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so quiet and modest, the band suffered from financial difficulties.
Collection of the roast was not just a self-knowledge.
Now the CD "Live 1974" was now cut before a recorded little, barely fifty-third culis.
At that time, he expressed his wish for the members of Harmonia to expel and exercise occasionally.
For Roedlio and Moebio, it was a totally inappropriate requirement.
In 1975, the band announced its breakdown.
Rother ended up in the esoterical sphere and secured his future with an album "Freeing Heart".
Cluster's band has been resurrected in the 1980s and has been more successful since then than Harmonia has ever been.
For the live album from Griessemer, we can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His recording company Grönland took a goal of Krautrock to look after as the original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was then considered Roedeli's salt work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia will take place in the Berlin House of World Culturals.
The Voldtronics festival will be publicly sponsored.
The British will be present, Julian Cope, an old pancake, and the author of the Krautrock Sampler manual.
The founder of Love Parade will also attend, Dr. Mott.
So we planned to broadcast the influence of the Krautrock on the future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will be filled with Harmonia.
Brian Ena's branches accompanied by the most strange sounds are raised in the hall: "Single real music, it belongs to the future."
There are images on which the manufacturer with Harmonia is in the agricultural session.
The creation of legend also contributes to demonstrating other black - white photos, on which a set of instruments are wildly connected cables.
Before that, these three veterans are re-employed with improvization.
No more sticking microphones to the bargains and drums so that the tools can be ejected from those never heard self-productive tones.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the techniques of disturbance, dots.
It doesn't change the congregation of the House of World Culturals.
Under the leadership of Barbary Morgenstern, she whispers under sound clouds and in one beautiful place she sings emphaticly "Aaaaaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock was always a very English concept.
It's never been a rock.
We would find the roots rather than in blues in musical high schools (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in escape from art and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who screams "'68!" isn't that far from the truth, but Harmonia will not even let her out of peace now.
Even the most apparently, the scene is carefully reflected.
Where does music start and when it ends?
This question either loses the nerves or allows him to experience mitigating moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough.
With the films The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films of war on the Balkans appeared immediately.
But none of them are convincing.
The film design either puts too much emphasis on action and shooting or are too touching.
The Hunting Party won't stop a player like Richard Gere.
Good news for the first: War criminals Karadzit and Mladić are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but right there, in the dark land of the Bosnian war, the actress Richard Gere will be octed.
In recent times, we lost this most beautiful man in the 1980s, not only because he played in many loving, unimportant roles in the comfortable women's movies, but in connection with his press conferences forever on the subject of Buddhism, they'll taste the next movie with this player.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for seeing the Hunting Party - Where is the hunter becomes a capability (Why must the names of movies in this day be so long and embarrassed?).
Gere gives magic performance. His war reporter Simon Hunt is essentially the one Gere could become if the fate and the film industry were not so mercyful: a man who has his best years since, but as a trouble like a monument, still keeps some remarkable beauty.
But despite this triumph, the Hunting Party is with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, who also enters the movies this week, just continuing with an infinite series of unsuccessful films on war in the Balkans.
With Mörderischer Frieden's film, we can do a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who will save the Serbian girl from the Kosovo shooter, and one of them will fall in love with it.
Although it is praiseful that the Serbs are not represented here as the cause of all evil, this television film is changed too soon in shooting and action.
From the movie, there's gonna be something like Cobru 11, even though there's no road, but for the war.
In the The Hunting Party film, it can be exposed to considerably why the Balkan War has not yet been able to film a really good movie.
The story of three American war reporters who seem to be "liss", the Serbian top war criminal, would in another time and under the leadership of another director and scenario (e.g. Richard Shepard) perhaps become a new "Apocalypse".
Both stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the woods to do something that is not capable of the army, but their way becomes a way to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of the The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the scary and sentimental cynic presented at the beginning.
On the contrary, his proposal will also prescribe a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The The Hunting Party's film can be finalized after the reporters in the last five accelerate minutes of the film will lead to what NATO, the CIA and all hunters of the world's criminals have failed in the past five years: to catch the criminals and leave him a fair revenge of Bosnian Muslims.
It's so against the logic of film creation that it would be worth turning to the International Court in Hague.
However, this film has a deep human message.
It condemns that Karadzit and Mladic are still free, and suspects the Americans and the French (they are extremely united) that, based on secret political agreements, the persecution is not committed intensely.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, the woman will attack us by the famous Brecht poem.
It refers to the wooden mask of the Asian demon on the writer's desk: "I look with compassion on the throats on my forehead, noting how hard it is to be bad."
In films like the The Hunting Party, they perform exactly such a naked heads that suggest how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not only limited to the theme of the Balkans war.
Recently, in these newspapers, all Hollywood movies about Iraq were great failures.
It can be added only: There has never been a good film on South Africa.
It's almost always true: When the star wanders through the crisis area or walks through the mine field, there will be a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, the Border of Break with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCapri.
Maybe all those conflicts are just too close in time.
Eventually, the Hollywood film on the Holocaust - Schindler's list had to run for decades.
Many films must appear - films that are today considered to be classical Vietnamese work - "Hunter of Deers", "Apocalypse" or "Figged Wipe" - were not celebrated in any case then as a championship.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Then scenarios do not have the ability that is needed to tell good stories.
"Bying or not" or "The Great Dictator" have become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin have not yet known how a terrible way the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you can't want to be good if you want to do good movies.
Maybe he has to create a sarcastically measured artistic view as a writer of Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was asked about a parallel between his historic Romanian "Lemprirus dictionary" and "The Balkan War," he said, "The parallel is only that some things never change.
The greatest people will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way and will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust criticizes the renouncement of the Olympiade
The retirement of the Mayor from the summer Olympic games in Hamburg encountered a strong criticism of politics and economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the layout of games at the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the estimate of chances.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, head of the Chamber of Business in Hamburg, named this decision on Wednesday "in terms of business as unhappy".
No other project has recently awakened the city as much motivation as the Olympic idea.
"Beyond this objective, this sportsly political excitement would not be possible to keep it so high."
Schmidt-Trenz called for the Senate not to bury this project, but he created a new long-term concept for it, "which comes from a changed time plan."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with his previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are at least unrealistic until 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic sports union will decide on the Olympic candidacy," said von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December the Sports Union will decide on Mnichov's candidature for winter games in 2018.
"This preference for us means that with a time plan counting on 2028, we have no realistic chance."
Still, this dream has not been over, said von Beust.
The Hamburg sports union (HSB) marked von Beust's statements as regrettable.
It makes the impression that Hamburg will not go away in the next twenty-five years.
"It's too soon to destroy the chance by calling the plans already in this early stage buried," President HSB, Günter Ploss, said on Wednesday.
Renouncement would be in contrast with the statement of the head of the Senate, which he made at the valley of the Universal German High School sports union.
Von Beust here candidate Hamburg for the University in 2015 was not announced as a compensation for the conduct of Olympic Games.
High school sports union Hamburk only nominated the candidate city in the last week.
The SPD fraction in the Hamburg Parliament of the Senate stated that it was a waste of valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"Klein Grasbrook has been hampered by the Senate for years because he has betted on the Olympiade and the building of apartments," SPD Carol Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the area of Klein Grasbrook still planned the olympics with the whole area to be used later for housing purposes, the CDU was unanimously betting on the "olympical factor".
The summer Olympic Game in 2012 has made its time in Hamburg a great excitement.
But Hamburg lost in Lipland.
They're not Warhol's boxes.
The one who connects the expressions of Sweden and wooden boxes doesn't mean Andy Warhol, but Ikea.
Is it?
The wooden boxes currently made in Sweden are throwing on the list of Warhol's works of dark shadows.
Most of it on the list of these ninety-four "Brillo boxes" type Stockholm are fake.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" several months ago expressed doubts about the validity of Warhol's "Brillo boxes" of 1968, the internal research of the Museum of Moderna Museet in Stockholm came with the result that brought disappointment; six "Brillo boxes", which in 1995 the Moderna Museet museum devoted to the gift of his former director Pontus Hulten, are copies - as most of the other "Brillo boxes" type Stockholm, which are on the international art market in the circulation.
Preliminary events are a embarrassing chain of art and curatorial actions.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painted wooden boxes that were based on the red blue paper boxes of Brillo powder.
The exhibition of his works in Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes from the carton. They did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
It wasn't artwork, it was their designs, just exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently gave in 1968 also permission to produce a few wooden Brillo beden in Sweden, but they were not exposed in Moderna Museet.
Those witnesses are now talking about 15 boxes that were rightly entering art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warholy Brillo Boxy" with the label Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for over $100,000.
The problem is now that the legendary Director of the Pontus Hulten Museum later falsely claimed that in 1968, in Sweden, it was made and exposed to about 100 beaches that Warhol then left him.
In fact, 105 Hulten bedens were made in Malmö for the exhibition in Petrograd only in 1990.
At that time Warhol was three years after death.
Lars Byström, the top conservator of Moderna Museet, examined in addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their crossboard panels were wrapped with the basic color and scratched, were a brush of oil white color.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies showed that the color was put on a painting role directly on the slipperboard - in addition, it was acrylic and not oil colour.
"Those boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official papers Brillo boxes," director Modern Museet, Lars Nitva: "If the organization of Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to classify six beaches of its exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copy."
In July, the Authentication Board has announced that these "free charges" which have been raised in the case of soap powder will be dealt with.
However, the organization remains silent.
Rebel soldiers in Manile give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who embarked at a hotel in Manile and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The rebel leader Antonio Trillanes, who called for the president's manipulation and corruption at elections, said to the reporters in the hotel that he refused bloodshed.
The soldiers of devotion to the government earlier attacked with tear gas on the hotel.
A few hours ago, about two dozen soldiers have ripped up in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were standing before the court due to a lost attempt to turn in 2003, including the Trillanes.
He used the action to escape with about 30 sympathys.
The soldiers who were supposed to watch him clearly ran into his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The governments of loyal units have closed the area around the chosen hotel.
The president called for an emergency session of the security office.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned soldiers' acts.
"People have had enough," said Triallnes.
"We invite people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, former elite commander Scout Rangers said that the march will be joined in a short time.
The government critics called for a great demonstration against the president on Friday.
Her government has been corrupted for months.
In 2003, Manil’s financial area has become the main scene of the rebellion of about 200 soldiers against Arroy.
Since the rebels refused to join the army, the rebellion fell down for less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, at least seven times they tried to drop the democraticly elected government.
United Internet becomes the majority shareholder of Versatel
