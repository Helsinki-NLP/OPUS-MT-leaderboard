Peter Czech: Release for the last moment?
It's possible everything
Today is the last day you can jump through the transmission window and make a big breakdown.
Another chance will come until winter.
Peter Czech, currently the Chelsea replacement braker, but now he's not sitting over the new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He's sitting in the Smile NH Hotel, speaking to Czech journalists and going to a Czech representation at the game general with the Americans and then to a sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualifications against the Netherlands.
In Chelsea's season, Premier League has the advantage of Thibaut Courtois, Czech, for the first time in ten years in the London Club, got into the position of a substitute.
Before time, it speculated that Real Madrid could be interested in Czech Republic.
The one in the introduction of the season lost the Spanish Super cup in the fights with the Athletic and did not even manage entering the League Season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
Paris SG also speculated about the interest of Paris.
The one in the French League season was put in two wins and two remises, fired St. Etienne 5:0 on Sunday.
Relatively, the shoes are the most pushing AS Monaco club.
He's got a balance of 1-1-2 in the league, and he broke up with Lille modestly 1:1 on the weekend.
On the English bulwary website today, the news is that Czech might want to go to Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, the Czech departure from Chelsea is not too likely for the last minute.
Skybet wrote course 4:1 on him.
Peter, is it possible you'll change your dress for the rest of the hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never a 100% football.
Maybe there's a bid that won't go away during the day.
How would that offer look?
(Laughter) "Well, I don't know how a offer that can't be rejected, actually looks.
It would have to occur to the conformity of all parties. It would matter the position of Chelsea, whether the club would be dealing with or not.
Is it technically possible to do such a crime when you're now in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary to sign a new contract somewhere in the new office?
I didn't think about it.
But in this situation today, there are a lot of players, they're all somewhere at the representative dates, and surely a lot of crimes will be closed today.
So it would be somehow realistic.
How many clubs can you afford on the planet?
Well, I don't really know.
So you're not pushing away?
The situation when I haven't caught a new season in the first three matches is new for me after 15 years of career.
However, there's no reason to panic, pack and go somewhere.
I want to continue the struggle on the position of Chelsea, and it is on the coach whom he chooses to make decisions in the next weeks.
What role does your family play in your decision?
I take into account all the factors.
It is essential for me, of course, a sports perspective, but I also look at it from the personal site where the needs of the family are of course.
Is it possible that you could catch another club in England?
That's the question I thought it was never about me.
But in the football, everything is possible.
I don't want to exclude anything.
I don't know the answer.

Renewing the very American ideal that work rights are also human rights
Congresswomans Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a law to protect the committees as civil law.
"In view of how the commissions work, jobs work for the high-class," said Ellison, a democratic senator for Minnesota, who is a co-Chairman of the Congress Committee.
That's why I'm so proud that I can present John Lewis the law that strengthens the position of employees together with a model of occasional rights.
This breakdown legislation will give workers the same legal possibilities as to defend discrimination in committee organisations, as in other forms of discrimination - and stop anti-committee forces
Edit the Labour Relations Act so that it allows all employees to face discrimination, if they want to join committees, to judge in the civil court - and to judge damage or repay damage - is a proper and necessary initiative.
But it's certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other proposers in the law is to reconcile the American ideal.
In spite of the combats that took place in the recent years -- in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states -- the Americans once supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect work rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember when the country made one breath promotion of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of press and the right to gather.
When the United States had taken Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to accept the constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja will be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their commissions played a role in forming a new Japan, included the language and openly recognized that “the right of employees to gather, collective negotiations and act is guaranteed”.
When the United States took over Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers encouraged Germany to create a constitution that ensures that the fascism of Adolph Hitler will be replaced by strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees would need to organize and promote themselves in the new nation, so they included a clause that openly states: “The right to create communities that will secure and improve working and economic conditions and will be guaranteed to all individuals and to each job or profession.
The arrangements that will restrict or strive to damage this right will be cancelled. The measures led to the fulfilment of this purpose are illegal.
When the former lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission for Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, the proposalers and the Roosevelt Guarantee included in it that “every one has the right to create committees and enter them”.
The Americans of the entire generation have accepted the basic premium that the rights of work are human rights.
When the country advised other countries how to create civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create work committees -- and their participation in collective negotiations with companies and government agencies in the position of an equal partner -- must be protected.
Now, when these rights are attacked in America, it is definitely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today everyone knows that the committees did not reduce the force of the nation, but expanded it.
They increased the standard of life for millions of people, created a market for industry and production to an unconscious level.
Those who attack the councils forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History doesn't forget, and we should not.
The formal recognition of work rights as humans - and the enlargement of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination in the organisation of committees - has a great delay.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that raised America and made a real promise of democracy.
The judge has temporarily blocked the law that could close all the abortion clinics in Louisiana.
The Federal Judge temporarily blocked the Louisian law on Sunday, which, according to lawyers, would probably close all five clinics of abortions in the state.
The regulation legally legally signed by Louisian Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is to enter 1 September, requires the right to accept a patient in the hospital from 30 miles from the performance of their practice.
The Judge's resolution means that the doctors may temporaryly pursue legal abortions and, in the meantime, have to provide for this authorisation.
"The proposed party will be able to legally operate its activities and, in the meantime, receives a licence," states the Federal Judge John deGravelles resolution.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month to allow the judge to issue a more permanent resolution on the law.
Activists for the right to abortion of a resolution, which was last in a series of similar measures, welcomed and told the doctors that he would give more time to obtain permission.
"Today's decision ensures women in Louisiana that they will be safe against the insolvency law that is to lose them from health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, the President and the Executive Director of the Reproductive Rights Centre, which, on behalf of the three of the five clinic, has been prosecuted by the blocking of the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decisions of the two clinics that were not among the suspects were concerned and are also requested to grant this authorisation.
Louisiana is among the 11 countries that have approved similar laws, while the courts in Alabama and Mississippi have declared that such measures are constitutional.
The key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state blocked the federal judge on Friday.
Warriors for women's rights to abortion together with the Association of American Birth and Gynekologists and the American Medical Association argue that the need to have this authorisation is to put the doctor's requirements which are not necessary in medical terms.
The opposers of abortions opposed by aiming to protect the health of women, and some also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed for measures.
The Centre for Reproductive Rights indicated that in Louisiana only one doctor performing abortions.
If all the doctors in the state were forced to cease to perform abortions, this doctor would also cease to take care of his safety, said the group.
The Louisian authorities have indicated in response that they would not be punished by doctors who are carrying out abortions while waiting for a request for the grant of rights.
Late diagnosis and disadvantaged treatment kills in rural cancer of eggs more frequently
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video with the hold of their dead mother who died of the cancer of eggs in 2007.
In women in the Australian village, a higher risk of dying from cancer of eggs than in their prostaces in the city.
Researchers analysed medical records of more than 1100 Australianek diagnosticated in 2005 with egg cancer and found that only 35% of five years after diagnosis lived.
The leading research of Susan Jordan from the Institute for Medical Research in QIMR Berghofer stated that about 20 percent higher the probability of dying in women in rural and distant areas of the State was to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
SOME STUDIES: New medicines can slow down pneumonia cancer and eggs
Women's researchers monitored during seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the chance of survival affected the age of women during diagnosis, type of carcinoma of eggs, other existing diseases and social-economic status.
The lowest survival rate occurred in elderly women with cancer diagnosticated in advanced stages.
In women in rural and remote areas, about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why there was a higher probability for women living outside the city to die of egg cancer, Dr. Jordan claims that the factors may be late diagnosis and bad availability of treatment.
"The disease is best treated by gynecoonkologists who are usually sitting in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of medical services on a distance to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen the transport service that would enable specialists to treat women closer to their homes and support programmes for people who are treated far from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan stated that the study revealed that long-term survival of women with cancer of eggs is low, regardless of the geographical position, which emphasizes the need for better treatment and preventive programmes.
The research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neave, young mother, was diagnosed with aggressive form of cancer of eggs in her 33 years.
Garden centres regret the reduction in the number of household owners
According to the HTA study published by Financial Times, the decline associated with the special removal of household owners under 35 years could lead to the loss of 10 million pounds per year when the young generation of consumers reaches “the main age group of gardeners”, the garden centers will lose up to 10 million pounds per year.
According to the report, people who rent for their gardens will spend 55% of the amount they spend in their own.
As other factors threatening the sector that produces a estimate of five billion pounds a year, the increase in the number of people living in very urban areas where there are no gardens, the love of the granting place used as a parking area and the lowering size of gardens.
In the area of Great London, where the share of households dropped from 61% to 43% during six years, one household is the lowest cost for gardening products in Britain.
HTA and the Royal Garden Society indicated that living in rental or lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the chief garden advisor for RHS, said: “The rentals have a very favorite plant growing in flowers - when they move, they can take plants with them. ”
The HTA report revealed that the “the golden age” of the garden retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of household owners and economic prosperity lasting from 80 to half of the 1990s.
He also predicted a higher reconciliation for this year due to a better weather that came under the adverse conditions in March and April.
When the eastern dictator preaches democracy.
After Putin at the meeting of his youth organization, who most reminds me of Hitlerjugend, baptized with the atomic weapons and, in fact, showed to all that his views were stolen, he gave us a talk about democracy today.
But I feel like the current regime in Russia shows many characteristics of the fascist state.
The great nations have one common thing, and that is that they can be controlled as well as ripped nationalism, as well as that that the complex of minority can transform into imperial tastes.
Time's going on east, apparently, different than west.
While the Western world thought that the time of wars for overcome over Europe has long gone, the east thinks that they have been overlooked for a long time and must be recovered from their international position.
Such mood and frustration ruled in Germany in the 1930s, just before the power of the Nazi, and then followed the explosion of nationalism unlike today in Russia.
And then the totally similar cult of the strong leader, the beating of journalists, the elimination of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, that is, indeed, quite similar.
Vladimir Putin and most Russians are probably missing after Russia ruled half the world and the second part was shaking before them.
Probably Western politicians blame it themselves, maybe a little Vladimir crying on his shoulder, maybe they didn't invite him where he wanted, and maybe they started underestimating him, and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
He made a line at home, he looked like he didn't even want to go anywhere, and he sneaked the knives at home.
Now he decided to retrieve his lost position.
It starts slowly, it's got time.
He's probably a leader for life, so he'd be in a hurry.
He screwed the Kavkazans, now he's gonna screw Ukrainians, then there's a bunch of rabbits from the Balt.
You've been sneaking a Russian bear in your skin for a long time.
It will certainly be noticed by China, who's kind of jumping too much and surely encouraging the fareway east.
And those Germans of Vladimir too are pretty angry, as well as they're good, and we gave it to their ass at 45 and to their ass.
Why don't you do a new Novorosy in Karl Varah?
It would be a baseline, and there's a lot of ours, and as they're pressing them there, and they'd already want to break the leckter of them.
For our veterans will still remember the way they were held in Czechoslovakia.
Well, the Prime Minister of Sobotka, he's so soft, he can be screwed like a boat and eat all of their EU.
That would play so much to make the big Russia scotch.
They need to be reminded where their place is.
And we're going to use our private people living in their territory.
There's enough Russians everywhere, and when they say they're pressing them there, they're just pushing them out there, and we're not leaving them, we'll protect them.
And again, the Russian will rule, for what else he is born for.
Europe, however, is only good as a tape on which proud Ivan can dance a goat.
Turkey has called for an American diplomat for a spy report
The Turkish Foreign Minister called on the highest built-in American diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British spy activity in Turkey.
The Deputy President of the Government Bullent said that the US charges d'affaires and Turkish state officials were conducting the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Speegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept stated that according to the documents provided by the former analyst of the American National Security Agency, Turkey was the priority objective of American and British reporting services.
According to Turkish communications, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was batalised by the importance of the report and declared that all significant States are following each other.
The older report, which also focused the German rapporteur's service on Ankara, caused a more distressed response to the Turkish government.
The game of thrones presented other tricks of the fourth row
The Creators of the throne Game are currently filming the fiveth series of the cultural series.

Police Director in Magaluf accused of corruption
The complainants presented evidence to the Office of the Mallorian State Prosecutor on Friday on the basis of the extortion by police officers and state officials of the city in the Calvia Self-Agency Area.
The Chief of the Police in Calvia on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after the charges of the entrepreneur and the owner of bars in an unfamous famous party quarter in Magaluf.
The High Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into an investigation detention after the charges of corruption of several businesses from Punta Ballena, the street in which most bars and night businesses are located in Magaluf.
According to Mallorca Diario's Internet Journal, the complainants presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and state officials in the Calvia self-government area on Friday.
Two other local cops were arrested by the Spanish State Police for connection with corruption charges and together with Navarr will hear them from the judge.
The Spanish National Journal of ABC quoted unsatisfactory owners of night businesses, according to which the benefits of public factors have a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about money earning, it's about survival," a businessman said in the court.
Don't play with our life.
We don't have anything to lose.
Magaluf arrived on the main pages of magazines around the world after a video of 18 - year - old British tourists appeared on YouTube, which offered oral sex to 24 men during the bar tournament.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to supervise drunks and breakers in a number of vacation parties in Magaful by reducing the number of unfamiliar alcohol tours after bars.
Furthermore, the Playhouse Club, where there was an event with oral sex, was forced to close for a year and with the organizers of tournament after the bars of Carnage to pay the penalty of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is mostly popular in the British, was also witnessed by many accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the fashion waves known as “balconing ” where people jump from one balcony to the other or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day marked by rain and storms that affected flights at the airport in Adelaide
The spring brought a ice surprise to the south of South Australia, with a strong rain and a strong wind that seriously affected the airport in Adelaide.
The next 5 mm collapse shall fall in the city until 9 hours at night and 6,6 mm will occur during the night of Sunday.
The last rain was presented together with several short strokes associated with the storm and wind strikes, which began eight o'clock at night and during about ten minutes, brought nearly 4 mm collapse.
After the winter last week, several early spring doses dropped in the city on Monday to just 15.8 °C.
It is considered that the storm weather contributed to the late arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was to land for a moment after 19:30, at a short distance, but it was affected by a change in the speed or direction of the wind and it was forced to defer landing.
The wind strikes at the airport in Adelaide at that time reached a speed of about 50 km/h.
The flight data indicated that the plane had to drop from the second landing and eventually reached about 20:40.
Lateness of the plane resulted in the delay of other flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
According to the predictions, the temperature in Adelaide will be reached on Tuesday at a maximum of 16 °C and may occur one or two precautions.
Israeli children return to school after war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza zone returned to school on Monday after they spent summer in bomb covers, while during the 50th-day war between Israel and Hamas attacked their homes of missiles and minometers.
The beginning of the school brought in communities in the south of Israel the attacks of joy and excitement, but the signs of battle are still visible.
In Ashdod, the city in the south of the country, the trainees of the rocket hit, removed the remains from the wall after the staples and are slowly expecting the return of children.
"We're a little scared, but we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibucu Saad and an English teacher in the local school.
Many children in this area really need to return to everyday routine.
Her 11 - year - old daughter Shani Bart said that “it's a little strange ” to go back to school at once.
"We've been through a few difficult moments and we haven't left the house at all," she said.
Kibuc, who is near the borders with Gazo, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer the population his support.
As long as the fire stopped last week, thousands of people in the border settlements such as Saad stayed inside their homes or left their homes and went to the safer areas away from Gaza to escape missiles and minometers.
Many inhabitants of Nachal Oz, the village near the border with Gazo, in which the shooting from the Palestinian minomet killed a four-year-old boy with height return.
The Minister of Education stated that about twelve families still haven't returned.
Their children were temporaryly placed to replace schools.
The President of the government, Benjamin Netanjahu, visited the school in Sderoth, a city on the border with Gaza, which was severely affected by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study carefully, and he added: “We will provide you with education and security. ”
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday on an unlimited timely peace.
While the ceasefire led to the immediate end of the fight, it did not solve the key problems as the requirement of Hamas to terminate the Israel-Egyptic Gaza blockade and reopen the airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers falling in war.
The new circle of indirect proceedings is expected to begin later in this month in Egypt.
According to the estimates of the Palestinians and the United Nations, more than 2 100 Palestinians died in the war, of which three quarters were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel doubts and estimates that at least half of the dead were radicals, although there is no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, died.
Hamas and other Gaza radicals fired during battles on Israel’s cities mainly in the south of the country 4 591 missiles and minometers.
The Israeli army again took over 5,000 air attacks and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza and estimated 250 000 people hid in a hundred United Nations schools that turned into a commission shelter.
Because of tens of thousands of people still staying in hiding, and for lasting fights, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope that school will soon be opened so that we can finish education as well as Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, 13-year-old boy in the largest city of Gaza.
Weather at the meeting: I'm behind the Eye.
And Lafatu suffers from the temperature
The Czech football representation met before a medium preparatory game with the United States today in Prague and the subsequent introduction of the qualifications of Europe's qualifications against the Netherlands.
Of the thirty-fifth cocktail, the Spartan attacker David Lafata, who is suffering from the temperature.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players, and David probably has a little bit of these problems.
But we want him here and to be as soon as possible,” said Coach Paul Werba to the journalists.
"If it will be two or three days, or it will be fit tomorrow, it will be seen according to his health condition that our doctor decides," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Certainly someone has some pain, but it's not that they can't train or participate in a game in the middle of the United States," the Czech coach said.
On Sunday night, Vrbba called as the last player of the Spartian carrier Lukas Vachu.
He admitted that this was not a easy decision, but other Mediterraneans were considered.
I decided that Luke is a perspective player who is 25 years old.
The decision was very complicated, but I am behind it," Werba said to the Watch.
What about Schural?
Let's see what happens to Latataa.
It is not excluded that the nomination could still be changed in the case of health problems.
For example, on the weekend, the Liberian Joseph Schural, who gave hattrick, was glowing with great performance.
Of course, there are players who recently show the form.
Let's see how David Lafata is going to do it.
If there is no way to be available in the Wednesday, I do not claim that I cannot dominate any of the players who have been involved in the Czech League," said Vrba.
This afternoon awaits the Training Training on Strahova, then on Tuesday a classic pre-arm training before the duel with the United States to Summer, which will be open for fans and followed by the autograph.
The struggle with the Americans is played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team will seek to win the Prime Ministership under Verba.
In the previous three preparatory matches, he played two remedies and once lost.
The qualification fight with the Netherlands is then on 9 September from 20:45.
Walking foot to the Netherlands to Italy
The verba loves having more time for training, unlike previous dates.
It's a advantage when you have players eight days and you can practice with them certain things we need to have had so much time before.
Now we will only be able to focus on preparing for the Netherlands as best as possible," Werba commended himself.
The Netherlands will be presented before the attack in Prague on Thursday in Italy and the duel will personally monitor the former temporary representative trainer Joseph Pješice.
He'll give us the information that's from the game.
But it's not just about him, we're going to have a game and we're gonna have to discuss it.
The new coach will come to the Netherlands, and we will see what changes they'll be there," said Vrba to bronze medalists from the recent world championship.
According to very monitored statistics, the apartment prices in the winter period have increased most in the past seven years.
According to the indices of the value of the apartments in the Australian capital of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic increased in August by 1.1%, the Agency said on Monday.
The increase led to a total increase in June, July and August 4,2%, the highest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual increase in prices rose to 10,9 %, more than double in one year until August 2013, but profits were not equally displaced in the country.
The RP Research Director Data Tim Lawless stated that Sydney and Melbourne are led on the market.
RP Data numbers show that the apartment prices in Sydney last year increased by 16.1%, while Melbourne prices were 11.7%.
Other strongest markets belonged to Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin with an increase in prices between five and six percent.
On the other side of the degree, the Canberra, which damaged the State of the cost-related reduction, and where prices increased only by 1.4 % during the year.
Lawless said that when spring began, the number of properties for sale will be increased in the next months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“In view of the continuing high sales of auctions, generally high sales rates and low interest rates, the value of living is likely to be increased during the next three months," he stated.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me.
He never said to me "I love you."
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamai immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
With his father, who died when Henry was 19, who worked at the factory, he had a colder relationship.
Henry is testing the comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on the imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of the Radio series 4.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rape and the melody is optimistic.
However, Henry had to deal with several unpleasant memories from his childhood.
After his mother’s death, Henry went through a “depth ” therapy, and now he thinks about his relationship with his father.
He knew a lot about him.
You have never seen his face, but you have heard his voice: “Stop the rumor.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a kid, they were adults - walking with him to the bar and discussing things like a glass of beer or a beauty of a cricket hit.
I've never spoken to him like this.
Most of my life, he was a serious guy in the corner reading the papers.
Henry recently visited Dudley’s desert, and although the conditions were better than in his father’s day, he looked at what life must have been for him.
Today there's a little more light, but it's still a dark, smoking, dark labyrinth, where the flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and seasons.
My dad always got into the bath and he was lying there, and then he was hearing how slowly he started singing for himself because he was washed the powder from himself.
When I walked around, I realized he was doing this for years to make his family happy, and I started to appreciate it more.
Still, Henry experienced childhood without parental love.
My dad didn't take anyone, he didn't say "I love you."
When Mom was sick and dying, we began to call ourselves "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, who was with Dawn French, allowed him to experience love that he missed as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
With France, who was married for 25 years, they're still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had a diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot of, very high weight and the symptoms of the diabetes began to occur, the doctor told me: “You have to make a radical change. ”
So I started going to the big fitness center, and I also had to keep a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tired.
No one wants to eat the carrot alone.
Change in the direction of taking Henry's career may reflect in his elegant, shortly shaved beard.
After he got his recognition from the criticism of his Othell, he swimmed into the theater.
Followed the comedy full of mistakes and Plates of August Wilson.
It's a different experience than sitcomy and comedy that filled his hectical work life.
He started when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed it on the stage of paroding someone, and wrote about it in a talented New Faces competition.
His television career began in the mid-70s: “I was the only black imitator/comic on TV for a long time. ”
He was learning to walk.
In addition to having to notice me from the public, I also had to learn from 1975 to 1985 how to invent functioning jokes, being a star and showing up on TV, and it was really hard.
Lenny in New Face in 1975
Since his manager owned the right to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a fun program in which the actors were dressed as blacks, Henry eventually performed his comedy for five years.
That's why my family's been so disgusting.
I wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Even though it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on great scenes and taught how to work with the crowd.
What was “years and years of appreciation for the main product of British TV, ” but was also“ a grotesk parody of black people. ”
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedial circles and represented figures that at the same time confused and celebrated the British Black Culture.
The First Series of Lenny Henry show began to transmit in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known, inter alia, as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedial series Chef!
Next decades he took advertisements, documents, television series and roles in movies, but after sending his series to LennyHenry.tv at BBC in 2008, he said, "What are you going to do now, Lene, because it looks like you're stuck in one place or you're a little off the road."
Next thing was a documentary show at Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great for...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergy to Shakespear.
We didn't really learn him at school, and I thought it was something for a white high school.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed in the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said: "You should try it."
Don't dare when you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all love Shakespeare.
Henry presented twenty lines from Othel's final speech for the document, and he was already in it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it gives me the courage.
"It's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn text, find out something about it.
So the test was hard, and I've read this game for months and months before.
And it was a success.
It seemed like they were waiting for trouble, which didn't happen.
Soon he started playing in the Commedia full of mistakes.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical disturbance and Henry instinctly felt that he had to take responsibility for taking the audience.
“The voice in my head told me, ‘Before the computer is fixed, you have to entertain them now ten minutes.’
Instead, the theatre director announced that the show would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the scene and something in me said, "Hm, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve it for me.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry in Plots in Duchess Theatre
Learn the text of the Plots was a challenge.
Panic's pretty good, he's giving up the determination.
The game was also well accepted, so it is like a sign of God that says: “This is what you should do. ”
Of course he says it in a sound voice.
So I'm staying with it.
I really like it.
I'm glad to be in a test room.
Still, Henry's brain remains a comedian - our conversation is interrupting with humorous performances when he enters and comes out of the role of the imitator.
I decided not to make stand-ups, because having satisfaction from the room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I think.
If you're still looking for something, you can get into a blind street.
Sometimes, if I want, I do Live at the Apollo, but I'm not happy as I used to.
I asked if he'd ever organize a stand-up tour.
It's a joy to sit in one room with a director who helps to give shapes of the beginning, the media and the end of the road - I don't think I'd ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I'm enjoying the actress.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers state officials to highlight non-existent employees
Kenya began with the biometric registration of all its state officials to try to remove the payment of the government's missing employees.
According to the government's statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will receive payments.
The government believes that thousands of people receive payments even after they left the public service.
After the office was adopted in 2013, President Huru Kenyatta promised that he would avoid corruption in the public administration.
The audit carried out this year showed that the State loses at least one million dollars (700 000 pounds) on payments of non-existing employees and on another abuse of official power.
The government suspects that payments are continued to be placed on bank accounts even after the death of the employee or after the employee leaves the state administration, the reporter of BBC from the capital of Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri.
All state officials shall be transferred to the identification centres for the next two weeks, where their data will be recorded biometrically, shall be stated in the government declaration.
He further says that anyone who does not apologize without sufficient apology will be removed from the payment sheet.
"As affording real public service employees, this measure will significantly contribute to its harmonization and will also be used to clean up the payment paper at both levels of the government and thus resolve the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waiguru, the Ministry of Development and Planning Secret.
Dozens of Turkish police officers are arrested for "speaking" against the government
The local media states that in Turkey it was detained for suspicion of “against government” totally 33 police officers.
The police office has not commented on the case yet.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, 14 highly built officials were detained.
Some of them were involved in December's corruption investigation, which focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for alleged organizing a criminal gang and telephone hearing.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (the President of the Government at that time) identified their actions as part of the act of the Islamic Spiritual Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all the children in Ukraine have returned to school
Most schools in Ukraine were opened again on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents and the President of the Government, Arsenium Jaceňuk, took his daughter to school.
At this occasion, he told the present journalists that not all schools were opened again, but that it was determined to defend the country for the next generations:
Not in all schools, a traditional ceremony has been performed until September 1st.
No, there's peace all over Ukraine.
We have to fight for peace.
The entire Ukraine, the connected Ukrainian front, has to fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher in Slovakia, who was visiting Jaceňuk’s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful in their future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by clothing the shirts, bringing balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
In Ronna Fairhead, maybe BBC found a boss for difficult times.
It brings with it a cloud of glory from the world of banking, the media of management and internal conclave of conservative parties.
She's got experience from the front lines herself.
The career started in the Bain and Co consultant company, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and Pearsons' media world.
Seven years she was the executive director of Financial Times. She resigned her function when the highest function in the mother company Pearson's hired her younger colleague.
They say her departure was nearing a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also broad.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former Director of BP, when Cameron needed private expertise in Whitehall: she became a consultant of the government.
Her husband is a former member of the City Council.
In May, I described the work of the director as a poison potassium.
Not only is BBC a wide and complicated entity in the centre of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns two directions: inside the top layer of its own BBC leadership, but also out to the public's voice in times when things don't work.
It is almost unsustainable monopoly, which asks for a thorough reform.
But the director would risk coming to a company complicated as Chinese dynasty, putting it apart, losing his own job.
It's a difficult challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, many people would like to see the BBC reducing -- its power, its finances -- and how its status is revised.
With the expansion of the competitive range and the new technology challenge old certainty, it brings with it direct negotiations on concessionary fees for BBC.
For a modest amount of 145,50 pounds a year, the British public buys a share in something that is certainly the biggest media company in the world.
BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households, and it costs only 40 pencils per day.
Furthermore, the BBC Favorites are apparently increasing: 53% of the favourites against 31 % ten years ago.
Models of use of BBC services have changed: Today, the news titles are showing me on the mobile phone and on the series I missed, I can see the iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a very loved and amazing institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
The Texas Governor Perry claims that the insulting tweet has not been approved
Tweet from the official Twitter account of the Texas Governor Rick Perry, who was published on Sunday, contained an insulting picture of a democratic state deputy who initiated Perry's criminal charges for abuse of power.
Tweet was later deleted and another one was published on Perry's account, which was distant from the previous.
My account left the tweet that wasn't authorized.
"I disagree with the tweet and I pulled it," he said in the next post.
Perry's assistants didn't answer the question reports immediately.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet published an unpleasant, humorous picture of the State Deputy Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, which was sentenced in April 2013 for drunken management.
When she refused to resign, Perry rejected the payment of funds for her office, which Perry, a possible candidate for the president in 2016 elections, led this month to a major jury in Austin.
The Tweet note stated: “I don't always drive with three times higher alcohol in the blood than the limit is allowed... but if so, I'm suing Governor Perry that he calls me on responsibility.”
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not led by the Office of Lehmberg.
Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed by the Republican judge.
Perry was considered innocent and accused he called a tactical, political maneuvre.
His qualified Legal Team requested the judge of the supervisor to reject the case, because the use of laws to pursue the most long governor in the Texas history is constitutional.
Perry interrupted the payment of $7.5 million from the State Fund for the Department of Public Protection, which has a seat in Travis County and pursues corruption in Texas after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection caused a formal complaint of the left-oriented civilian activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it's celebrated.
After he ended up in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012 at the fifth place in the committee of his party, Perry replied to speculation that he could already end up, tweeting his own photo running near the lake, and saying, "I am here, South Carolino!"
According to Berkeley, the residence market is returning to normal.
One of the most prominent London developers' companies warned that the residence market in South-Eastern England has “returned” to the normal level of activity.
The residence in the capital was the subject of high demand and increased prices and the expanded concerns of the credit bubble caused in June of the Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits.
Tony Pidgley, the founder and the Chairman of the Developing Clients of Berkeley, said on Monday: “Since the start of the current financial year, the market from the top point in 2013 returned to the normal level of transactions.”
The London Housing Market was good during the decline, because the customers of abroad were flooded into the capital.
According to the catastrophic authorities only last year, the prices in the city jumped by 18.5%, thus far above the average of 6.7% in England and throughout Wales.
The average sales prices of private, price-available and student housing from Berkeley rose about five last year, and at the end of April 423,000 pounds.
However, because of the stronger liber, in the past months for foreign purchasers of London property are not so attractive - some of them also threatened to introduce new taxes from property and to speak of possible “settlement taxes” with which the politicians came before the parliamentary elections of the next May.
The London Reality Office of Foxtons last week warned that the April revision of the mortgage market, which presented stricter loans rules, would also slow down the growth rate of the market in sale of property and prices during the second half of the year.
The new data of the Bank of England showed a decrease in the number of approved mortgages in July in the month, which suggests that the residence market is calming.
Hamptons International, another real estate office, decreased on the basis of that the prices of homes have already fallen, its predictions for the rising prices of London property for 2015 to 3%.
The volume of transactions according to the WA Ellis reality office, meanwhile, in London's most expensive quarters such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington decreased by a quarter every year.
However, the demand for residence in the capital city for Berkeley's blessing was because it increased cash for forward sale to more than 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, well-seeming living in a good place remained the same, and it kept the forward sale. ”
In June, the company announced that it sold 3 742 property from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the top of the crisis in 2007.
The annual tax profit increased by 40% to 380 million pounds, the profits of 18 % to 1.6 billion pounds.
On Monday, before the annual meeting of the company Pidgley said it was predicted that the annual profits of Berkeley would be in line with the current market expectations.
The analysts agree that the annual profit before taxation will be 450 million pounds.
The Berkeley shares stopped at the London Bureau on 23.96 pounds.
Hacker published photos naked by Jennifer Lawrence
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to 85th anniversary Price Academy.
The photos of Oscara Jennifer Lawrence had escaped on the Internet because of a hacker who claimed that he had a "list" of photos of hundreds of other actors starting.
The speaker of the "Hunger Games" movies confirmed that Lawrence's photos were true and the hacker criticised for "the obvious violations of privacy".
The officials have already been contacted and will pursue anyone who's stolen photos Jennifer Lawrence's release.
Hacker photos that were originally published on the 4chan image sharing server, reportedly received a space in the Internet storage system Applu iCloud. The alleged list of photos of hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is not clear how many photos are authentic, however the star of the film “Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world” Winstead also criticised the act on Twitter.
"I hope that those of you who are looking at the photos that my husband and I have made in private home years ago are happy with each other," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known as Nickolodeon 'iCarly' and 'Victorious', said that the photos would be true. On Twitter, she said: 'This is my alleged naked photos, people.'
It's better to cut it even in distress. *Specific word game*.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday night that the speaker of the pop stars Ariana Grande denyed that alleged photographs would be true.
An extraordinary example of a famous new novel Howard Jacobson about love and letter “J”
It's the best way to describe it, they gradually distributed as a cardboard box that someone left on the rain.
Just from time to time, a woman told him that he was too serious, complicated, hard, isolated, and maybe a little poor.
And then she shake his hand.
He admitted it softly.
He's got to fuck like a lamb, yeah.
The last victim of this ability was the starting loving tiles, which more than usually promised to relieve him from a lonely life boring and perhaps give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wild hair heat and a flying heart from a village in the northern island, which was even more distant and undeserved than Port Reuben.
The older associate, which Kevrn thought it was her aunt who inherited property in a wet but beautiful valley called, conveniently, the Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for a few years.
The pipes screwed, the dead spiders in the vans, the slippers slightly signed themselves on the windows, as if they thought they belonged to them, the garden was grown, and the grass was reminded of huge heads of grain.
The house seemed like a scaffold of children's stories, scary and charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations on Man Booker Prize 2014.
The longer choice will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn were sitting on a long grass chair and holding behind their hands, enjoying an unexpected hot spring afternoon, unwillingly set up a public station that supplied the country with comfortable music and calming news when the view of her burned cross legs reminded him of the old song of a long-forgotten black comic whom his father loved to listen to with the rolled rolls.
You've got too big legs.
Because of their natural aggression, they haven't played such songs in the radio.
They weren't forbidden -- really banned was nothing -- they just didn't play.
They helped them get into the desuetude, just like the same word desuetudo.
The human taste has proved what the laws and positions of outside the law would never be able to do, and as people relating to books, they choose memoares that become rich, cooks, and loving romans, both in music are chosen ballades.
The Kavern was letting him cut the day and started playing the imaginary piano and with a rough, comic voice singing the serenade with the big footsteps of Aillin.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was the favorite song from the jazz pianist Fatse Waller," he said and automatically added two fingers to his mouth.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to push the letter j before he got out of his mouth.
It started like a game when he was young.
His father told him he played the game with his father.
When you started with the word on j, you didn't give two fingers in front of your mouth, it cost you a pence.
It wasn't too funny that time, and it wasn't funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn never heard any.
Not a jazz, even though he wasn't directly built outside the law, they didn't play.
Improvization came out of fashion.
There was only a place in life for one "if."
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to know exactly where she was going to end.
Same in humor.
His unpredictableness went to people's nerves.
And jazz was a humour expressed by the song.
Although he didn't hear about Sammy Davis Junior until ten years, he knew Kwern jazz from the father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least he didn't have to say Aillin that Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn't remember the time the favorite singers weren't black.
Neither laws nor pressures.
The solemn society is the kind in which each part of it with appreciation - with the gratitude of those who have been happy accidental savings - agrees with the principle of group appreciation.
The people of the Afro-Cariban origin used the temperament and the constitution for entertainment and athletics, so they sang and run.
People from the Indian subcontinent, like the nature of the gift for electronics, have taken responsibility for not having a family without a functional phone.
The Polaci who remained were the installers, the Greeks who remained washed the dishes.
Those from the Persian Gulf and Levant States whose grandparents did not quickly leave the country while what happened, when it happened - they were afraid that they were accused of putting them into the fire, they were actually afraid that the fire would spend them next time - opened the restaurants where the lab was sold and smoking water smokes, not to mention themselves and the inactivity was slowly feeding them.
Everyone according to his talent.
Because she was listening only to ballades, Ailinn had hardly understood how the rude words that Kavern just sang to her could come from music.
Music was the expression of love.
"In fact, they are not messed up," said Kevern.
Maybe just for people who have too big legs.
My father never hit anyone, but he liked this song.
He talked too much, but the negligible garden provided the illusion of security.
Aside from the audio-vailing sheets, no word could escape.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was afraid to put two fingers to his mouth in her presence.
She thought he was weird.
"She seemed funny," he finally said.
She shook her head unbelievably and shadowed Kevern's view.
There was nothing else to see all over the world but the snake of her crown hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"When you think," she said doubtfully.
But that still doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Maybe a bit of ankles...
You're saying you hate me because I'm too fat?
I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said to her "I love you," but it was too soon.
"Your fat bullets are just attracting me," he tried.
I'm kind of disgusting.
That didn't work out.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, he often got into trouble, because, like his father, he missed the spell needed to be able to reduce the cruelty that was cheating in the jokes.
Maybe his father was deliberately cruel.
Maybe Kavern was deliberately cruel.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons was red and lifted out of her bed, put the radio down, and she poured out unfeeded wine.
It's no wine, so it couldn't have been drinking for it.
She seemed to be shaking in her disturbance like palm leaves in the storm.
"I'm freaked out that you're an asshole," she said...
Except that it doesn't attract me.
He regretted her, both because of his unpleasant words, and for the fear she had in her eyes at the time she stood against him.
Did she think she'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life on a cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that it was the same in bases as here.
The same wide and ice ocean was shaking about them.
The same confused men, after having become, even more intimidating and creepy than their ancestors, counterfeiters and diversity, were angry to scream from the house to the bedroom, ready to raise their hand on any woman who would dare to refuse or laugh at them.
Bullshit?
If she's not careful, they'll show her her hands!
First to anointed her - to anointed became the most common expression for erotic irritation between men and women: antibodies of the young balades of love that radio cried -- first they anointed her, then one slaughter.
According to Kevern's opinion, too cultivation was too cultivated, because the spoiling was an act of violence itself.
Ailinn Solomons never meant to leave him.
He got out of the bed as an old man.
She felt disgusted herself, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know each other.
She was watching him leave - as if she was watching him out of the window in the floor - a man who was caught, what caused himself.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart was embarrassed because of him and for all men generally, regardless of a few of them who hit her.
The man turned away from her, the shoulders hanged, embarrassed, defeated, all the battle left him - why did she feel like she knew this look well, even though she couldn't think of the only moment today, that she would ever see it?
Ailinn Solomons, herself again, looked at her legs.
About 20 years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, intelligent and excited twenty-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, the non-statute monitoring system of Public mood, prepared a short article on the persistence of light and medium-term violence in the areas of the country where its relief or direct stop was expected most if enough money and energy were exposed to its elimination.
“It has been done a lot and a lot of things have to be done, ” she wrote, “to calm down the native aggressiveness of people who fought in many battles and most of them won, especially in the dry, hardly available places of the country, where, even after the top of the church towers decorating over the living plots of the hopes of human kindness, historically revealed rarely. ”
However, some things are unreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower is, the lower the pudes are.
The inhabitants sigh over sentimental ballades, swallow unhappy stories and declare that they strongly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that old brutality is held in rural areas as hard as in urban aglomerations, but evidence also shows that at home, at workplaces, roads, and even at sports games arises new and attacking innocence.
" Unfortunately, you have a tendency to be too mateful," her supervisor said.
I'd suggest you read less romans.
Esme Nussbaum put her head down.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I feel I don't have to answer this," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Esme regained her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Next silence.
“I am not asking,” said Rabinovitz, “that I should have something against the atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have prejudices on this workplace.
We serve inconsistent companies.
But some kind of hypersensitivity, which is completely acceptable and praiseful about yourself, may sometimes mitigate the judgment as you did.
Apparently, you yourself are predominated to the church - things that you call "crowd" and "brutal" others could also interpret as the expressions of natural power and energy.
Still to deal with what happened, when it happened, as if it happened, if it happened yesterday, it was preparing the country with its basic life force.
While Rabinovitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum was looking around.
His head on the lightboard was pink, and the Recommendation that Ofnow sent to the world for the last quarter or more.
Smile on your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballades, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the singing word is better than written, but there's nothing better than love.
"I fully understand your claims," said Esme Nussbaum silently when she was sure her supervisor was over, "and I don't claim that the morning has not been healed as we think she has been healed.
My concern is, in particular, that if we are not in advance alerted, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what happened, when it happened.
But this time, anger and uncertainty, we will not ventilate on others.
Luther Rabinovitz connected his fingers.
That was supposed to mean infinite patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "if the steps they may have done and may not have made your grandparents, you describe as mistakes.
You're too far in talking about being ventilated by their "anger" and "no trust" to the "other".
I should not remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and the protection of the presence, we are not talking about "we" and "them".
There was no "we" and there were no "they."
We only know that it was chaotic times.
"Which, if we are honest with each other," she took the courage, "We are no one without guilt.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened, it happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add to -- we're in this together.
And just as there is no guilt that could be brought to someone, there are no things that should be fixed, even if the correction was suitable and perhaps.
But what else is the past but to learn from it?
The past exists to forget it.
If I can add something to that--
Luther Rabinovitz untied his fingers.
"I will take into account your report," he said and released it.
The day when she went to work as usual, the motorcycler hit her, who hired the railway in a way that the circuits described as “grozny and angry. ”
The accidents happen.
The army of the Lesoth Kingdom claims that there is no plan - the President of the Government remains in South Africa
Military officers of the Lesoth Kingdom denyed that they would organize a bunch to remove the government, and claimed that they acted against the police suspects of attempting to arm political fanaticians.
The President of the government Thomas Thabane fled the country and said the army surrounded his official property and hired government buildings in Maseru's capital.
After he declared that he was threatened by death, the prime minister went with his family to the neighbouring South Africa.
Major Ntlele Ntoi, speaker of the Army, said that it wasn't actually a bunch, but the response of the army to the threat of the “political fanatici” that the police tried to arm.
"This morning, the command of the defence components of the Kingdom of Lesotha acted after a number of reports received from the information service that several police groups were in order to arm some radical, political fanatics who were going to put on a desert in the country," said the Voice of America.
The speaker of the South African government Clayson Monyela said military action seemed to be an attempt to remove the government.
"Although no one has declared that he has taken the government's power through force, they are allegedly taking action by the Forest Defence Facility marks of State Return," he stated.
The military leaders of the Lessoth Kingdom said that soldiers returned to their casar on Sunday and there was peace in the capital.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane declared that according to his opinion, he was the target of the attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended the parliamentary meeting for internal disputes, he is in Lesoth's tension.
He declared that, despite the opposite claim, he did not undermine his government's actions.
Production in the euro area is at a minimum of 13 months
The growth of production, according to a carefully monitored research in August, slowed down to a minimum of 13 months.
The Final Shopping Manager Index in the euro area (PMI) of June 51.8 dropped to 50.7.
The number greater than 50 means the expansion.
The new orders and factories have been damaged by increasing tension between the EU and Russia for Ukraine.
The numbers originate from the fourth meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
The markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the distant euro area recovery and the threat of deflation with inflation to 0.3%.
The speculation appeared that the ECB director Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he considers the quantitative release of the euro area, similar to what the United Kingdom and the United States have joined during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the brake effect that has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on the manufacturer is still more visible," said Rob Dobson, the main market economy.
Manufacturing PMI Germany, the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU, fell on an 11-month minimum 51.4.
In the second largest zone economy, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
The concern is over France, Italy has gone back from the expansion of the stagnation.
The notes that the motion of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands has disappeared, is also not too calm," Dobson said.
Industrial slowing is likely to bring oil into the fire to the analysts expecting the implementation of other monetary or tax stimulations.
One positive report came from the Irish Republic, where the PMI grew to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the main economy in IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the production review of shopping managers in August is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: Producers in the euro area now have a very complex life because increasing geopolitical tension - especially between Russia and Ukraine - adds to the still difficult conditions in many countries even more uncertainty.
This increased uncertainty of trade has been proofly affected -- especially the confidence of consumers, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially those costly.
He stated that as “no more likely” it appears that the ECB will eventually have to perform a form of quantitative release, “although we expect it to be limited”.
Ten years of hell of survivors from Beslan: Ten years from the horrors of the schools children are still suffering
Ten years ago, a thousand people were detained by Czech radicals in school in Beslan in Southern Russia as hostages
During the suffering that took three days and which shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, of whom more than half were children
We returned to Beslan to search for some of the victims that escaped death during the wild school.
Precisely ten years after the scary school in Beslan, where 334 people, including 186 children, died, warned the survival heroes from the new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, they captured and killed fanatic terrorists children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
The opposition to the tragedy connected the east and the west, which led to the proceedings and the future in this disaster.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan in Southern Russia to search for some of the victims that fled death during the wild school.
We found amazing young people who opposed the unfortunate, even though the memory of hell caused by terrorists will continue to live in them.
What is their greatest wish?
To make the war that is now ruining Ukraine -- and in which children like them are dying -- ends.
A girl trying to get back into a ruined school gym.
She was captured by the front Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov, as only in the underwear she was trying to get back into the bombed school workshop after the bomb exploded.
The confused Aida was desperately looking for her mother, Larissa, who is now forty.
The concerns were that they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," said Aida at that time.
I had my legs from blood.
I got up and came back to find my mom.
She was saved by a soldier.
After several surgeries, she thought she was well healed, but yesterday she said: “Three months ago the pain came back.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to do another operation.
My knee's got pieces of rappin left.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people as doctors help her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it," she said decisively.
"It just happened to me and it can't change.
Once a year, I go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we're trying not to talk to friends about this.
That pain is too big.
My best friend and the future classmate of Jer Gapoev was killed there.
When we were little, we played together, and we imagined to go to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she didn't forget the captivity, but the memories are a little pale every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we have received from Britain and from other countries.
When I look at my photo on the Internet as I climb through the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, they understand the disaster and prevent it from repeating.
The guy who escaped the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first school day (in Russia children start school in seven years) and he survived the class surroundings of the school in the hug of their mother Tamara.
At that time, the seven - year - old man said: “Mommy told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down and hold her hand. ”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Get away."
He was afraid she was dead, he ran away and saw crying in the way, grabbed the baby for his hand and ran the shower of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said: “Damir told me that his mother was dead. ”
He says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara went to freedom and lied in the hospital with a wounded leg and thought her son died.
After they met again, she said: “I cried fortunately.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London ( according to the missing News of the World), where he was then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie declared a winner of Bernardo's Children.
"The horror returns every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say the memories are faint.
I remember that I threw all my guns to play right after that.
But today I can play computer games in which they're shooting, and I don't have a problem with it.
“I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember the kids I played at the yard and they didn't get out.
We'll never say they were killed or they died.
We're saying they're staying in the gym.
I remember a good trip to London, especially how I could choose whatever I wanted in the toy store, and how I went with a cabriolet.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine, where the war suffers as he and his friends suffered.
That horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I am so sorry for anyone who has to go through such a horror," said Damir, who attended voluntary activities in the monastery last week.
I want to help a lot.
I want to work with the police once, and I hope they'll take me to the Academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children in our neighborhood, can you imagine that?
I remember the silence right after the attack, and there were no children who would scream and run here, and it took a few months of silence.
He remembers a live journey with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price granted and for the possibility of going on autumn 2004 to London.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally say that even though it was ten years old, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember the taste of Damir for the borszch, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember playing with waiters in the restaurant, Damir shooting them out of the water gun, and they ran away and playing with him.
And that was just a month since that horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share with us our pain and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think the world has not changed to better in those ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think it's been and it's going to be killed by a lot of children.
They're the same kids as you are ours.
I think for many people, war is just something in the news that they listen to when they're bored or doing something else.
I know what these people are seeing, what a horror it is.
I still feel it.
Nothing has changed. People still want to kill each other. It's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a nice and quiet boy, not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about it at all.
I know he hates to remember it, but he's very close to six schoolmates, and sometimes he goes to the gym and burns candles there.
When he was smaller, he had problems with it - I remember when he used to lie on a couch with a face distracted from us and sometimes lying for hours.
He didn't sleep, he had eyes open.
I also remember that he threw all his guns or other guns to play.
I can hardly believe that I've been sure for hours that he's dead and I'll never see him again.
When I reconciled after the explosion and lifted to my feet, I looked around and saw the hell, the pieces of human bodies lived everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my boy didn't have this hell of a chance to survive.
“I remember screaming ‘Damire, run, run!’ but I was convinced he didn't hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our life goes differently from others.
Gregory Ilyin, 17
The guy whose photograph after the attack became a symbol of horror in Beslan
Convenience: Living from Beslan Grigorij Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, right Gregorius today
When he fled for his life after the Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, his bloody face was frightened.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of beslane beast.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, put him down at school for the first day and hurryed to take his older son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists hit the court, so my boy stayed alone for three days," she remembered.
Not completely alone because we had relatives there, but everyone died there.
Only my Gregory survived.
As the date comes, it's still harder to think about it and talk about it.
There won't be one day to remember the tragedy.
It doesn't seem like it's been a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments are still coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: Photo Grigoria (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was elected as a statue (right)
I remember when that day Gregory was looking forward to school, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
That he's alive, I found out when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of crying Gregory in San Marino.
Gregory doesn't like to look at that picture and we have it hidden at home in the library.
I understand it, but I also think that this picture makes people all over the world know how much pain we feel.
Today, Gregory says: “It is important that this is not repeated again.
“I doubt we will learn the truth sometimes.
Similar tragedies are still investigated, but no one will ever find out the truth.
Now they're investigating the boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what was the cause?
This world is waiting for something too bad.
"I don't understand why this happens, because when you ask people, nobody wants war, so how is it possible?
There's nothing for that pain for ten years.
To forget a little bit, it takes tens of years.
It affected my health, I still feel it.
I had three or four years for a nightmare attack, but then it improved.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and the classmates they killed.
So when the first September comes, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memorial of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get in that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is the past.
I won't forget it, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikakaz.
I want to be a cardiac surgeon.
First I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't be healthy.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't work.
Grogorij Farniyev, 20
The guy who survived, even though he was held at the feet of a murdering terrorist.
Wonder: Gregory Farniyev was held at the foot of a murdering terrorist, but he survived.
When the attack was in full stream, he was captured in a gym, sitting next to the bomb at the foot of a murdering terrorist.
It's a miracle that he survived.
"It seems to us as if it was yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become a federal security service agent, but because of the injuries he suffered during the attack, he couldn't.
It's still with me, it's not something I threw behind my head.
Now I'm older and they're saying that children can deal better with bad experiences - I have to say that it's not true.
“ In 2006, I went to a psychologist and I was a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - then - it was the first time and the last time I entered the gym again.
I'm faint.
I'm never going there again and don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting on this well-known picture.
Living: Gregory Farniev today, on the laptop with his photograph taken in the hospital after the attack
That pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know that I hate to think or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
As for physical health, I'm fine.
I need to be careful about my knee that I hurt myself, but I'm walking normally.
But I couldn't come in and study at the FBS Academy in Petrohrad, as I wanted.
I sent them my papers, including medical reports, and they said that it was impossible.
My next favor is animals, so I went to the veterinary.
I finished the next year.
He teaches how to treat all animals from "cows to cows".
He said: “I know I will never tell my children about it.
It's not something the kids should know about and not anything they should ever experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “The pain will always be here.
He's inside and he's getting worse with the coming anniversary.
I'll take part in the reminder ceremony.
I know Gregory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him because he was there, unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he brought him back to me.
It's staying with us.
Gregory's grown up today, but he's taking the horror on.
It's hard to accept when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it for his knee.
He's done several operations, he can walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say he's already overcome 50% of the scary, but to overcome it completely and forget it can't be.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
During the attack, many of our friends and neighbors were killed, and the pain just makes it worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could give me, but it hurts me losing the dead.
I know families in which other children were born, but also widows who did not marry again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's going on in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is approaching our country now, which I can hardly believe.
In the past we were one friendly country, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If we could take all those rebels and throw them away as far as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
Child that has taken a special command to safety
Saved: Alyon Tskaev is carrying to the safe Russian special command (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't remember the tragedy at all
The world caught the breath in 2004 when a Russian policeman took Alyon into his arms from Belanese capture.
However, the terrorists released her, leaving her 30 - year - old mother, a ten - year - old sister, Christine and Brother Makhar in captivity.
Makhar, who was three years old, escaped, but Alyon’s mother and sister died at the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried, and their new wife, Lightlana, had a girl named Christine after their dead daughters.
The neighbours say that Alyona, who is now ten, doesn't even remember the attack and grow from her a sharp and happy little girl.
A close friend declared that “he is a great happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great children. ”
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep his children away from the memories he reminds the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.

4 tips how to order better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in photographing or filming underwater, you have a great choice of equipment.
The cheapest option is a compact such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an outdoor camera of the type GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs approximately $300.
I took these photos at a family party a few cameras, all worth less than $350.
It doesn't matter what equipment you use, but a number of rules apply to reaching the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a water-friendly camera, make sure that batteries and other parts are firmly closed.
Next set the camera according to what type of photos or videos you will order.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or filming mode that optimizes exposure to the dark environment underwater.
And before you get into it, find out how deeply you can flood yourself with your equipment.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, other to 50 to 60.
Read our guide by shopping and evaluation of digital cameras in common and waterproof implementation.
You always do a few pictures - a lot of them won't work out.
Compact cameras have LCD that will help you with the composition of photos, but outdoors don't have it.
Even if you have LCD, underwater will be badly seen and the composition of the recording will be unpredictable.
So always do more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing regime that makes a series of images with a slightly different exposure distance, use it.
Stay close to the level.
With a deeper underground of light, it is significantly disturbed.
If possible, stay at photographing in the pool, lake or sea near the level.
It also allows you to get more light on photos - the deeper you are to drown, the less colors you will see.
Get close to the photographed object.
This is an excellent advice, if you take a picture on the ground, but underwater is even more important because of a more tangible light.
It is especially important if you film with the outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a solid and wide angle of the boat, which means that if you want to fill the camera, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a person whose power of personality could change things even in such a huge organization as NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to relieve the pain caused by sickness and treatment.
His wife remembers that one of the people who searched for his help was an officer of MI6, who had to live with the consequences of the torture that crushed him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnosis and diseases, treated patients in a cruel majority are interested in something completely different: pain.
However, one day in 2007, it was the one who began to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May that year.
I felt out of energy.
He was dealing with the symptoms of the flu and discovered that he was impatient, and his wife Juliet included regrets.
He noted: “I want everything to happen more sooner than later. ”
When Juliet went to the service trip for a week, Lawson was unusual and unexplainably upset.
Something was wrong.
A colleague made him a rentgen of his chest.
Once two weeks ago, he skied in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray have come.
He had a mezotheliom, an unhealthy tumour that affects the scaffold or the lungs.
Most of the cancer species are difficult to determine what was their cause.
Although some smokers get the pneumonia cancer, not all patients with the cancer of the lung smoked.
But Mezotheliom is different.
Almost in all cases, it is the cause of the exhibition of azbest - construction fibre material, which was earlier referred to as “the miraculous, ” but today it is known to be deadly dangerous.
For most of us, it wasn't difficult to ignore mezothelia.
Azbest, eventually, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in Britain since the 1960s when the prohibition of the use of azbest in the industry has entered into force.
Even when the asbest was used, only some groups of people, such as isolation, builders, carpenters, and shipping workers, came into close contact with him.
The toxin used in industry in another era is now difficult to appear as a reason for fear.
But it's not in place.
As it appears in Britain today, the Mezotheliom epidemic is at the top.
The number of deaths on mezotheliom is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2.500 deaths on this disease per year are twice more than the number of car accidents.
Number of deaths for the consequences of mezotheliom yearly since 1980 and estimated death in the future in Britain
The reason why we only now feel its effects, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (assbest species were eventually prohibited by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades before the mezothelium develops.
Disastrous in the form of mezotheliom does not affect only the veterans of the construction industry.
Azbest was, and in many cases he is still present in homes in which we live, in offices where we work, in schools where we learn, and in shops in which we shopping.
So Mesotheliom does not respect the social layer, wealth, jobs, or age.
Privileged gardens from London business houses after public schools do not represent a shelter.
Parliament is also full of asbestos.
Even hospitals in which we should be treated are the storage of this mortal carcinogene.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't even insulation.
He was trying to find out where he could get in contact with azbest.
Then he found out.
"It is possible that many asbestos were in the basement halls of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
All - students, sisters, doctors and doormen - were using halls.
The question is, how many of my currents will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, this was the question he could partially answer.
"For four doctors who were in practice in the Guy's Hospital and in whom he showed himself mezotheliom in the past five years," he noted in the letter in 2010, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us are sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mezotheliom when he was 48 years old.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
Living with this diagnosis is not common for so long.
55 percent of people diagnosticated with mezotheliom will die within eight months of diagnosis.
The illness is always dead.
So now we can just repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will get sick of the same disease? ”
According to the first British expert on the mezotellio of Professor Julian Peta, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when azbest epidemic in Britain is happening, about 90 000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die this way.
Azbest mine in Quebec, Canada
At the executive review of the archives of courts to which disabilities often turn and require compensation, it shows how much the mezotheliomic disaster has spread.
For example, this June, Marks & Spencer confessed that she exposed Janice Allen asbestos from care.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she was watching in two sales in the clothing section - one of the places was the flagship ship of society, the Oxford Street shop.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today she has two children who are over 20.
"Before it happened," he says, "I never heard of mezotheliom before, I barely knew something about azbest.
I've never thought he might have anything to do with me in my dreams.
There's not a lot of people who know about azbest.
In fact, azbest is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
He was named because of his fibrosis structure, which gives him strength and flexibility.
Three of the six minerals were used in construction.
Today, most often in buildings can be found crizotil, commonly known as white asbest.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler tissues and even in the brake.
It is not as mortal as other forms of asbestos, the EU and the WHO still consider it “great health risk” that can cause death.
But more dangerous is brown azbest (amosit) and blue azbest (crokidolit).
Britain was once the biggest world importer of brown azbest, and experts claim that “there is a convincing but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of an unusually high phenomenon of mezotheliom [in the United Kingdom]. ”
Marsk & Spencer employee was exhibited in the flag sale in Oxford Street in London
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical victim of mezotheliom, but the work of Julian Peta indicates that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients claims that “the major part of the cases of mezotheliom without a famous exposure to asbest at work or at home was likely caused by exposure to azbest in the environment. ”
A significant part of this exposure is caused by “continued use and nursery” buildings.
Looks like no one can be sure he's safe.
The report Goddard Consulting, who was investigating the Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the middle of the government don't have to know that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report which provides that the service elevators and pipes behind the parliamentary committee are contaminated by azbest whose death fibres could be broken as harmless as “power air stream”.
Ministers are often accused of caring only for their own interests, but in this case it may be contrary to the truth.
Although the Bureau of Parliament's Services insisted that the Westminster Palace receives “good medical certificates”, it is now counted on the need for a million pounds and a few years of work to be reviewed carefully, the Parliament has modernized electricity and removed asbest, and that, after the elections in 2015, the ambassadors will sit in Westminster's green bars rather than sitting in the premises of the Queen Elizabeth II Conferency Centre.
The Goddard report states that “azbest’s presence is not in accordance with several regulations. ”
It can't be said whether this disagreement will cost life.
Everyone can just wait now.
One of those who have never been able to determine when they had an azbest exposure is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Just like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, is suspected that he was exposed to asbestos at work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where the presence of azbest was demonstrated," he says, "but in my case, I can't prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places where he worked and when he worked there.
But clearly, he remembers the day in December 2009, when he had something like a cold.
He was 45, he was in the middle of the surgery.
I suddenly got shaken.
It came at once.
It was awful.
I thought I wasn't going home with a car.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming out of the bladder, the pulmonary bullets.
But like Janice Allen, she had no reason to think it was mezothelia.
Finally, he spent a month at home.
The confused doctors made him a rentgen of his chest and took his chest category to remove the fluid they sent out of his lungs.
Still, they didn't define diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and returned to work.
But from time to time, symptoms returned to him, often after he exercised and drowned.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients with similar symptoms came to the surgery and then diagnosticated mezothelia.
Even then Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
Finally, his patient was tens of years older and at work he got into direct contact with azbest.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011 Abbott's condition has reinstated and his doctor consulted his CCT and rentgens with the panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, he had been introduced by a camera-equipped sonda in his space between the extremity of chest dust and the extremary of lungs.
I'm an optimist.
I have a tendency not to marry much," he says.
To be honest, I didn't really worry about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of biopsy arrived between Christmas and New Year: “They told me that it was mezotheliom. ”
Graham Abbott: diagnosticated with mezotelliom
Abbott started meeting sisters from Macmillan's charity and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that point, he realized the range of epidemic.
"Azbest has turned out to be extensively used, especially in large public buildings that often have asbestos heat isolation in the pipe," he says.
For people who were exposed in these asbestos buildings, disease is now being exposed.
So Mesotheliom is now starting to deal with younger people who have no risk challenge.
The most dangerous pipes of heat isolated asbestos were in the hospitals in the basement, thus unlikely to threaten patients.
However, members of the staff who walked through the basement halls between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or eating in the basement dining rooms (as often Graham Abbott), certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it appears now, a few decades after the war of the hospital, they were places where patients could save their lives, but also a place that could threaten the life of doctors who treated them.
Azbest is being removed by today.
The pupils of Bunsen's cahan built on asbestos.
And it's not just a hospital.
Asbest was often used in offices, shops, librarys, and councils because of his excellent insulation and irrespective qualities.
In schools, too.
In fact, many asbestos have already been exhibited in school.
Somewhere in numerous hours of chemistry, students built Bunsen's cahan on the asbestos floor.
Web sites have been raised with the question of azbest in schools.
The harmless things such as floor plates or roofs of roofs on tools in our homes were commonly containing azbest.
"One of the industrial poison is built into a large number of houses," said Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, there was only contact with the asbest that a woman suffering from mezotheliom was able to remember during the 70 ’ s fighting of a garden house.
So be careful how you blow up the garden house.
With awareness that the disease is irregular, the impact of diagnosis is huge.
"It takes a while until you get it," Graham Abbott says.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I found out that I can't focus on what I'm doing.
I was in the surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won't live next Christmas.
One of the hardest things was the transition from the doctor's position to the patient's position.
As a countless number of patients before him, he also remembers how he felt confused about the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was difficult to understand all of this," he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘ How much time do I have left? ’
I was told that twelve months.
I remember thinking: “Well, I won’t live next Christmas.
That's it."
Mezotheliom is particularly destructive, because the mechanism of what keeps us alive -- breathing itself -- is what causes cancer that kills.
Most of the cases of mezotheliom are caused by exhibition of asbestos.
Azbest forms small fibres.
When azbest is broken and the fibres breathe, they can sit in the wormhole, the lung exhaust.
Azbest fibres are irritating and can cause cell mutation.
"The problem is the inspired azbest fibres in the form of needles," explains Professor Tom Treasure, cardio surgeon, who entered Guy's Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, which is paradoxally the leading centre in the treatment of mezotheliom.
The Treasure of Lawson knows and treats other patients who were probably exposed to asbestos during the hospital practice.
The azbest needles get into the lung tissue, says Treasure, and “the breathing itself pushes them on the edge where the shelter is located.
It's been invasive from the beginning.
Mezotelliom normal treatment options used in other types of cancer do not take so much.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is being discussed hotly.
Some think she'd be worth a try.
The treasure doesn't agree.
"You can't remove the blade," he says.
You won't get a scalpel around her.
The cancer “does not respond too much to chemotherapy, ” which, while“ has some effect, ” does not treat.
“ Sometimes there is someone who cancer the lungs survive, ” says Treasure.
But they'll all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than they were expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years since Graham Abbott's own diagnosis is still fighting.
After discovering the mezotheliom, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson who, four years since his diagnosis, became individual support and advisor for the same people.
When they called, he joyfully presented himself: “Hello, you have called at the center of cancer. ”
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months, and likely would only extend his life for a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson “he was able to show things in a more optimistic light. ”
After visiting a number of doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the chirurgial department in the hospital Guy's Hospital.
"I had the privilege that I didn't have to wait to be sent to him, but I just called there and they looked at me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get a request and they would have to approve his remuneration.
To get to the best available treatment, the question of money is key to patients with mezothelio.
But when different treatments eventually fail, many patients face another financial mayor -- the future of the family they leave here.
That's why he turns to courts and they want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“ Since 1898, asbest was known to be harmful with health," Morgan says.
However, in the 1960 ’ s, it was found that his very small quantities could also be a health risk.
And here we meet the company's carelessness.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually balanced, but according to Morgan, it was not a “complete compensation” because Lawson could definitely prove that mezotheliom was the result of the exhibition of azbest in Guy's hospital.
However, after the investigation of the case, speaker Guy's Hospital confirmed that “azbest was removed in the incriminated basement part in the 1990s. ”
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove azbest
Conducting the exposion of a death asbest to one company or a job instead - usually tens of years after that, for patients with mezotelliom trying to compensate has proved to be an enormous problem.
Many former workplaces have changed their owners or disordered.
The security records are lost.
And those who now defend themselves by accusation have time on their side, which their prosecutors certainly not.
In response to this fact, an important new legislation has been approved this year, which makes it easier for patients with mezotheliom to seek compensation, even if their former employer cannot be monitored.
The law has created 350 million financial reserves which are insured by insurance and which is intended for people diagnosticated after July 2012 who can prove that they were exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the infections will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally refer to as a compensation - approximately 120,000 pounds.
300 successful applications are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like mezotelliom patients, believes that 350 million pounds are “good work. ”
"It is an agreement written by insurance insurance companies," he says and points out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if they had not reached the time and people with mezotheliom would be able to look for former employers and to sue them normally.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Employment and Social Affairs, admitted that the law had “has had spaces. ”
But Penning and Morgan admit that, due to seven deaths, each year, a rapid negotiation was required.
"The people suffer too much and need help immediately," Penning said in December last year during the second reading of the mezotheliom law.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunskio for 19 months.
After initial consultations, he recommended Lang-Lazdunski operation, which, unlike Tom Treasura, he thought he had a positive effect.
After surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed -- a three-treatment with Lang-Lazdunski can be praised for five years of survival to 40% of patients.
Abbott made it stronger.
"Of course that is not the most important thing," Abbott says.
You always see it in patients.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition may be worsening very quickly.
Graham Abbott succeeded in March 2012.
At the end of August, he finished the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
The checks did not show any symptoms of disease.
I went to another control in March [2014].
In my chest, I had a few shattered skeletons.
My fiftieth birthday was just coming.
It doesn't threaten life.
He's taking it.
Abbott reinstated six cycles of chemotherapy.
At present, there are no signs of tumour in his body.
But it's a physical and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things -- financial security when I die, or to show the woman how the cattle is working.
When you get the bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look forward.
It's not always easy for Ellie's father (16) and Tamsin (14).
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After diagnosis I told the girls that my condition means I'll never be old.
Their reactions were different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and suddenly a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more sustainable.
She didn't say much.
Such interviews must be faced by all patients with cancer.
In patients with mezotheliom, however, such interviews are not eased by hope or just a sign of the chance of survival.
The illness brings (and eventually brings Stephen Jay Gould) unhappy certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “the mezotheliom does not threaten life. ”
The bodies of the balzamated Pharaohs are packed into the asbestos platoon.
The azbest fibres are used to fix the cooking pots and increase the resistance of the light.
Plinius Senior describes asbest.
The fabric was invented, which was furious.
I've seen it's made of the bruises that shine in the chambers on hostages.
In Italy, azbest begins to appear in commercial use, is used to produce paper (also banknotes) and tissues.
The large asbest mines are opened in Canada and South Africa, soon afterwards in America, Italy and Russia.
During the industrial revolution, it is an excellent isolation substance in par engines and turbines.
World production of azbest increases to more than 30,000 tonnes a year.
Insurance statistics Prudential detect more mortality in people working with asbestos and then life insurances are rejected.
In Rochdale, Nellie Kershaw is dying.
Dr. William Cooke confirms that the azbest particles in her lungs were no doubt the cause of her death.
It's the first case of this kind.
Kershaw employees, Turner Bros Asbestos, refuse responsibility.
They won't pay any compensation.
During World War II, ships are intensely built, work in ships represents the highest risk of asbestos exhibition.
Prohibition of imports of blue azbest
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful lawsuit for health injury due to the exposure of azbest in Britain.
World production of azbest increases to more than 4,213,000 tonnes per year.
The United Kingdom imports 139,000 tonnes.
The British Institute for Health and Security requires all asbestos suppliers to have licences.
Import and use of blue and brown azbest are prohibited in Britain by law.
The use of all azbest species is prohibited in Britain.
The law on mezotheliom shall enter into force in the United Kingdom.
350 million compensation program is being launched.
Azbest is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world, white asbest is still used as cheap construction material.
World production is held on two million tonnes a year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - demonstrators promise revenge
The Chinese parliament despite the debate on the democratic reform on Sunday decided not to allow the voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for elections in 2017.
It is likely that this step will cause long promised protests in Hong Kong's business quarter, as activists began to organize and plan only a few hours after this notification.
The Chinese People Congress is essentially allowing the Communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't surprise us, but it made us angry," said the legislator Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Peking promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And it's clear that we're dealing with the authority regime.
For the defence of the Chinese decision, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of Li Fei said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong's elections would cause "haos".
Since 1997, when Britain returned the Hong Kong administration to China, Peking promises that in the beginning of 2017, the inhabitants will be able to vote for the power of the inhabitants.
The Chinese leaders presented Sunday decisions as a democratic breakthrough, because Hong Kong allows direct votes, but also clearly shows that Chinese leaders hold firmly in their hands the nomination process of the committee which is strictly controlled by Peking.
And according to the new clause, only candidates will be allowed to “love the country and Hong Kong. ”
The decision came after summer months that recorded one of the biggest and most follow-up protests in Hong Kong in a few years.
Most of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong stand for the occupation of the Centre with love and peace, whose organisations threatened to close the financial quarter, unless Peking gives them the universal voting law.
On Sunday night, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of favourites of the Occupation in the rain gathered before the habit of the Government of Hong Kong.
At the demonstration, the organizers informed that their movements enter a new stage of civil disobedience and that the waves of protests are launched in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any more details, obviously they wanted to avoid the problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organisations said that the movement “consumed the occupation of the Centre only as the last step in case all options of dialogue are exhausted and there will be no other choice.
We must regret that all options for dialogue were exhausted today, and the posts of the Centre are inevitable.
The officials in Hong Kong have been preparing for Peking's notifications for days and strengthened the protection of the government's office on Sunday and placed police and barricades.
The incitement of anxiety is a sign that many inhabitants of Hong Kong are slowly losing control of the city.
The invasion of people from the land increases competition in the field of products and services.
The concerns are also growing that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are declined by increasing pressure from Peking.
Some people criticize the Occupation of the Centre and say that their demonstration is threatening the trade - a rescue boat of Hong Kong.
"The protest he talks could cause much more economic damage according to how many people will attend and how long," says the political Regina Ip, who has criticised the movement for a long time.
We don't want the concerns that Hong Kong gets out of control.
Such perception could damage the investment.
China's state media also came with reports in the last days, which democratic activists in Hong Kong render as counterfeit agents managed by the West.
In summer, activists organized an informal referendum on voting rights, which came to 780 000 participants -- more than five voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people attended one of the greatest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the area.
Pre-election agitation?
League in Jihlava has a name by political movement
He plays with a small smash in the district city of the Highscore about 1,600 amateur sportsmen.
And their highest competition is newly named Together for Jihlava League.
The name was given by one movement that goes to October's community elections.
The tenth of his candidate is also the chief of the little scattered in Jihlava Jan Mraka.
"There was a huge crowd where there was no problem," said the Dark.
Situation around the first league of small diggings has already been dealt with by the lawyers of the Jhlav's Council and recommended to change the subsidy division system.
A small scam won last year on the city's website about a million crowns.
It's about hundreds of thousands in this year, too.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure is not small in contrast with the law or directives of the magistrate.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Office to adjust the rules for grants and grants," said the speaker of the Mastership of Radek Tulis.
Draining grants from the city and expressing at the same time as a small scratched support in the elections of one political party, it probably won't go anymore.
The high-level "great" football like this has not yet come from politicians.
That the ChSSD may have created a district conversion, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1.
What about class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be for you.
On the contrary, I would like to have sponsors from a number of companies turned to us," said the President of the District Football Union, Miroslav Vrzačka.
The chief of the small football of another party and the movement to the name of the League
According to players, a small scatter would have earned this sport in Jihlava with six fields, dresses and social equipment.
"For example, the field on the Stoups is not ours, we're in rent," said Ondrej Lapeš from Starlet Jihlav's Club.
The most suitable place would be the Czech mill.
But there, for example, it will be constructed in my opinion, an insensitive area for skates, which is about 50 in Jihlav," said the Dark.
The Primator of Jihlava Jaroslav Clearal (ODS) responded that small digestion uses a field with artificial grass in the streets of Rošsky and on the Stoups, which are in the property of the city.
We want to build a playground that has the maximum use.
We are going to modernize or build sports in schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think that for a small rupture, a huge progress has been made in recent years," he added Clear.
Other political parties in the names of the League will not appear according to John Darkness.
We have restrictions.
If one of our partners enters our partnership, we don't give the other one anymore," he explained.
"Politic movement in the name of the League, I consider it at least an unhappy step," said a member of the Council Committee for Sports, Karel Waldan.
"But let the voters assess whether Mr. Dark uses the mergers Little Bagged Jihlava and the subsidy of the city for political purposes, or not," he added.
America's tradition breaks into university life - firstmans can fly with a trigger plane
We are glad that we can answer the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in Britain.
In order to leave the best impression at the arrival of the university, the company also offers the possibilities of transport, including a private rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also declared that the service has its security site.
The service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their things over the entire state in a dangerously loaded car.
We are looking forward to ensuring that with our VIF (very important fresher - very important first year) the students will come to the university with a minimum of nervousness and luxury.
The speaker said that since the services were just launched, they had no booking yet, but he added: “The students will start booking in a few weeks. ”
The company also stated that, although students pay annual schools of 9000 pounds, they expect the service to find their place on the market.
In comparison with students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, students today are different, as regards expectations and wishes -- more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF program is exactly the appropriate way to achieve it.
The National Union of Students, however, criticised the service as unaccessible.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, noted: “For most students, such a project is unavailable.
Many of the students who attend the university this month must, before they throw thousands of pounds away as simple as to get to the line, compare with the financial crisis, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep the step of increasing costs on basic needs.
Feminists after events in Ferguson are opposed to racism and conduct of police
At the beginning of the month, he killed a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, an unarmed young man.
The present who are waiting for the funeral with their hands up, scandal: "Don't shoot your hands up, don't shoot."
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson in Missouri for the shooting of unarmed young man Michael Brown, a blogger Miriam Zoila Perez was recorded in the online discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and equity of income, white feminists prefer sex before race.
With the increasing tension in the Middle West, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perez noticed that the responses of the white people focused at 100% on the race.
In comparison with the reactions of the blacks shortly after the shooting of 9 August, personal articles with titles such as "the idea of white over Ferguson" or "feminism is not just about the oppression of women" have appeared relatively late.
But Perez says it's an important change.
"I don't think in a feminist movement there are too many people who would talk about race and privileges at this level," she said.
People felt that what happened had to express themselves.
For the crisis we face, it is characteristic because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially equipped that they had to note it.
According to the English Professor at Ohio Corithy Mitchell State University, Ferguson had brought Ferguson to the light of problems that African Americans must face every day and which are not considered “women's questions”.
"I can publish funny stories of life on Facebook with my partner and get 150 figures from people around the world," said Mitchell.
When I write something about the colors in their own land, it's silent.
"How can a woman speak publicly about relations, but not public security?" she asked.
For blacks like Mitchell, who were dealing with race, sex and sexuality in American history, there is no between race and gender dichotomy.
The blacks were unable to make the luxury accommodate these problems: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although the white women today are combined with the question of race and gender in the mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor teaching a woman's question and gender study at George Mason University, says that their predecessors were doing the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched and the reason was almost in all cases of rape of white," said Hattery.
To justify the lynching, you needed white collaboration.
According to Hattery's division between white girls and black girls, when the fighter for election law, like Susan B. Anthony, examined at the end of the 19th century, and realized that the election law could only have one group of people - women or blacks.
"They decided to bet cards on the voting law for women and the right of black men to focus later," Hattery explained.
If we realize this, we get an important view of why colorful women don't believe white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped the blacks to protect their husbands and children.
Even after women got the election law in 1920, it took ten years before they started organizing against lynching in the Southern Women's Association for Prevention of Lynching.
The group came up for 40 years after the blacks first told each other about help.
According to Mitchell, the reaction of white feminists to questions that the Ferguson conducted -- the issue of police conduct, racial discrimination -- reflects the time when white feminist women had to "gone" questions with which the blacks were dealing with generations.
"Wasn't it great if activists in these areas [traditional feminism] took the right to raise the child as seriously as they take the right to anti-conception?" Mitchell passed.
The second wave of feminists who have made a career fighting for reproductive law and access to contraception now find out what it means.
Significant feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown was shot by Facebook, where they published a column of Rebeccy Carroll from Guardian, which required white Americans to protest more racism.
"I hope that women with different but similar reasons for understanding dangers in society - and the views of race that differ significantly in public opinion - will strive to change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem is the intersectional feminism, which includes issues of race and sex, its comments on the question of race in America are mathematical.
The American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, author of the book “Who stole feminism?", said for She The People that young men in the United States, especially young coloring men, are “more vulnerable than their sisters”, but the notes of the Steinem Party to Ferguson are faced by the criticism that she has already called before.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost no boys.
But when the White House launched a small program My Brother's Keeper, who was supposed to help the vulnerable young black people and the Spanish, it caused many feminists, including Gloria Steinem's angry response.
The attitude of the police to the Montenegro community is not the only problem that comes forward to the interest of mainstream feminism.
After the US Border Police held this year in the southwest of the country nearly 63,000 youths without accompanyment, the reform of immigration laws -- this time as a woman's question.
Andrea Mercad, co-Chairman of We Belong Together, the organization mobilizing women to reform immigration laws, said that the only thing that she had to do was to share immigrants' stories.
"He speaks for himself," Mercad says.
Since most of the work permits are granted to men, women who come with them are in a position where they are vulnerable, as regards domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have a voice in women's organisations," she said.
Accommodation of pigs in Ipswich for sale
The real office removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when she published it, rested on it in the pig's living room.
A single room house, which is sold for 120,000 pounds, stands on a private trip in Ipswich.
The information photographs included a picture of the living room where he rests with his head on a pig couch.
The real office Connells said that the pig on the photo is a pet of owners.
"The photo was mistaken, and it was already removed," said the speaker of the office.
In the real estate information, Connells described the former prayer store as “a single single single room house”.
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it is still appearing in promoting materials.
The sale of the house caused interest in social networks, where some asked whether the pig was included in the price.
After winning in the lottery, Harvey has a city in the southwest of a fresh millionaire
The lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
There's a search for a new millionaire in the southeast of Perth, and one lucky man takes a lottery home from Saturday to take $1.1 million.
Harvey's traffic has had a second time in five years, last in November 2009 it was one million dollars win.
But the lucky winner just has to log in.
Steve Forward's owner said the whole city in the southwest of Perth is talking about winning.
It's the main theme and they're all disturbing.
We thought a similar win was for touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia last month shared one victory, ending a few happy weeks.
Last weekend, the player in Canning Vale became one of the five August millionaries and only a few weeks earlier in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning couples were betting up for 20 years and said that winning would allow them to process the world and buy a new house.
A millionaire from Harvey is 59th the only winner of the lottery in Western Australia this year, totally won $85 million.
The trains Deutsche Bahn won't leave tonight.
Machine leaders want higher wages
In the press statement, GDL marked the protest for a warning strike for which he deliberately chose time outside the transport peak.
The chosen time of the strike takes the GDL view of many people who return from the weekend after the rail until the first working day.
At the same time, we also think of people coming at work during the day," the council union stated in a press statement on Monday morning for the announcement of the strike.
"Our first strike should affect primarily cargo transport, less traveling," GDL supplemented.
The DB has not yet been published by the official reaction to the announcement of the strike.
It is not even clear how the protesting action affects international railway links, inter alia with Czech Republic.
The committees require an increase in engineers' responsibilities by five per cent and the reduction of working hours by two hours a week.
Currently, the average salary of engineers is moving on the basis of the years between 36,000 and 46,000 euros (998,000 and 1,27 million crowns) annually.
Machine leaders work 39 hours a week.
The DB refuses to accede to the growth of payments in reducing working hours.
They emphasize that the remuneration assessment of the engineers must be developed as in the other railroad personnel in which the DBs do not count by reducing the working week.
It threatened the Crest's car to burn.
That's why Barum Rallye ended
What exactly happened?
It was about the defect of the material.
The car was completely new, so I didn't even think anything like that could happen.
Couldn't the exclusion be competitively fixed and continue slower to the service where the mechanics would exchange it?
If we could go right there, yes.
But we were still waiting for two other erases, and it couldn't.
There's a high temperature in it, and the risk of the car to start burning was great.
I can't afford that.
You've done five speed tests at full rate.
What kind of impression did you have?
Very good.
I felt like a young man.
We were fast, and I didn't go through the vint.
Everything was caused by the car we've had more than half a year to be at some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You've driven him by thinking real about winning.
I prepared myself and the car by really winning.
The job didn't come out.
On the other hand, the result we could've thought about has not arrived.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You weren't the only one of the peaks who left the fight for the championship early.
He also got out of him by foreign favorites of Breen, Abbring or Lappi.
Are you surprised that so many favorites have gone away?
Yes.
Mostly for the watchers, it was a shame because the race was over early.
A long time on the spear was Jaromir Tarabus, whom you're going to have a car.
But he paid for flying out of the trail and picking up a almost two-minute manko.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It's a shame because he could repeat the degrees of winners.
He was driving the first second time.
But Mira also confirmed that the car was well set up.
He was very fast.
Just a year ago you announced the end of your career, yet you showed up at the Barum Rally launch.
Can you make a good feeling of riding a regular participant of the Rally race again?
Not at this point.
Last year I said Barumka was my last race, and I didn't keep it anyway.
I decided to ride her again.
It was my nineteenth start here, and if there's a chance in a year, I'll probably go in.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people have arrived to the trail just because of you.
Did it please you?
We've been starting to a certain extent because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, constantly asked if I would go.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's waiting for you after Barumce?
The team continues.
We'll go to Wyskov next week, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't hurt too much.
Besides, he wants to borrow the Honz Sikor Fabia for this race.
With Mira, we are waiting for a European binary in Switzerland and in Korsica.
We're going to have to prepare things for the next year.
Can you mention anything?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsian Rally belonged to the world's championship, you reached the fifth place in your maxim in the series.
Doesn't it attract you to try the road again?
He's not attracting.
The oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not let your doctor confirm the work failure that serves as evidence for the organization that you cannot perform work for health reasons.
In addition, you haven't announced the employer immediately.
The agreement was thus concluded that these days would be recorded as vacation, but the agreement was only done orally.
Although the labour law does not imply the obligation to confirm the agreement of the employer with the drawing of vacation in writing, this procedure has in practice been verified.
If there is only an oral agreement, you have no confirmation.
Later, the alleged consent of vacation as well as in your case, may be denied and absence of work as a long-term unexcused absence, thus the reason for immediate cancellation of the working relationship under § 53 of the Law of Work.
In the case of a judicial dispute about the contract with the employer, there is no proof.
The working relationship with you, however, was not cancelled in accordance with § 53, but you only have the days listed in the accounting sheet as an unexcused absence.
Unexcused absence in the accounting paper does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the unemployment of material security), however, the difficult possibility of searching for new employment is difficult.
We recommend you to visit the doctor again and to confirm in writing that there has been a serious injury, resulting from which you have been unsuccessful (it is not called "unspeed", it is only a doctor's document).
When you are looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate both the exhibition of a written medical confirmation of worklessness, such a rapid notification to the employer or requesting written consent to draw the vacation.
You're avoiding any complications.
Tony Stewart's accident returning to the trail
Return to the trail ended for Tony Stewart just a little bit at the half of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
Stewart secondly hit the placement after his right front tyres broke in 172. round, and the race was over.
Stewart brought a ruined car to the garage, didn't say to the reporters, and he left.
The chief of his team Chad Johnston said that the car team number 14 is disappointed, but now he will focus on the Richmond race, in Virginia, which will be done next weekend.
"I wish we had better performance and better conclusions," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we'll be better there.
Stewart hit the race for the first time in the Sunday night race after the collaboration with Kyle Busch, which demanded repair of the right side of his car.
"We put hopes in the race today," Johnston said, "It just didn't work."
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team was packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver in the New York race, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either the Atlanta race or the next race in Richmond to reach the place in the table.
He returned to the race during the investigation of a tragic accident, where the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. died, who led Stewart during the race to the road.
The authorities said that the investigation of the cause of the accident would take at least two more weeks.
Not yet decided whether Stewart would face any charges.
The three-fold champion came to warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started at the 12th place, at the beginning of the race, he worked at 10 and then even 4.
Then, at the beginning of 122. round, Busch's car No.
18 went out of control, came out of the second turn and hit Stewart, sending both cars to the place.
Stewart went on, but he retired to the 21st place.
Prague chose a new taxi manager, earning 12.3 million
The threshold has completed the selection procedure in the new taxi manager.
In 103 parking stations, he gets approximately 12.3 million crowns annually.
Recently, she chose 150,000 crowns annually for the same places for drivers of cars.
He informed Councilman Luke Manhart (TOP 09).
The former city used the scattering of the electorals.
The winner then got a rent for a standard amount of 1,000 crowns a year.
But the rules have changed.
It is currently deciding the summary of the offer.
"The year since the original rental contracts and the initiation of electoral proceedings has proved that the new rent system is far more favourable and fair for Prague," the council states.
The most expensive flick is in Perstina
The highest price has been offered by interested in a position in the street in Perston.
They pay 2.1 million crowns a year.
Approximately 1,5 million crowns, the new governors paid for places in front of the General House or at the Václava Square.
The new rules of rentals of the taxi stations were adopted by the Council at the autumn of 2012 and declared the original rental contracts in the summer of last year.
The selection procedure took place in four waves and the new manager found 29 positions.
We had to clean the well this year twice.
We've been letting her out every time, and it's a practically second pond around the house.
Then we poured Savo there.
Unbelievable pussy!
Our well in the basement was always squeezing enough of a beautiful smelling water.
And that wasn't kind of professionally done, Grandpa scratched her with his help.
It's been a long time ago.
She was just on three circles and totally different, like everything at the cabin, but as I say.
Water was great.
Until the summer.
When we started the season, of course we exhausted the water.
When she stood there for a few months, she deserved it.
But even then, we didn't feel like the water smelled.
We've been wondering if there's something falling down there.
Where the pump was passed, it was possible at a bit of misfortunate, the board wasn't quite lying there, so there was a hole squeezed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, there was nothing to see in the water, and we enlightened her to the bottom.
So we let her go and clean her up again.
Of course, we've improved improvised tightening around the pump tube.
We noticed strange things in the basement.
There was a sticky package on the ground with some bones.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a piece more.
Now it looked like a blank mouse.
The ceiling, the places where the springs, Grandpa's invention, were the rest of the fish!
And it's hard!
Our cemetery is too distinct.
Someone would say Grandpa just buried the house.
And he wouldn't be so far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are just a drowned sand, but the ceiling is undercover.
There are mainly ships.
And the car.
And a beach bed.
The door with broad spaces was mostly open, as someone walked there in one piece.
At the ceiling of several already mentioned products.
No network, so birds usually fly in there, and they build nests on their traces.
It's useless to mention mouses.
Grandpa wanted it to blow up, and that's what he did.
Now, of course, the luft didn't help.
The whole cemetery smelled.
So we cleaned the whole cemetery.
Especially that fish on the tram was nutrible!
We also threw out the things that were around: dots, heroclite board, and so on.
Our house on the distance welcomed the circuit of the disinfective spectrum.
We've been wondering who could've dragged us these disgusting remains in there?
The closest cat lives two miles from here in all.
She'd hardly come to us.
The grandfather was attacked by one neighbor who wasn't perfectly well.
If he didn't get that french out there with the ghost?
He's been here almost a year, stupid ideas, that's what he has.
We decided to watch the ceiling and the club and regularly check.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using water again, while only washing and washing before the tests were done, but it was good.
Pulling the water from the forest water is nothing I'd like to do for a long time.
Once we heard a horrible wretched punch of our phenomenon.
My mom looked out of the balcony and saw a long, strong black whiskey in the grass next to the veranda.
The cut was scratching over her and squeezing like a madman.
My mom gave her money because she thought Réza was buying a waste sandwich from the wastehouse.
But suddenly, the screwed partially into the club and partially straightened.
The balcony has fallen to syringe.
Rheza got a hysterical invasion.
We ran down.
The bass, long over a meter and fat as a bull, was about to swallow a huge pigeon and Réza stopped it.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save the squirrel or whether she wanted to eat it alone, but it was unrelevant.
When she saw the excess in the form of our whole family, she probably said to eat it when we were hungry and elegantly dragged into the basement.
We flew after her.
She jumped into the cold as a lightning.
By the way, we recorded another smelling package on her desk.
It's like a fish, according to the smell.
She wasn't there last night!
Our new security around the pump was a little shaker.
And that's the cellar we've been locking up for the day.
That he'd...
We went out, and there we all lied to one air.
We haven't waited long.
It screwed up in the club.
First there was a flat head with yellow moons on the neck.
Then the whole bullet came out on the club.
She screwed around the pumps and started going in.
A fired employee revenged, bought a laptop company and sold them.
A sacred employee after his release bought a computer company and then sold them.
He got the money gained before the police were arrested.
During a short period, a man bought a total of 16 computers for more than 2,00,000 crowns in twelve cases.
"He transported the notebooks to Olomouca, where he was selling them at bases," stated the High Commissioner of the Schumper Police Rostislav Brückner.
The motive of fraud was the revenge of the employer for the release and the profit of money.
"When he interrogated us, he claimed that he used money to pay credits," Bruckner told us.
The police also found that the fraud was a pathological player who was treated repeatedly on psychiatric treatment.
Money could also end in victory devices or videoloteria terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money at him," the Commissioner said.
A fraud who has already been punished for stealing is now threatened to stay in prison for a year to five years.
Policemen have not yet told whether the punishment was also threatened to the basers who bought the laptops under price and continued to sell them.
"It is true that they have taken completely new goods, which is minimum suspicion," the Commissioner stated.
However, none of the owners of the base have been accused yet.
Come on, you can handle it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague.
This year, the orderers have made a few changes to us.
The biggest was the change in the route that brought the target to the flood instead of leading back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it somehow on the other side.
With the entire team, we decided to personally health our readers on the stand where we took pictures together and filmed videos.
To reach out to perfection, I accepted the role of a personal guide.
My friend and I, Katja, were obediently set up at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes.
We greeted with friends who walked around us to the faster runners sector.
There was no time left.
A few hooks to warm up, turn on sports, counting and start!
The screams of the jasoth, but instead of a rapid start, there was a screaming to the starting line.
After five minutes, we get to the gate, I'm turning on the measurement, and we're running at a ten-hour rate.
We fly through a yellow serpent of runners who, like Katja, run their first race.
At the time, all fresh, slowly falling sun on the sky gives a look at the Heaven almost up to the whiskey breath.
The pulsing meat pulling around the coast looks like the whole Prague is running here.
On the coast between the Eastern and the National Theatre, the traditionally begins to show who has the strength.
A light climb on the Palack Square forces many runners to slow down or move into the walk.
Just before I move to the Theatre, I see a police escort, and right after it, Wietek Pavliste flys an incredible pace to the target.
I hear a marvelous confused sigh of other runners.
I move to the edge of the trail, I encourage him, he's about to screw with me, but just before that, my leg is screwed up, and our hands will pass closely.
The Theatre Street sequence gives a chance of a short rest and breathing.
There are places in front of us where the views will give me a breath.
The rotation on Manes' bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the sunset.
I'm not breathing, and my feet are almost on my own.
The time of truth is at the first refreshing device.
When the road runs, Katja scobbers about the branch and shows a jump of the flood.
I'm seeing if he needs help, and I'm starting a series of encouraging words so that she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It lifts and continues with the Kozi street, it's one of the fastest places of the trail, but in this stage of the race there's no more such a volunteer, but it's necessary to watch the area well.
I still don't know that the concept of the fastest place gets its real meaning later.
For the Powder Gate, tourists and friends of other runners are frequently encouraging us.
I'm trying to applaud anyone who offers my hand, and I'm advising Cat, because ten flashing with fans is like half the energy pussy.
It really works, we're going to speed up again, and we're getting pretty badly, and now we're starting a rushing ride.
We're running tens of runners, when I'm crossing someone especially tired, I'm trying to encourage him to say, "Come on, you can do it!"
No one's running us after the last refrigerator, we're going to speed up.
We've run for an hour and a quarter, we're adding, there's nothing to wait.
Three miles to the target will be painful, but it's really necessary to move.
The sun has fallen slowly and the ending day symbolically slowly ends the race.
The last trip on the bridge, the turn, and it's just a line to the target.
The tempo we're running is wondering where the girl is taking it?
"Come on, we're going under 13, we're doing!" I call.
We're trying, printing, and there's a target here.
An hour 13 and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
The coach set a limit of 20 hours.
So seven minutes under plan.
Which is a great result.
I'm helping her to make her rest for a while.
It is visible for exhaustion, but also fortunate from well-related performance.
I'll take her out of the target space for a while.
Euforie doesn't let us think on a button in the passage to the closets.
It's here to see that the Goat Street wasn't the largest place.
That's what it's about to do for a swimming swimming swimming, which is under the effort of almost ten thousand runners to smash.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it's not a place for him.
I was losing my head after a while, and I was wondering if those beautiful views and the more interesting routes over the past years were worth what's going on in the target.
I know from my own experience that making a race isn't fun.
If 10,000 people are added to this, the rich programme and the closure of the entire Prague Centre for all transport is a huge challenge.
This year's change in the route showed to the runners a lot of interesting places, but it also brought several really uncomfortable surprises.
The excellent atmosphere pumped in the Yellow Baths has been transferred between the runner and the race itself.
Organists around the trail and random viewers graduated it on every metre of the trail.
Unfortunately, at the urban race, the historic center must count on obstacles that cannot be removed but the goal of the mass race in a place on one side is limited to the wall and on the other river, I do not consider it the best solution.
If I say that the race ended with a goal, I appreciate it as a very guided one.
I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but finally everything went well.
Write us to the debate if you liked the route, and what do you say about the situation in the target?
Prison guards in Bulgaria organize protests
Thousands of prisoners throughout Bulgaria have attended a national protest meeting before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
At the peaceful demonstration, they reiterate their requirement for reinstating the original working conditions that have changed recently.
There are also higher payments on the list of requirements to be discussed with the temporary Minister of Justice Christo Ivanov.
The overseers of the month symbolically protested the new working hours and demanded return to the original twenty - hour shifts.
Although the commissions of prison overseers and the representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they disagreed, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) was informed.
"One are still in progress," said BNR, head of the Directorate General of the Prison Service, Rosen Zhelyazkov.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Professional Officers at the Ministry of Interior will also be joined to the protests of prisoners.
Why the universe can have more dimensions and we don't see them?
Physics usually do not write bestsellers, but Brian Green from the Columbia University in 1999 hit black.
His book Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laikies to get into the guest of problems dealing with a number of theoretical physicians today - trying to unify two great functional but uncompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and theory of general relativeity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is, of course, that in the case of finding a united physical theory, it is not a boring story.
Physical fundamental problem between two key theories (which at this moment our universe de facto is divided into two worlds with different laws) has been resolved and so decided so intensely that it is worth reversing to laiks.
In addition, Greene consulted enough fresh material and boundaries that he could not count as much interesting as he had not included in his book.
Furthermore, he fixed his "fail" in most of the other two books: the structure of the universe and the Hidden Reality.
Apparently, no author would deny anything against if his book was older, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe provides almost all the important things that an informed layak with ambition should understand the world should know about this important part of the theoretical physics.
It is relatively likely that in the next years it will only be more alive in this area (i.e. because the LHC acceleration will finally go to "full gas"), so it is a good time to enter Green in the unviolently open doors of the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three space dimensions, surely can sound foolish, fantastic, strange or mystic.
However, it is concrete and fully acceptable.
To understand this, let's turn our eyes away from the universe for a moment as a whole to something more groundful, specifically to a long and thin garden powder.
Imagine that you drag a 100 - meth garden snake from one side of the canyon to the other, and you watch the whole scenario from a half-mile distance (as on the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance, you easily record a long horizontal direction of the acquisition, but if you do not suffer from the brightness, you barely recognize the thickness of the snake.
Given its great distance from the squirrel, you would think that the ants forced to live on the sand have only one dimension in which they can go: the left-right dimension along the sneak.
When someone asks you where the ant was at a given moment, you will only answer it with one information: the distance of the ants from the left (or the right) end of the sand.
All we're saying is that from a half-mile distance, a long piece of a swamp looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, he has a thick thickness.
If we increase everything, we see the second dimension suddenly -- in the form of a circle that swings the screw.
In this increased view, it is obvious that the ants can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well known left-right dimension at the length of the chain, but also in the "dimension in/proti the direction of the clock handles", that is, around the circular spray.
You begin to realize that to determine the location of a small ants, you have to enter two numbers: how far away from the end of the sneak and where it is on the circle of the whiskey.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the sneak is two-dimensional (see the Experts will observe that this chapter is focused on the strune disorder theory.
The non-competitive aspects are discussed in Chapters 12. and 13.
The surface of the sneak is two-dimensional: one long long long-term dimension is illustrated by direct arrow, dimension in the direction of the circuit, marked with a circuit arrow, is short and swift.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The dimension along the sneak is long and easily visible.
The dimension of the circuit of the sneak is short, "glumsy" and worse familiar.
To realize the existence of the circular dimension, we had to explore the scope with a significantly better distinction.
This example illustrates the important feature of space dimensions.
That they split into two groups.
They may either be large, wide, and therefore directly visible, or rather small, screwed, and much worse observed.
Of course, in that case, we didn't just plan to expose the "poor" dimension of the thickness of the sneak.
All you had to do was take a television to help.
But if the snakes were thin -- like hair or capilar -- we'd only expose a screwed dimension with a great effort.
Kaluza sent his article to Einstein in 1919, in which he made an incredible idea that space geometry of the universe could have more than three of us familiar dimensions.
He reasoned his radical claim by providing additional dimensions with an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein’s general relativeity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory to entail into the single, united concept structure.
Now the question is how this Caluz's perception goes together with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of space.
The answer Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and clearly expressed by Swedish mathematician Oscar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that space geometry of our universe can have both large and screwed dimensions.
This means that, like the dimension in the length of the squirrel, our universe has a large, wide and slightly visible three dimensions, whose existence we realize at each moment.
But analogically with the circuit circle of the garden chain can also have additional dimensions, firmly slipped into the space so small that they have remained hidden from our most perfect experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer idea of Caluz's substantial proposal, let's stay at the sandwich for a moment.
Imagine to draw the circle with a black color relatively dense series of circles.
The distance looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
Now, with a distant view, we're going to detect a screwed dimension even harder, because we'll see the motiv from picture 2.
We clearly see that the surface of the sneak is two-dimensional, with one large and almost unlimited dimension and with the second short and circuit.
Caluza and Klein came with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but besides one small circuit dimension, it has three large space dimensions, thus four space dimensions together.
It's difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imaginations, let's see the illustration of the giant 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circuit dimension.
We increase the view of the geometry of the space on the picture, just like we've zoomed the surface of the sneak.
Each next level represents a huge increase in geometry of space from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of magnification), if they are screwed into sufficiently small space; thus we explain that we haven't seen them directly yet.
The fourth network represents commonly known "great" dimensions, while the circle of a new, small and swindled dimension.
Just like the slippers wipe in a dense carpet, and these circles exist in every place of normal dimensions - just because of our opinion, we only scope them into a square network.
The background of picture 4 represents the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in the usual standards such as metres, illustrated by a small square in the square network.
In each of the following pictures, we focus on the small area of the preceding image; we increase it to make it visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see at several first levels of increase.
However, when we move on our path to the microscopic properties of space further - to the fourth level of magnification in image 3 - we will see suddenly a new, a circle-shaped dimension, like the slippers or the thick piece of the carpet.
Caluza and Klein came with the idea that an additional circuit dimension exists in every place in the direction of large dimensions similar to the circle circuits in each point of its length.
For reasonableness, the circuit dimensions were emphasized only in some, regularly placed points.
Figure 4 Caluzova and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of geometry of space summates.
Similarity with the wax is obvious, even if we record important differences.
First of all, the universe has three large, far-dimensional space dimensions (of which we only draw two), where the screws have a large dimension of only one.
The more important difference is that we're talking about the space geometry of the universe itself, not just about any object inside the universe, such as our scrap.
The basic idea is the same.
If an additional circuit dimension is extremely miniature, recognise it is - as the circle circle circle - much harder than to observe obvious, large and widely dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is sufficiently small, it will actually be revealed over the powers of our most modern tools to increase.
But the most important thing is that the additional dimension is not just a huge throat inside the normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration mismatches.
The circuit dimension is a new dimension that exists at each point of three common dimensions.
It is the dimension of the remaining three dimensions independable as the sizes of the top-downs, the left-to-right and the front-back independent (and slippery) each other.
A sufficiently small ants could move in all four dimensions and to determine its position we would need four data, except for three usual positions in the circuit dimension; if we count even time, then data five, in any case more than we normally expect.
Did you take care of it?
The book The Elegant Universe of Brian Greeen can be purchased here for books.idnes.cz.
The e-book price is 149,- Kč.
So, to our surprise, we find that being aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Caluz and Klein suggests that this does not exclude the existence of additional screwed dimensions if they are sufficiently small.
The universe can have more dimensions than we can see with just an eye.
How small should they be?
The most modern technical equipment can recognise the structures of a large billion billion meters.
We can barely observe a smaller screwed dimension.
In 1926, Klein combined the original Kaluz's idea with several ideas from just the birth quantum mechanics.
His calculations indicated that an additional circuit dimension could have the size of approximately one Planck length, which is far beyond the distinguishing capacity of today’s devices.
Since then, physics call the possibility of additional small space dimensions of Kaluzova-Klein theory.
Wogni Honza Homola advises how to exercise on electric guitar: 5 part
The whole "twelve" part is a 12-tact harmonic form that you can repeat freely.
Who's drowning in music theory finds her principle detailed here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
By education of a dollman and a doll driver whose facebook profile can be monitored here, from maturity 20 years ago, they live as a graph.
He's a guitarist of the Woget band, which, unfortunately, can't leave.
The guitarist is after his father, as is Matthew's brother, the leader of Wohat.
Start on one string with training.
"The rhythm model is only for you, you can make up anything, then just apply it to a harmonic model of twelve," Honza advises.
If you add another string, you can change the figure again.
All you need to do is listen and watch Honza, what you can make up with twelve harmonies on two strings and how nice it's starting to sound.
If you pick up a third string, you can already coke with a song with the song.
When you finally add the fourth, be careful to change the debug, Honza will be alerted in the video.
Next time Honza will return to the pentatonic and you'll try to put it together with the twelve.
Then exercise her fairly.
The best, you can read it in the interview with Jane Homola at the first lesson of his school games on the electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, recognised by the castle Castle
We're taking the point and we're glad to see it.
The first half time, we had more chances, the second home," said the attacker, who this time scored out of the penalty.
You weren't nervous when he played, weren't you just accompanied by a huge swimming swimming?
Somehow, I didn't think of it, even though the second gate where the home fans are, it would probably be worse.
You balanced the penalto after half an hour, but you also got a goal from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We fell asleep at the beginning, we were passive, it came from the corner, and then the penalty came after it.
After it, you got up and first half time you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that we played well after an incased goal until the rest.
In the cabin, we thought we wanted to keep the game pace after it, but we couldn't.
To tell the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it's also probably true that they said something about a break to their game, probably not very satisfied with it.
You've only been on the rival playground for the first time, until you may have even got a goal at home.
Why is that such a difference?
I don't think it's such a difference, but it depends on us, how we do it.
We started well in Brna, but then it was bad from us, Pluz, that's another category.
Four matches you were waiting for the goal, weren't you afraid that after the last fight could be similar?
Perhaps not, but we are certainly happy that since the last match, we don't have to talk about waiting for goals.
Now, without waiting, we added another, but there are only three in six matches, which is not yet for great celebration.
Iceland - Lion comes from a mile away crotter.
Flying on the surface of the Holuhraun near the icefish Vatnajökull, is flowing by the underground tunnel from a mile away.
It's under the ice tunnel, as well as a part of the mentioned underground lave tunnel.
This fact now concerns the scientist the most...
The situation remains unchanged for now.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.)
2014) continues to fly out of the crack of approximately the same amount of the lion.
However, against original estimates, its quantities are lower than 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Against the previous explosion of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times larger.
However, scientists fear that the lamb tunnel could be opened in places under ice.
In addition, with similar intensity as the current eruption, it would mean huge floods, both on the Yökulsaa a Fjöllum river and on other rivers.
In the area of the eruption, it feels a strong smell of cheese, and the clouds of couples and gases rise from the crack.
It is definitely not an explosion suitable for tourist movement, such as in the case of an explosion in Fimmvörjohls in 2010.
This is much bigger and there are much more gases," says vulcanologist Armann Hösculdsson.
However, weather has been significantly improved since yesterday, and in the early hours almost no air.
The tracks of the sandstorm were washed by rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange degree (second highest) for Barjarbung and yellow (third) for Aska shall apply.
The sky over Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked through the wings
A flight day in Cheb.
The Boeing Stearman PT-17 machine presented the Peggy Valentin Air Acrobat, which came from the cockpit to the castle on the top wings of the two-wings and between the wings.
There it is denied only to the strength of muscles.
A flight day in Chebu was held this year on the fifth, and the directors were able to prepare a few interesting aircraft.
The Prime Minister took place at the oldest Czech airport not only in "going by wings" in the application of the German acrobate of Peggy Walentin, but also a legendary chase P-51 D Mustang or a plane Beechcraft 18.
He turned his attention to himself with his glowing wave.
Acrobatia called Wingwalking has origin in the United States.
After World War 1, many former war pilots were so trying to prosecute.
But the number of death damages has been prohibited.
But today he is slowly returning to the Air Days Programme.
Peggy gets out of the cockpit to the top wing.
He's showing different practices there.
At the end of the show, it will move into the area between the wings of the aircraft, where its show continues," described Ludek Maciejkik from the Chebean Ultralight Club and organizer of the Air Day.
The pilot of Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main hill of the program, then the next Mustang prosecutor's show was a reputation of the cake.
The Legendary Racinger joined the area with the Grippenes of the Czech Republic's Army in the curtain (such as numbers).
That's the first time the flying fans in Czech Republic could see.
The Pilot Miroslav Sazavski then showed all the breath of taking acrobacy with a plane from 1945.
He was made in war, but he probably never attended her.
He was included in military reserves.
Since 1963 he's been in a civil sector.
Even as a race plane.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Mnich Building.
In the same place there is also another Cheb Air Day Pearl, two-motor Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
The airport didn't go over a powerful machine.
His flattered aluminium stream shined in the distance.
Excellence has also obtained Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colors of French aircraft.
A small carriage plane jumped for a denied Turbolet and a part of the German Hofu brought from the German delegation to the airport day.
The German neighbours performed in Chebu with reconstructed planes As 18T or three-party formation of Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhy: Dramatic return in front of the camera!
The parental concern was exchanged by Lucie Borhy for at least tonight for those workers.
Stress or nerve - a blonde moderator doesn't obviously know anything of this.
For she was doing good, as if she hadn’t stopped with him for two months!
It's only two weeks since the blondes ended six weeks, with women having the biggest stress after birth.
However, Lucia will not show regularly in the main reporting TV Nova.
The regular return is waiting for her in the lightning.cz information until a month.
It's just her daughter Linda now needs more than a television watcher.
Lucy Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a black hit.
A hand exhibition in Prague?
Hala would sell herself, plans Jagr's party.
It would be worthy to do something like that during the world's championship.
But it depends on how the union will be made up," he said in Jihlava after the exhibition called the Golden Facility, in which a fascinating nagan team again gathered.
Even the players who were participating in the golden cap.
Players should taste, don't they?
Sure.
It would be just good to do goodbye with a gold generation during the championship.
I think they can find one two days during the tournament, when it's full free, and where such a struggle could be mixed.
We'll tell Gum (Jiri Schlegrova) or Bedja Scherbana (the rider of the Yihlav fight), who would take care of it...
The arena would sell herself out.
But what if you play with New Jersey play-off?
So if I get here...
But you don't want to play in representation.
Or did the Jihlav meeting change your decision?
Representations and exhibitions are two different things and the representation is decisive.
One thing is, people would like to see me there, but the performances are crucial, especially for the world's championship.
That's where the players should ride, not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
How did you actually enjoy the nagan dating?
All that meeting with the players was great.
A man regained his stories and experienced a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans, but also for hockeyists.
But the most important thing was the honour of Ivan Glink.
And it's good to remind the history of our hockey and that one generation is leaving, which really worth it.
Slavomir Lener, Vladimir Różica and Peter Čechmanek on the medator.
Do you still think of your first representation match?
They don't forget such things.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young men: me, Robert Hollic and Robert Reichel, we came in one three.
For everyone, it was the first start of representation.
Well, if we could dominate somehow, we can't say that.
In Jihlava, Dominik Haszek was captured for a long time.
What did you say about his performance?
I'm never surprised by Hashan on the ice.
I wanted to return this to him with the criticism, but I can't (Hashek criticized Jagra for reasons why he decided to quit in representation). He just caught it greatly.
It's a great show, too.
You used to train with me once at night and there was a hole.
And now he's catching famous.
First United States and then Netherlands, footballists start qualifications
The nurses of the NH Hotel were accompanied by the prominent guests on Monday morning.
People could have seen, for example, Peter Chelsea, Coach of Paul Verba...
And there, that figure in the black squirrel, it's Tomasz Rosic!
Arsenalu's carrier and the captain of the representation arrived for a meeting about half-two among the last.
There's a beautiful fight against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be pleased?" he said, when he already made a reporter's presentation.
Czech Representation Programme
Monday 1 September: beginning of the meeting, first training
Tuesday 2 September: Training open for fans (18:30, Year) Autograph (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Year)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Year) end of the meeting
Russian and gender can support fans even before the Central Fight against the United States (20:15).
The presentation opened a Tuesday training, which begins at 18:30.
And then there will be a autograph where the Russian or Czech will not be missing.
Otherwise, this meeting of the national team will be more calm.
Which commends Coach Vrb, who was just complaining about the number of social action on the spring.
Finally, we will dedicate ourselves to what we want to do.
Now we'll focus on the Netherlands.
It's a benefit when you have players together eight days.
We will have time to exercise things for which we have not been doing so long," he commended the Werba, which has officially led the national team from January.
The Czech football representation will be carried out by a musketar image when entering a new qualification cycle.
Representation has three matches under Verba, all ready.
She remissed 2:2 with Norway and Finland and lost 1:2.
However, these results were not important yet.
That's right now.
The qualifications for the European Championship 2016 will be launched by the Netherlands.
Of course, the Czech people would be helpful if they could handle the general against the United States.
The first half year was to meet each other.
Now the results are important.
We have to think about being successful," Werba agreed.
The only player in the 30-member nomination with health problems is David Lafata.
He's suffering from the temperature.
If he hadn't been able to heal himself in the middle of the U.S. fight, Coach Vrba would have invited another attacker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman in Britain describes how after a bad diagnosis she thought she'd die for years.
After diagnosticated with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent the majority of adulthood in her opinion that she has only a few years of life.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of inheritance disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and the back.
The CMT UK charitable organisation stated that bad diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT, because the disease is not known very much.
It is considered that CMT is suffering about 23,000 people in the United Kingdom, which may be symptoms in the field of motorcycle, such as muscle weakness, irregular walk, and scratched fingers on the feet.
Infected can also occur insensitiveness or pain, this condition is irrelevant and progressive, which means that the symptoms are worsening through time.
When Rodgers was 13, she thought she suffered Freidreich's attaxie (FA) - a disease that has a very bad forecast.
She believed that before she celebrated the eighteenth birthday, she was stuck on the wheel chair, and she was dead before she was thirty.
A mother of two children, now 51, says: “I knew as a child that I could not do the same things as others.
I fell down every day, and everything took me longer.
I've never been able to ride with the other kids on a scateboard or a skateboard, and I've been kicked at school for walking and running."
When Rodgers was thirteen and she was after several operations that were to release her Achilles' shelves and compare the feet, she used her doctor to leave the room, and looked at her documentation where she learned that she was suffering FA.
"I felt guilty because I was blamed, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home, I looked for information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association," she said.
When they answered me, I was in shock, I totally panicked.
I thought before I was 18, I'd end up on my wheelchair, and before I'm fifteen, I'll be dead, and then I'll gradually lose all my powers.
I was all alone and I planned my funeral."
When she was 17 years old, she realized that her walking ability was not as much worse as she assumed, and asked her surgeon.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said: “Sweetie, I don’t think you have the illness, otherwise you'd be on the wheelchair.
I think it'll be a much less dangerous life."
After a few genetic tests graduated, CMT was found.
"When he explained me what CMT is, I thought I was a happy child," she said.
The CMT UK charitable organisation launched a month of information on CMT to notify this disease.
Entrepreneurs in the area of Washington: taxes are raised with the conversion of the economy
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new research published last week, state and local taxation to companies in the country with acceleration of economic recovery had slightly increased last year, and companies in Washington were not exceptional.
Investors in Maryland and Virginia together for the fiscal year 2013 took $27.6 billion to the state and local treasures, which is 3.8% higher than $26.6 billion selected in 2012.
Tax burdens - state and local - increased by 4.3% last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year and was a third growth year after 2009 and 2010 when taxes were reduced.
According to the study conducted by the Ernst & Young and the Political Communities of the Centre on State Taxation, State taxes increased faster by 4,3% than local retails, by 3.9%.
More than half of the tax revenues of the district, 56%, is from an animal tax, and 36% of Maryland's income is from companies.
Virginia, with 28 %, shows a moderately smaller tax income from business.
The researchers argue that the majority of the growth in tax income is due to an increase in the value of property belonging to companies, which has increased by 3.7% by the real estate tax this year after three years of growth.
Although most profits come from large states like California, New York and Texas, the same situation seems to be in Washington.
The companies in D.C., Maryland and Virginia paid over $10 billion last year on national and local property taxes, which compared to 9.6 billion in 2012 represents an annual increase of 4.2%.
However, the apparent increase in real estate does not exert so much to the state and local tax income in Maryland, where the property tax represents less than a fifth of company taxation.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., the property tax represents almost half the state and local taxation.
“In Maryland, there is a lot of real estate to companies, especially the base of tax in the area of D.C., the government or a non-profit organisation that does not pay taxes”, explained Douglas Lindholm, executive director Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to relieve much more, for example, on income taxes to pay for the same services that are in other countries.
The recent increase in tax income from business cannot be assigned only to the remedies market.
According to data, business revenues also seem to increase.
Companies in this region have published a tax from the revenue of 2.3 billion dollars that have increased from 2.1 billion of 2012.
Maryland has chosen a billion dollars, most in the region in taxes from business companies.
Although they are taken in the same direction, local tax burdens of businesses do not grow as quickly in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average level, at 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only in Virginia there was an increase in tax under the average, by 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest income tax from all three circles (of which all the same taxes) of business revenues, 6 %.
Trade tax rate in Maryland is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, at 9.975 %.
Similar studies carried out by the US Trade Chamber this year showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and totally more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. didn't evaluate.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the southern.
North Carolina recently signed a tax reduction of 6.9% from 6% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and the tax is reduced to 5% next year.
If the revenue targets continue to be held in the coming year, the fixed tax rate of revenue could be reduced to 3 % in 2017.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington are doing better, so higher government and local taxes are paid.
Little businesses' tax transfers as a tax from personal income - the structure of compensation to increase prices by which most companies are organised - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia has increased by 20% last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers argue that the trend and the national increase in animal tax will likely continue next year, the total tax income from the sale for state and local governments in comparison with the same period in the first three quarters of 2014 will increase to 6.2% in comparison with the same period in the past year.
However, Washington can remain behind others, because reducing state expenses chooses its tax on the labour market.
What you've missed: Europe's boss will be Tusk, Putinovo Novorusko and Lafat's knives
Is there a new state in Ukraine?
Putin called for negotiations on Novorusk
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the south-east of Ukraine, where government units have been struggling with the Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that after the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, they will have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support provided to the West by the war of the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine contradicts democratic values.
The end of the conflict, according to him, depends on Kyev, so he can't tell when the Ukrainian crisis ends.
Another sanction for Russia?
Czech Republic has had the right to disagree with part
The European Commission, together with the diplomats in a week, has proposed a form of another affirmation of the anti-Russian sanctions, decided at night for the EU summit today.
The reporters were told by the Permanent Chairman of the meetings of the Member States, Herman Van Rompuy.
According to Czech Prime Minister Boguslava Sobotka, specific proposals to move the forms of sanctions should be prepared on Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU President.
Van Rompuye will replace in December
The Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to head the European Council, the so-called EU President, managing the summits of the Member States.
From December to two and a half years, he'll replace Herman Van Rompuy.
In the lead of the European diplomacy, Catherine Ashton, Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogheriniová.
The Italian vice-president of the future European Commission must still be confirmed in the function of the European Parliament.

Incomplete promises.
The elections are coming and the parties are offered again and impossible
The end of the homeless people on the streets, the parking for every family and the chain over Prague.
It is repeated before each choice: the parties promise the impossible.

Joan Rivers' family: "We hold our thumbs"
Joan Rivers is unconscious for three days, since she was brought to the hospital in New York City, but her daughter today said she was not losing hope that the 11-year-old comic will be healed.
"We thank you for your greetings and support," said Melissa Rivers in today's statement.
We're holding her fingers.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a rescue service call, according to which her heart rate at the yorkwill endoscopic in Upper East Side, as the source indicated.
The physicians intentionally maintain it under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are certain of its condition that remains “valuable”.
The reactions did not allow to wait long, including incredible support on the Internet of personalities such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
Reality is screwed titles
That the media are screwing the reality with their titles, unfortunately, there is no news.
I know the titles "sell" papers, but unfortunately I also know that many of them are so-called readers, who do not read anything else.
And that's the fact that I'm very troubled lately, more precise is the word of anger.
This concerns particularly the articles on the conflict of Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
Totally common are the titles "Israel attacked Gaza."
Just in the text you read that Israel's "attack" was the response to burned missiles from the Gaza zone, often during the time of the reconciliation.
Then it will appear the title "Both sides broke the reconciliation."
Does the journalist community realize that this procedure directly involves antisemitical attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there)?
It has not been sixty years since the end of World War II.
People who survived Shaw are still alive.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd screamed the passwords of "Jewish pigs" and similar disgustingness, I was disgusted.
Is that what the world wants to finish what Hitler didn't make?
Do our journalists realize the fact that after the Jews, they were appointed to eliminate the Slovakians?
Ladies and gentlemen, please give a little more care of your work.
You're often labeled "the guardian dogs of democracy."
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also defend the right of one truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect your population.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbours decided that the Czech nation would eliminate and remove the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also realize another fact.
Almost 20% of the Arabs with Israel’s citizens live in the territory of Israel.
And they're good there.
If you ask them, why don't they go between all of them, like Gaza, they'll answer why they would do that?
In Israel, they have work, social security, and high health care (I saw myself seeing Hadassa's high private hospital, financed from the Jews' sponsorship gifts from all over the world, commonly visiting Arabs, and they are obviously treated there).
Hamas attacks his Arab brothers with his shots.
The only real help of Gaza, including this disturbing area, is to get rid of Hamas and disarm him.
And not condemn Israel, be indirect in the titles.
Inform the practices of Hamas, his abuse of people as human shields.
Notify that Hamas aims to eliminate the State of Israel at any cost.
Even for the death of innocent Arab children.
Inform Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Inform that in nine years of self-authorization in Gaza this area could be a prosperous area through humanitarian assistance from around the world.
Even from Israel, which delivers water and electricity, which, of course, does not apply to Gaza’s managers and even angers that the supply of currents are sometimes interrupted at that time.
If Hamas did not invest money in the construction of underground tunnels so that self-suicide attackers could prosecute them in the territory of Israel, but, perhaps, to the building of houses, hospitals and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would live much better.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion Twitch
AMAZON has just confirmed the statement Information from Monday morning: Internet retailer - video producer and hundreds of other things - buys for $1.04 billion (970 million US$) video streaming services Twitch.
The notification has not caused a surprise because no one would expect Twitch to buy, but because it was expected to be a buyer of YouTube.
Three months ago, it seemed to sell Twitche Googlu in a billion sure, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, who was founded just three years ago Justin.tv, was incorporated to become a widely used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it became a fast platform for players who sent online transfers from games - words Business Insider "YouTube for lively transmitted games".
Interface Twiche.
On YouTube, there are already popular videos "Let's play", a kind where wise people (party elders) give the game of processing Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube's describing Twiche comes to a lot, so the news that YouTube is buying Twitch, who was not very excited, was an example of how the introduced company would pay for possible competition.
The mystery is why the YouTube agreement has not gone, although the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we are currently available is the statement of the CEO of Twitche Emmet Shear: “We have chosen Amazon because he believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us fulfill it faster.”
Another mystery is - honestly - the incredible success of Twiche.
For snobs like me, who claim that sports are rather doing than watching, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about, games instead of real playing just watching.
One thing is to watch at three in the morning a friend over his shoulder playing the Resident Evil, and the whole other thing is to watch someone stranger, how he gets twenty hits in the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could just look at.
Another problem is that a lot of today's, most popular games are from the perspective of the player, so you look at their records without you to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good prescription of how to acquire your head.
I admit that games of type speed run in which Rogers Bannisters of our electronic time finish the game at the record time is funny.
But if someone's not a master of play or humor, his channel on Twitch probably won't be very interesting.
But what does the skeptics like me know about?
Twich has 55 million visits a month and is fourth at the top of the Internet operation.
How exactly will Amazon use that?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch interferes with Amazon Instant Video as elegant as if it could have swallowed YouTube.
But Twitch has something that would like to attract every company: hordes of young men that the books want.
As director Twitche Shear said, Amazon and Twitch “believe in the future of games” and the media don't seem to be distracted, nor like - swallowing - watchers.
The second basic lie of creacionism.
Another Czech translation of the American atheist vlogger Aaron Ra.
This time on "Sacred Fonts are God's word."
The original video is attached.
The second basic lies to creacionism are the belief that the sacred texts were written by God and not by the true human authors.
When believers debate about one of the many things that are in contrast with their religions, they often set us up with the question: Who will you trust?
God’s alleged word, or the word of a man?
It's like human research was totally vain in comparison with the authority they imagine that he has their doctrine.
Only when they say "man," they're talking about science.
And when they refer to “the word of God, ” they refer to the myths of the God of the people written.
If there is really an intelligent creator with a purpose, then it is the one who created a fossil record that reveals the evolutionary history, and it must be the one who invented the genetic patterns that respond to it, and it must be the one who added a number of more evidence that shows exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion in the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
Looks like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of these things.
But people can tell stories, fabulate.
And they were the people who wrote all those texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every sacred teaching of any religion in the world is described as humans, not gods.
People who were "moving" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listening to the dictate of angels, but those texts were written by none other than just mortals with a certain degree of imagination, no angels and no more gods.
If there really was one true god, it would be an integral part of all gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire space.
If a creature of such size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, the only letter of holy text.
She would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because the use of human authors could not be measured with such works.
And people would not have to believe her blindly, because it would be consistent, subjected to valid and true evidence, and would reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
She would persist in inspiring every reader to unity of shared faith.
If God wrote it, we wouldn't have expected anything smaller.
But what we see instead of it is exactly the opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the final truth, we have many different religions without common origin, and all are constantly denominated to increasingly separate denominations, looking for dispute truths and in some ways enforcing God’s guidance, regardless of continuing diversity and division in every direction.
The Jewish Tora, Christian Gospels, Islamic Koran, Baha'ullah's Kitab-i-Akdas, Zarathustrova Avesta, Sikh Adi-Grant, Mahabharatska Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormonov, or the book Urantia are all considered "a absolute truth" and "approved word of the only true god" and the faithful believers of each of them say that the other is on the ground.
The only logical explanation is likely that everyone is at a certain point.
None of the books mentioned above has any advantage against others.
None of them have a proof of opposition and no history can be confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at the West Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and appology (defense), because they contain incomparability, absurdity and primitive ideas once considered true that have already been overcome.
So it cannot be said that they are proof of divine wisdom.
Many of them prosecute awful beasts instead of morality, and many of them claim to be confirmed by fulfilling prophecy - with the fact that each can also contain prophecy that has not been fulfilled.
Theoretical theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands, thus subjected to interpretation, impressions and views of their primitive and often prejudice to politically motivated authors, explaining many of the controversies and incompatibilities in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it an objection, rather commentary.
We need to reiterate that we have two different authors here whose work was kind of mixed together during some editorial revision.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not by telling an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for Pentateuch, i.e. five books of “Moses” and Moses, not authors any of them, because he almost certainly did not exist as it is described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several mutually unnecessary oral traditions less than 2500 years ago.
Other documents have been filtered at the same time and all are assigned to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as its believers think.
The Scrolls from the Dead Sea are the oldest archaeological findings of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet are much younger than the roots of zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Helenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a gnostic faith, followed by docettes and ebionites and their entirely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in some compromise called orthodox.
Other Christian groups such as luxury were discredited and discredited by other Bible revisions.
One of these regulations refers to the king of Ugarit, who ruled 3500 years ago.
Because his followers represented a major threat to the youth of Moses, the authors of the New Law decided to confuse and Ba'al Zebula, "God on the Mountain" changed Belzebub "Man of Much".
So the Bible was intentionally and fraudally amended for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened by the New Law was canonized in the fourth century C.E. in a series of committee decisions in Nicai.
Four Gospels were accepted and sixteen others were rejected by a simple raise of the hand, as if the fact could be accepted or rejected by vote.
The way the canon developed depended on what was read about Sundays in those Christian centres.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in Jerusalem’s Church?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually discovered that they were approaching the same Gospel stories.
So the core of the canon developed from the earliest of the original church.
So the Congress simply accepted as the Gospel any relevant stories that circulated between uneducated meats at that time.
However, they consciously took over ten books from the Bible, even though they were referring to books that were approved.
Among the rejected items, we will find the records of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s word refer us to books that are only words of some people and/or are not available anymore?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be approved so if God was the true author of this random mixture of reputation, illustration and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was definitely written by people and certainly not with too much enlightenment, rather on the contrary!
That's why so much of her content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, whatever it is from the beginning to the end.
We're talking about people who believed that serpents and blades could talk, believe in spells, bloody victims, ritual spells, charmed objects, fire-free pills, astrology and five animals of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic stick to squeeze someone with blood, it would cure him from the leper.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were chewing and nipples are birds and whales are fish and drinks that they're all numbers.
These people believed that if they show the pregnant cow squeezed patterns, they would be delivered by the laundry bodies.
How could someone who knows something about genetics say this?
The authors of this book, of course, didn't know.
If the Bible was written by a higher being, it would not contain such errors as it contains.
If it came from a pen of really superior creatures and was designed as literal history, then it would not have contained anything of what it contains.
As a moral guide, it totally fails because most of the original Hebrew records were written by unscientific and bigotic wildliers who ignored or supported cruelty against animals, incest, slavery, abuse of slaves, abuse of family members, abuse of children, violence on children, abortion, murder, cannibalism, genocide, and prejudice against race, nation, religion, and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming that they do God’s will.
But creatists still ignore this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, the fact must be ignored!
And why?
Because if creatists had no loved books, they wouldn't have a god.
Their world is the same.
It's ironical that they reject God's "work" as "creation worship instead of the Creator."
But they themselves consider the word of a man as the word of God and the god of themselves, and even insist that the distortion of their allegedly "holy" books somehow distorts God as such.
Not their version of God, but all the versions of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, God lies.
They cannot accept that God could exist, and the Bible may be wrong at the same time because he cannot separate the doctrine from divine.
So it's a kind of idolatry where believers worship man's compilation, as if these books were a god, because they think they're his word.
But God never wrote or directed any of the records of any religion.
Anything that people have approved or rejected in their allegedly "free word" of any god was made up, compiled, compiled, translated, interpreted, corrected and often intentionally modified and crushed by just missing people.

Apple iCloud reportedly succeeded in hackers, the public got naked images of celebrity
Screenshot with expired files
Meanwhile, an anonymous user on the 4chan server announces naked and pornographic images of American celebrity, the US Mashable.com server noted.
It is reportedly obtained by unauthorized access to user accounts on Applu servers where users were recorded by automatic repository of iPhones and iPad images.
Apple hasn't spoken to a problem yet.
The part of the celebrity rejects the images as fake, but several of the images concerned have already admitted.
It belongs to Jennifer Lawrence, known as Katniss in the Hunger Games film series or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played in the Death Trap 4.0.
The purpose of hacker is to use the images and videos obtained for enrichment.
The recordings reportedly showed an interest in American magazines, according to the 4chan server's reports, but he wants hacker more money than the community.
According to the The Next Web server, it is probably a weakness in iCloud security.
Because a tool on the GitHub server appeared two days ago that allowed the user's accounts to get passwords via a gross force, i.e. automatic repetition of attempts to login with different passwords.
This tool has worked proofly, but Apple closed the safe hole after two days.
However, it is clear that potential attackers had a lot of time to obtain access to different accounts before the publication of this instrument.
The iCloud users should therefore change their password with Apple ID for preventive reasons.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
The length of at least 12 characters is suitable.
The escape of naked images of celebrity is considered a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although companies servers such as Apple, Google or Microsoft, are multipliedly better secured than computers in households or smaller companies, download sensitive photos in unsafe form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to record explicit photos or any other sensitive content, encrypt the files before upload.
It is also reasonable to set the automatic backup of the photos from the phone so that it only runs on wi-fi and after connection to the charger.
So you will be able to move sensitive images "to security" in time, and in particular you will have space to delete undepleted images, so they will not take the space in the online storage.
Instructions about how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet, we offer HN and IHNED.cz readers in the form of an electronic book from Michal Altaira Valaška in PDF format.
Smart way to save for high school script
Since the price for a high school script for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, an incoming student of the second year came with a smart way to reduce costs.
He invented a book lending system from students from high schools offering nominal compensation to delay their sale back.
"The book for calculations, which usually cost 180 dollars, I got for a semester for ten and for chicken Nugets," says Schroeder, 19, studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He lost 120.
According to the university Council, the average student will spend more than $1,200 per year, but students have different options to manage these expenditures.
The preferred choice of students becomes Internet trades and creative solutions such as Schroeder's.
Increasing is renting books, which allows students to use a semester of book, often with significant discounts than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc, operating over 250 books in campus areas, says the loaning of books has doubled since 2011.
The study shows that about a quarter of the books in university books were loaned in the last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the teaching texts are purchased according to the National Association of University Trade in university books.
There's 101 of the best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
The prices of some new books may be on the Internet by a third of the university books.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book “Calculus” of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost 290 dollars, but it is possible on the Internet on Chegg.com, in a low-market specialized book, to buy a new $239,99.
Buy Used
If you don't mind notes of other people or consumption and destruction, the appropriate options are used.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, student of the University of Brigham Young, says that Amazon.com paid for the used print “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of the Advertising Business” 42 cents.
The new one sold himself for $48.
The university teacher Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students in their teachers verify whether older publications are acceptable.
Sometimes changes to work in seminars are not important.
If so, the elderly may be sold for a fraction of the price of the last version.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, they are also the favorite alternative to buy the books used eBay Inc's Half.com.
Loaning
It is also worth considering the loaning books, if you treat them well, you do not forget to return them, and you do not need to have them even after the end of the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the costs of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow Calculus for about $20 for a semester.
Meet the conditions of trade in which you borrow the book, including the impact of notes, highlighting or consumption and damage.
Remember: If you do not return the book in time, the penalty may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to settle the e-book instead of the normal book.
Sometimes these books are basically lended in the form of electronic licence valid for a certain period from distributors like Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows "Calculus" for six months in approximately $161.
According to Bracey, the most suitable offers can be found by students of literary courses, because many classics are now available to download free, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
Either way, go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon enter Pepperdin Law School, recommends to follow the ISBN because it guarantees you buy the right book.
Before you order a book on the Internet, make sure that it is really a warehouse, Gault advises.
He made sure of it on his own skin.
The book he bought was sold for four weeks, and he had to pay a full price for a book from the university book.
Mud, blank.
And then they found a torzo of guns at the end of the war.
That well stands a little bit from St. Jirie's church.
We discovered a rise around and we started pulling a summer carriage - about a metr and a half bladder and dirty leaves.
When we were approaching the day of the moon, we hit the head," Radomil Novak said.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up and found that it was a torzo of attacking German guns used by SS units.
The finding is allegedly unusual.
According to my information, these rifles were made until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," Newman added.
All wooden structures have been disintegrated in time, so it is unused.
Her body is, of course, preserved - keeps its shape.
How did it get in the club?
There's one explanation.
Maybe there were people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by SS units, probably because of fear of being removed.
The fascists in the escape would probably not do that.
They threw their weapons in the woods," the finder thinks.
The gun was the only thing the enthusiasts from the Movement of the Duch of the Jesenics found in the cable.
"There may have been manual grenades, those once around a lot, so we slowed down the digging work, we carefully mudded out so that there was no unfortunate situation, but there was nothing else down there," approached Novok.
The finding will end in the museum depositary at the castle in the nearby Slez Rudoltics.
Ukrainian General: I haven't released the enslaved Czech yet
Exclusive interview Currently.cz with General Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from capture of Proroxic Separatists.
Kyev/Praha - "I'm sorry, I have to take this-- they call me from Doneck," he may apologize eight times during an exclusive conversation with Currently.cz Ukrainian Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise also the Director of the Centre for Liberation of War Prisoners.
Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban in a television debate.
In each such interruption, it could not be heard of people's names, their numbers or places where they are - or they should be - which Ruban is fixing with his transit at the end of the phone.
"It's going to be it - go there," he finished one of the lightning discussions with Doneck and devoted to ours again.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in the backup, former chase pilot and an active participant of anti-governmental protests in Midan.
Since yesterday - when we had an interview - he was in Donec.
Liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of Prorous separatists is devoted to forty-five hours a day.
Currently.cz: You may know that on the side of the Prorous separatists, also the Czechs are fighting.
Our contraintelligence estimates their number to 30.
But there can be even more of them.
Have you ever met a Czech prisoner in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have released already captured Serbs, Dagestans, Chechen, one Sweden, Georgian... but not yet Czech Republic.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we hit your prisoner and we could free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured separatists
A.cz: What are you suggesting to the Czechs who join Prorous separatists and Ukrainian soldiers will take them?
They should understand that if they are fighting in the Ukrainian volunteers and separatists, they will be shot after an interrogation without mercy, as well as any other stranger.
Separatists consider these men rental, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But for example, if Ukrainian soldiers are captured by a group of separatists - and, therefore, including the Czech Republic - they will seat him behind the nets and treat him as a war prisoner.
The guy's just gonna survive.
The Ukrainian Party also acts in war as a state.
A.cz: How long have you been able to save Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand that well, in exchange.
Some sources indicate that it has been over a hundred men long ago.
We've stopped counting how many people we've helped.
But we just freed them... We didn't save them from war if they decided to continue fighting.
Savers are doctors in the war, surgeons, but we definitely don't.
That's it.
And every day, there are more and more.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, another four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be a exchange.
Sometimes it's enough for the prisoners to be released, and it's just a human request.
A.cz: There is a hearing that in a few months you have won great authority and even confidence from Prorous separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you build respect for both warfare parties?
It's a hard question.
One of the officers in Kyev gave me a nickname "A mad general with steel balls."
It doesn't insult me.
And maybe that's the point of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian Officer's congregation, I have received some authority before.
I'm never smart, I'm never cheating, and I always keep my word.
Whatever happens, I act honestly and speak the truth.
Even when it's Ukrainian government, or that dodging or luhanian, very uncomfortable.
If they torture and kill people?
So I'm just telling them they're torturing and killing them.
And they're crimes.
I'm often risking my life, even in exchange of prisoners, I've been captured... this job can ever be the end of me... I don't have to come back.
A.cz: How many executions and torture of prisoners do you know?
... (long conspiracy)... to torture the prisoners in the interrogations, Ukrainians and separatists are dismissed.
Unfortunately.
What about the execution?
They're only on the dot side.
The fact that Ukrainian army also executes prisoners, I have no information.
No indication that the Ukrainian army is doing something like that.
We have an idea about the number of executions, but I can't specify the numbers and I don't want to.
A.cz: Describe me the characters and motives of prorous separatists.
There are officers among them, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
He's trying to seduce individuality and perhaps democracy in Doneck or Luhansk -- at least that's what they say.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarches anymore.
Separatists already have oligarches full of teeth and are their imminent opponents - to life and to death.
As we say, they ate them to the throat.
The same dreams and desires of people were shown in Midan, by the way.
And now I'm speculating: Russia supports separatists, and the West is the Ukrainian State.
I think one speculation is big and the other is small.
This is my sentence, but it's hiding an inconvenient contradiction in it.
A.cz: How does one of the strongest leaders of the Prorous separatists Igor Bezler appear to you?
Whenever I cross the line of war front, I am without a weapon and showing soldiers or armsmen shaved naked hands.
And I'm always both sides of these two hundred or three hundred meters on the mushroom or the optical focuser.
Those faces of people who point at me every time I see well... and they can push their weapons down any time.
Explosive colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
It is considered to be a Russian officer, but his family - mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a small governor in the big Russian empire.
In any case, they keep talking about it, and Ukraine considers some kind of misunderstanding.
This state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is an irregular enemy of all Ukrainian oligarches.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in the debate show of the Ukrainian TV you've named your Prime Minister Arsenia Yaceňuk a weak, helpless and tired "ledge", who would do the best if he quickly left.
For those three hundred feet of walk, I'll always get a fear at least five times.
So why should I hide myself with the opinion that Jaceňuk is a very weak prime minister and harms our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a share in the war in Ukraine?
Maybe you know that the Yaceňuk Ukrainians call the rabbit.
And the rabbit is not a animal in the eyes of the Ukrainians who would have fear or should have respect and authority for others.
His behavior directly copys the rabbit's behaviour.
He may be a good economy, but as a prime minister, he has no right to cry in the parliament, beg him, play with him his intrigues, threaten to put his function... he has to drive the country, manage it, and in war and protect it.
In the threat of the country, the prime minister has no right to family, friends, rest on crying emotions.
He is the first of Ukraine ministers.
And Yaceňuk?
She's acting like a puberty girl.
Yes, he's tired, but also weak, because he's never been strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just complaining all the time.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Galaxy Guards couldn't save markets
Patient 3 Sylvester Stallone returned from the 19 million budget in the US less than 30 million dollars and Sin City: a woman for which I would kill from the 70 million budget only 12 million.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz earned only $14.6 million during the first weekend and films for children such as how to train dragon 2 were disappointment for the movies.
According to the article of the film criticism Robbie Collin in Telegraph, children's films are responsible for their own quality.
Collin marked 2014 as "the worst" year of children's movies and how to train dragon 2 called just "functional" continuation.
When it comes to films placed on a little older target group, it seems that the problem must not be in the quality of self - films.
In July, he compared the Entertainment Weekly servers of CinemaScore and Metacritic and their average summer film premier estimated at least 2,000 movies in the period between the Day of War victims and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results that take into account the views of the viewers and film critics suggest that this year’s film fertility is similar to the last year's hits.
According to some comments, there may be a change in the access of the viewers and a higher popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix.
The director Jon Favreau, currently working on Disney's processing of the Jungle Book, Hollywood Reporter said: “I think time changes.”
We have to admit it and not try to pursue what's been before.
Unlike the current crisis of Hollywood’s cash tramps, Netflix has gained profits due to the internet services of $1.2 billion, which is almost twice the $837 million last year.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticised the study for too much relying on the rights to comics, and foretold Hollywood's "demotion".
In the light of the current failure, some commentators declare that there may be something at his catastrophic celebration.
In the summer of 2015, the potential large cash flowers, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimoni and the Yurian world, are more optimistic in the film industry.
Producer X-Men Simon Kinberg recently marked the decline in markets simply as “cyclic” for Hollywood Reporter said:“The next summer will be the biggest cash triggers in history and no one will worry about sale. ”
KLDR is threatening Soul again, launching another short-down missile
North Korea launched another missile of a short railway to the sea, said Soul.
The reported missile test was carried out shortly after the completion of the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, which Pchjongjang considers as preparation for invasion.
The Chagang Province is located in the northwest of KDLR at the borders with China.
The speaker of the South Korean Ministry of Defence according to the DPA Agency stated that the arrows were fired from the northwest of KLDR and flew to a distance of about 200 miles.
The North Korea has apparently first launched a rocket from the Chagang province, stated the South Korean media with the appeal to the military circles.
They say there is a sub-distribution framework for Scud-type missiles in the province.
It is another of the series of similar tests that the isolated North Korean regime has performed in the past weeks.
North Korea has performed an unusual quantity of missiles and artillery tests this year.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend, NATO's opponents in Newport were protested.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the Newport Centre to attend the NATO march.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff's city for a meeting that was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough watched the situation during the weekend and spoke to the protesters who landed from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers must have been transported from Blue Mountains
Two young tourists were picked up by a plane and transported to safety after they spent the night in Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
Sixteen - year - old girl and an 18 - year - old man went to Govets Leap in Blackheath after Sunday afternoon.
When they didn't get home, the concerns of their relatives called the police around 8:00.
The search team, including the local police and the rescue team, was sent, and a couple were found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11 a.m.
The girl wounded her knee and a man fell and hit his head.
The police stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stabilized state, they were transferred to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouch brought from Opava only a point, he had a win on your leg
The 23-year-old Forward could have decided, but in two largest chances, he failed.
After the goal, the arrow called close to three minutes before the end, but it ended up at the Opova braker Joseph Flower.
I had it on my leg, I had to give that chance.
I'm mad at myself," your chick was singing on his head.
"I guess I should have put it above, I'm a little out of it," he said.
Sigma's defensive was not allowed to do that, except for Mikul's 11-minute invasion, but covered by the golman Reichl.
Then the Hanacas started pushing, but they were not released in a block defending home, and the arrows from the distance caught by the flower.
Fifteen minutes we compared, then we took the initiative.
In the second half time, we were better, we had more of the game, and Opava threatened us only with standard situations.
But the exhibited chance of Youreček has not changed, so it ended 0:0," the coach of Hanak Leosza Calvodu was disappointed.
In addition to the two injured, Peter Vavrik and the three-gol shooter Peter Chevczyk, who were hosting from Sigma in Slezland.
It did not allow them to enter, unlike its previous policies.
The substitutes deserve the absolution.
Sigma acted more soccer, but until one standard we let her do nothing," Coach Peter Baranek, said.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and combat.
Remiza is probably deserved, the point is a good profit for us," he added.
Sigma has reached four points, which means the thirteenth place.
Nothing that could satisfy the boss of Josef Lebra club, who after defeat with Znochem, has contracted his million contribution to the treasure diameterally different performances in other matches.
"We realized the warning of Mr. Lébra, so there can be no talk about the boys not to fight," Calvoda noticed, and at the address of a sleeping shooter, Youreček added, "I believe that it will come and when he gives a goal, it starts to fall there.
But after the first hit, I am right away with him to save the goals for other fights," Calvoda laughed.
Al Pacino inspired the Venice twice.
The Film Festival is suffering a crisis otherwise
After a huge enthusiasm on the Birdman starting film, whose director Alejandro Gonzalez Inyarritu settled with serious candidates for the Golden Lions, the other days indicated that the interest in the 71st year of the festival in Bennetics was somewhat declined.
Whether either because the number of places in the largest hall increased to 1400, or because Birdman followed the criticism recognised, but less attractive images as a document on genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s, in view of silence and other social films from the American 99 homes to the Iranian Stories, there were simply empty seats in the movies.
Heroes of comic books
Even the red carpet before the Festival Palace did not lay the crowds like the past, and it was reportedly no problem to acquire a place in the hotel at the last moment.
The crisis is spoken more than anywhere else in Italy and it is not surprising that both important institutions, such as Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not manifested by a lack of personality, but only in relation to films.
While the younger fans wanted autographs of comics superheroes, Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who had successfully taken the dramatic roles in 99 homes, for all generations, no matter what happened, the main event was the visit of a legendary actress Ala Pacina.
He's also lighted in two movies.
In the history of the Provision of the out-of-contest, which was filmed by Oscar Barry Levison according to the romance of Philip Roth, the 40-year-old Pacino role is close to him: the actress at the top of the glory, who suffers from depression from the end of his career and his personal life.
But seeing him the other day as a weird iron owner from the village town in the Manglehorn movie that David Gordon Green made, it was a really unforgettable experience.
Volpi's cup for the best acting performance shouldn't miss it - but does the Pacin artist still need prices?
It may be the most satisfying audience to him, and the Italian especially, for even though he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the land from which his grandparents come from.
Bodys for Italy
Otherwise, the Italian movie is doing very well in Venice this year.
The black souls directed by Francesco Munzi became the first picture of Birdman rewarded with long applause.
The Calabrian multitude of the mafia is observed in it by the view of family relations between clans that fight for power and money, and the director was able to harmonize all predictions for a good movie: quality scenario, camera, music and actors.
He also took a chamber psychothriller Hungry Heart, who photographed Saverio Costanzo with either Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost destroys his own child.
On the contrary, the French competitive films did not await a warm acceptance of either the ransom for glory, nor the 3 hearts, both works of the traditional model of consumption films based on the popularity of actors.
But eventually, two really excellent movies, Birdman and Black souls, are not so small for the first half of the festival.
And even if the Festivals have a universe of depressive themes, a new picture of Peter Bogdanoviche named She's Funny That Way, a fun comedy listed in the Bennetics outside the competition and filmed in the style of American cheerleader in the '40s, it was able to raise the mood for more than one day.
Policemen caught four pervitine producers in Prague, medication from Poland
"Detectives detained three men at the age of 42, 42 and 37 and a fifteen-year-old woman who made and sold drugs from November to August this year at Prague 9," said Police speaker Jan Rössler.
First on Tuesday, August 12th, the invasion unit in the Cihlary Street captured a twenty-five-year-old organizer and a dealer in one person and a young woman who in the group was a buyer of drugs in Poland and a seller of doses.
The next day, the detectives detained on the basis of the previous consent of the State Representative of the next member of the group, the seventy-year-old man.
The last one of the four cops were caught in the middle morning hours of August 20th in the area of the smallhouse," the speaker described.
The woman received a third of drugs for the transport of medicines from Poland
The main organizer had a wide field of activities.
In the summer area workshop, in a garden house in Horemirik, in the apartment in Konivo Street and in other places in Prague 9, he produced pervitin, provided various helps and chemicals needed to produce it and provided for the transport of medicinal products with pseudoefedrin from Poland.
He also weighed the drug produced, divided into plastic bags, and then selling pervitin.
With the transport of drugs from Poland or the sale of drugs, he was helped by a fifty - twenty - year - old, unpunished woman.
For that, she received a remuneration from the organizer in the form of a third of the drugs produced," Rössler added.
Criminalists also carried out several home surveys on the judge's order, where they provided drugs, industrial chemicals, digital weights, pay bags, syringes, syringes and other syringes and items that, according to experts, can be considered complete equipment for the production of metamphetamine.
Dealer has been punished seven times since 1995.
"The police have then found out from available records that the chief organizer has been seven times sentenced for property criminal activity since 1995," the police speaker supplemented.
The latest detained in 2006 was convicted for a criminal offence of sexual abuse and the seventy-year-old carmacher who was persecuted on liberty has been sentenced nine times in court since 2009.
It was mostly for his own crime.
The investigator accused three men and women of committing criminal offences of unauthorized production and other imposedation with lucrative and psychotropic substances and poisons, threatening them to do decades of imprisonment.
In three persons, the detective eventually instructed the State's representative and instructed a proposal for a detention where the judge eventually placed them," the speaker said.
The fourth accused, the seventy-year-old recipient, ended on freedom.
His position and role in this case were not as important as others accused.
The cops are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers chess from wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things within its other products for very "interesting" prices.
As a good example, for example, in Italy, manually made chess with a playboard size of 42 x 42 cm.
If you like it, prepare more than 40,000 CZKs.
Precise price is 43 405 Kč.
The customer gets a set of wooden black and red lactated figures stored in a wooden box covered by carbon fibres.
Probably no one is surprised that the players are available with a rising horse figure instead of a classic rider.
If the chess does not seem to you as a sufficiently valuable gift, you also need Ferrari 500 F2 model manufactured (approximately manually) in measure 1:1.8.
The price of this toy is 318 305 Kč.
Disturbing high schools and high schools doesn't make sense.
Czech Republic has few generally educated people and statistics further show that high schools have good use.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There were great preparations in schools in the last 14 days.
Most of the things are routine, such as carrying flowers from the summer storage back to classes and fascinating crystals.
They're going to have a little bigger fromol at the mountain high school.
A few days before the season, they are searching for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature to the library.
There was no robbery or fraud, the four-year high school in Horysk opens and renews its activities after three years.
Not in public, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not caused by the founders being so unable.
They had to wait to see if the existence of the school would be confirmed by bringing to the school register of the managed MSMT.
"French socialists should shut up and make France cool," said French Alliance key
Vals calls on a strongly broken left to “spoke its support ” to the fightful socialist president whose new division of functions did not meet with the consent of most French.
The president deserves universal respect, deserves loyalty, deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay by him," he said and crushed the applause.
As a peaceful gesture, the Government's chairman insisted that his government will not question the controversial French thirty-fifty-hour working week, despite the passionate arguments by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Finance, who proposed that the rules should be released at the beginning of the week.
On Saturday, Holland asked socialists to remain “compliant” with the government.
Christiane Taubir, the Minister of Justice, but she made him a line through the budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebel socialist messengers, where the Socialist Party criticised for her “Francous lost faith in the future”.
Marine Le Penn, a leader of extremely conservative right, smiled with constant internal disputes between socialists when she said she did not assume that the new government of Valles would last for more than a few months.
The Emperor of Francois Holland is naked and Prince Manuel Vals also. They were forced to build a new government when the previous one did not last by the end of the summer.
"And the new one will not end the autumn or winter," Le Penn said to his favourites.
She reiterated the call of her party to dissolve Parliament and stated that she was convinced that the party could win early elections and is ready to drive the country.
The French ruling party suffered the defeat in March's communal elections and in May the extremely conservative right has successfully made elections to the European Parliament.
According to the public opinion of the Journal of the Dimanche week, 76% of the French believes that the Socialist Party is exposed to the risk that it will be divided into several competitive fractions before the end of the Dutch Functioning period in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, politicist of the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French will soon be patient, unless the new socialist government can improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It is a limited area for opportunity, but the public opinion must think that there are changes in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art are not limited to the elections
The amendments to the relevant statements should be prepared and approved until the new leadership of the capital.
On the streets of Prague, it will not disappear before the community's choices, and the city will not limit the street art.
It won't be limited to the dog's wedding.
The threshold will not reach the October elections to prepare and approve the amendment of the relevant statements.
"The decision on changes should also not be made by the current leadership of the city ending in a few weeks of mandates," Council Lucas Manhart (TOP 09) said.
In the past weeks, several cities, such as Pragues 5 and 7.
Herny's not going to disappear, the gambling statement is not going to change yet.
It's a task of new city leadership after elections.
Now we wouldn't even technically reach this, for example, with regard to the time limits for comments and similarly," Manhart explained.
He added that the latest negotiations of the current representativeship, which must be approved, will be implemented on 11 September.
The general gambling ban referendum is scheduled on the day of community elections of Prague 1 and Prague 8.
At present, the gambling ban is paid, for example, in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The statement will not change for the same reasons even in the case of street art, so-called busking.
In particular, Prague 1 complains that has already sent a proposal to the magistrate to places to which the current list of forbidden places would want to be extended.

Last week, he set the victory to the Scotti's independence on the reach of the hand
The Scotland Campaign for Independence was in danger of making this mistake for the first time when she almost placed the billboards around Scotland to ask whether Scotts want to be rich.
But you don't get to the hearts of the Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet, nor to get their respect when you start threatening them.
The morality of the New Law is still alive in Scotland, even though few Scots are still going to church today.
Scots have a much greater tendency to expel alternates from the temple than to let them dictate how to vote.
The chief of Scotch nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, and therefore in the television discussion he repeatedly asked his rival, unionist Darling, whether he is willing to respect "the sovereign will of the Scotland people" if the Scottish voted for independence, and began to support the single currency for Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to vote between the Scotland civil society and the London fundants, and he fell in this trap with a grimas.
Of course Darling won't support the mandate of the Scottish voters.
However, the debate on how Scotland will have a currency has already been more neutralized.
What really motivates the Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities and protection of public health that citizens have free.
Darling supported the London bankers in the currency case and also made the impression that he would not protest against privatisation of health.
As Salmond said, "he got into bed with conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for every Scotland policy.
Every Scottish voter knows that the Scottish businesses are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who in Scotland spoke not to voters, but to the boss association, to the British Industry Confederation.
It is clear that Cameron's refusal to debate about independence with the Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a coward absent home.
Scotts would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scotch Prime Minister.
Cameron could at least say that Scotland could be a successful independent country.
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it makes him almost physical pain.
What he tells is clear: Scots do not have to jump out and must accept what it is.
The longest year is 10 months.
Pesimistic beginning of school according to Miloše Urbana
Illustration to the story The longest year
Miloš Urban Latest Year
The end was the best of the holidays, the last week that hadn't worked anywhere, and we were just screwing up and swimming with grandmother's summer, silence in front of the storm, calm down before stress.
New clothes, when they could get from Tuzex, boots from Eastern Germany.
Reading Quick Arrows, already the fifth, whistling around the Empire by the back of Vary, somewhere to the tennis courses, no more hot, the sun was shaving back and shoulders, squeezing the rays of goodbye.
Evening a mild nerve, still holiday regime, sleeping until half a week, it'll be worse, a few minutes before sleeping, two hours, then wake up at half seven in the morning.
It'll be Monday.
Most of them don't rain, on the contrary, the summer is crushing in front of school.
Approach in a ghost light on the wrist and feel like a plastic plot in a glass height, there's the school, the U.S.A.
A witch with a creepy pink squirrel, and before her old facial faces and a few new boys, more exhausted, girls more boobed.
That's where the bastards are, they're avoiding, as interesting as they keep together and how soon they're here.
And these grown girls who came to scream, now they're hysterically laughing, probably something changed in their life over the holidays, while everything's old in my place.
And the new firsts, some nervous and other pleasures, why are they even climbing here?
Because it has to, the educational war is obliged.
So inside, the cold moisture of the floor and the light smell of disinfection, the poisoned schooler with the mope, unfortunately the same as he said to borrow the student the keys from the blanket box, where they can leave the books and which are still so little.
For a bottle.
The smell of dress remains in memory, now it's not, it's pretty winded, but in a week it's gonna be worse.
It's just the idea that a stomach is screwing and the head's getting hurt.
The head that makes it worse for the teaching from mathematics, the devil's games for the chosen, which I don't belong and I will never be.
Again those threes and fours, not just five, hide from testing, fall into the lava, and best to be there, not to be there, exist only as a name in the classroom and dream about sweeter girls and beautiful buildings, about the antennas into the universe, where no one is competitive to anyone, humiliate and no one's legs.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, now like years ago.
She let her daughters die.
She is threatened by a special punishment - News.cz
The first birth occurred in March 2012 in the public toilet cabinet at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without a foreign help, her girl was born, who, after cutting the puppy, packed into a prepared blanket, hid under her bunch, and took her to a road drawer, where she was put into the bushs of tens of meters away from the road.
She was born on her way to school
It came to me a little earlier.
I was on my way to school.
I had to go to the bathroom in the bus, and I gave birth.
She was born alive, she was looking at me.
I cut the puppy rope with the knives I was wearing in school," she described the defendant and said she was ashamed for pregnancy.
"The next day she returned to the place, she put the baby's body in her bag and took her body out of the bag, packed into the black igelite bag, and hid and left her grandmother under the stairs in the house of Havic's Brod," she said in the lawsuit that it was not quite obvious when the newborn died.
It could have been tens of minutes, but even a few hours after birth, suffocating in covering the blanket or putting under the jacket, colding or bleeding out of an untied puppy.
The similar scenario was repeated next year in spring.
A woman nearly uncertain from February to April 12th, when a child’s dead body was found by random witnesses under the mushroom at the pond in Haličkobrodska, she was again secretly born.
This time in the undercover apartment in the family house.
Without verifying whether it was born alive, without cutting and bound by the puppy around the neck, she put the child in several plastic containers, including the igelite bag, and left it in the bathroom.
In the afternoon, he was taken to the pond with his partner.
Finally, a friend gave her up.
The father of both children was just a friend of the accused, but he reportedly didn't know a partner about pregnancies.
Even for that reason he is not now in court, he was only punished for a sin against the funeral law.
It was also the one who turned to the police later.
I don't like him being punished as a colleague.
He manipulated the child against my wish.
I know my solution was not right, but it came to me as human at the moment," she did not hide the anger of the accused who reportedly subjected and feared him.
During her testimony, a young woman spoke relatively balancedly.
She had tears in her eyes until the moment she talked about her relationship with her parents, from whom she left after her age.
She didn't want to kill
"They go to visit me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she cried.
I didn't get my equipment because I didn't want kids, I felt young.
I wanted to put him in the babybox, but I don't know what happened, I didn't do it.
I can't explain that to you," she answered the question of the judge.
However, she refused to deal with the mind and intention of the newborn to kill.
In addition, the second child was born dead.
Even in pregnancy, she didn't stop drinking alcohol.
But I've limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I also limited smoking," she said.
Although her pregnancy was seen in both cases, she allegedly claimed that she had a health problem, she was induced.
And that's my friend.
The main treatment will continue in the castle court on Tuesday with the statements of the judicial experts.
Wednesday may have already been sentenced.
A woman is threatened by a criminal rate of up to 18 years of imprisonment, if possible, by a special penalty.

Prodemocratic activists in Hong Kong are provoked by Chinese authorities
There was a group of loyal to Beijing who was waving the Chinese flag nearby.
The Standing Commission of the National People's Congress on Sunday approved that only two of the three candidates attend elections in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive support from the appointment committee, which is likely to be composed of members of the faithful Peking.
This decision is almost impossible for opposition democrats to get to the election tickets and to force pro-democratic activists to renew the promise and to distort the Hong Kong financial centre of the "Central Occupation".
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main cause of tension, Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democracy will extend to other cities.
After Peking published in June a detailed report of the Chinese official authority in Hong Kong, democratic activists organized an informal referendum on elections in a special official circuit and hundreds of thousands of people went into the city's business quarter and borrowed it.
The press conference held by Prime Minister Li organizes the Government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Contact Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, the Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission of Zhang Ronghsun and the Deputy Director of the National Council of the Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei Bureau.
Student activists declared that the afternoon would be gathered before the Hong Kong government office.
Until the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain has never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kyev to start negotiations with Eastern Ukraine on "State Sovereignty"
According to the description of the events by Russian newspapers, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked on Sunday to stop the Ukrainian government from fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately launch the negotiations on "State sovereignty" of discarded areas.
His speaker Dmitri Peskov later explained that Putin had no intention to indicate that the areas of Eastern Ukraine under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reconsidered that the Russian speaking area would have the power to protect its rights and interests.
Putina's challenge to the Kiev government to treat the Russian rebels as equal to itself corresponds to the obvious strategy under which it is managed from the explosion of anxiety five months ago: Help separatists to hire the territories and make the Ukrainian government grant a real independence to the newly declared Novorusko so that the place with the West can be connected with Russia.
In an interview for the first channel of state television, Putin condemned Ukrainian military action to reappear the Eastern areas of Donecka and Luhanska, which were controlled by separatists in March and April after Moscow acquired the Crimean half-ostrows belonging to Ukraine on 18 March.
Kreml and separatists have recently called the “Novorusko” or “New Russia” as a term that refers to the famous prerevolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian press agency Itar-Tass published Putin's words, according to which the “ilusion prisoner” is all those who believe that there are peaceful negotiations on the horizon, because Ukrainian politicians started before the parliamentary elections on 26 October, while government units attack civilians in the areas of controlled separatists.
"In the interest of people living in these areas, we must immediately begin meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organisation of society and on the statute of state sovereignty in the south-east of Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's outbreak on state sovereignty was thought in the context of a broader autonomy, which has been dealt with with Kijevo's leadership for months and which is to mitigate the concerns of Russian speaking areas from the threats of cultural and language rights.
Peskov stated that only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern region.
It is not a matter of discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The progress of the speaker Kreml, which was to correct the “failing interpretation” of Putin’s notes, emphasized the approach of the leadership of Russia to address the rebellion of separatists in the east, which is different from the open-up of the Crimea, where most of the two-million population is separated by the ethnic Russians.
Moscow should also acquire much more difficulties in the East of Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million people are not Russians and public opinion surveys that have been conducted before the conflict have shown wide support for the resilience in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have acted in international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own business agreements and international relations, and in principle to give Kremlu real control over the territory that would link the Russian land with Crime.
The Black Sea Half-Sea, acquired five months ago, is the seat of the main Russian maritime fleet, the marine commercial territory and the historic coastal resorts.
Areas between Russian Rostov and Crime are also a centre down, factories and slippers that produce important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Porošenko, during his inauguration speech of June 7th, proposed that Ukrainian legislators - after new elections - consider changes in the constitution that would give more control to the different regions of their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy is much different from the vision of Kremlu and Separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's last challenge to treat Kyev separatists as equal to herself after the next rebel procedure last week after the Russian units and tanks of the former calm region along the Azov Sea broke into Eastern Ukraine.
Separatists strengthened by the Russians have taken control of Novoazov so much that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that it is aimed at acquiring strategic coastal territories until Krim.
This has achieved a huge civil and military effort to reinforce Mariupol, a port with metalurgical compartments of 500,000 inhabitants lying between Novoazovska and the narrow gate on the Crimian peninsula.
On Saturday, the Rapporteur spoke to the European Union's leading representatives in Brussels and encouraged action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which is independent for the last 23 years.
"We are close to the point from which there is no return," warned Porešenko.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks in Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - the leaders call for further sanctions against Russia in the event of a closer unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andri Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday, told the reporters in Kiev that Ukrainian soldiers had to retire from their positions in Ilovia after the last week two colonies of Russian defensive vehicles and 1,000 military units broke into the Donya area to support surrounded separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovay during Russian invasion were replaced on Sunday with 10 Russian landlords captured a week ago in Ukraine, stated Lysenko on Sunday.
The scandal with discovered photos also includes Australian celebrity and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgusting over hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancé Gabi Greek and other influenced Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after the biggest scandal with hacked photos of celebrity got on the Internet series of explicit photos naked by Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker claims that he has sixty photos with the naked star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars, including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, Rihanna's singer, Ariana Grande and Ley Michelle and Kirsten Dunst's actress.
The iCloud's escape was reportedly accompanied by personal photos of Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourn Greek actress.
There's 101 celebrity on the list.
Edelsten, who asked Greek for hand last month, the Confidential magazine said: "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and all private pictures should remain private.
It's a shame that personal information can be stolen and extended to the public.
Greece, who is now in New York, reported online news reporters, has informed that hacking is "unshy" and those who have become his targets are "consuming humiliation".
It's supposed to be that the hacker got 30 photos of Palmer with a former friend Scott Speedman, including two pictures on which he's upstairs without breaking up at the pool.
Palmer, for example, worked in the Love and Honour film, where she was Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of Chuck Strahovski's television series and the actress from the Sucker Punch Browning thriller yesterday did not comment on the stolen images.
Deputy Lawrence TMZ said: "It's a clear violation of privacy."
Herec Seth Rogen hackera criticised on his Twitter: “Opening photos from hacked phones is exactly the same thing as selling stolen goods. ”
In legal terms, the release of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Footballists Sigmy have met Lebra, even without victory
Olomouc - Groms and muds, which a companion of the sigma sigma Joseph Lebr sent to his subject last week, are, seem, past.
Being from Opava finally brought just a point for the wireless remise.
By putting and fighting, the club boss just made a little good.
Money for payments could come to the club soon.
"I keep another game as I talked about it last week, but I am far more optimistic," Lebr confirmed that despite Sigma's failure, it was convinced by the players with improved performance.
The battle and laying with which we played mainly in the second half time was exactly what I want to see from the players.
In that case, I am able to forgive that he won't win.
If we played this from the beginning of the season, I'm sure we haven't lost yet," Lebr thinks.
Sigma in Opava stopped initiating domestic pressure, then balanced the game, and in the second half it was better.
After Calvood's victory, the trustees touched, but they didn't get their options to the goal, so they couldn't win.
Although the result is not according to our ideas.
But we missed the full satisfaction but only one changed chance," said Lebr, who doesn't think that a change in footballist access caused only his threat.
There must have been more aspects.
Anyway, from my side, from the coach, or the fans," Lebr said.
Pressure must be counted on Sigma
The players after the game in Opa's event last week didn't want to comment.
I'm trying to get these things out of here.
I tried not to accept it," a young braker Michael Reichl was shooting his head.
Without comment, he left a question on Lebrova's statement last week from the attacker Václav Vasiček, who did not change Sigma's greatest opportunity in the Saturday match.
But it's just a little bit about the pressure.
We'll be under pressure all the time.
Everybody wants to get out of here.
Today we showed that if we fight and ride all the ass, we can do it," he said.
They took warning to their heart
Even the coach Leoš Kalvoda did not pretend that preparation for the fight was not the easiest thing in view of the atmosphere in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was seen that Mr. Lebra's warning was taken to heart.
Even though it wasn't about them not to fight and disturb it," the coach of fraud thought.
It was like the first 15 minutes today.
It took us to compare with the hardship and to realize what the other league was about.
That it's not just about football, it's mainly about the fighting," Calvoda said.
There's nothing left to hope that Sigma's next matches will work from the beginning.
"I'd love to believe it," he added.
