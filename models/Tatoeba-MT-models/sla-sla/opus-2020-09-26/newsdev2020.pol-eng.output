I protest Bosnians against Croatia's plans for the storage of radiation waste
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in north-west Bosnia in protest against Croatia's neighbouring plans to store parts of waste from the only nuclear electricity region near the border with Bosnia and the main river known as natural beauty.
Demonstrators in the Bosnian city of Novi Grad requested Croatia to reject the waste storage plans in former military carriages in the town of Shopping Gora and declared the fight against the project.
The object would be stored by waste from the nuclear power plant Krsko.
Bosnians, holding baners with the labels "I want a healthy future" and "Stop - ( river) Una needs us," said that the storage of radiation waste can threaten the rivers of the Union and the lives of about 250 000 inhabitants.
We have to say no,
He told the crowd Miroslav Drljaca, the mayor of the city of the New Grad.
We have to fight to protect our way of life and our union.
Located in Slovenia, the Crush power plant built in the 1980s of the 20th century also belongs to Croatia.
The representatives of both countries are to meet next week with a view to discussing additional waste stocks.
Croatian public TV HRT stated on Friday that Croatia has not yet been decided whether the waste storage waste waste store itself, whether to pay for the storage of parts of waste in a new facility designed by Slovenia.
Croatian Minister for Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric told journalists that Croatia has also a problem with the elimination of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes for a full solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents, on every side of the ethnic division country, insisted that Croatia finds a different location in the part of the country nearby to the power plant.
"Why is Croatia all over its area saying that this is the Shopping Mountain in Bosnia?" he asked.
We can't let them humiliate!

American Congress agreed to sale Poland 32 F-35 planes
The U.S. Congress has not objected to this transaction 15 days since the Ministry of the State's possible purchase by Poland, 32 multi-purpose hunters F-35, which means that the last condition has been fulfilled before the negotiation of the purchase was launched.
The decision of the Congress, although not unexpected, has a major political importance.
"After selling by the Department of State, and now through the Congress, I do not see any more serious obstacles," said John V. Venable, senior adviser for the defence policy of Washington, conservative thinking of the Heritage Foundation tank.
The expert explained that the Federal Government, represented by the Department of State, must notify the Congress on 15 days before the signing of the contract, if the value of such transaction, in the case of sale of weapons to the NATO country, is exceeding 50 million dollars.
The value of the proposed shopping transaction of 32 hunters F-35 by Poland is estimated at 6.5 billion dollars. This amount includes costs of technical and logistical assistance, support equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of F-35 planes – if this transaction is finally finalized - will be the US Armed Concern Lockheed Martin, and its subcontractor is the manufacturer of engines for hunters F-35A conrn Pratt and Whitney.
The proposals for the purchase of the fifth generation of F-35 American hunters on behalf of the Poland authorities submitted on May the Defense Minister Mérier Blastak.
The Polish offer was discussed in June this year during the meeting of President Andrej Dudy with President Donald Trump in the White House.
The implementation of this agreement, if it is finalized, will be preserved by representatives of Pentagon under the Foreign Military Sales Programme (FMS).
In the framework of the FMS Poland has already acquired a Patriot anti-racket system.
The price of one F-35 hunter at the time of the purchase offer by Poland was, without arms and technical assistance, approximately 89.2 million dollars.
As the PAP reported by the US military experts who wanted to maintain anonymity, the price given in the preliminary negotiations was “a maximum price, much higher than the price that would be negotiated”.
"The prices are rapidly declined, now the price of one F-35 is less than 80 million dollars, much less than the Eurofighter cost, which does not have the advantage of F-35," said Venable.
The PAP speakers hoped that the final negotiations of the transactions for purchase by Poland of American warplanes will end this year.
The eventual participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction, which is offset, will be discussed directly with American hunters producers F-35.

It is also called invented and caused by a disease, and it is treated as violence against a child.
This is a rare disease that usually includes a parent of excessive symptoms or a symptom that causes symptoms, so that it would seem that his child is sick.
What are the substitute symptoms of the Münchhausen team?
The symptoms of this disease may differ, but NHS notes the following examples of conduct:
Convince medical personnel that a child who looks healthy, however, feels bad.
Extension or invention of symptoms.
Fake results to be considered sick, e.g. administration of glucose to urine samples, so that the child may seem to have diabetes.
Experience of symptoms of disease, e. g. giving children the necessary medicines and other substances.
How often is the Münchhausen substitute team?
It is difficult to estimate how often this disorders occur because many cases of disease are not reported.
A study published in 2000 indicates that over two years 89 cases of this disorder occurred to 100,000 people.
What should be done if there are suspicions that the child may be in danger?
Contact the local special service office or call for an NSPCC child protection line by selecting number 0808 800 000.

Before taking children to school, their parents signed the form.
The parents daily delivered food to their children and knew in what conditions they were.
We were remarkably surprised by the arrival of police and evacuation of children, as well as the elimination of the full food of pupils delivered by our parents before the school was closed.
It's not right, because parents can testify whether their children are in bad conditions, as the police say.
He added that the former Commissioner of the Police Abdurrahman, who once visited the school to check the level of care for children, never had any objections.
He claimed that the children were studying Koran and nothing else.
However, the Public Relations Police Specialist, Yakubu Sabo, considered that after transfer to the government, children would join their parents.
“It was kept in dehumanizing conditions on behalf of the subjection or acquisition of indigenous knowledge.
Many of them had scars on their back, which proves they were beaten.
That is why we are also studying the school to meet her owner," he added.

"I believe that Donald Tusk and Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonia have a chance to win elections with President Andrey Duda," says Thomas Semoniak.
Vice-Chairperson of the Civil Platform Tomasz Semoniak in a conversation with Polsat News spoke of an affair with the head of NIK.

He can be a cultural minister for some entertainment, not a NIK boss, or a financial minister.
Not someone responsible for billions of taxes," he said.
"This case is a very serious state crisis," he added.
Semoniak also spoke of Klaudia Jachira's candidature.
"Antoni Macierewicz is in the PIS lists.
A man who didn't just say things, he was doing it.
He judged former SKW heads to spy for Russia, destroyed their lives, destroyed their families.
Why doesn't anyone call for Antoni Macierewich not to be in the letters?" he asked.
“People of us have different estetics.
I think Jahira, who has already apologised for one of these things, also feels that sometimes she's overwhelming.
Let's not make this a campaign problem," he added.

The conference organizers hoped to benefit from the expertise of the participants and identify possible future advisors of the Catholic Church in high technology matters.

Boris Johnson directed to the police supervisory body in connection with the close relationship with Jennifer Arcuri
Independent IOPC police proceedings authority shall examine the possibility of initiating a pre-implementation to the Prime Minister of Investigation whether, during the conduct of a public office as Mayor of London, the criminal offences have been abused.
The Council of Great London (GLA) stated in its statement that its supervisory inspector registered the “the matter related to the proceedings” of the Prime Minister in connection with the charges of preferential treatment of Arcuri to result in the connecting of their close knowledge.
“The matter relating to the proceedings” may be said when information appears indicating the possibility of committing a crime”, he said.
That doesn't mean that it was proven in some way.
IOPC will now consider whether the case is necessary.
The issue was addressed to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against members of the Police Services in England and Wales.
It was transferred to this police supervisor body, because Johnson was then a representative of the Commissioner of Police and Criminal Commissioner.
Johnson denyed it as if his close relationship with Arcuri had occurred to any irregularity.
Earlier he said he would apply to the city council and give details about his relationship with Arcuri, but he argued that the council was “agathering on the wrong problem”.
The order is the result of the report “The Sunday Times” that Arcuri, a American who moved to London seven years ago, received 126,000 pounds from the budget money, as well as a privileged access to three foreign trade missions that led to the mayor Johnson.
As a result of this report, the government has freezed the grant of 100,000 pounds for the Hacker House Arcuri.
The Government is awaiting troubled questions about the verification procedure carried out before granting funds.
The Minister for Digitalization Matt Warman said in the Gmin Chamber that his department employees “usually kept good care ” and that the company has a British phone number.
However, according to many reports, the number connections were converted to the office in California, where 34-year-old Arcuri is currently to live.
The close relationship of the Prime Minister with the Businesswoman was “the secret of polyshinel for the staff. ”
The GLA decision to direct the Prime Minister's case to an independent IOPC police office met with dissatisfaction at 10 Downing Street.
According to the source of the higher rank, the government representative is “a attack motivated politically” and its term, in the preceding conference of the Conservation Party, is“javely political”.
"The supervisor has not presented any evidence that confirms the charge, and the Prime Minister has not received a chance to answer it before the publication of the press message later on Friday night," the source states.
Neither citizens nor the media will be able to tackle such a publicly political rule.
Today, in the previous hours, the Standard journalists said that the close relationship of Johnson with a businesswoman from California, which was helped by the Tourism and Promotion Agency in London, was for workers “the secret of polishinela”.
The workers of the London & Partners (L&P) were above set up, reminding that Arcuri received places during Johnson's foreign trade trips as a mayor, despite the fact that her companies were not considered “reliable”.
Third accused of drug crime in connection with Mac Miller's death
The LOS ANGELES (AP) – In connection with the last year's death of a raper Mac Miller was arrested by a third man and charged with drug offences.
According to judicial documents, Stephen Walter suspects the sale of counterfeiting oxycodon pills made by fentanyl, which Miller had in his possession before his death in September last year, due to a random overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, or a strong opioid responsible for “epidemia”, which absorbed several thousand human beings in the United States.
Walter is accused of delivering pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold Miller.
Trial documents sealed on Tuesday reveal that Pettit received drugs from Walter over August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havas City, Arizona, is suspected of performing the role of Walter’s courier, who provided Pills to Pettit.
None of these men were directly accused of the death of Miller and none of them presented the defense line in their case.
Walter's conditional release on drugs from 2005 is in custody, and he has already been sentenced for a five-month liberty for violation of the conditions of exemption.
The prosecutors dealing with the case, which was first reported on Thursday on the website dedicated to the celebrities of TMZ, demand that Walter remain in custody in the expectation of the process, claiming that there is a serious risk of escape of the accused.
The answer to the message left on the automatic secretary of his lawyer did not come immediately.
Pettit was charged in the federal court on 4 September, and his defendant refused to comment.
The words of Miller's Roman songs are a sincere conversation about his depression and drug use, making him fans of the biggest hip-hop stars.
From Pittsburgh Miller, who was really named Malcolm James Myers McCormick, remained two years in connection with Ariana Grande's songmaker, ended earlier in 2018.
After his death in the Instagram portal, she published an exciting film with Miller's part and the "Thank U Next", in which she mentioned it with love.
Miller is one of the musicians whose death was connected in recent years with the abuse of opioids.
Matthew Roberts, a guitarist team 3 Doors Down, also died as a result of overdose in 2016, and his body found the presence of fentanyl and hydrocodon.
This article introduced a change: Walter’s correct name is Stephen, not Steven.
9-year-old Nigerian creates more than 30 games for mobile devices
A 9-year-old creates a game of fun hidden with a free application to program Scratch 2.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories online or offline.
As far as Basil's help, he generated more than 30 games for mobile devices.
Today's game has a nucleus that's hiding according to the program.
The player wins a point every time he catches a tower who gets out of the hide.
I've learned how to create games on a speedy course.
"I now create them when I'm bored," Basil CNN said.
In March, my dad recorded it on an accelerated course for children aged 5 to 15 years.
The Codefest International course aimed at providing children such as Basil access to new technologies, such as robotics and virtual reality.
The boy's father, Basil Okpara senior, claims that Basil played a lot of games on mobile devices.
"When he was 4 years old, I bought him a tablet because he always grabbed his phone and played it.
He played a lot in Candy Crush and Temple Run," said Father CNN.
But Basil's interest in creating games increased when he was seven years old and received a storm for all his time to play.
"One day he played on the tablet as usual, and he was so absorbed that I was upset," said his father.
From anger, I said, “you still play, can you not think of creating your own games so that others can play it?"
Speaking these words, I was upset and I didn't think he would take them seriously," he added.
From then on, Basil was actively interested in learning to create his own games, incentives his parents to buy the laptop and write it to the course where he learned the basis for the creation of games.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives his thread titles based on their contents.
One of his games, "Mosquito mash", is available in Google play store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population includes innovation leadership on the continent.
Two Nigerian 12-year-olds have recently been famous for using codes to create robots split their work at home.
In May, Acrobot's female school team in Ghana won the Robofest 2019 competition for programming robots for handling boxes.
And thanks to the growing investments of giants in technology, such as Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basil and his peers, are on their way to the coding star career.
Former President of the Republican Party in Northern Carolina will admit to a lie about corruption
The court documents submitted on Friday indicate that the former President of the Republican Party in the Northern Carolina confessed in the court that he lied to federal agents investigating the corruption of the main political donors.
According to Robin Hayes' vacancy, she's going to admit her guilt next Wednesday.
The document containing a real basis prepared under the defence agreement and signed by Hayes' lawyer indicates that Hayes knew that he was making a false statement to the FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The defense agreement was sealed, and on the basis of the fact, it is not the basis for which Hayes' charges are confessed.
He was first accused of conspiracy, corruption and false testimony.
The prosecutors accused the former congressman Hayes of the insurance company's institution plan to manage taxes to the main insurance market regulator country in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two colleagues were accused of attempting to buy a state commissioner for Mike's insurance.
Lindberg is the founder of the insurance and investment company, as one of the major political donors in recent years, which has transferred over 5 million dollars to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He supported primarily the objectives and policies of the Republican Party, but also gave taxes to the Democrats.
His lawyer did not answer the Friday e-mail with a request for comment.
The defender of Hayes Kearns Davis did not answer the Friday e-mail with a request for comment.
The court documents submitted on Friday indicate that Hayes lied to the FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he didn't talk to Érzey about the state insurance department.
In accordance with the document containing the actual basis, Hayes actually spoke to the Commissioner for Insurance on Lindberg's request to make changes in the personnel employed by the market regulator.
The prosecutors claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg organize a meeting with Ussy and that he was talking about bribes directly with the regulator.
According to the April Prosecution Act, Lindberg required special treatment of his insurance activities and planned to transfer up to $2 million to the re-Aussyya campaign in 2020.
The accusation file indicates that the contract also includes a request for a change in the department official who controlled Lindberg's company.
As the Republican Causey announced an apparent attempt to corrupt the federal agents and helped them collect evidence on the case.
He wasn't charged with any charges.
According to the law of charge, Lindberg's colleague ordered Hayes to transfer $250,000 to the Causeya campaign during a conversation in which Lindberg and Causey were also present.
During the interview, Hayes first protested, claiming that the transfer of that amount of money would have drawn attention, but, as a result of the accusation, he eventually resigned.
"Whatever you all want to do, we will do," Hayes said, according to the accusation act.
"Okay, I'll take care of it."
The prosecutor of the federal prosecutor did not respond to the e-mail requesting further information on the agreement.

Facebook with anxiety to users will hide on the test number of favorites
Within the first time in the world of experiments, which aims to improve users' self-conscious feelings, some people using Facebook soon under the posts of others will not see a number of favorites, reactions and video displays.
Favorites will be hidden and visible only for the author of the post, and this change will be introduced in Australia following a similar test carried out on Instagram in July.
The new Facebook version initiated in the next Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, director for Facebook Privacy in Australia, said that the change was the result of an examination of self-sensitivity and the opinion of professionals in the field of mental health that indicated that a number of favorites can be inclined to compare themselves with others.
“It was really positive by many groups that cooperated with us to combat harassment, as well as mental health organisations”, said Garlick.
Eliminating this counter will make people focus on the quality of their interactions and quality of content, not on the number of favorites or reactions.
It is expected that sharing with others through the platform will be more pleasant and will not be taken as competitiveness – she claimed.
Garlick assured that companies based on Facebook will still receive the same indicators and observations to which they had access so far.
She said it was too early to be able to determine whether the test would be extended to other countries, as it was going to happen with Instagram, when the test was covered by Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
Like in the case of Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication when the experiment ends and whether the change will be introduced permanently.
"The initial comments of the users on the new rules applicable in Instagram were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to opinions," she said.
Speaking about the world's place of experiment, Garlick said that Australia has very active, technically familiar Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that this is an incredible country that will provide us with measuring opinions that indicate whether the new experience is valuable for those who use our services or not.

Brother sentenced to life penalty for murder of honourable stars of social media Qandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star because of the photos published in social services, was strangled in July 2016.
The brother of the Pakistan social media star Qandeel Baloch was recognized as guilty of her murder on Friday and sentenced to a lifetime prison for the wiseest in this patriarchal country “honor murder”.
Baloch, who won the celebration by publishing brave selfie – polite according to Western standards, but in mizoginous Pakistan considered provocative in July 2016, was strangled.
Her brother, Muhammad Vaseem, was arrested.
A few days later, he said during the press conference that there was no embarrassment for his actions and said that he “of course” killed his sister and that her conduct was“ unacceptable. ”
His lawyer Sardar Mehmood told AFP that the west city court considered his client guilty and sentenced him to life in a long-expected sentence.
"Inshallah (if God permits), will be liberated by the Supreme Court of Instance," he said.
Earlier, Baloch's mother, Anwar Mai, announced the AFP that she hoped her son would be liberated.
"He's innocent.
It was my daughter, and this is my son," she said.
Baloch's murder came to the heads of world information services and resumed calls for action against the epidemic of honourable murders in which victims — usually women — are killed for breaking patriarchal social principles.
Women were burned, suffocated, they were fired or fought for such offences as choosing their own husband or, as in the case of Baloch, for bringing their family “has shame” by manifesting their own sexuality.
Murders are usually done by a close relative.
In accordance with the Pakistan law, Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (replies) may request the nearest victims for forgiveness.
Three months after Baloch's murder, Parliament adopted a new legislation to impose an immediate imprisonment for honourable murders.
However, whether the murder will be considered a honourable crime remains in the Judge's gesture, which means that the killers can teoretically call for another motive and be liberated.
In the case of Baloch, her parents initially pressed their sons not to show mercy in any case.
However, those who are distressed think that he could also be lost, changed their minds, and said that they wanted to be deprived of him.
The international anger caused by the murder has caused the Pakistani state to take an unprecedented step and to declare themselves a successor with their parents, forced the same way to move the case forward.
One of the more famous achievements of Baloch is the offering to make a strip in front of the Pakistan cricket team and the establishment of a deculted purple dress in Valentine.
She was criticised and threatened, but many people, including young people, saw it as a breaking restrictions in the country where the position of Kim Kardashian could be considered bold and political movement to strengthen the position of women.
The “honorable ” roots of murder are in tribal social standards that continue to dominate in South Asia, and in particular normal women’s behaviour, although men can also be victims.

Anarchy doubles the number of resettled from north-west Nigeria to 40000: UNHCR
On Friday, the United Nations organization stated that increasing violence has caused a double number of people resettled from north-west Nigeria to about 40,000 people in the last four months.
The UN Refugees Agency found that the concerns have created a “new unique humanitarian situation” that requires an interagency effort in the meeting by the end of the year for new funds of $35.5 million.
Babar Baloch, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamic Grouping of Boko Haram, which has been leading the rebellion in the northern country, has not been responsible for the last attacks since the decade.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsina observed in the past 10 months is rather a result of the activities of organized armed groups.
"It is a scary image of anarchy and uncertainty," he said to the journalists on Friday.
He informed the frequent reports of abductions, torture, forces, murders and sexual assaults from attackers who also ruin houses and steal goods.
The troops and the police were sent to combat criminal gangs in the region.
However, the army is distracted from the fight against Boko Haram and the branch of the Islamic State in Western Africa, which was separated from its long-term grouping in 2016.
"The refugees do not come with groups' names," he said.
They're coming for it with monstrous stories.
Most of the refugees are going to the Neighbouring Niger.
In his statement, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said that it is expected that more people will run to Niger in the coming months with a worse security situation, especially in the state of Sokoto.
A new date of the trial of a man accused of murder of a woman and two children
A new date of trial was planned for a man from Guatemala accused of killing the Ayov apartment and her two children.
The Act of the Regional Court in the County of Polk shows that 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellan is accused of three murders of the first degree under, as the authorities claim, the false name that he originally gave to the police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't confess to his fault.
According to the police, he killed 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and her 5-year-old son on July 16th at their home in Des Moines.
The judicial act shows that the new date of the hearing, i.e. 27 January, will give the representatives of both parties more time to prepare.
Immigration and Customs Officers of the United States claim that Escobar-Orellana is staying illegally in the United States and was deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was convicted for an illegal entry into the United States.
“The Sun: Boris Johnson in the face of the rebellion of the office to reduce the requirements of brexite and achieve a compromise agreement with Brussels
Only three weeks before the final summit of EU leaders among the most important people in the country's surroundings of the Prime Minister, the concerns are growing that he does not have enough time to acquire more important derogations.
Boris Johnson is at risk of rebellion by the office to reduce demands for brexite and achieve a compromise agreement with the EU.
There was an impass in the negotiations on a new customs system that would be a replacement for the backstop mechanism for Ireland, as Brussels has identified the proposals for other provisions proposed by Johnson as “incomplete”.
The Crown Ministers expect EU decision-makers who are headed by Germany Angela Merkel to offer the criticised toris leader compromise as a three-year time limit for the implementation of the backstop mechanism.
The Sun journalists talked to three different ministers of the office, all of whom are preparing to meet the Prime Minister after the annual toris conference next week in Manchester.
They will require the prime minister of the condemnation of a “aggressive” strategy developed by his close consultant Dominic Cummings to try to use the bloph against the EU and to threaten the EU to leave without a contract, and then accept the offer submitted by the Union at the last moment.
One of the ministers of the Bureau referred to the drowning judgment of the Supreme Court on Tuesday to terminate parliament's suspension as “the warning signal” and added:“The only way to leave the European Union is to do this on the basis of the agreement.
We'll never beat the aritmetics in the Gmin Chamber, which works for our disadvantage.
The prime minister must now be screwed up and accept what he can get.
Aggression does not pay: it is obvious that the Cummings plan burned on the pancake.
We can't fight on so many fronts.
The second minister of the Bureau has pledged to give Johnson to try to push the agreement of the former Prime Minister Theresy May, unless everything else is said.
The minister said: “If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister to introduce the agreement proposed by Teresa May in the Gmine Chamber again.”
There are numerous chances for her vote, and everyone is very concerned about the end of this subject.
If we're forced to extend the term, it's the end of Boris Johnson and the end of all of us.
John Major rejected Boris Johnson that he didn't take the negotiations seriously.
In a delicate speech, the first minister from the Toriss said: “The Prime Minister tells us that he wants contracts with the European Union.
However, we do not see him sitting in Brussels working on it.
Instead, he's raped with bulls in Scotland, checked eggs in Walia and argued with citizens in the main streets of towns -- everything in the eyes of the world, as if the election campaign has lasted for good."
The Prime Minister admitted yesterday that the treaty was still far away, and added: “No one should have any deceits: to ensure agreement a very long road.”
However, the prosecutor also said that the Benn law which introduces a three-month delay of brexite in the absence of the agreement “activatedly weakens our negotiating position” in Brussels.
He said: “The law has no doubt that it is difficult for us to negotiate, but despite it, the prime minister and his colleagues are still trying to make progress. ”
The Secretary for Brexite Stephen Barclay returns to Brussels today, where he will have more talks with Michel Barnier on the EU.
They will discuss the book on how the zone functions for all Ireland for food and living.
The dog with no nose and legs is instagram.
Perfectly irrelevant
He was supposed to be asleep.
But it's been possible to prevent it.
The bitch was transferred from Romania to Britain by the Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
The picture of the dog was published on Facebook.
Kate Comfort has fallen in love with a animal since the first view.
“ At first, I had difficulty convincing my husband to adopt because we had three dogs, ” she said.
The woman decided to take care of a bitch until someone adopted her.
However, no one was still in touch.
“The fact that no one wanted her has made me want to take care of it.
She was sensitive and needed love," Kate told me.
Finally, the marriage decided to adopt Bonnie.
"Our Bonnie is perfectly irrelevant.
We love her as she is, and if anyone doesn't like how she looks, it's his problem, not ours," said the woman.
Bonnie has become a social media star with time.
Instagram observes more than 14,000 internauts.
Lorraine Kelly: It was said that with a speaking accent I would never do my career on TV
According to Lorraine Kelly, the TV chiefs said that because of the accent from Glasgow, "he will never make career" as a presenter.
Speaking of her 35-year-old career in Kelly's television industry, 59 years old, she admitted that before her first show on the screen, she felt “great nervous. ”
"I was only 25 years old and I was very nervous," she said.
When I worked at the BBC Scotland as a search and checking specialist, the boss said that by my accent from Glasgow, I would never make a success on TV.
I went to London to meet the whole TV team and watch the program's emission before I took the responsibilities in Glasgow's office.
I'll never forget the interview with the Beth Davis star that Anne Diamond and Mike Morris did that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew I wanted to stay here.
Before Kelly became a Scotch TV correspondent in 1984, she started her career as a local journalist in East Kibride, Scotland.
Then she started programs like "GMTV", "ITV Breakfast" and "Daybreak" to launch later with her morning program "Lorraine", which named her name.
The 35th anniversary of her career will celebrate a special program in which she will mention her best remembered moments and interviews.
The presenter said that the secret of her long-stage in the TV is “passion and enthusiasm” and“ curiosity”, adding: “You need to work hard.
Be fair and authentic.
Prepare for programmes and be both interested and interesting.
When he recalls media reports that affected her emotions, Kelly states that it was “very difficult ” for her to relate to the murder in Dunblane.
I had no idea that many families killed or wounded children were watching our Dunblane program live day after a terrible killing of sixteen children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose 5-year-old daughter was murdered, asked me for a private meeting, during which we talked in her house for hours.
The whole meeting took place quietly, and Pam Ross and I are friends since Joanna's funeral.
She added that “very difficult ” was an interview with Kate and Gerry McCannam shortly after their daughter Madeleine disappeared in 2007 and that“ it really admires their strength and courage. ”
They must deal with pain because they don’t know what happened to their beloved daughter, and also tolerate the most ugly Internet comments of the troll.
I'm with them all my heart.
The 35th anniversary of work, Lorraine Kelly, will start at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, 30 September at ITV station.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga was afraid of imprisonment
The Higher State Officer claimed that Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga rejected the offer of the president's office submitted by the dead President Robert Mugabe in the top of the conversion point, as he feared the imprisonment in order to confirm the receipt of the military in November 2017.
As the Zimbabwe Independent reported last week, Mugabe offered Vice-President Chiwenze the presidency during its military negotiations.
However, the higher state official stated in the social media that Chiwenga did not reject the offer of fear, but since he reviewed the Mugabe plan, which implied the use of it in order to prove it to the world leaders and the African Union (UA), that he actually lost during the turning.
In the thread on Twitter, who confirmed that the 37-year-old Zimbabwe leader wished to give the authority to Chivenga vice-President, not to the President Emmerson Mnangagwe, Jamwanda 2, which the government officials confirmed that he was a higher rank in the Bureau of the President and the Council of Ministers, the intensive negotiations were being held at that time.
The state officials claimed that Mugabe contacted Chiwenga through one of his messengers, when he realized that his power was expelled from his hands.
The mediations between the military authorities and the deceased former president have, according to the higher rank of a state official, three stages.
The official claimed that among the negotiators was President George Charamb, a person who then served as head of the Central Intelligence Organization Aaron Nheper and a priest representing the Roman Catholic Bishop Fidelis Muconori.
The former head of the Bank of Reserve of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, was the next element since Mugabe sent him with a single mission to submit the offer to Chiwenze, who was head of the Defence Force of Zimbabwe (SOZ).
A man who was considered an African icon even more than life after his death was in vain attempted to get a condemnation of military action from UA, trying to encourage other African leaders to intervene.
The offer of the President, which was submitted by the dead (Mugabe) to the former Chivenge Defence Head (SSO) was no choice.
"It was a desperate act to save the situation that has taken a dangerous speed, removing part of the dead family," the official (Jamwanda) wrote.
But there was also a little political temptation that helped the dead to reverse the situation in a completely non-diplomatic way.
Just remember that the commanders said that they did not distort or discontinue the constitutional order, which would result in their conflict with the UA's position.
The dead (Mugaba) hoped that the SSO (Chivenga) would then swallow the bait, violently interrupting the claims of leaders that they did not distort the constitutional order.
The hope for the deceased (Mugabe) was that the UA, and on the margin, was still highly disordered by the whole situation and the way to fit it in its theoretical turn-off taxonomy, would have no choice but to describe it as a turn, thus calling for military intervention would be reliable.
In such a spirit and with such calculation, this offer was made.
The officials claimed that Mugabe made this move when he realized that the defence forces were no longer ready to protect him.
They said that Mugabe was forced to sign the resignation letter after warning the powerer that he risked a caddafi linch.
Army chiefs told him they wouldn't return guns against citizens if they were moving to his Blue Roof residence.
And at the same time, Mugabe had two desires, which were to save his family and prove that the army took power," the official added.
The modern SSO and the commanders have read the assumptions properly.
The messenger (Gono) who has sent this desperate message to understand, through a powerful metaphor, that it is the tiri vemaquapa-maquapa (we belong to the kamuflaž sect, i.e. army), we are not politicians or we are not competitive at a political level, stated a higher state official.
State officials say that the army has informed military commanders in the area through the Attaché, who were in Zimbabwe that they did not intend to compromise Mugabe, but to deal with the surrounding “criminalists”.
Mugabe tried to use the same strategy to try Mnangagva again to return from the short exile in the South Africa so that they could talk about the conversion and success.
In addition to the negotiations with the army, Mugabe was also looking for help in the region.
The residents of the South Africa, which are a key element of the process, not only because of its economic and regional power, but also because of the fact that President Jacob Zuma was President Sadc, refused intervention, but clearly indicated that if the army finds the house of Mugabe, as many times frightened in the background, the army of the South Africa will immediately appear in Harare.
"This didn't work because Putin and African leaders did not choose this route," said the Independent.
China needs strong leadership or falls apart as a policy document states
China needs a strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party, because otherwise the country will fall apart, the government concluded in the paper on the policy issued on Friday on the 70th anniversary of the creation of the People's Republic.
The Chinese government's press office reported in a white book that the success of the country since the receipt of power by the Communists 70 years ago has moved into the leadership of the party.
China has a large area, they have complex national conditions, but there are rarely administrative difficulties.
The document recalls that without a single and strong leading force of China, they will move towards divisions and declines, which will be catastrophic for the world.
The Chinese authorities have used a stronger hand policy in addressing problems for a long time, as in the case of prodemocratic protests in Beijing in 1989, justifying the need to maintain the stability of the country.
The strong-handed President Xi Jinping, who will be head of the Tuesday anniversary of the second world-wide economy, since the receipt of the office at the end of 2012 even more strengthened the governments of the party and applied sanctions against those who may question the authority.
Xi is also supervised by the military modernization programme that has erased the region from balance.
The document stated that China is not trying to export its development model or want to import any foreign models only to peace rather than to “hegemonia”.
The Chinese have no genes of conquering other nations or domination over the world.
In modern times, China has been oppressed by great powers, and wars and anxieties have struggled them deeply into the suffering that they have suffered; China will never cause any suffering that they have experienced.
China covers this anniversary in uncertain times for the country involved in a bitter trade war with the United States and which faces challenges due to the release of the economy, as well as anti-governmental protests in the underministered China of Hong Kong.
The document says that China will never "trade" its most important interests or allow anything to harm their sovereignty.
With regard to the trade dispute with Washington, the document stated that “the risk of trade wars and the further increase in customs tariffs do not lead to the solution of problems”.
China is a mature economy with a full industrial system, a complete chain of industry, a wide place in the market and a strong rate of economic development.
The document added that “the trade wars will never weaken it. ”
China is sure that they are able to face difficulties, the crisis to turn into new opportunities and open a new world.
It was also added that the United States should consider China's development rationally, as China is not going to question the position of the United States, nor want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and even less likely to stop China's development.
The limitation and weakening of other countries and the transfer of national disagreements abroad will not provide the United States with a strong position.
World of Jack Palkiewicz: Dubai, real face
Dubai's emirates are still looking for their own identity, broken between the beduin tradition, the religious islamic radicalism and the extremism of progressiveness.
This designing new trends of world tourism leaders raises imagination and desires, degrading the vulnerability of snobistic hotels and attracting searching for the fortune of investors and traders in tax paradise.
The websites infect the enthusiasm to this city of dreams, which is an exciting temple of luxury and concentrate of the 21st century architecture in one.
They became a paradise for those who love the rest, five-star hotels, beautiful weather, and pools placed hundreds of meters above the ground.
Many are admired by the universal embarrassment here, appreciation of creative hyperactivity and hysterical pursuit of adventure.
Here is the city that the motto says everything: “Short, shock, and charm. ”
And it's almost every step.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling them a city without nature.
According to British writer Lawrence Osborne, “the full of extremes and contradictions of the metropolitan has taken the dimension of grotesk. ”
She turned into a futurist nightmare, completely dominated by the Guinness Records Book, an unofficial Emirate Constitution.
Because everything here must be bigger and more beautiful than anywhere else in the world.
However, there is something that in ancient Europe may be a little transparent but important for life quality.
In Wroclavia, Berlin or Madrid, everyone feels like in his own house.
And not in Dubai.
By running away from the world of magic, I broke his golden mask, revealing the second face of the artificial paradise.
The counts that aren't spoken loudly and not written.
I'm showing the trouble of the Asians contrary to the ethnic ethnic conditions of the Dubaians, unwritten grandchildren of Beduin.
I am starting to the places of extreme poverty, for example to gett on the coast of the city, where, under cruel conditions, a army of Asian workers.
In one generation, they built Manhattan in slavery conditions.
They came here visited by good earnings and the possibility of ensuring a worthy life to their families, and they stopped the nightmare.
This tourist can never see, because it could blow up in the air created for years of Dubai.
The increasing criticism of the international community makes the issue of cheaper workforce becomes very troubled for the emission.
Mel C from the Spice Girls team has forbidden talks about diets in her house after its fighting with food disorders
Melanie Chisholm, from the Spice Girls team, admitted that there is a ban on the use of diets in her home after she was fighting nutrition disorders for years, eating only fruit and vegetables.
Sports Spice has not been eating and “training obsessively ” for years because of the pressure associated with being a celebrity member throughout the world of the pop group, which has later caused depression and nutrition disorders.
It now reveals that her experiences influence Scarlet’s childhood, and therefore “does not let her house talk about diets. ”
"Scarlet is now ten years old and I begin to see that she is more aware of her appearance," Mel said.
"I believe that one of the positives of the experience of food disorders is that I am very aware of how I speak with it.
The use of a positive language has now become my skill.
In an intelligence for the Women's Health Mel magazine, who was acquired in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls team, she said that, in the time before the social media were incorporated in the press, the “revolutionary” comments on it had caused complexes.
"I started looking at myself in an inappropriate way, quitting from certain food groups, practicing increasingly obsessively until I began to have disadvantaged," she says.
"I was sick, and it probably took a few years."
A picture that shakes the world
Polish girl and American documentary gave the world a testimony of the cruelty of war.
Legendary picture of Julien Bryan can be seen in the Museum of World War II in Gdańsk
"Listen to my history.
I'm speaking from the surrounded city of Warsaw.
I can and I have to speak on behalf of the Polish people about what happened here.
America must act, must help!", he started his radio documentary, photographer, Julien Bryan.
In the tragic, September days of 1939, he was in the capital of Poland, seeing the drama of the bombed city and its inhabitants.
His relationship was reflected by a wide echo in the West.
The President of Warsaw Stefan Starzinski first helped him, borrowed the car, but then asked him to leave immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a good-bye letter to his family in the U.S., deposed it in the safe of the embassy, and... he stayed.
For the next four weeks, he was trying to be everywhere where the warsawers were.
400 planes and artilleries almost attacked the city.
Bryan's painted death, suffering, struggle for survival in the cities.
Right before capitulation, he and his embassy workers took negatives out of the ocean.
He never stopped talking about Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: “What happened to Warsaw will meet Paris, London, and even New York. ”
His shaking chronicles saw President Eleonora Roosevelt.
Soon the United States began preparing for war.
“Dad showed the truth, and thus he fought German propaganda.
They were making glorifying their knighthood.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," said Sam Bryan, Julien's son.
Judgment against the jury against the former athlete to the accused of numerous rapes
In front of the jury, there is a trial on rape against the former baseball team of the University of Delaware, who is being attacked by a number of sexual attacks.
On Friday after 10 days of the deposition and hearing of arguments, the jurymen joined the determination of the fate of 23-year-old Clay Conaway.

The woman is one of the six defenders of Conaway for sexual assault in 2013-2018.
The prosecutor believes that the hug that the woman agreed was raped, what happened to her objection.
The defenders refer to the opposite relationships of a woman and a hole in memory and claim that the woman was likely regretted that there was an intimate approach.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bike for a million gold
A gold bike worth a million gold could be seen on the jubileus, 10th edition at the International Bike-EXPO Bike Bielce.
It's an extraordinary vehicle printed on a 3D printer.
His constructor, 30-year-old Adam Zdanovic, just received a bicycle Oscar for him at the World Custom Bike Show in Las Vegas.
The unusual copy made a furniture on the market. - The bike covered is a golden crush chrome, underneath it is the highest silver test.
It's a non-type shell made by my colleague with Hor.
"There's a seat, there's peppers, there's a driver, you can drive it normally.
It can develop a speed of 50 kilometers per hour.
It's a electric bike," the constructor says.
“Caroseria of the bike was printed on a 3D printer.
It's a cubic type of faith.
I came up with the idea of this model riding my first bike home, a few years ago.
I painted it on my card and hid it deep into the drawer.
Squitz's been waiting five years to realize.
The bike itself formed three years," Adam Zdanovic added.
"It was cruelly difficult to hide all the elements under the caroseria.
There are batteries, pipes, elements that make construction.
It's hidden under the caroseria scrolled in 11 elements on the steel bike frame.
There's also a engine hidden there.
The driver for this bike was set up a week before I flew to the United States to the World Bike Exhibition.
I couldn't decide what the driver was supposed to be.
She's composed of transport.
The bike weighs 90 pounds," summarizes.
A gold bike was appreciated in Las Vegas's most important competitive category “The best incredible single customary copy”.
Film material shows strong pollution of popular tourist places
Sydney Bay surrounded by the opera building, Circular Quay, Luna Park, and of course the famous Harbour Bridge Bridge bridge is a significant contribution to $21.9 billion annually imposed in the Australian economy by tourists visiting Sydney.
But there's ugly truth under the bridge.
The known Sydney bay is one of the most contaminated waterways in the country that affects the volume of pollution every year is equal to the capacity of about 15 Olympic pools.
These scary statistics make one of our biggest tourist artists at the same time is one of our dirtyest aquens.
According to the new film material titled “Sydney Bay — Up and Down”, waters in the most popular city of Australia are filled with minorities, plastic grids and bottles, lost shoes and parts of clothes, and even dead animals, and all of this flows to the bay along with rains.
However, the largest part of our sailing channels is plastic.
“I would call it paradox”, says Dr. Katherine Dafforn, Deputy Director of the Research Programme Sydney Harbour Research Programme, published in September 27, and the publication of this film is deliberately collaborating during the World Tourism Day.
This Aquen looks beautiful, but it is one of the most modified and contaminated to walk the rivers along our coast.
The CSIRO Agency estimates that every hour about 1560 kg of plastic is available to our waterways, and its majority affects the bay through the storm sewer.
"After so powerful declines of the bay... it looks pretty tragic," said Dr. Dafforn.
Two thirds of pollution come from rain removals.
However, as in the ice mountain, the problem with the Sydney Bay is much more serious under the water surface, since 70% of the plastic that moves into the ocean reaches the bottom of the sea.
"I think if you don't spend time under water, you can't really realize what's in the deeper," said Richard Nicholls, owner of Dive Centre Manly, noting that he and his team are self-extracting about 500 kg of plastic annually.
I think if more people knew (what is under the water), they would be just terrified.
It's surprising... more than half of what we find on the bottom are plastic networks.
The rest of 50% are things that are at least made of artificial creation.
When you look at the bay, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that all this plastic and the other garbage we're getting right under the surface.
Jeremy Brown, a co-sponsor and director of the Ocean Protect, found out that there are ways in which people, both local and tourists, could help to reduce the amount of plastic and the remains of our waterways.
"This must begin at the source," he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic used by us, better lead the recovery of materials, and have a greater awareness of what we're dropping in the garbages that eventually reach the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we'll be destroyed because 50% of the oxygen we're breathing is from the ocean.
It absorbs 30% of carbon dioxide and our food source.
However, we can arrange this bay and restore it to an old excellence, which is very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we will kill ourselves.
The film material financed by the TOMRA recycling company within its broader efforts to educate Australians in the field of environmental protection and reduce the negative impact of beverages on beverages that frequently affect the environment, is collaborated during a study on the dependency between artificial and mental health, which has been published this month.
A new survey carried out between 546 children aged 12 and 18 years has concluded that 82% of respondents feel helpless to waste from artificial materials and 25% of adults are guilty of waste with one-time plastic packages.
The study revealed that waste from artificial materials was also fourth of the fear of parents, and 93% of the 551 surveyed parents said that their concerns about the quantity of plastic waste passing into the oceans were increasing.
Many people who took part in the study said they wanted to do something about waste from artificial creations, but they just don't know how to make significant changes, which led to environmental fear.
Poland – Slovenia.
Memy after the network game in me halffinal

But it didn't happen, and the Poles had to finally recognize the highest of the rival, which after winning 3:1 will play the final tournament.

Google creates a cloud in Poland.
PKO BP Partner
National Cloud Operator, PKO BP and PFR, has concluded strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation is to help Polish companies implement and use the potential for calculation cloud technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the National Cloud Operator offer, and Google will open in Warsaw, the region Google Cloud, which is the hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to clients from Poland and the Central and Eastern Europe region.
The Google Cloud region will be the first global, public cloud calculation in Central Europe.
The digitization of Polish companies was one of the key foundations that were based on the draft national cloud created and developed by the PKO Bank of Poland and the Poland Development Fund, the participants of that company.
The Partnership of the National Cloud and Google is another important step on the road that we have encountered a year ago, announceing the call of the National Cloud Operator.
The goal remains unchanged – the digitalization of the Polish economy and the dynamicization of its growth.
“Now Polish companies receive additional, elaborated tools for its implementation.
By using them, they increase their chances to advance the world's league, what we all care about.
The fact that Google joins them today is essentially strengthening our joint project," said Zbigniew Jagnjelo, PKO President of the Polish Bank.
The Polish Development Fund indicates that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industry and businesses.
“Investment in the National Cloud Operator is ideally incorporated into the PFR strategy, as an essential part of the country's digitalisation.
It will provide modern and accessible price solutions to entrepreneurs based on a cloud architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also affect the development of the Polish IT market and bring to it the best specialists," Paul Borys, President of the PFR.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on the leading technical infrastructure, providing the calculation power and data storage services.
Clients in Poland will find all key products Google Cloud Platform such as Compute Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner or Big.
Inclusion of Google Cloud services in the National Cloud offer will enable Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies that their global competitions use.
But thanks to us, they will remain in Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators," Michal Potoček, President of the National Cloud Operator.
It adds that the company will be ready for megatrendy, such as Internet stuff (IoT), which repeatedly increases the requirement for the calculation power necessary for the processing of enormous data collections.

It was also organized for discussion panels with inter alia: Helena Norowic, Beaty Tadli, Marioli Bojarska-Ferenc, Tomas Jacykovski, or Robert Janowski.
There were no vocal and music attractions on the picnic.
There was a legend of the Polish song, Christoph Krawczyk, and there was an inter-general dancing that led DJ Wik at the evening.
Tasmanian Devils may provide guidance on cancer treatment
Tasmanian Devils may have a cancer-treatment key – researchers have made a breakdown discovery that can revolute therapy for patients
Medical researchers have discovered how to mask some cancer cells
Students have found that the same process is in Tasman's devils and in humans.
There is hope that this discovery will bring new oncological treatment methods
What do Tasman's devils and people have in common?
Cancer cells that can become invisible.
Researchers, including Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made a breakdown discovery that can help revolution therapy of some cancers if they do not respond to immunology.
It may also contain a key to the treatment of mortal tumours in the face, threatening the future of the threatened Tasman devil.
The study set out how to mask certain cancer cells both in humans and in bags, using a group of proteins called PRC2, which excludes a marker that would otherwise signal the immune system to attack cancer.
This may be the greatest challenge in the treatment of minor cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and the type of skin cancer called Mercla cell cancer.
"The great significance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop immune therapy, we can be able to reverse this process," said Mark Dawson, chief researcher of Peter Mac.
Existing therapy can be addressed to re-inclusion of markers, proteins called MHC, allowing the immune system to recognise cancer cells.
"There are potentially long-term implications for people with lung cancer," said Professor Dawson.
"It is one of the most common diseases on earth.
And maybe we can treat her much better.
Students also hope that the discovery will be used once to treat the face of the Tasmanian Devil, where cancer cells are avoiding discovery in a similar way.
"It's unusual that the same process is happening (in the case of cancers in people and in Tasman's devils)," said Professor Dawson.
"How difficult it was to treat Tasman's devil tumors so far.
But if human medicines can also be used in Tasman's devils, there is a possibility that this will help control the disease."
Scientists are surprised by the fact that around a really small star is a very large planet.
Scientists are surprised when they discover a solar system of 30 light years from the Earth, which undermines our current understanding of the processes of planet creation, because in this context, a large planet similar to Judah is circled around a small star called red carl.
The artistic illustration of a giant gas type planet GJ 3512b circulated around the central star as a red carl, published on 26 September 2019.
In general, stars are much bigger than even the biggest planets around them.
However, as the scientists said on Thursday, in this case, the star and the planet are slightly different.
The size of the star named GJ 3512 is about 12% of the size of the sun, while the mass of the planet around it is at least half of the mass of Judah, the largest planet of our solar system.
"Yes, this is an absolute surprise," said astrophist Juan Carlos Morales from the Catalonic Institute of Space Research at the Spanish Institute of Space Studies, who was headed by research published in Science.
Discovery is surprising because theoretical models of solar systems suggest that stars with low mass of rule become mother stars for smaller planets similar to Earth or smaller Neptuns.
“In this case, we have discovered a planet of gas type with a giant similar to Jowisz circling around a very small star”, added Morales.
The planet, which, like Judah, consists primarily of gas, was discovered using a telescope in the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It circles its star after a very eliptic orbit, and the complete circulation lasts 204 days.
Red carves are small and they have relatively low surface temperature.
The GJ 3512 star is not only much smaller than the sun, but at some point, it is comparable to the size of a very large planet, because it is only about 35% bigger than Jupiter.
They emit less energy, so they are fatter than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is approximately below 3800 (steps) Kelvina (6380 degrees Fahrenheita / 3527 degrees Celsius).
"That's why they have red color," Morales said.
"There are evidence of the existence of the second planet circling around this star, while the third planet could be thrown out of the star system in the past, which can translate the eliptic orbit of a planet like Jupiter," said Morales.
Planets come from the same star gas and dust disk that produces a star around which the planets circle.
According to the leading model of the creation of planets called a model of action, the object is initially formed from particles of steady in the disk, and the force of gravity of the planet in the early stage of development allows the atmosphere to be emerged from the gas surrounding.
This unusual system can explain a competitive model called a model of gravitational instability.
"In that case, the protoplanetary disc around the young star can be a little massiveer than we expect and may be cold," said Morales.
This leads to a disability of disk stability, so some dense areas can occur.
These mass may grow up until the planet's falling down and creating.
Delicious worker accused of the use of a bovine dip colleague containing metamphetamine
Sheriff's office in Marion County stopped Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38 years, for the application of a bovine dip colleague containing metamphetamine.
On Thursday from Albania, the 38-year-old Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez was accused of providing metamphetamine and causing the consumption of this substance controlled by another person – both crimes are crimes of the second degree.
The charge was filed on the basis of the 9th September event in the Thriftway food shop in Jefferson.
In the portal obtained by OregonLive.com of the statement made under the oath of the probability of the 27-year-old suspected colleague told Marion's deputy sheriff that during the lunch break she saw Medina-Hernandez make a bovine dip to which she then paid her.
On the basis of the statement, it is known that the victim of a crime that, according to what she had transmitted to the investigator, had never taken the metamphetamine, said that “she thought that one of the pieces that had eaten by it had tasteed strangely, but it didn’t raise any suspicions. ”
When she got back to work, she felt like she had a stomach and she couldn't stand on her feet.
According to Albania Democrat-Herald, she went to a local hospital where it was found that the beans can contain metamphetamine.
On the basis of the reports of the Smoking Gun Police, another worker of the Thriftway network said that Medina-Hernandez “reached her to add drugs to food”, while another admitted that the suspect had sent her a message, claiming that the metamphetamine had gotten into the fasol dip by accident.
The OregonLive website informs about the recording from the delicates, which apparently shows how it was turned back to Medina-Hernandez camera pulling something out of the biustone, standing behind the microwave and leaning.
Then it simplifys, wires his nose, comes to the table and puts the beans in a small paper vessel.
According to the police, the thing that was pulled out of the biustones was also probably on the plate.
The Oregonic Stateman-Journal newspaper states that sheriff's office employees claim that there is no suspicion that customers are given contaminated food.
Medina-Hernandez is in Marion County's prison – the bail is $520,000.
According to the The Smoking Gun portal, its extensive police record indicates that a woman was already sentenced for attack, robbery, identity stealing, supplying metamphetamine, stealing, possessing metamphetamine and possessing unavailable weapons.

What's KAS doing about boss NIC?
The rental of real estate for the amount below the market price is the objections that appear in connection with the Chairman of the Supreme Chamber of Control, Marian Banasia.
What the treasury is doing in this case, we asked at the Treasury Administration Chamber in Krakow and the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel presented doubts about the proprietary statements of the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control of Marian Banase.
He's been studying the Central Anticorruption Office for several months.
The control shall end in the second half of October, after the parliamentary elections.
As indicated in the statements, Banása had to rent a stone of 400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
In fact, he received 65.7 thousand gold for this year.
The Supervisier report revealed that the stone that he hired was located in a hotel for an hour.
The NIK chief later explained on state television, why he only took over 5,000 gold per month for rent.
“The electoral newspaper”, referring to experts in the estate assessment, estimated that it should be 15,000 gold per month for the stone itself.
"The amount was lower for a simple reason: I concluded the preliminary agreement and the fact that the hireman had to buy this stone, caused me to agree on the lower rent that the other duties would be calculated at the sale of the stone," Bannasa convinced.
However, there have been doubts whether this is not a violation of the law.
Conrad Zawada, a press attorney of the Treasury Administration Chamber in Krakow, in a television with TVN24, informed that “the case is directly addressed by the Ministry of Finance”.
"All such questions, please direct to the Minister of Finance," he added.
The claim explained that in such cases, “the National Treasury Administration is running.”
The press branch of the Ministry of Finance, Paul Jurek, admitted that the National Treasury Administration itself monitors a number of cases that may raise some objections.
“The Financing Administration works in a way that it has its own information, as well as is based in some sense on those information that are available publicly.
On this basis, it takes decisions whether a specific matter of conduct of possible proceedings or not,” translated by the MF Prosecutor.
"But because all of us in the financial sectors are obliged by a treasury secret, we never speak, because we cannot speak in individual matters of a specific taxpayer, a particular person or a particular company," he stressed, questioned about Marian Banasia's case.
The Minister of Finance, Jerzy Kwecinski, emphasized that “the treasury authorities do not transmit to public information of this type of news”.
"We know that the whole treasure camera is dealing with very many similar cases throughout the country," he pointed out.
Royal family secrets: Surprising guests flying frequently by royal aircraft
As part of the duty, members of the royal family have to travel hundreds of ways around the world during their life.
It usually facilitates the royal plane — a private machine that drives the royal family around the world to important events and events.
It is not surprising that owning a plane is connected to privileges.
The members of the Royal family must not stand in long lines for shipping, their limits for the number of baggages, and, as it appears, may invite any guests, including truly unseen.
According to a recent prime minister on Channel 5 of a documentary film not only the queen and Prince Philip often travel in a royal plane.
During the programme entitled “The Royal Air Secrets ” were the navigator of the Queen’s flights, he revealed that with the royal family, flew freaking guests.
Bob Shields said: “Sometimes, along with our very important royal guests, they could fly very important royal dogs. ”
It is not surprising that the queen could have earned her favorites to be accompanied in her journeys, because she is known for her deeply bound to dogs of corgy.
Since the youngest, Queen Elizabeth has been a lover of these four - foot creatures and hears that since the coronation she owned more than 30 corgs.
It is said that in 2007 she had five corgs: Monty, Emma, Linneta, Willowa and Holly.
Five cockers joined them: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Span, as well as four dogs who were a crusade of corgy: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The royal aircraft crew must have had full hands of robots.
A royal housekeeper was seen to bring the dogs and ask them to settle their needs before taking them to the plane, says Shields.
I'm glad to say that there's never been any incident.
The programme also revealed the shocking number of baggages that the queen takes with her on board during the journey during the performance of the service obligations.
The Narrator stated: “In 1953, the Queen took a bag of 12 tonnes in her 70,000 miles away. ”
To be able to show it better, it's more than the same as two huge elephants.
But the queen is not the only person who has a weakness to fashion.
The Princess Cambridge said also enjoys the transport of her suitcase – it is said that each of her dresses are a separate seat.
The new law shall enter into force.
The injured in accidents will be receiving rents
On Friday, there shall be a regulation to ensure that the remuneration of the remuneration is seriously damaged in cases – the Finance Guard informs.
It is a law of 9 July 2019 on specific powers of persons affected in the event of exhaustion of the guarantee sum fixed on the basis of the provisions applicable before 1 January 2006.
It concerns those who were damaged before 1 January 2006.
They were then decisively lower than the guarantee amounts now, and therefore, in some cases, the insurance insurers have already stopped paying rents.
"I am pleased with this regulation, because our institution has been trying for many years to create a mechanism that will allow seriously damaged in cases to guarantee financial support from the communications or the OC farmer's insurance, despite the exhaustion of the guarantee sum," said Alexander Dashewski, a legal adviser in the Finance Office.
This was necessary by the Finance Guardian, because these are often very tragic situations regarding people in a very bad condition, which, for the reason of an accident, cannot work for example, while they bear significant cost of accidental rehabilitation.
Some of them had no longer been receiving equivalents and increased requirements for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the exhaustion of so-called safeguarding amounts in the OC fields.
Parts of this threatened in the coming years.
By 1 January 2006, the liability limits of the insurance provider were significantly lower than the present.
Therefore, the issue of exhaustion of the guarantee amount in the previous years was most frequently affected by those who suffered damage in the 1990s.
At that time the guarantees were very low, and economic conditions resulted in the increase of prices.
"We also noticed that this problem has also affected a number of young people who have suffered damage during the period where the amount of EUR 350,000 for each injured accident.
It is now EUR 5,21 million for the event, regardless of the number of damaged.
It is therefore a huge difference in the previous periods, therefore the problem required the legislator's intervention," Alexandr Dashewski recalls.
It explains that, since the guarantee amount is increasing for a period of time, the legislator accepted that the upper boundary of the insurance fund will be a guarantee amount in force at the time of remuneration to the Remuneration Fund.
This principle shall apply if the insurance undertaking is not obliged to pay the remuneration on the basis of the judgment of the judiciary determining a different amount of guarantee than set out in the OC insurance agreement.
This shall take place in the case of an increase in the guarantee in the judicial way under Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which allows the modification of the existing binding relationship.
“In the last days, we sent letters to those who in the past asked us to intervene.
We inform them about the new powers and, of course, we provide for the possibility of further support in the event of any problems occurring," says Alexander Dashewski.

Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle "inspiration" in Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed high appreciation for Meghan Markle in Instagram on Thursday, calling the Prince Sussex “the careful leader who breaks the schemes and making our world better. ”
The Princess and Prince Harry, currently taking a ten-day royal journey to South Africa with their son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, attended a meeting with the youth at the beginning of this week, where they met with the leaders of the Obama Foundation.
"I would like to thank my friend, Her Royal Majesty, Princess Sussex@sussexroyal, "the careful leader who breaks the schemes and which makes our world better," wrote the first lady in her encouraging post.
“Is this meeting with the leaders of the Obama Foundation Fund @ObamaFoundation, or helping girls around the world to access the education they deserve is an inspiration for many people,” she added to Obama, incorporating a picture presented by the smiling Meghan with the leaders of the foundation.
Meghan conducted an interview with Obama for the September issue of the British Vogue, guestly edited by the former actor of the Suits series.
In the sincere conversation, the first lady was talking about maternity and how it changed her.
“Bing a mother means leading to the art of forgiveness," Obama said in the Intelligence.
“Materonomy taught me that for most of my time, it is my task to give children space so that they can know the world and become what they want to be.
Not who I want to be or who I wanted to be in their age, but who are in the heart.
Obama, who knows from experience what the pressure to be on the candle, shared with the priest's council during an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine.
"The press that you feel, which is caused by yourself and by others, may sometimes push you," she said.
“My advice is therefore to release and do not rush at anything.
For the first few months in the White House, I spent mostly caring about my daughter, making sure that they work well at school and make new friends before I was more ambitious.
I think that's necessary, too.
Hotel Trumpa maintains a license for sale of alcohol despite the complaint of the owner's nature
WASHINGTON (AP) – The Commission for Alcohol Control in Washington has revoked a request to verify whether the local property Trump International Hotel should lose the marketing authorisation for alcohol due to the owner's nature.
The Agency arranged on Wednesday that the complaint of three shepherds, two retired judges and two rabbis is unfounded because most of them do not live in district or have no real estate in it.
The Washington Post states that the second time you have tried to revoke the hotel's license to sell alcohol, calling on the regulation in the district that the applicants of alcohol license must be “a good attitude”.
The original complaint last summer was claimed that President Donald Trump breaks the law and charges for attacks and repeated fraud cases have been accused.
The complaint was dismissed because the authorisation was granted before it was filed.
The reason for the second complaint was to extend the authorisation.
"The Sun": The inhabiting report recognizes the scandals of police service in Cleveland as the worst in Britain
Inspectors recognised the scandal police as the worst in Britain.
In a burst report, they evaluated the police work in Cleveland as an incompatible place in all areas.
Phil Gormley, the Chief Police Inspector of Her Majesty, claims that in Cleveland police services there has been a "sensitive deterioration" of standards.
There have been new appeals to resolve police services, which led five commanders during six years.
According to the report, the police did not try to prevent crime, arrest suspects and the protection of the weakest.
Phil Gormley, head of Her Majesty’s police inspector, said: “With our last inspection, there has been a significant deterioration of standards. ”
Commander Mike Veale quit in January after an incomplete year in the face of the investigation on “serious”, even though unrecognized, accusations on his proceedings.
Deputy Commander Adrian Roberts was suspended after the arrest under suspicion of severe errors.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood set up before the committee for offences for encouraging colleagues to sexual activity.
He left his office.
Mayor Tees Valley Ben Houchen, from the Toriss shoulder, said: “It is officially confirmed that these services are compromised.
It's time for the Department of Home Office to intervene now."
Police Commander Richard Lewis said: “I take full responsibility for carrying out police forces by changes after improving it.”
We have a visualization of the skatepark!
Are youths finally waiting?
The elderly people are disturbed by the youth passionate riding on the bullies and descorols, and they complain that there is no right place for them in Olawa.
For years, young people are reminded of a place to ride on rolls, descorols, hulaines, bikes.
The subject's still coming back to our ruins.
We've been paying attention to this problem for ten years.
It's been loud again about the lack of a skatepark.
That's why we're going back to this again and asking the device what's next?
We remind that a woman who was disturbing the youth riding in the center a few days ago.
"I write on behalf of the inhabitants of the Pl. Pilsudski bloc, so that you may be interested in the situation of the Olaw youth," says Malgorzat.
"The inhabitants of the block have repeatedly called the City Guard ineffectively.
For the evidence of such daily situations, I'm sending photos."
We asked others about this matter.
Most of them clearly argue that young people simply have nowhere to ride in the city and have longed for their own place for years.
Under the post on Facebook, even the lavene of comments appeared.
We already wrote in July that there was a chance that the skatepark would be built in the Olaw City.
The Mayor informed that the city had requested funding for the construction of a skatepark.
“The project, consulted with youth, together with the permits, is ready.
On 28 March, the Ministry of Sports and Tourism was requested to finance the task of the Scatepark Building in Olawa under the Sports Poland programme, we were told in the Office.
Total value of the project: 798 306.00 zl.
Appropriated amount of funding: 263 440,00 z.
Now we've asked again at what stage the matter is.
"We have no information yet about the responsibilities of solutions to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism for Finance", said Elizabeth Bednarcziz, Chief of the Division of European Funds of UM Olawa.
“The information received from the Ministry's employees shows that the final choice of all tasks under the Sports Programme of Poland should occur in October”.
We also asked for a visualization of the Slow Park.
We'll present it below.
The youth informed the editor that the subsequent Saturday (September 28th) would be collecting signatures under the petition on the construction of the Scatepark in Olava.
"The rebelling youth saw the last post on Facebook and came to the conclusion that they would organize the collection," Santa Claus writes.
Signatures under petition will be collected from 12:00 in the area of Lidl market.
Poland Cup 2019/20: 1/16 final.
We know couples, hit years ago.
It was one of the most extraclass rivalries.
The biggest legend has grown a memorial game in the 1996/1997 season.
On June 18, 1997, the Legia took the old stadium at the Lazinkowian ship team in a more expensive row.
Both teams shared the point.
The householders had to win, the second in a row of Poland's championship gave a point.
By the 87th minute Legia drove 2:0, but for five more minutes there was a earthquake – Vizov shot three naked and enjoyed the title.
The boat club of years had grown more troubles until he stopped counting for the championship and fell down from the highest play class.
For the last time, both teams met at this level in season 2013/2014.
The Legis — on the way to the title – took two victories – 5:1 at her house and 1:0 on the way out.
Return to elite
At present, the boats are fighting for returning to national elite.
These plans were delayed for at least a year, because in the previous games, as one of the favorites, they could not advance the back of the extraclass.
As a result of this summer failure, there was a personnel revolution in the club.
The authorities have changed, the coach of Marcin Kačmark, and the next step to the club hyerarchy is to help the marcin Robak and Matheus Mozg.
For now, Vizev is fourth in Table II of League, but in Poland, he defeated the Vicelider Extraclass Slosk Wroclaw 2:0 on Tuesday.
The Legis in the same size has been limited to the departure of the Desert of Colombia.
Extraclass starts
The only couple composed of the highest class representatives in the 1/16 final form its ALKS benymine and the Zabrze Mountain.
The swords of this stage will take place on 29-31 October.
This year was planned to play 1/8 final (3-5 December).
The final is to be held on the National PGE on 2 May in Warsaw.
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr "rebelled" and the investigation within the impeachment must run through his track
You never know where we're going.
Now, I think, we are participating in trying to hide facts and the investigation in this case may take a while," Pelosi said in an intelligence for CNN at the Capitol Hill.
“They do the work they started by sticking to the facts and time necessary to find them,” she added.
From the protocol issued this week by the White House, Trump asked the President of Ukraine to conduct a investigation on the former Vice-President Joe Biden, the 2020 candidate, and his son.
Trump also asked Zlenski to take action with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as a result of the protocol.
Trump denyed that he did anything wrong.
On Thursday, CNN reported that the national security lawyers from the Department of Justice had notified the complaint filed by the signalist on Trump's proceedings with Ukraine more than a week before the formal statement.
Following the receipt of a complaint from officials of the Community Intelligence, the Department of Justice found that the Trump's telephone conversation did not provide a criminal investigation on the funding of the campaign.
Asked whether Barr should testify, Pelosi stated that on Friday the Intelligence Committee would decide who to call for a witness.
But she added that Barr’s view was “rebelled. ”
It's been a long time.
“Again, (Barra) is exchanged in all of this," Pelosi added, referring to Tramp's mention of his general prosecutor during the July conversation with the leader of Ukraine.
I'm wondering he was making decisions about the way the complaint was considered.
Pelosi stated that “he is very afraid ” of the signalists whom Trump attacked as spys on Thursday, suggesting that in the past they had been dealing differently with spy.
I think the words of the President are beyond the responsibility, it's dangerous.
Our signalists play an important role in discovering - revealing crimes in our government," Pelosi said, adding "The word of the President about people who could provide information you have seriously condemned the integrity in the government."
On Tuesday, Pelosi took a historical step to announce a formal investigation on the conduct of an unlawful act based on attempts to pressure the foreign leader to obtain political benefits.
The telephone conversation was included in the composition published on Thursday, in which the signalist claimed that Trump abused his power to “provoke Ukraine into interference” during the coming elections of 2020.
The signalist also charged that the White House's lawyers had ordered officials to remove the phone records from the computer system in which they were stored for the purposes of the Ministerial Council and to place it in the system designed for particular sensitive information.

Ghana: Kofi Manu concerned by the verification Commission structure
Kofi Manu, football manager and representative of the Secondi Hasaacas Club, raised doubts about the composition of the verification Commission for the coming elections to the National Football Union in Ghana (GFA).
He questioned the inclusion of the President of the Commission, Frank Davies, and added that he was not satisfied with his participation.
In an intelligence from the GNA Sport Manu, the Chairman of the Commission has expressed doubts that the verification process is in its interest.
The verification Commission should be composed of neutral persons outside who do not show any links to any member and who have not previously shown interest.
For example, Davies hired the NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwaku Palmer about the payments of 10 per cent.
He is also a famous advocate of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to take a position in the verification Commission, as he has interest in it," he said.
Manu said that if Fred Pappoe, Director of Olympic Games, before the Commission, would have a conflict of interests by the Chairperson because of his relationship with the club, suggesting that if the Commission becomes Palmer, it will be subject to prejudice and partyity.
According to the expectations, the members of the Commission were to start the work from yesterday, after the oath during the GFA ceremony in the Acra Secretariat on Tuesday, 19 September, and complete it on 4 October.
The Chairman of the Commission is Frank Davies, and its members are the Corporate Consultant and Mr. Marian Barnor's lawyer and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwah.
Other members belong to Reginald Laryea, Director for Marketing and Business and Richard Akpokavie, Sports Administrator and Lawyer.

Israel: There is no agreement on the government of unity
Two main parties of Israel, the Alliance of the Blue-White and Licud, continued negotiations on the establishment of a government of unity on Friday.
The meeting that took place after the president's mission to form the government of Benjamin Netanjah did not make any results.
The discussions discussed the possibility of the rotating leadership of both parties in the government and remaining Netanjah as Prime Minister, but, as the Israeli Journal “Haarec” says, there was no approach to views.
Talks will be resumed on Sunday.
The Central Alliance of Blue-White informed in the communication that he presented the preliminary postulates.
He accuses the right Lekud that he “popped himself on his positions”, demanding that his leader and so far Prime Minister, Netanjahu, be head of the government, and in the office, which is previously included in its Ultra-Oxy politics.
"And from the beginning it was known that the Blue-White would not agree on these conditions," said the communication published by them.
For Licud, acting only in the interest of Netanjah, wants “to lead in Israel to the second round of elections. ”
The leader of the Blue-Bible Benny Gantz refuses to support the government to be directed by Netanjah until he has been charged with three corrupt affairs on the basis of which the prosecutor could formally accuse him after the Wednesday meeting.
"Likud and Blue-Biali have obtained a sufficient majority in the elections of 17 September, which would allow them to share governments as natural allies, but it forces them to negotiate which no party has wanted," the EFE Agency wrote.
President Reuwen Riwlin was trying to bring their positions closer in the last days and suggested that the Prime Minister suspend his functions in time, which would allow Gantz to take this position if the charges against Netanjah were supported and formalized.
There are no lack of Israeli analysts who believe that things were stuck in a blind street.
However, half of the Israelis, as indicated in the report published by the public television on Friday, wishes to unlock the political situation in the country by calling for a government of unity under the rotational leadership to transform Netanjah and Gantza.
According to this solution, 50.6% of the Israelites, 32.1 per cent of the surveys oppose such a solution.
The survey shows a deep division in the Israeli society – on the question who should first be headed by the office, 41.8% of the respondents are speaking for Netanjahu, and 40% behind Gantz.
In another survey published by the Journal of Israel Hayom, the percentage of unity constituents increases to 63%, 60% is opposed to new elections that would be third this year.
In the pre-term parliamentary elections on September 17th, Gantz's alliance won 33 mandates in the 120-mest version, Likud Netanjahu combated 32 mandates.
Netanjahu and his traditional and potential allies can count on supporting 55 ambassadors, while Gantz – on 54.
No participants have gathered 61 mandates necessary for most.
Tipuric calls for a fight before the final game with the Australians
Justin Tipuric says that it is “time to be checked” when Wales faces the final game with Australia within the World Cup that can form their fate in the tournament.
The Belgium's victory over the "Kangurs" would set this team on the position of a favorite to win the Group D and guarantee participation in the likely fourth final meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia defeats Walia for 14 times in the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be shinyly sent to the start with England within one eighth final.
"Let's make the case clear, both teams want to try through it and be headed by the group," said the Wales fighter Tipuric.
In the past there were some difficult results, but last autumn was nice to win with them (Australia).
I think they're going to try to take this victory from us, and we're going to need to take it back.
Before we arrived here, you knew it would be a big start.
And now we're here and it's really time to check.
Walia won only one victory over Australia, New Zealand or RPA in the history of the World Cup – and it took place 32 years ago in the third game when they defeated the "Kangurs".
And their total record under coach Warren Gatland shows only seven victories in 41 attempts to defeat three heavy teams from the Southern half.
The Wales represented the line of 13 lost test matches from Australia's hands in November last year, and Tipuric prepared to be among those few rescued from this win 9-6, who will run to the Tokyo stadium on Sunday.
Typuric asked whether before this victory the team experienced mental blockade, he added: “It is hard to say.
These matches are so balanced that maybe... people expect there's a mental block, I don't know.
The end of the last game, we probably left about 15 points on the field, so the final result seems much less advantage than it actually was.
If Walia triumphs, then the fight of Tipurica with the popular Australian duo from the third line of the mill Michael Hooper and David Pocock during the detention and destruction will be essential.
Tipuric played 67 meetings in the colours of representation and met both players at a few earlier occasions, so he knows exactly what he's waiting for.
"These are players playing at the seventh absolutely world class," he said.
When playing against the world class to the third line of the mill, it is always known that it will be a hard game to play.
Those two are always with the best players in the world.
You know what play you can expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is a more attacking seven and probably better feels footby, because he's always in the right place at the right time.
It's better to play against the best players in the world and to challenge yourself than to deal with the third line of mill that is not that good.
It's worth playing against the best, and by fighting these two, you must be in a top form.
I wouldn't say Sunday's almost going to happen to the finals of the squirrel, but it's an important game for us in this World Cup.
The impet is its important element.
When we build the strength and keep putting great effort, we will fly like our wings and it will be hard to beat us.

The prime minister of the book.
"Waffen-SS" Jochen Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Mlynarczyk
They were supposed to be an elite organization of the gentleman's race.
They accepted in their series those whom they despised.
Can the crime be stronger than the national identity?
In your hands, we give not another book about war or military theme.
We take a deep international study on the participation of non-Germans in Waffen-SS.
Historians from different countries of Europe analyze the attitude and motivation of volunteers, remind them of their activities and look at the recruitment processes at different stages of war.
Did the Danish branches differ from the French?
Where did Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why hasn't it been possible to create a branch composed of the Polish itself?
How does the official historical talk on collaboration in individual European countries look today?
What happened to volunteers after the war ends?
Among other things, the Waffen-SS book is answered on the basis of solid research material.
We have also been trying to present a subtellier and more clever, closer to the picture of collaboration in Europe during the second World War, trying to break the methodological borders of history and the period of history by presenting researchers' reports from different countries.... Unless the fate of the main victims of this war - forced workers, Jews, prisoners, Nazi opponents, Germans, Slovenian people are sometimes presented in a comparison and/or an overnational perspective, the number of perpetrators are examined in principle from the national perspective (if so).
"The total panic" when the White House fights finding arguments on impeachment
The officials from the White House are going to find out how to resist the pressures renewed on impeachment on Thursday, and one of the speakers familiar with the situation describes the feeling of "total panic" sensitive last week due to the lack of response to the new reality plan.
It appears that it is “the concern, insecurity and concern” -- one of the people related to the White House described the mood in the west wing – that the accusations of the informant can seriously harm the president and the people of his environment.
He said: “They are not sure that there is nothing to hide. ”
The White House officials were still uncertain about how to proceed, not only because there is no obvious action plan in this situation, but also because the charges are serious enough that the standard methods of effective avoiding the controversy used by the President in the past may not work. "It does not seem to pass on to the next cycle of headlines."
Another person who knows the course of the discussion described the atmosphere in the White House as “the state of shock, ” accompanied by a growing uncertainty that, together with a cross-controlled investigation on impeachment, the probability that the president will respond in an inappropriate way and become“ difficult to control”.
This fear is divided by another speaker who claims that the president's surroundings are predicting that he will be more “speaking ” behaviour, and the pressure incurred on it will certainly begin to increase with every day of investigation on impeachment.
This is a concern that Trump can present an increasingly unpredictable behaviour and in an unexpected way to explode – it is in the context of the election year, both from the perspective of the Presidentship and the elections.
By facing the greatest threat in the presidentship, Trump circled from attack to defense, once again pursuing a strategy that he assessed as effective during the investigation of Robert Mueller on Russia.
He tried to evaluate his own request to the Ukrainian President for help in carrying out an investigation on his political rivals to distract and direct it to the actions of democrats and candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, and to discredit the informant as a party motive.
But while many people in the White House have been combated after Mueller's investigation, this time something has changed -- advisers and consultants said.
The President, whose recognition mark is the force, the middle press conference showed a defeated one of the people familiar with the situation.
While Trump enthusiasticly accepted Russian investigation questions, he seemed unwilling to answer questions about Ukraine, they said.
Some of the president's allies believe that there is a possibility to avoid damage, and some of them hold the fact that the informant had no knowledge from the first hand about the controversial telephone conversation between President Trump and the Ukrainian President of Zelene, which, according to them, contradicts his credibility.
And how often it happens when the president is an object of attacks, this fact is vividly raised by his chief advocates in his defense.
But one of the Republican strategies linked to the White House indicates that the results of the President's support surveys are unboundly high, and the impeachment will not affect the acquisition of new sympathy.
"There is no positive need to concentrate on the president's impeachment in the next four months," especially if it disturbs his legislative program and prevails in the new cycle of headlines.
Another speaker claims that those who claimed that the impeachment would help the president did not fully understand how unpredictable his response would be.
The concerned White House officials were looking for help from advisers, compiling a team of responses to impeachment.
According to the person who has knowledge of plans, taking into account that these efforts are in early stages, it remains uncertain whether any initiation in the style of the command centre will be taken and which form can be taken.
This person stated that it was convinced that a co-ordinated legal and communication strategy was required with a decisive leader who was able to strike the PR as a riposte for the publication of an exhaustive signal report and aimed at preventing the dissemination of the democratic action on the impeachment issued by the report.
The speaker familiar with the situation states that the lack of long-term strategic vision was clearly visible when the Secretary of the State of Mike Pompeo and the Secretary of Treasure Steve Mnuchin stated that they had no intention to disclose the notes of Tramp's discussion with the Ukrainian President, and then 48 hours later, it was possible to feel that there was no way out and that the document was to be published.
The pressure is now predicted to be greater than during the investigation of Robert Mueller, who mostly kept silence and spoke only through accusations. One of those who may be involved in the development of answers to the impeachment is Corey Lewandowski, a man from the dirty work of Trump and former head of the Election Staff, said a person linked to the case.
However, Lewandowski said in his conversation with NBC News that it is not true to suggest that he will manage this action.
"In the past five years, I have done everything I could to support the President and his programme," he said, "but I have not participated in any conversations with the President or his team on joining the team to resist the false talk on impeachment."
The private attorney Donald Trump in the investigation of Mueller, Jay Seculow, is also involved in impeachment actions.
“We respond to things right” – Sekulow replied when he was requested by NBC News to comment.
At present, the White House feels the lack of a lawyer experienced in the field of impeachment, after Emmet Flood, who worked with Clinton's impeachment and advised White House at the end of Mueller's investigation, left, and the present advisor, Pat Cipollone, has no such experience.
The speaker familiar with the White House Strategy stated that officials at no time had planned to involve people or create a command centre, but admitted that the need for coordinated, common response and those who could lead political battle.

Devin Nunes accuses the Democrats of demanding "naked pictures of Trump"
Congressman Devin Nunes from the state of California apparently cannot bear the naked truth that President Donald Trump is being investigated.
On his Thursday defense, he accused the Democrats of getting the president's naked photos.
Nunes, a highly posted Republican in the Commission for Intelligence of the Representation Chamber, charged the above charge during the preliminary statement during the hearing of the signal complaint, as if Trump asked Ukraine for assistance in the inquiry against the Democrat candidate for President Joe Biden and his son.
The Congressman called the Ukrainian scandal "grotesk presentation" of the left and their "mediatric ass" before he found that the Democrats wanted to see the pictures of the president in the negligence.
"The Democrats in this committee negotiated with people who, according to them, were Ukrainians to receive Trump's naked photos," Nunes said.
"People can correctly ask why the Democrats are so determined to put the president in the state of accusation when they have their chance in the next year.
When Nunes finished giving reprymends, the HuffPost political reporter, Jennifer Bendery, decided to see if the Democrats were really trying to find it.
Until now, only the representative of Connecticut, Jim Himes, we suspect that his answer is naked, as a confirmation of many of his colleagues and colleagues.
The Mediaite.com portal suspects that Nunes' naked comments were referring to “specific more favourable and unaffirmed information” that are likely to appear in Steele's controversial records,
This is a famous, gathered by the former British spy Christopher Steele's collection of charges against Trump, pointing to the probability of the existence of a tape, which clearly shows it by watching the urine of a prostitute in the hotel room in Moscow.
Possible biofuel studies can help reduce emissions
While electrical cars and Semi Tesla have dominated information services in recent years, one issue seems to be excluding renewable energy — aircraft.
However, a professor from the University of Alberta developed a technology that enables renewable biofuels to be used as air fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at Albert's University of Agriculture, Sciences on Life and Environment, who started working on this project in 2003.
Its laboratory is designed to produce carbon fuels obtained from fat waste such as fat from restaurant, fat animal origin and repack oil.
In contrast to ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use low quality oils during production, thus estimated to 85% lower carbon emissions than for petroleum fuels, as well as to use waste from other sectors in the process.
This technology is intended to imitate hydrocarbons present in petrol fuels.
"What our technology has done in the first generation," said Bressler, "it is [in fact the creation of] hydrocarbons, which are the same particles as in diesel fuel."
While opening this new possibility of biofuel use, previously developed biofuel products had a tendency to destabilise at lower temperatures, which was a serious threat in the case of aircraft flying at large heights.
"The problem with air fuel is a little wrong circle," said Bressler.
It's really less worth than the diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Bressler's laboratory is currently watched by two air fuel options.
The first option is a small risk approach that requires additional processing of carbon fuel and adding hydrogen.
The second option is to continue working on the partially developed chemical properties that will ensure fuel stability, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little," said Bressler, commenting on the second option.
This option is more risky.
The opening company created by the University of Alberta, Forge Hydrocarbons, is working on commercialisation of the product, because airlines, as well as the Canadian and American Army, increase investments in the renewable option.
"They are able to imagine the times in which the situation may be reversed and the coal tax will be put on them," he said.
They want a alternative instead, which will be an emergency plan.
Forge is currently running a pilot plant near the Centre for Waste Management in Edmonton and recently received a sum of $4 million from Lockheed Martin in the context of investments aimed at supporting the cost of $25 million of the construction of the production plant, which will be located in Sombra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce about 19 million liters of biofuel annually.
Bressler also notes that the carbon reduction established will be approximately 85 per cent, but issues such as transport and fuel production stop the further reduction of carbon.
"As a technology specialist," Bressler said,
I have a task to develop options that allow conscious decisions and many choices."
MARKETING: Another granddaughter fraud
8000 Zl and 750 euros lost the resident of Zamstia thinking that he's helping his grandson who caused an accident.
The police were informed on Thursday by the son of a deceived guest.
"Well, a man called to her granddaughter on Wednesday.
He told me he had caused an accident and he needed money.
Otherwise he's going to jail.
The senior woman, in order to help her grandson, gave 8 thousand evil and 750 euros to the false policeman who came to her home," says Associate Dorota Krukowska-Bubilo from the U.S. police.
The police are looking for the perpetrators and again call for caution:
“Each phone with a request for financial assistance must be verified.
It should not be affected by emotion and in a hurry.
Let's remember the cops don't ask for money and don't take money.
If we get a phone with a request for financial support that will raise our suspicions, we should respond immediately and notify the police by calling the alarm number 112.
We also appeal to the younger members of our families.
Let's talk to our seniors about dangers, let's tell us how fraud works.
We ask for caution, and we do not trust those who call and ask for loan."
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's alliance warn that if the Brexit of Great Britain is reversed, they are threatening to be in Los Angeles, and he himself appeals to peace.
One of the principal ministers of the office said last night that the country was threatened by a “violent social breakdown” if the original result was questioned by the outcome of the second referendum.
Prime Ministers of Great Britain from his nearest surroundings warned that the countries threatened social concerns to the extent of the “Yellow Chapels” protests in France because of social inequalities and residues in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for "disciplination of moods" during a burdenous arguing about the language of politics, but stressed that it would not stop using the word "submission".
Despite his calling for peace, the office minister said "The Times: "In this country there have never been protests such as the demonstration of "gilets jaunes" (the yellow chapels) or the rebellion in Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible, just because they didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – the gilets of jaunes – they use encrypted phones to coordinate the pickets and to push people to protest just a few unwanted populistic leaders.
The residents in Los Angeles exploded after the jury denounced four white cops who beat a black taxi driver Rodney King in 1992.
This year, anti-governmental demonstrators in France wearing yellow reflex vests – jaunes gylet – have been empty for more than six weeks and devastate Paris streets.
The Minister responded to the warning of Johnson in the Gmin Chamber and said that if the Great Britain failed to get out of the EU, there will be a "castrophical loss of confidence in our political system".
"If we organize a referendum that votes in 30 million people and 66% of them will appear behind the remaining United Kingdom in the European Union, they will remain ten million citizens," said the Minister.
Even if this is the result that ignores 99% of them, we will have 100,000 angry people who will write to their messenger and who won't let go.
You don't have much to see in the street soon.
One of the principal ministers of the office added that the country is threatened by a “violent social breakdown” if the result of the first referendum is questioned by the second.
Johnson called for the organizing of general elections where the voters should decide on the fate of brexite.
According to the reports, the Prime Minister is at risk of the rebellion of the office to reduce the demands for brexite and to achieve a compromise agreement with the EU.
The Hospital, Chebovna, and Krosny were admired in Krakow.
Follow us Talk'N'Roll
More than 300 participants listened on Thursday (September 26) 11 inspiring events of prelegents, including Simon Hollownia, Chebovna Christina, or Ireneus Krosny.
It's all in the Talk'N'Roll conference, which has been held in Krakow for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Enlargement of horizons, talks about the ideas worthy of audience and joint discussions that can become a impulse to further development.
This is the goal of organizers of the Talk'N'Roll conference, inviting 11 special prelegents, representing very different sectors and areas of interest, including people known as the media - Simeon Holovna, Chebovna and Ireneus Crosh.
This year's Talk'N'Roll edition has been "Crafting the future, NOW" and the guests invited to participate in the conference have focused on the future.
The first session was opened by the director of Sabre Poland, Sebastian Drevicki, who told us how the mark that is built around us may have an impact on our future.
Richard Lucas went to the scene to change the public's perception of the phenomenon of rejection, saying that it should be accepted if he wanted to create the future, and Chris Badura took the subject of empathy in the age of bright technological development.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) shared observations and techniques that could help to manage career and increase the overall satisfaction by finding a proper balance between professional and private life.
The second part of the conference opened a multiangle conversation with Cristina Chebovna, which, inter alia, told us how the profession of a teacher in Poland changed from its perspectives in the ages.
The owner of one of the most popular votes in the country admitted that, thanks to technology development, everyone today can get difficult with this profession.
However, he does not think that, in the next years, a doctor’s position will be completely replaced by technology.
Right after it, Peter Nabelec took the problem of life in the time of information, emotional, or overloading the choice, giving public valuable instructions, how to deal with it, and Luke Lutoch in his appearance spoke about what another industrial revolution, known as "Project 4.0".
Enjoying Learning, Teaching Fun
The conference organizers also took care of artistic impressions, inviting an illusionist, Daniel Oneak.
The third part of the conference was opened by Ireneus Krosny, who first played the public with pantonym, and then, in his own career example, told him how he was trying to maintain the right balance between the career in the scene and his private life.
He also abducted the participants by Simon Hollownia, emphasizing primarily the role of time in our lives.
The publicist noted that even two minutes can diameterally change the situation and have to be ready to use this time.
Furthermore, Holevna shared its thoughts about the surrounding reality, calling on the anecdotes that could have caused a smile on the faces of the viewers.
Then the scene appeared by Adrian Tvoruška, who reviewed the history and goals of several innovation models and linked them to how they are being used now.
At the end of Marcin Slovak, on Rubik's cube, he told me about the approach to addressing problems.
Each of the 11 representatives certainly introduced something new in seeing the reality of all who had the opportunity to look at the performances, and natural responses and numerous questions to guests show a great public involvement.
The organizers provided a transmission to all who could not personally participate in the event, and the tapes from the lectures are available on the website.
Governments of law instead of law governments.
“In spite of the lack of sufficient numbers of votes to change the Constitution, the governing majority has introduced a number of changes in the state system, creating threats to the protection of law and the rule of the three divisions of power”, states the Helsinese Human Rights Fund published on Thursday.
The report “Rules of law instead of law governments” documents, inter alia, changes in justice and basic protection of rights and freedom.
The Helsinese Human Rights Fund (HFPC) published a report on Thursday entitled “Rules of Law instead of the governments of law.
Threats for the protection of human rights in Poland in 2015-2019."
The Fund estimates that the largest regression in the protection of human rights in Poland was recorded in 2015-2019 after 1989.
“In spite of the lack of sufficient numbers of votes to change the Constitution, the governing majority has introduced a number of changes in the state system, creating threats to the protection of law and the principle of the three division of the authority.
With the right to political goals, the governments have been replaced by law," HFPC experts write.
What's in the HFPC report?
The report documents changes in the functioning of justice, independent institutions (such as public media or Civil Rights Order) and in the field of protection of fundamental rights and freedom (including the freedom of assembly, the rights of women, the rights of persons of LGBT and the right to a credible process).
The report also summarizes a three-year dispute between Polish authorities and the European Union.
"In the last four years, for the first time and to this extent, we have observed the use of the right to implement participating parties' interests.
This has been transferred to the ongoing crisis of law, as well as to weakening the entire human rights protection system in Poland," the lawyer Marcin Free, one of the report's authors, stressed.
Protection of Human Rights
As indicated in the report, the last four years are “the period of systematic changes both in the country” and “in the protection of human rights”.
In the last four years, Seim has adopted more than 20 key legal acts in terms of human rights protection.
“The changes were often adopted in a rapid rate, without social consultations and despite the observations of the legal environment, the Civil Rights Guide or the international organisations”, translated by a lawyer of Malgorzata Schuleka, a co-autor of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed over the past four years are: “the weakness of independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), the disrespect of the binding judgments of courts and recommendations of international institutions and the weakening of the guarantee of protection of human rights”.
State authorities have not responded
The Helsinese Human Affairs Foundation has considered “the situations in which the authorities have not responded or simply ignored the occurring cases of aggression”.
The fund experts have noted that some changes were introduced in the atmosphere of attacks on specific institutions or professional groups or groups in the risk of discrimination.
The Foundation indicates that the result of State activity in restricting the rules of law is the ongoing dispute of Polish authorities with the European Union, as well as a series of recommendations by international law entities.
"The lack of implementation of these recommendations does not only weaken the position of Poland as a leader of democratic changes in the Central and Eastern region, but also threatens the Polish State to be responsible for the violation of the law of the European Union or of the European Convention of Human Rights," we read in the report.
Brother of Pakistan's social media star with life for honourable murder
Women's rights experts argue that the investigation of justice is often difficult because of the prolonged proceedings, the release of suspected killers behind bail and the loss of awareness of the public opinion.
"It's so long that people forget," says Farzana Bari, the defender of women's rights and the founder in Pakistan of the Gender Study Department at the university, and adds that even a widely reported case of Baloch's murder has been resolved for over three years.
Although, according to the groups fighting for women's rights, genuine data are difficult to determine, the Pakistani Commission on Human Rights in 2018 found at least 300 cases of honourable murders.
Many activists argue that the real number is much higher, and the network promoting awareness of crimes from honourable motives considers that in Pakistan there is about one-fifth of 5,000 honourable murders committed every year throughout the world.
Records of Polish earnings abroad
However, the transmissions to the country are smaller, because many emigrants are sitting outside Poland permanently, says the Friday Richpospolita.
The latest Euro-Tax report indicates that the average profits of the Polish employees in other countries of Europe amounted to more than 8.6 thousand evil in 2018, which means that they increased almost a thousand gold, which is almost 12%.
Euro-Tax “assess that the total income of Polish emigrant emigrants in the Union has reached a record value of 154,5 billion of evil in 2018, one seven more than a year earlier”, we read.
Director of the Centre for Research on the Migrations of the University of Warsaw, Paul Kačmarczyk says that the Poles are getting better at the international labour market where they use various options available.
"The number of specialists and experts also grows, who are moving from the country to the country as well as international corporate workers," the newspaper reports.
Part of Euro-Tax clients work in two countries over the year, e.g. Great Britain and Germany.
“This is the most in RFN in 2018, because by 11%, the total income of Polish emigrants (to nearly 27 billion zls) increased.
However, the Polish has earned most of them on the islands – almost 35 billion evils," we read on.
The President of Euro-Tax believes that despite improving the conditions of work on the Polish market, the number of emigrant emigrants is not smaller.
Because the saxes in the West and north of Europe (headed by Norway) are often the chance of a few times higher earning than in Poland.
"And even at the minimum rates in the country, which, for example, are 9,5-11.7 euros per hour," reports the Journal.
“Recpopopolita” indicates that the Poles remain not only because of higher earnings but also because they have accommodated abroad.
Many Polands are leaving abroad roots, which are also seen after small cash transfers to the country.
Those last year were the lowest years.
As the Economist Recalls Tadeus Chrosticki, with the extension of a foreign time, there is a small group of people transferring money to the country and their height is reduced.
“Emmigrants are bringing their loved ones to each other, ” we read in Friday’s "Rachpospolite".
The prolonged monsunes cause floods and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India has been extended for almost a month, and the unexpected rainfall causes death as a result of the displacement of buildings and the gnost of many gains.
Usually, in northern India, monsun declines at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall in this month exceeded 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation continues for the next few days, it will be the most late ending monsun since decades.
In many areas of the country, rainfall is still unprecedented – in recent times in the West of India, the city of Pune, and the Thursdays, the oil rain, has led to several people to die and to desolate the destruction of buildings.
There was a sewage of houses, people screwed through the streets in water to their knees, which normally happens only during the monsune apogeum.
Many rainfalls also occurred in cities such as Calcutta, Lucknow and Hajdarabad.
Because of long-term rain in the north of Uttarakhand, many homes have been destroyed.
Monsun also started delaying.
In many areas there was no water, so farmers were preparing for a probably dry.
The long-term monsun is not welcomed by farmers.
The amount of rain is not normal at this time of the year.
"With this, my vegetables – and now I have a bovine, bovine, and tomatoes – will rot," said Prakash Mehr, a farmer from a small household in Bhimtal, Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the impact of the delayed and the late ending monsune is an increase in the price of a лук, which is an unnecessary ingredient of Indian food.
The cebula, for which it was usually required to pay 20 rupies (0.23 pounds) is currently worth 80 rupies (approximately 1 pound) per kilogram in cities such as Delhi and Bombai.
The festivals and holidays are also in danger.
Another big festival is Dasara's 8 October holiday, during which the Indians rise huge dolls like the comicles, representing Ravana, a form of bull whiskey and a vicious smile from the Romanian epos.
Ravana's smoking symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, given that Ravana's images were made of paper, if monsun continues, Ravana will be the last laugh.
Implementation of the Energosynergia Technology Sp. z o.o. in restructuring
On 27 September 2019, the Fund’s bank account was affected by the Sales of 26.843 shares in the Energosynergia Technology Sp. z o.o. in the restructuring of 100.000 evils.
Thus, the property of these shares went to INDOS S.A. with the Horzova seat.

Looks like a little bit, even though it's only gonna be measured tonight.
Doodle celebrates the 21st birthday of Google
It would be hard to imagine the world without Google today.
In the search engine, we're looking for answers to all our troubled questions.
What are we looking for in Google?
"What is this?", "Where?", "How?" and "How?" are one of the favorite categories searched by the Poles.
The giant data show that last year we were willing to ask about this, "Where is the storm?", "How do you make sparags?" and "How many fingers have a horse?", "How can we get rid of the fruit mush?", "How to eat some kind?"
Today, the search engine cares about the first twenty-first birthday.
Her users – and in Poland up to 96 percent of people are using Google's Uncle – welcome a special Google Doodle today.
He's not animated this time.
Google reminds of his birthday, showing a steady computer with a monitor, mouse and keyboard, and in the right, bottom corner, a digital date was printed -- as in the picture of the 1990s.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
The search engine was set up for a specific purpose – she had to catalog all the information available and to share it through the Internet.
Her name is a word game.
It comes from the mathematical term of googol that means the number of ten raised to the 100 power.
This name was also intended to reflect the intentions of the company to index as much as possible of the world's internet resources.
The Google searcher was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1996 in their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the dependency between parties, which worked better than the methods of normal segregation of results based on frequency of the occurrence of the phrase.
At the beginning, the search engine was named BlackRub, which refers to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages linking to the result.
Page and Brin founded a company operating under Google Inc. on September 7, 1998, and soon later launched the famous google.com page today.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, in the "PC Magazine" information appears about the extremely properness of Google's search results.
Then the story of the company looks almost like a tale - a lightning development with every month, a defeat of the further markets and an increase in the company's value.
In June 2000, Google's URL index has over a billion positions, which makes the work of Page and Brina gain the name of the largest Internet search engine in the world.
Currently, the company founded by Page and Brina is one of the leading IT players.
So, is there any other fields for development?
"Google's mission is to organize global information resources to be widely available and useful, although we have made huge progress in this area, it is a long way to achieve this goal," Peter Zalewski from Google Polsk provided in the conversation with Newsweek.
Common contact with pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and brain failure
A new study suggests that working with the risk of contact with plant protection in large concentrations may be a high risk of heart failure in later years of life.
This happened in the Japanese group of Americans in Hawaii, who have been studied for over 30 years.
Scientists found that, in comparison with men who did not work with plant protection, those who had the largest contact with them were 45% more risked to heart disease or infarction.
“This study emphasizes the need to use personal protection equipment during contact with pesticides at work and the importance of recording in medical contact with such measures in work, as well as the control of standard factors that increase in heart diseases”, said Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez, co-autor.
She is a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in the district of Manoa.
The results are based on data on more than 6,000 men on Oahu, who participated in the cardiological program Kuakini Honolulu.
As scientists indicated, the results of the research may not apply to women and other populations, as it only affected Japanese men.
Pesticides have a long half-decline period, so the effects of their health effects can be known for many years after contacting these substances.
In this case, the most visible results have been observed within 10 years after the contact with plant protection substances.
“ After 34 years of men’s observation, “the relationship between the exposure to pesticides and heart diseases was no longer significant. ”
It was likely because more important factors of age have become that masked possible cause-effective relations between the exposure to pesticides and the incidence of the diseases of the circulation system in the past years of life.
Students have not discovered a significant relationship between exposures in small to moderate plant protection and increased the risk of heart disease or infarction.
Telephone call Zelenski-Trump: Rassenko delivers its three money
The Washington policy has a broken week in connection with the initiation of an immeachment procedure against American President Donald Trump
Involving a political scandal, it is for the political debiutant Volodymire of the Zelenian situation that he would prefer to avoid.
But what do we really know about Zelensky-Trump's affair and will she have far-reached effects for the first of them?
Almost at the introduction of the telephone conversation, Trump announced to Zelenski that the United States have done more for Ukraine than for European countries.
Despite the fact that the notes revealed by the White House are not full, they detailed the Trump attack on the Chancellor Germany Angela Merkel for the fact that the German leader and other leaders of the European countries are engaged in negotiations instead of presenting specific proposals.
The controversy raised the Zelensky answer, which said that it agreed with Trump not in 100%, but in 1000%.
Zelensky added that both French President Macron and Merkel are trying to help Ukraine in an insufficient way.
This exchange of opinions made politicians, especially from the Ukrainian opposition, decided to vote through social services.
Petro Poroszenko, former President of Ukraine, said on Twitter that the EU's support was "without precedent".
In other tweets, Possenko said he was grateful for the support of the EU's sanctions and financial assistance granted during the “Russian aggression”.
Others expressed their concerns, including Ukrainian politician Victoria Voytsitska, said: “How can we talk to Germany and France now? ”
Then Trump mentioned military aid and asked Zlenski to investigate not in one and two cases: the first one on Joe Biden's son – Hunter – and the other relating to the invasion of DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in a hacker attack on the e-mail boxes of Democrats during the elections in 2016.
It is not known whether this will break European relations or will make relations with the leader of France and Germany break.
I don't want to talk wrong about anyone...
We thank all those who are helping us," he announced after the publication of the Zelensky telephone call in New York during the United Nations General Assembly.
Zelensky is to meet the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the nearing summit of Normandian Four, which is to take place in October.
The former military inspector has been authorized to dismiss.
The court cleared George Wiśniewski from his deeds.
After six years, Jerzy Wisnewski was finally cleared from the charges.
The Industrial Court has cleared the former Chief of the Army Inspector of Quality Trade Articles of Agriculture and Food in Rheshowa, for the charge of the oversight of powers.
The Lubel Prosecutor claimed that he would betray the former marshal of the warden's time for control in the food oil plant.
A prosecutor's jurisdiction has recently fallen in this case.
The appeal was recognized on September 12th.
“The Court has maintained an accused conviction,” confirms Judge Malgorzata Reizer, the Prosecutor of the District Court in the Industry.
This is about the sentence of 14 February, issued by the Regional Court in the Industry.
Jeri Wisnewski then commented on him on Facebook: “It was six years since I presented the Appeal Prosecutor in Lublin the prosecution of the apparent violation of law in the telephone conversation with Marshall of Podkarpacki Military on 30 April 2012.
The Court clearly stated that I was innocent, and I did not break the law in force at that time.
I was convinced that my telephone conversation with the Marshal of the Podkarpacki Army was in line with the law.
The version of the events published in 2013 by the Appeal Prosecutor in Lublina has passed along with the truth and has caused inadequate damage to both the food manufacturer and the loss of the image of my person in my employers, among workers and in the local community.
The Act of the Prosecution, which was made to me in the Court's opinion, contained a number of errors, false facts, incorrect legal definitions, which were not actually confirmed.
With the help of CBA in Rzesha, I was done everything to eliminate me from public and professional life.
Then I was immediately released from work and exempted from the funds.
I've been staying for a long time to keep my wife."
Let's remind you.
The Wisnewski function of the military quality inspector of agricultural and foodstuffs was carried out in the period 2009-2013.
He was revoked after the Attorney's office in Lublin in 2013 filed his charges.
According to investigators, he would in a telephone conversation betray the former marshal of the military (Miroslav Karapita was sentenced to four years of liberation) the date of control in the food oil plant of the wife of the subcarpatic vice-marshal.
This warning – as the prosecutors from Lublin said – was to cause the company's owner to know about control and correct the labels on oils that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wisnewski heard the accusations of the violations of powers, which threatened him to be released for up to three years.
"I feel relief that this case has finally reached the end and the court confirms my innocence.
From the beginning, I was convinced that I had not done anything wrong, which now the final confirmation is the lawful sentence that dismissed me from my charges," commented Jerzy Wisnewski.
The White House was trying to hide a conversation record with the Zelenian.
On Thursday, the newly revised signal report wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking to the President of Ukraine, Volodymir Zelensky, was looking for an alien state's involvement in the US elections, and the White House was trying to hide the record of this conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the United States
In an anonymous report dated on August 12th, a signalist who is likely an interviewer, he wrote: “In the context of my service obligations, I was informed by many members of the US government that the president used his function to demand foreign interference in the elections in 2020 in the United States.”
“Trump has used a part of the conversation (s Greenland) to implement its own interests.
And exactly – he tried to push the Ukrainian leader to take steps that would help the President to reelect in 2020," the report quoted by the The Hill Journal.
The Ukrainian leader was given to understand that contacts with Trump are dependent on whether “If I wish to take a game” in the cases that the President Rudy Giuliani's lawyer would inform him more accurately.
The author admits that he was not a witness to the conversation, but stresses that he was detailed on its content by “a number of officials of the White House who had direct information on this subject” and their relationships covered.
"In the next days of this conversation, I learned from many American officials that the high rank representatives of the White House intervened in order to "accumulate" all the archive records of this conversation , and in particular the literal record that was made, as it is usually done, in the White House's crisis peace , we read further.
"A high rank of White House officials told me that the White House's lawyers' ordered them to remove an electronic record from the information system where such records are stored.
The record was transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store and manipulate information particularly confidential,” wrote the author of the report.
"In my opinion, these steps indicate that White House officials were aware of the weight of what happened during the conversation," the signalist estimated.
As the AP commented, this document may accelerate the procedure on the possible impeachment of the President, and also includes valuable information on witnesses who can confirm this relationship.
The record of the conversation with the Green White House, after the pressures of the Congress, made available on Wednesday, but not on the basis of the electronic record, but on the basis of the relationship of those who were witnesses.
The report's content, in the edited version, revealed a day later the Commission of the Representation Chamber.
Also on Thursday, the responsibility of the director of the U.S. Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the Committee of the Representation Chamber and made explanations on the way he treated the intelligence officer's report.
Maguire said that the signalist made the right choice and did what the law orders.
He also emphasized that his views that the case of talk with Zelenian was “without precedents. ”
The Democrats in the Intelligence Commission asked Maguire why he blocked the accession to the Congress of the Signalist Report; the Intelligence Director replied that he had no power to disclose his content, which the confidential nature guarantees the privilege of the implementing authority.
Part of Maguire's interrogation by the committee took place behind the closed door.
On Tuesday, the President of the Representation Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, informed that, in the light of the suspicion that the President had pressures on the authorities of Ukraine to injure his potential rival in the next presidential elections, the Chamber of Representatives would initiate an investigation that could lead to Trump's impeachment.
A day later, she evaluated that the Trump's conversation record with Zielen confirms that the President of the United States has broken the standards for elections and security.
The U.S. Electoral Law prohibits the use of foreign aid.
The resort of justice, however, evaluated that the president did not break the election law. On Thursday, the prosecutor of the White House, Stephanie Grisham, said that there was no "nothing wrong" in the conversation, and in the report, "There is nothing more than a collection of third-hand relationships and the joint press cuts."
"The White House will continue to criticize this media hystery and false narration promoted by the media of the main nurt," she added.
Ghana wins two ICAO prizes
Ghana won two prestigious awards during the 40-year period. The International Civil Aviation Organization Assembly (ICAO) in Montreal, Canada.
The security award was granted to the proof of Ghana's highest number of air safety points in Africa, i.e. 89.89 per cent of the provisional Implementation rate (EI).
It happened when the ICAO completed its ICVM control on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the General Audit Programme of the Aviation Control of the United Nations Aviation Agency.
The safeguard prize was proof of the recognition of the country's high involvement in implementing the ICAO standards and protocols for protection in airports and in Ghana airspace.
The award programme was developed to provide support for the ICAO initiative No Country Leve Behind.
Furthermore, the ICAO Member States which have improved their safety and protection standards have been granted 16 other safety certificates and 17 in the field of protection.
During the rewards for Ghana, the Minister of Airport, Joseph Kofi Adda, Director-General of the Civil Airport Office of Ghana, Simon Allotey, Ambassador Ghana in Canada, Nii Ayikoi Otoo and Director of Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa.
The President of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olumuyiva Benard Aliu, stressed in his speech the need to maintain security in the airspace by Member States.
He stated “it is important that we keep reminding ourselves that even in the innovation of the security of safety and sustainable development must remain our primary priorities”.
On his own, Mr. Adda observed that the awards were a huge achievement for the efforts of the State, because they are a complement to the hard work and sustainability of the industry.
He also added that the airport industry has an enormous potential for the development of the country's economy, saying “Aviation has powerful opportunities to change our lives.
These are social and economic benefits, but everything comes from security and protection that we have achieved."

Trump nominates Peter Gaynor for head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, who serves as the Federal Director of the Crisis Agency (FEMA), smiles when he testifies at the meeting of the Senatic Budget Subcommittee on National Security on the proposal for the FEMA for the financial year 2020 at the Capital Hill in Washington, USA, April 3, 2019.
WASZYNGTON (Reuters) – The White House announced that the US President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor as the head of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA) on Thursday.
Gaynor, Deputy Administrator of FEMA, serves as the head of the agency, which controls the government's response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The Agency has operated without the administrator approved by the American Senate since March, when Brock Long released this position.
Long quit after the Department of National Security of the United States, which belongs to FEMA, concluded that Long was in the wrong way to use government vehicles to travel between Washington and its home in Northern Carolina.
Another candidate for this position, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn earlier this month, when the exact verification of his past revealed the charges that he was involved in a fight in the bar.
Gaynor's nomination was expected for this position.
In order to approve his nomination for this role, most of the Senate will be required.
The White House notified that before Gaynor became a Deputy Administrator of FEMA in 2018, he worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served in marine marine.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, Norwegian Runner, considers his finger amputation
The 28-year-old runner specialized at the distance of 1500 meters, gaining a gold medal of Europe's championships in 2012 (Helsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and brown in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also the Vice-Master of Europe, 5000 meters from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that it was not a new surveillance and that he had already passed one operation immediately after the games in 2016, but the pains returned and the current season has been very serious.
The pain makes me put my foot differently, which changes my body's system, other unnatural burdens, and I start to feel pain in other places, such as in the bowl.
For this reason, I couldn't prepare myself enough for the world's championships, and for two weeks pain is so strong that I have difficulties with laying rings, said the runner on the NRC channel.
The father and coach of Gjert Ingebrigtsen admitted that after long discussions with their son, they concluded that the only solution to not finish his career and participate in the future Olympic games in Tokyo would be amputation.
Looks like it's the only one, although a drastic solution and a decision has already fallen.
"If part of the body hurts, it should be removed, and in general, Henrik does not need that finger so much, and in this situation, it should be forgotten of a cosmetical asspection," he explained.
The police close the illegal e-paper factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley – CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) – On Thursday the police closed an illegal e-paper factory with marihuana in the San Gabriel Valley.
The office building standing at 9600 Telstar Avenue, about 16:37, was launched, while the police were looking for illegal e-papers for sale containing marihuana and in which large slores containing a butan hashish oil were found – concentrate from Indian cannabis.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano, El Monte police officers also found a device used to complement vacuum contributions.
“This process is very dangerous”, says Cano.
Cano, who once worked with drugs, says that distillation of oil used in vaping products is a potentially easy process.
"The ordinary electrostatic spark of our clothes can cause the burning of these ovens, not only caused a fire, but because of concentration, even explosion," he says.
"If we have a lot of sloes in the room and similar, after one explosion, another will occur, causing not only fire, but also an explosion that could remove the entire complex from the surface.
The office has been called for a special task team to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
The value of confiscated products and equipment is not currently known.
Detectives say they received an anonymous instruction that allowed them to get a search warrant, thus detecting illegal activity.
The investigators are still trying to get information about who's behind this illegal business.
They say the responsible person has established a business in this place because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing and the officers want to ensure that illegal products have not reached the street, taking into account the recent articles on vacation damage.
"The people really don't know what products they buy," says Cano.
“They may be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This may be a threat to our community and children, so we always keep them from reaching this kind of thing.
Aphtin withdrawn from the traffic.
GIF has taken a decision against the medicinal product to the spleens
The Chief Pharmaceutical Inspector has informed the withdrawal of oral infection.
Aphtin is a medicinal product that is used for the treatment of blisters and infections of the oral slippery infections with Gram-additional bacteria.
It can also be used in helpful treatment of infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginos.
The product has been withdrawn due to incompatibility with the requirements of quality specimen and the decline of the active substance.
The product was withdrawn at the request of the Galen Laboratory in Olsten.
Each month, GIF shall make an average number of decisions on the withdrawal of individual series of products from the market.
A series of medicinal products stopped in the traffic in Poland can be reintroduced once evidence of safety to use it.
There is no such possibility if you withdraw your medicine.
Banknot 19 zl – where to buy a collection banknote about this nominal?
He has a nominal of 19 goldes and has a picture of Ignacho Paderewski.
At the beginning of October, the new collection banknote will be introduced to the circulation – the National Bank of Poland informed.
It's another "Independence" banknote.
He will remember the 100th year of the formation of Polish Making of Securities Papers.
According to the NBP communication, the Ignacy Jan Paderewski will be presented on the banknote.
The date set on the banknote, 25 January 2019, is the day of the 100th anniversary of the PWW.
Also the nominal value, 19 zls, refers to the year of creation of the manufacturer" - we read in the NBP communication.
The water mark presents the image of the eagle from the first Polish banknote produced in the PWW after the recovery of independence.
The news is a holographic belt located on the window in the floor.
The front page presents the portrait of Ignacego Paderewski, and next to the inscription “unsubscribed”, a view of the order of the White Eagle was styled.
This subscription, reflected in Joseph Pilsudski's manuscript, is a logotype of the 100-year-old independence trades by Poland.
In a branch of vaurin, symbolising brotherhood and victory, the security developed by PWW - Umbra4Note, which is a special form of angle effect.
On the reverse page of the banknote, the image of the production gmash has been placed on the background of modern Warsaw panorama.
Besides, it is embedded in the PWPW logotyp security of SPARK Live and the burning belt, also visible in the UV light as a repeated number of "19" and "NBP" - describes NBP.
The banknot is to enter the circuit on 2 October to 55,000 pieces.
One banknote will cost 80 gold.
All monetary and banknotes emitted by NBP, including those from special series, are a legal payment in Poland.
However, their nominal value is significantly higher than the one that can be achieved in the collection market.
The new owner bought it for $500,000, which is over two million gold, for his parents, and decided to move the building to Queenstown, Maryland.
The house was transported on a special platform to the Easton port where it was loaded on the bar.
He's swimming 50 miles from there.
Jaroslav Kaczynski votes at the Margorzata Gosijew
The President of PS Jaroslav Kaczynski will vote at the arrivals of the Margorzata Gosijew.
“Please, please, ” he appealed.
Jaroslav Kaczynski and Malgorzata Gosijewski poisoned a baner candidate of PS.
On Friday, warsaw's “three ” praised in the social media that it was the one who gained the Kachinski voice in parliamentary elections.
"The President of the Law and Justice, Prime Minister Jaroslav Kaczynski, supports the Margorzata Gosijewska," we read on her Facebook profile.
The party's boss noted that he is a sensitive, sensitive person and is always willing to provide help.
"I will give my voice to the Małgorzat of Gosijew, and I ask for the same," she appeals.
Gossiewska candidates to the Seim of the 19th District (Warszawa) and from the third place on the list.
The "one" is the Caczynski itself, and the second place is the Major Kaminsky.
Here comes the Christmas Trags of Books.
We're in front of meeting with popular writers and books at extraordinary prices.
"We are here to break stereotypes.
The inhabitants of Podcarpacia say they don't read books.
We will show that it's different," said Marta Halftour at the press conference.
And who will support the readership in Rzesha this year?
As we heard, sister Anastasia, who was cried by the first cook of Reality, will appear on the markets, as well as: Luke Orbitowski, Katherine Bonda, Carolina Corwin-Piotrowska and Jacob Čwiek.
This autumn in Millennium Hall will take place a great cultural event – 22 and 23 November to the Trade Centre, 3th edition of the Christmas Trade of the Book, which is one of the most important reading events in the region.
The most interesting publishing and book officials from Poland will come to the market.
They will be 30, and among them will be Agora, SQN, PWN and Black.
At their positions, they will present their broad publishing offers and hundreds of book news that marketers will be able to buy at attractive prices.
Furthermore, during two days of trade, there will be special meetings with writers.
This time, the authors were invited to write about important matters and not afraid of taking difficult topics, and they're also prestigious awards and... they're great cooking.
The invitated author list is not closed yet.
At this point, the participation in the markets confirmed, namely, Luke Orbitowski, the Laureat of Political Passport, Janusz Leon Wisnewski, the bestseller author of "Something in the network", and the Queen of the Polish Crime itself: Katherine Bonda.
This year's market star will be the sister Anastasia, author of several books (including cooks), which sold in more than 4 million copies.
Exhibition of the missing Elizabeth dress I in the Hampton Court Palace
The silver clothing made of the most famous silk camlot was architected by the hafts presenting vegetation, animals and butterflies.
For Eleri Lynn, the exhibitor of the Historic Royal Palaces, it was only one thing.
A black tissue hanging for 100 years on the wall of a small rural parafial church she was looking at, could only be a missing part of Elizabeth's clothing I.
Three years after Lynn encountered a case of exhibited altar cloth in Bacton in Herefordshire County, the missing Elizabet's dress was to hit the Hampton Court next month, near the same rooms in which the Queen of Tudors could wear it over 450 years ago.
The importance of this discovery is that the entire collection of royal dresses survived only another element of the XVI - century dress.
Although there is no unexpected evidence that Elizabeth was ever wearing this dress, three years of research have strengthened experts in the belief that she had to be part of the royal dress.
“The silver, ” incredibly the road fabric, was legally reserved only for the most important members of the Royal Court, and the virtuozer quality of the hafted plants and flowers, later enriched by deer, dogs, butterflies, fishers and bears, indicates that the clothing belonged to the most famous of people.
The dress, while it was sewed, could cost the equivalent of the Tudor property.
"After, in the 1990s, the end of Elizabeth's rule, she felt the threat of other women in the court and would not tolerate the rivals of such artificial fabric," says Lynn.
"As this is a very important statement, I have asked many people from the environment to look at their dresses.
I was really delighted to see the dress, and they also admired it, and they were practically convinced that we have the element of the royal dress.
A long, re-life dress cut to serve as an altar cloth in the dark church of St Faith in Bacton is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is the settlement from which Blanche Parry came from, the nearest lady of the court Elizabeth, who served the queen for her entire long life, and with which the local legends were identified by the tissue.
Although the dress was created after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth had to give it to Parry's family or the parish to the memory of Blanche before her death in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of maintenance work, four hundred passed on the largest manual sewage with specially painted silk and thin surgery needles, the altar fabric will be presented on an exhibition next to the exhibition of the Hatfield House of the “Rainbow Portrait” portrait, one of the most famous images of the Elizabeth dressed in a similar dress.
"When working with historical tissues, it really starts to respect the council of people who have done it," says Libby Thompson, the chief of the maintenance work, whose majority has been carried out in the processed glass in the Hampton Court Palace – the only large enough place to place some of the precious palace gobelins.
"When I looked in front and back, I began to feel great respect for those who did it.
I've never worked on something so elite.
The "The Lost Dress of Elizabeth" exhibition will begin on October 12th in the Hampton Court Palace
Fitch has confirmed Poland's rating with a stable perspective
The Fitch Agency confirmed the long-term rating of Poland at the foreign currency at the A- level, as indicated in the communication.
The rating perspective remains stable.
"The Fitch Agency pointes to strong macroeconomic and well-diversified economies, which is supported by reasonably implemented economic policy and the strong banking sector," the Ministry of Finance reports.
Fitch also noted that Poland was at the top of the conjunctive cycle, and in the 2019-2021 real growth rate of the Brutto National Product in Poland would be 4,1 per cent, 3.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent.
The Agency predicts that the deficit of the government and government sector to GDP in 2020-2021 will remain below 3 per cent, respectively 2.3 per cent and 1.9 per cent.
“The debt rate of the government and self-governmental sector to GDP will be 50.5 per cent in 2019 and will be less (average 48.3 per cent in the period 2020-2021), we read.
Revaluation of Polish
The autumn round of Polish rating reviews will end on 11 October S&P and Moody's.
The rating of Poland in Fitch's assessment remains the same as it was issued at the end of March 2019.
At that time, the Agency confirmed the Polish rating at the A- level with a stable perspective.
Among the three largest credit rating agencies, Poland's credit credibility estimates the Moody's at the A2 level.
Polish rating according to Fitch and S&P is "A-", one level below Moody's.
The perspectives of all evaluations are stable.
What's the rating?
The rating agencies shall develop to assist investors in assessing the risk of their investment activities.
The rating is granted to companies, banks and countries.
In these recent cases, each assessment is translated into economic attraction.
Rating is nothing but a credit credibility assessment.
On the basis of it, the decision is made to who and how to loan money.
Sometimes such information also suggests that the best thing to do is not pay any loans at all, because it is a risk that money can't be recovered.
The lower rating is associated with a higher risk.
In turn, higher risks are high credit rates.
Each assessment must be justified and arranged.
The rating can be manipulated, but in this case, the agencies risk loss of reputation.
At this point, more than 90% of the global rating service market controls three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of them uses its own assessment system.
“Further Friday of the Confederation: First 1,000 plus
“Fiveth of the Confederation”, which is the main foundations of the election programme, presented the candidates in Koshalina to the Seym of County of 40 requesting a mandate from the KW list of the Confederation of Freedom and Independence.
The Leader of the Koshalian Letter to the Seme of Christof Chmilewski presented the passwords “Five of the Confederation”.
"The first program 1000 plus for Poland, secondly fast and fair courts, third cultural bon and educational bon, after fourth national security, it is a healthy life," said Chmelewski.
He noted that “Polaci must finally start making worthy money”, which is why the Confederation wants to eliminate the income tax and, as Chmilewski said, “the problem with a free amount of tax itself will be resolved”.
"The Polands must make a choice where they want to save their money for retirement, which is zero PIT and voluntary ZUS for all," said the leader of the list on the foundations of the "program 1000 plus for Poland".
However, Alexandra Zadencka, starting from the second place of the letter, referring to the programming password “healthy life”, said that“ food is increasingly worse” and that should be “promoted by Polish farmers, Polish agriculture” to act for free of GMO.
As she said, the Confederation also calls for the cessation of “stygmatization of seed ropes. ”
Zadenska declared the support of the Confederation for “the development of the construction of natural raw materials”.
She also spoke on behalf of her grouping for “the voluntary vaccinations. ”
"The right to consent cannot be broken," she added.
The other candidates to the Seima from the Coshalian District emphasized that the Confederation is behind the “depth reform of the judiciary”, which would be the element of the examination of the case by the judge “day after day”.
They have also agreed to ensure that educational subsidy reaches schools without the intermediary of the authorities, which, according to them, without additional costs related to the maintenance of officials.
The Confederation is also “a strong Polish army based on Polish industry and Polish soldiers”.
The candidates to Seima stressed the need to increase the number of armies.
They also say that we need easier access to weapons.
In economic matters, they emphasized the need for “permanent access to energy”.
"We can gasify the coal, we have a lot of geothermal energy, and we also need to consider returning to the idea of the nuclear power plant," said Peter Karpinski, the fifth list.
The chief of the Mexican cartel stands for one third of the drugs in the United States
Chicago – just after the sunrise in the West Side in Chicago CBS News reported an early drug chase.
Brian McKnight from the Office for Drugs (DEA) showed in full light what is going on.
In Chicago last year, nearly 800 people died of drug overdose.
McKnight said "probably 90%" drugs in Chicago is from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the mexican drug lord Nemesio Cervantesia, known just as El Mencho.
"It is the most important priority for the DEA and directly for the federal Executive Body in the United States," said Matthew Donahue, chief DEA agent in Mexico.
The El Mencho award is $10 million.
He helped to discover the dozens placed in the jungle of El Mencho drug laboratories.
It belongs to El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generation, CJNG, is responsible for at least one third of the drugs that reach the United States by land and seaway.
According to the Department of Justice, the cartel has transfused “tonnes” of cocaine, metamphetamine and heroin polluted by fentanyl.
El Mencho's head is waiting for a 10-million-dollar prize.
For irony, he lived in California about 30 years ago, where he was arrested for drug charges and finally deported to Mexico.
That's where he created a brutal cartel.
He has a huge amount of weapons, RPG, caliber 50.
In general, he has its own SWAT teams," Donahue added.
El Mencho has no punishment to protect his empire, using such measures as the shooting of a helicopter of the Mexican army, killing six people or participation in public hanging this summer.
In recent years, the brutality of the cartel led to thousands of murders.
According to the statistics of the Mexican government, there are about 94 murders every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that they cannot be handled without protective equipment.
In the lab, the cocaine package is marked by a conveyor.
For more than one third of them, the leads to the El Mencho cartel.
"He is responsible for sending a poison that kills innocent women and children," said Donahue.
So when someone dies, Donahue says there is a “great chance ” that drugs come from the El Mencho organization.
Over 67,000 Americans died from overdose last year.
France: 27-year-old blackmailed President of France and his wife
A 27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macron and the first lady – says the French prosecutor.
The accused shall ensure that he has documents compromised by the presidential couple.
He demanded from the head of the state, including 300,000 euros in cash.
A man who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work in the police in France claims that he received "explosive" documents from the person employed in the Elise Palace.
During the interrogations, he explained that these documents not only compromise the presidential pair, but the exhibition of them entirely could even threaten the safety of Macron and the First Lady of France.
In exchange for their return, he demanded EUR 300,000 – he also wanted to get an apartment in Paris.
He contacted one of Brigitte Macron's daughters from the previous marriage.
According to the prosecutor, the prosecutor refused to submit to the police the documents he spoke about.
He predicted that he would transmit them to the media, but it is not yet known whether these documents exist.
They were not found during a review in the apartment of this 27-year-old.
The man was subjected to psychiatric studies, but the doctors did not find any serious disorders.
PS4 game will be old - Sony reveals surprising facts about PlayStation 4
Sony throws more light on the debiting game soon available only on PS4 The Last of Us: Part Two.
Sony, as part of the recent State of Play presentation, announced that the Prime Minister of the Last of Us will take place in February 2020.
The fans could also see a new fragment of breathing in the breast of the game of action coming.
More specifications have been revealed in the days after the loud barrier of the play of The Last of Us 2.
And it looks like Sony and Naughty Dog are reaching old climates in many ways.
The last of us: Part 2 will be sold on several plates.
Neil Druckmann from Naughty Dog confirmed this in a revolutionary intelligence given by The Telegraph, explaining that the sequel has grown to one of the largest games in history.
"The fabula is ambitious and is stuck in aspects where the one was not," he said.
She must have been so extensive that she could present this kind of story with so many characters.
We didn't mean to create the largest game, so it just happened.
"We are experiencing the awareness of how many possibilities are hidden in this history, and there will be moments when you think you're going to end, but you'll realize that this is just the beginning and that it's starting a completely new chapter," says Druckmann further.
It's such an ambitious game that it didn't fit on one BluRay and it's on two tiles.
In another place, it was revealed that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two easter eggi content for adults (information given by Gamestpot).
We're not gonna ruin surprises, but the easter eggi game refers to Naughty Dog's old-sculpture works.
More information will be found when The Last of Us: Part Two debuts only on PS4.
Persons with PS4 can prepare for the sequel premiere, reaching the Last of us Remastered available in the PS Plus offer.
Sony recently announced a list of free PS4 games offered since October 2019 by PlayStation Plus, including the above Naughty Dog production.
PS Plus subscriptions will also have access to MLB The Show 19 since October.
If you like The Last of Us Remastered and want to make a pre-prime order on the sequel, Sony said that there will be many versions of the game, including an exclusive edition containing the replica of Ella's backpack and her bracelet and a 30-century figure of this cultical character.
Run, scatter and fight - Sport
On Saturday, Stomil will take Podbeskid and will win.
Footballs of Stomil from three rows are invincible.
The guardians of Peter Zeitzkowski at that time won seven points, because they won with Stallu Mielec and Choinician Chojnice, and in the last match, a gateless remis in Swallows.
Now the Olstina team will take Subbeskid on Saturday at 18 a.m., which is exchanged as one of the favorites to advance to Extraclass.
The nearest rivals of Stomil take the fourth place in the table and have the prevailing point over the Olsten team.
The subbeskid on the trips in this season played six times and counted after two victories, remissions and defeats, however, Stomil feels very well at its facility – at the stadium at Al. Pilsudsky 69th the team of Peter Zaytzkowski won three times and once lost.
In total, in ten rows, the alstinians gathered 17 points and are in the head of the table, although after two failures at the start of the game did not say anything.
"Every change takes time to make results," explains Peter Skiba.
"We've finally got something in us, we believed in ourselves, and we can also work under normal conditions.
We're just focusing on the game.
They're pure heads, there's a good atmosphere, and everyone knows what to do because we have a strong training headquarters."
Thursday, the Stomil footballers eliminated Poland’s movement of the sick, but they needed a series of punishment to play.
In Southern Poland, Peter Skib, Gregorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc did not travel, because Coach Zaytzkovski had let these key players rest before the Saturday fight with Podbeskid.
Instead, in Chorzov, he played back after the injury of Jacob Mosakovski, who finally shot his long-expected gate.
"It's always fun to get a naked, and I'm still at the moment that we can keep playing in the squirrels. (Mosakowski equipped at 3:3 in 119 minutes - red.)
Dad used to bite me and laugh that I couldn't get the gate, and I always told him I would shoot at the moment he wouldn't expect."
Now Mosakowski is counting on returning to the basic composition, even more that because of the yellow cards, Oloh Tarasenko can't play.
"For this, I'm sharpening in training so that I can play in the first composition," Mosakovski says.
“In Choroba, I was doing everything I could to present myself as best as possible.
However, whether I play, or sit on the reservation club, I'll still be strong in support of the team.
Because the most important thing is the team and three points in the Subbeskid game.
Surely we have a difficult meeting in which victory will have to run, explode and fight."
In the middle of the Olstinic Defense, Raphal Remish can play, who has also recently experienced an injury, so whether it occurs, we will find out only on Saturday, more that coach Zajkowski traditionally ends the personnel's efforts to keep it secret.
The man raped and killed his nephew.
"You will never see the daily light.
You'll never breathe with fresh air again," Judge Kevin K. Allen said, calling Alex Whipple.
"What you've done was so disgusting and evil that you have to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
Five-year-old Lizzy disappeared in May.
Her search lasted five days until Whipple indicated the body's hiding place.
“How could someone do that to his own nephew? ” asked Daay Smith, Uncle of the girl.
"You are the worst person humanity has to offer," Alex Whipple said.
“ I would give everything I could to meet her again, to hug her, ” said the mother of a murdered girl.
“Our life will never be the same again, ” added a crushed woman.
According to Fox News, 22-year-old Whipple has not shown any emotions during the interrogation.
Last month, he confessed that he kidnapped, used sexually and killed a girl.
A man’s lawyer found that his client was raised in “infinite family. ”
He was meant to be molested as a child.
He also added that Whipple is aware that he did a terrible act and is ready to take punishment.
The man was convicted to live without the possibility of requesting for a conditional release.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that he would deliver nearly 100 million dollars of additional funds to the communities touched by the drought.
The funding programme for farmers affected by drought will be extended and the criteria for allocation of additives to farms will be simplified.
The aid package covers almost $34 million for the initiative of support for the drought communities, which allows the eligible farm to receive up to $3,000 in sudden cases.
Each of the 13 local governments within the Programme of Assistance to the Soil affected Communities will receive up to $1 million grants for infrastructure and assistance in dealing with the impacts of disasters.
The new support package is a supplement to over 7 billion dollars intended by the government for the Foundation for the Treasury Fund.
Frostpunk - a strategic game connecting city-builder production characteristics with a unique simulator of the 19th century society and the freezing sustainability – is approaching the planned on 11 October premier on consoles.

Frostpunk is a game that treats survival over the edge of society in which warmth means life, and each decision has its own price.
The player's task is to build on a frozen wilderness of the city whose heart is a pair generator.
Now a complex, strategic game, connected with a rich fabula and an incomparable survival experience, will be available on consoles.
Frostpunk: Console Edition will be a real test for your tactical knowledge.
Traitors of Chinese (In the name of the Love China's Mistress Busters)
documentary film: In China in the last decade, the number of divorces increased twice.
The cause of this situation was generally a third party.
Increasingly, more men maintain a marriage relationship, which has led to the education of a special industry in this country — a professional lover who has a task to save the marriages of betrayed wives.
Let's scand out loud: Ma-te-uch!
Trying to welcome the Prime Minister in the Sleekers
A special test was carried out before the election meeting with Prime Minister Mateus Moravec in the Slassian Pekars.
"Dear State, louder, louder, so we will not welcome Mr. Prime Minister here!
Let's scand aloud: Ma-te-uch!", he encouraged a strong leader.
Unfortunately, the enthusiastic leader’s efforts did not result in the expected outcome.
The campaign's in progress.
Politicians ride around the country, persuading voters to each other.
The intense campaign is also held by Prime Minister Mateus Moravecki, who, as leader of the PS Letter, is a common guest in this region.
Each meeting is planned exactly, including the correct correction.
So was it, but rather, it was meant to be in the Heavens.
A special guest should be welcomed specially.
Before meeting with the Prime Minister, he decided to take a general test at the chamber.
With nothing, the diet leader tried to encourage the crowd to scandal the name of the chief of the government.
"This will not be a welcome for me, but for Mr. Prime Minister of Moravic!
Also louder, more loudly my dear ones!" he encouraged the enthusiast.
Unfortunately, the crowd could not fully abduct the hot intentions of the ma-te-ush, but the enthusiastical recording of the leader makes a furora online.
Ronald Lee Haskell: Man sentenced for murder of his former wife in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was sentenced for the murder of Stephen and Katie Stay in 2014 and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
According to the authorities, he entered Stay's house on 9 July 2014, requesting the residence of his wife, Melannie Haskell, with whom he was separated.
She wasn't there, but she was her sister, Katie Stay and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys aged 13 and 4 years old, and two girls at the age of 9 and 7, died when Haskell opened the fire, as said the Office of the Sheriff of the County Harris.
Only one family member survived, a 15-year-old Cassidy Stay.
The authorities claimed that she was severely injured, but she was able to recover completely.
On Thursday, the jury members rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defense on the basis of unreadness.
The jury's jury will regain on Monday to make a sentence.
quantum Internet increasingly closer to reality – ScienceDaily
The results of the U.S. Army's research are going through the quantum Internet a step closer.
Such a internet could offer military opportunities for security, detection and precision of time absence in the traditional approach to networking.
The Centre for the Disseminated Quantum Processing of Information of the Military Research Laboratory for the Development of the Opportunities of the Steering of the American Army, was looking at researchers from the University of Insbruck, who managed to achieve the record transfer of the state between the matter and the light, 50 miles away with the use of light cables.
The compound is a correlation that can be made between the quantums such as the cubits.
When two cubits are compounded and measured by one of them, it will have an impact on the measurement made on the other, even if the other cubit is physically remote.
“These [50 km] are two lines of size far away than was possible and it is an executive distance to start building the quantum networks” said Dr. Ben Lanyon, experimental physicist from the University of Innsbruck and the main researcher in the project, whose discovery was published in the Nature magazine, section Quantum Information.
Intermediate quantum networks would be composed of remote nodes of physical coubit networks that are connected with each other despite a large physical distance.
Students have argued that this disseminate state is necessary to create a quantum internet.
"This demonstration is a huge step forward to reaching a wide ranged state," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-ordinating a military programme supporting these studies.
The quality of the state connected on the second end is also high enough to meet some of the most difficult quantum network uses.
The research team started an experiment with a atom of calcium captured in the yonic trap.
By means of laser links, the researchers entered the quantum state in the yon, while exciting it to emit it to the photo where quantum information was written.
As a result, the quantum states of atom and particles of light have been connected.
The challenge is to transmit the photon with light cables.
"The foton emitted by yon calcium has the length of the wave of 854 nanometers and is quickly absorbed by the light," Lanyon said.
Hence, his team initially sent a part of the light through the neline crystal highlighted by a strong laser radiation.
Photone wave length has been converted to optimum value from a large distance transmission — the current standard telecommunications length of the wave is 1550 nanometers.
Then the researchers sent this photo over a 50-mile light cable.
Their measurements show that the atoms and parts of the light were still connected even after the wave was converted and passed away.
“A decision to select calcium means that this results in direct way to create a connected atomic clock network on large physical distances, as the calcium can be connected with high quality cubit “caption”.
The Army is very much interested in the complicated clock networks built largely because of the use of precise positions, precise navigation and time synchronization," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher, who also co-manages the programme.
