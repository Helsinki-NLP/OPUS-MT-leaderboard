Scientists found a way to discover relative stars
Astrophysics from the University of California in Santa Cruise studied the turbulent mixture and its impact on chemical university in stars.
The discovery of experts is expected to allow the search for relatives among the stars, that is, from the same cluster.
The results of their studies have been published in Nature’s magazine and can be briefed at the university site.
The same chemical ingredient of the nearest stars is a turbulent mixture in gas clouds preceding the education of stars.
Even if the baby star then leaves a star cluster, it is chemical to determine its birth and the area of the generation of stars.
Scientists had previous doubts that the evolution of the star outside the classter could lead to the differences in its chemical content from the family in the classter.
Astrophysics modelling results show that such differences should not occur.
In their studies, experts using supercomputer designed two interstar gas streams that formed cloud together.
This object has been converted into a cluster for millions of years under its own gravity.
Scientists added colours to the original gas flows and found that rapid turbulent mixtures in the cloud achieved a high degree of chemical university.
According to astrophysics, their research demonstrates that chemical stars can be searched, as well as to identify possible areas of education of such objects.

Lavrov: Russia will not " squeeze the door" in connection with new sanctions and will not leave WTO
Russia will not "shook the door" in connection with new sanctions.
Today, head of MID RF, Sergei Lavrov, spoke to the students and teachers of MGIMO.
With regard to our responsibilities in the case of a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even think, fantasize, because everything must be calculated specifically," he said.
And when we realize what European and American partners will like for this once, we will decide how to respond.
This will not be related to the door-crap, some of the insults that are falsely understood," the Minister stressed.
We will, first of all, refrain from our interests, interests to protect our economy, our social sphere, our citizens, our business and make conclusions from the actions of partners on their adequacy, agreement and reliability.
Following the steps taken in the area of sanctions, it can be very well judged what the partners are pursuing -- the head of the MID RF continued.
If they say "this sanctions will also be painful to us, but we are forced to go to punish Russia," it is probably not very appropriate.
With regard to the WTO outcome of the RF in response to possible new sanctions, it is not.
We, on the contrary, want to build the WTO tools more actively, including when dealing with trade disputes, said Lavrov.
We have already launched this tool to overcome, as we believe, the EU's discrimination policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia was accused of demping and applied anti-dumping measures against RF economies.
"We are ready to initiate WTO mechanisms and to stand up to our position of inadequacy to apply the EU's third energy standards retrospectively," said Lavrov.
How is it appropriate to use the cheese in the garden design?
The questions were answered by Irina Okuneva:
Since the cheese after the flower loses its primary attraction, it is desirable to be planted with other crustaceans.
It is perfectly connected with many cultures.
In addition to the syrene, both plants decorative and flourishing at the same time can be planted.
Another plus siren is that it provides a mass of creative opportunities.
You can form it with a different height of the stamb tree, an improved bush, a widely founded stove, and even a kind of garden bonsay - a tree with a miraculously twisted bullet.
Just choose the form that more matches your garden design.
In Karelia, the inhabitant of the Leningrad area is convicted for the gain of false money
According to the Republican IMD, the man was engaged in his criminal industry in the Olonec and Seguez regions.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already inherited in the Vologen area where he was sentenced to two and a half years of detention.
Later, the man was presented to the Olonian District Court.
In order to end the investigation of the crimes committed in our Republic, it was staged in Segage.
In the investigation, a number of episodes of fake funds pertaining to summer 2013 have been demonstrated.
At the end of June, the criminal proceedings with a prosecution were sent to court.
On Friday, on 29 August, the court decided to replace the term of deprivation for four years with a general regime colony.
The sentence has not entered legally.
Recall that two other counterfeiters were convicted last week, which were paid in Petro factory stores.
Citizens of Azerbaijan also arrived in Carelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them is deprived of five years, one for four.
Everyone has a fine of $500,000 rubbers.
The sentence has not yet entered legally.
In Archangel, the 73th anniversary of the first convoy, Dervish
The event held in the area centre was dedicated to the first arctic convoy.
Dervish delivered military assistance from the United States and Britain to the SSSR.
In Archangel, the Memorial Memorial Memorial took place at the founded stone to the future monument for the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the coast name of Sedow in Solombala.
At the event, representatives of the veteran organizations of Archangel, children from the Cadet class, were gathered.
For the first time, we gathered for twenty-three years ago when the stone was found.
However, today's event is not a celebration, but a day of memory of those who have not returned the sea," said the Chairman of the North Sea Council, Boris Carpov.
Then the city’s spirit orchestra spoke at the event, and the cadet class teachers gave flowers to the veterans and marched with the flags of Russia and the victory flag.
The myth ended with the planting of colors to the stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport loaded with strategicly important raw materials (10,000 tonnes of couchuk, 1 500 tons of formed shoes, pencil, wool and many other inventory and equipment).
Furthermore, there were military equipment and weapons -- 3.800 depth bombs and magnetic mines, 15 Harriquein executors, in a clear condition.
The escort of the convoy was 16 BMF ships of Great Britain, including two aircraft.
The caravan was not discovered by the opponent and has reached the appointment of Archangel.
A total of 848 ships who participated in vital caravan operations were killed by 126 transport vessels and about 50 military vessels.

Recalling the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill that protects trade unions as civil law.
"Where trade unions are there, there are the medium-class jobs," said Allison, a democrat from Minnesota, who is a co-Chairman of the Congress of the Progressive Fraction.
That is why I am proud to present the Act on the Expansion of the Rights of Workers, along with the symbol of movement for civil rights, John Lewis.
This innovative law will give workers the same legal possibilities in the discrimination of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination, sustaining the forces of opponents of trade unions
Amendment of the Labour Relations Act in order to allow workers faced with discrimination for participation in trade unions to seek justice in civil courts and to receive compensation for damage and fine payments is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative, at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Allison, Lewis and the co-autors of the draft law are to remember a very American idea.
Despite the attacks that trade unions have been attacked in recent years, in Visconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country, the Americans once supported countries around the world in order to adopt, expand and respect labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remembered while the country protected democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of printing and the right to organization at the same time.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas McArthur and his assistants helped the country to adopt a constitution so as to guarantee that the military autocracy of Hideca Todzo was replaced by democracy.
Recognizing fully that workers and their trade unions play a role in creating a new Japan, they included a text that directly recognized that “the right of workers to organization and to negotiations and to collective action is guaranteed”.
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his assistants helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers will need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article openly, " The right to establish associations in order to protect and improve labour and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each person and to each profession or sphere of activity.
Agreements that restrict or strive to deprive this right will not have legal force; measures aimed at these purposes will be recognized as illegal.
When the former Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, who composed the World Declaration on Human Rights, which would be adopted by the United Nations as a World Agreement, Roosevelt and the composers included a guarantee that “Everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect their interests”.
For generations, Americans have accepted the proper basic position that labour rights are human rights.
When the country consulted other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to the organisation of trade unions and that the trade union should be engaged as an equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government institutions should be protected.
Now that these rights are subject to attacks in America, wisely, to return to the American ideal that employees should have the right to organize and to hear their voices in free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Younger said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the force of the nation, but increased them.
By rising the life level of millions, trade unions made a marvelous market for industry and raised the entire nation to the unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how we should.
Official recognition of labour rights as human rights - and enlargement of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination against trade unions - has long risen.
Keith Allison and John Lewis have restored ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy reality.
The judge is temporarily blocking the law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, a federal judge in Sunday had temporarily blocked the introduction of Louisiana's law, which his supporters say he would probably close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed to the Governor of Louisiana, Bobby Ginadlem in June and had to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who aborted would have the mandate to receive patients in the hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
Nevertheless, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to aborte legally by continuing to seek such powers.
"The claimants will be allowed to work legally, continuing to obtain powers," Judge John deGrewells wrote in his decision.
The hearing will be appointed within a month where the judge will make a more permanent decision under this law.
Protecters of the right to abortion welcomed this decision, the latest in a row of decisions against similar measures, saying that this would give doctors more time to receive hospital powers.
"The current decision guarantees that women of Louisiana will be protected from a corrupt law which seeks to deprive their health and rights," said Nancy Nortap, President and Head of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, which has filed a claim to stop the law from three of the five state clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision was made to doctors from two clinics who did not speak to the plaintiffs in this case, and also made an application for the recruitment.
Louisiana is in 11 states that have adopted such laws and the courts have recently recognized such measures as non-constitutional measures in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked by the federal judge on Friday.
Abortion law fighters, along with the American College of Acushers and Guineclogues and the American Medical Association, say that the laws on the powers of recruitment are limited to doctors that are not necessary in medical terms.
Abortioners object that such measures are aimed at protecting women ' s health, although some also noted their positive effect in closing the clinic.
Only one doctor who has an abortion in Louisiana has the power to receive in the hospital, said the Reproductive Rights Centre.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to cease the procedure, the doctor, fearing for its safety, would have ceased, said the group.
In criticism of this decision, Louisiana officials said that they would not punish abortion doctors until their claims for powers were to be taken.
What will lead to the introduction of quotas on domestic products
At least half of the goods of each type of goods in the trading networks should be Russian production, the Deputy of the State of the Fraction of the Just Russia, Oleg Neal.
The parliamentary drafted a law aimed at the introduction of protective measures against national producers, reports the report " Notification " .
The document will also be detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This concerns goods that are not produced in Russia. According to the remaining groups of products produced in Russia, the rhythler will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic producers," Nilov reported to the publication.
In addition to the amendments to the article “About the grounds for public trade management in the RF”, the draft law provides a change in the Tax Code, which sets a 10 per cent lower rate of NDC in the implementation of the products produced in Russia.
The idea to introduce a 50 per cent quota in trade networks is a package of stimulating measures for Russian producers.
There will be several times more domestic goods.
However, the initiative may have both a positive and negative effect, say experts.
According to the Tax Advocate, a member of the Independent Public Think Centre, Sergei Lithuinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for domestic agricultural and food sectors, the effect will be positive and will lead to growth.
Furthermore, sell-producers, farmers, small shops.
They can sell more, which means profits will grow.
Furthermore, they will be entitled to dictate their terms and prices, as they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, leading to higher taxes than before.
This will increase the budget income, create new jobs, some sectors will begin to expand, some faster receipts will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will fall several times, indeed not at once," said the expert.
Rather, Russian enterprises often couldn't break into local shops because of high competition by foreign analogs.
Now, after the introduction of the embargo, the nith was free and it could be relieved.
However, we should not forget that after all the necessary consents and sanitation checks on the Russian market, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will come.
In other words, the moment of silence came when the former players left, and the news have not yet come.
Almost a month later, a growing demand for domestic commodity and a rise in prices for preparatory product," said Aif.ru, the first vice-president of the Socio-Russian Public Organization, “Russian Financial Directors Club”, B.C.E. Tamara Kasianowa.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food products in each category will enable the local production sector to be strengthened.
In that case, they will compete with each other rather than with goods that are cheaper from the grants of another State.
In other words, the fight for the buyer will turn around between companies working on one industry law.
On the other hand, Casianova notes, the Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the internal needs of the companions far from all the articles.
And in this situation, trade networks will have to "continue" the share of Russian goods to half the assortiment.
In this regard, fears are growing that non-performing goods will be taken into account.
Possibly, abroad products with broken labels will be placed under the type of produced in Russia," the expert added.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will be experienced by large trade networks, especially those who are more eager to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers will be affected by such arrangements, as the demand for their product will be reduced.
Lithuanianko does not exclude that the law on quotas on domestic goods may also affect consumers.
The point is, some Russian production products can be declined by quality of import analogies, while shops will be able to raise prices for seconds as deficit goods.
The idea of importing the economies forgotten in the early 2000s was reconsidered in February this year because of the continuing devalvation of rubber.
The question of refusal from import products is now still more relevant in the context of difficult relations with the West.
The law is designed to oblige rhythlers when orders are made by suppliers to be treated with domestic producers.
Then we will go far faster and more confidently on the path of imports, and the production planning system will be established at a shorter time," said Deputy Oleg Nealov.
Especially effective agricultural sectors, where the potential is particularly high, for example, in the breast sector, where imports were 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really capable of fully covering Russian shops.
Furthermore, a powerful impulse can be obtained by meat production.
It is known that the largest share of imports remains from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.
A 65-70 per cent of the Russian product is still in place," Casianova decides.
Experts have been observed that the introduction of quotas on domestic products will improve imports and may accelerate the process.
However, this initiative would not lead to importation itself, as it would require a set of measures, as it was sure of Lithuianko.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative could still be imported from abroad, which means that full imports will not occur, but significant steps will be made in that direction.
Furthermore, there are little quotas to be set up, and the production of domestic products in the country should be adjusted to fulfil these quotas.
Such guarantees will be provided by the quotas,” states the expert.
Instant diagnosis and lack of access to optimum treatment indicate that the cancer of eggs in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of their dead mother’s memory, who died of egg cancer in 2007.
Women who are forgiven in the rural territory of Australia face a higher risk of death from egg cancer than in cities.
Researchers analysed the cards of more than 1,100 Australian women with diagnosis of “Jajic cancer” in 2005, discovering that only 35 per cent had lived five years after diagnosis had been diagnosed.
The leading researcher Susan Jordan of the Institute for Medical Research, QIMR Berghofer, reported that the possibility of death during the study was 20 per cent higher for those living in regions and remote areas of the state than those living in urban areas.
INTERNATIONAL TRAINING: New medicines can slow down lung cancer and egg cancer
Researchers tracked the medical path of women for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, type of egg cancer, current diseases and social economic status had also affected the probability of survival.
Women of older age and those who had cancer at the later stage of diagnosis were lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote areas, the probability of death during the research was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women outside the cities are more likely to die from egg cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that the unsuitable diagnosis and the lack of access to optimum treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specialized in gynekological oncology, and they are primarily in large cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of the quality of television services in order to reduce the distance impact, she assumed that the increase in the number of exit services that would allow professionals to treat women closer to home, and the support programmes of people who have been treated far from their home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of the geographical situation, the study found that the length of life among women with egg cancer was rare, emphasizing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, when she was 33 years old, the young mother from the Golden Coast, Elisha Neev, said that she had an aggressive form of egg cancer.
The new FAP will open the door in the Kugener region in September
The medical institution in the village of Toktaibelac was launched in April this year and was conducted by a model project.
The cost of work was about 10 million rubles.
According to the management of public communications and information by the Head of Mary El, the funding for the construction of the facility was carried out by the funds of the Republican budget in accordance with the addressing investment programme.
The general area of the treatment prevention institutions is nearly 230 square meters.
There will be medical assistance to the inhabitants of eight settlements: villages of Toktaibeljak and villages Dementjevo, Püncherumal, Tunisia, Fomici, Toraibelak, Shinur and Chascayal.
The new Feldshire-Acusher item will replace the current FAP, whose building was built in 1918 and has long been exhausted from its resources, and its premises do not comply with the sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new institution will be opened soon.
The killer of a four-month son in an unhealthy state of the new boxer will be before the court.
Chichisha's resident is going to be a chamber of defendants for killing their own child.

Inflation left the vacation.
Do Russians feel a sharp price growth
As a result of the cross sanctions of RF and West, inflation in Russia will be accelerated and not incorporated into the prognosis of the authorities, the WTB Capital analysts are convinced.
According to experts, the anti-sanction implications deferred would lead to inflational shock in the first quarter of 2015, the RBK Daily wrote.
According to the last Mineconomic projection, the inflation would be 6.5 to 7.5 per cent in 2014, in the next year and less than 6.5 per cent.
However, according to the Commersante newspaper, this week, the MER should make " small, but principled" adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the publication, the Office may reduce the inflation assessment for 2015, which will eliminate the expected decline in population income growth.
The forecast was that the food sanctions of RF were operational until August 2015.
How could such a high inflation be suggested?
The current situation envisages a parallel shock, but the humiliating trend of inflation will not change," said the source of the newspaper in Minfine.
Economists from the WTB Capital do not share the expectations of the Government ' s financial and economic bloc on inflation and predict the increase of prices at 8 per cent in 2014.
The main effect of product bans will be along with the possible introduction of taxes from sales in the RF regions (NAP) in 2015, the experts are convinced.
Inflational peak will be 9 per cent to February, after which the annual price growth rates will fall, the experts believe.
By the way, last week, Rosstat failed the first inflation results after the RF introduced "clear sanctions " .
AiF.ru questioned experts and discovered their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, head of the FK AForex Analytical Department:
Price growth is already observed on the main segments of goods.
Furthermore, when socially significant products began to be valued, the Government had to launch systemic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risks of unfounded price increases in short term.
The suppliers and rhetelers are already reported on a daily basis to regulators so that the authorities can know exactly who, when and why it is initiating prices.
The key factors for the growth of the consumer price index continue to remain the enormous rate of capital flow, the excessive refinance of the banking sector by the Russian megagulator, the internal conversion for the evasion of the population into foreign currency, and the embargo on the import of food products from countries joined in sanctions against Russia.
If the inflation pressure remained under control, the cost of the minimum set of products would not be 12 per cent for one quarter.
The prohibition of importing foodstuffs caused a shock of proposals in the internal market and led to a totally logical increase in the final value.
Since at the current stage, we are not fully able to start the importing mechanism and to improve the self-sufficientness of the Russian market through internal production, the responsibilities will continue to risk the growth of the inflation.
In addition to the fiscal reasons for lack of confidence in the national currency and the deteriorated prospects of economic growth, by the end of this year, the inflation could totally exceed 8 per cent.
Alexander Razavaev, Director of the Analytical Department of Alpari
In the 1990s, the inflation sometimes reached 20 to 30 per cent a month, as it was also above the current level, the second, which was compensated for rapid economic growth.
I think, after the end of the year, the inflation will be 8 to 8.5 per cent.
Platon of Maguta, managing UK assets "Found Maguta"
The external factor of the sanctions against Russia has been successfully delayed, but if further pressure increases, particularly the financial sector, it may lead to certain difficulties and increase inflation expectations of the population, which are traditionally manifested in the purchases of cash currency in order to safeguard their savings.
It can be assumed that the Government, the CEB and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of rubber, both by market and public regulation.
However, price growth begins traditionally after summer silence and it may become more sensitive.
The target of consumer inflation in Russia is approximately 7.5 per cent, since RF has additional financial accumulation.
Garden centres regret the reduction of the number of householders
Such a decline due to an exceptional reduction in the number of householders less than 35 years of age may lead to the loss of tens of million pounds per year, when the young consumers today reach “the basic age of gardening”, according to the HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, people who take off their housing spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that owners of their own houses spend on gardening.
It refers to the increase in the number of people living in high-urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of the assfaltation of courts in front of the parking house and the reduction of garden sizes as other factors threatening the industry, the annual sales of which is estimated to be $5 billion.
In Great London, where the number of householders dropped from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the lowest cost rate in Great Britain for household gardeners.
HTA and the Royal Garden Society reported that the rental of housing and lack of space for the garden did not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the chief garden advisor in RHS, said: "The growing of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular for renters who can carry plants with them when they move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as a “the Golden Age” of diversity trade in gardening as a result of an increase in the number of householders and economic prosperity from the end of the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year through better weather after the disadvantaged conditions in March and April last year.
Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture conducted mass cleaning in the Agriculture Fund

Turkey calls for an American diplomat in connection with the spine report
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey called for the highest American diplomat in the country to clarify the report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bullent said that the US officer and Turkish officials discussed a communication on Monday.
The German Journal of Der Spiegel and the Intercept Internet report reported that documents provided by the former US National Security Agency by Edward Snowden showed that Turkey was a priority intelligence for US and British Intelligence Services.
According to Turkish news agencies, the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, reduced the importance of this communication, saying that all leading countries are spying each other.
The previously reported information that the main intelligence agency of Germany had also made Ankara an intelligence facility has raised a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
The largest Chinese companies are united against Alibababa
China’s companies, among whom the largest chinese business real estate is Dalian Wanda Group and Internet Giants Tencent Holdings (society, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engineer), are creating a company that will compete in the online trade market with Alibaba.
However, the miracle of Chinese Internet, which left even its American rivals eBay and Amazon.com behind, will be difficult.
The Greatest Union
Companies plan to invest 5 billion juanas ($ 814 million), 70 per cent will belong to Wanda and 15 per cent, each of the internet companies, said the Wanda Group.
The company is planned to be registered in Hong Kong.
The PP will combine Baidu's search services with the popular WeChat social platform (the largest social network in China, which is about 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 feechenebel hotels, the Wanda group manages at least 49 commercial property facilities throughout China and 40 trade centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion juanas (about $8 billion) in the construction of the movies and thematic entertainment park in Cindao (Cyndao City, Eastern China, the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and make profits at $960 million.
Furthermore, Wanda belongs to the American AMC Entertainment Holdings film network, which makes the company the largest movie operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its trading centres, hotels and entertainment sites with e-commerce services, which will take place in the development of the Alibaba competitive.
According to Dun Cé, who leads the new company, Wanda will be able to increase its e-commerce users from the current 40 million to 100 million by the next year.
The new place should be the largest online-to-offline platform in the world, notes Dun Cé.
The point of online-to-offline (O2O) is to attract customers on the Internet in order to come to offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O are coupon sales services such as Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the biggest " pie" in online trade," said Wanda Van Zzyñlin (Bloomberg quota).
"Now the present O2O area in China does not exist, and in this situation the chances of all are approximately equal," he believes.
The Chinese Internet Trade Market is the biggest in the world and, according to McKinsey & Co., it will increase more than three times by 2015 than 2011 to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users increased to 632 million, Bloomberg reported official statistics: more people in any country of the world, except India.
And according to forecasts, by 2015, this number could grow to 850 million people.
Union of the Wealthiest
The Chief of Tencent Ma Juaten has recently been the richest man of China, but according to the Bloomberg Bloomberg index, the founder Alibababa Jack Ma has already enrolled him at $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's condition is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion will come to his share in Alibaba.
The leader of Baidu Robin Lee is now third among the wealthiest people of China, while Van Zhenglin of Wanda is the fourth rating line.
"After this battle, it is very interesting to observe: three of the richest people are uniting efforts to challenge even richer," said the director of the Chinese Centre for Electronic Trade Research in Hanchjou Cao Lay.
But he believes that the new company would hardly be able to compete with Alibaba immediately after the creation, "Rome cannot be built in one day."
That Alibaba was not just competitive to new companies, but also to the earned leaders of the world's Internet Trade, an announced report on Alibaba's financial indicators before the last quarter.
Alibababa is often described as an average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company has earned more money than the two American competitors taken together.
The pure Alibaba profit over the period almost twice exceeds the similar summary of competitives - it grew almost three times in the annual calculation and made $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has a huge capacity to generate money, in many ways through its mobile applications," Bloomberg commented the report of an analyst from the Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba Prospectus on the U.S. Pricing Papers and Markets Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company's services was 188 million in July, which significantly exceeds the March rate (163 million).
32.8% of all Alibaba's transactions for the past quarter had to use mobile devices.
Alibaba has to indicate the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to the average estimated 11 analysts examined by Bloomberg, the company could be evaluated in $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to the sources of Bloomberg, the Alibaba debut at the New York Fundament (NYSE) could be held on 16 September.
The Road-show company before this event starts on 3 September.
It is expected that Alibaba's IPO exit will be recorded in NYSE history and will allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
To date, the U.S. marketing record belonged to the Visa Payment System, which had originally placed its shares in 2008, earning $17.9 billion.
At least half of the foodstuffs in trade networks should be Russian production, according to the State deputies.
They have developed a bill on this subject.
This is about the amendment of paragraph 8 of the FZ on the grounds for public trade management in the RF and the Tax Code.
The aim of the document is to introduce protection measures against Russian food producers.
The important clarification, according to the draft law, should be at least 50 per cent of domestic products in shops in each type of goods.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruits in winter, so it will be made for them to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also modifies the RF Tax Code, which sets a lower rate of NDC at 10 per cent in the implementation of all foodstuffs whose origin country is Russia, reports the report " Notifications " .
On 27 August, a draft law on amendment to the FZ " On Different Markets " was introduced to the House of Parliament, which suggests that farm markets in Russia will be restored, where small producers can implement their products.
The Chief of the Police of Magaluf has been accused of corruption
The claimants presented evidence of expulsion by police officers and officials of the Calvia municipality to the Office of the Prosecutor of Majorka.
The Chief of the Calvia Police on the Muljorka Island was arrested as a result of the charges of corruption by businessmen and owners of bars in the scandally known center of the scattered drunkenness of Magalufe.
The Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was detained as a result of the charges of corruption against him by several businessmen with Punta Ballen, the street with most bars and night clubs of Magaluf.
According to the daily online publication of Mallorca Diario, the judges presented evidence of expulsion by police officers and officials of the Calvia Municipality to the Office of Prosecutor Maljorka for the fight against corruption on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Guardians of the National Guard of Spain for the charges of corruption and will be questioned by the judge with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that dissatisfactory owners of night clubs said that protectionism by the authorities was seriously reflected in their business situation.
"The thing is no longer to earn money, it is to survive," said one businessman of the court.
We can't threaten our sources of existence.
We don't have anything to lose.
Magaluf was in the titles of international press this summer after a popular video on YouTube, showing an 18-year-old British vacationer who passed 24 to men during the bar race.
The authorities of the island have since tried to cease defense among the resting Magaluf, minimizing the number of scandally known alcoholic races on bars.
Furthermore, the Playhouse Club, where the mine incident happened, had to close for a year, while the Playhouse and the Carnage race managers were combined to $55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist court of Magaluf, primarily popular among young British vacationers, was also a place of numerous accidents in alcoholic situations associated with a crazy party known as "balconing" when people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring was wet and wind conditions affecting flights at the Adelaide Airport
The spring prepared a cold surprise in South Australia, raining rains and strong winds that affected flights at the Adelaid Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain dropped on the city at 9:00 a.m. after 6.6 mm that fell in the night of Sunday.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short wind wind winds, including a storm that began shortly before 8 a.m. and poured nearly 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter released the early spring in the last week, the temperature fell again on Monday until only 15.8C in the city.
The qualified conditions are supposed to have served one of the reasons for delaying the Airlines Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaid.
The plane had to land on the schedule immediately after 7:30, but it had been forced to get a height to the wind area -- sudden speed change or the direction of the wind at a short distance.
The wind strike reached 50 km/h on the ground at the Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to be high during the second landing, and the plane eventually landed around 8:40 a.m.
The delay of this flight led to a further delay in flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
Maximum 16C is predicted in Adelaide on Tuesday with the probability of one or two lions.
The calculation of building facilities in the RF will take place in a new manner
Price-education, construction management and network connection issues of the Federal Anti-Monopolity Service takes special control.
FAS was established by an expert committee on competition development in the construction area.
At its meeting, the Chief of the Management of the CEO, construction and natural resources of FAS Vadem Soloviev stated that " today's calculation of construction facilities was totally incompatible " .
The normal base makes prices transparency and can lead to unreasonable prices of construction, they believe in the FAS.
It is also suggested that the cost of the construction of states at the stage of designation should be determined on the basis of the market prices of constructive decisions instead of the current estimated standards and the unitial estimates for technological operations.
These proposals are made into the road map and are now being reviewed in the ministerial office.
"The replacement of traditional estimates in the construction of constructive elements should lead to less corruption in the industry," explained the RGB, Vadim Soloviev.
Because the account is now calculated by every bullet and bullet, and it is not always possible to verify everything, so sometimes in the documentation the unconscious construction companies can bury the whole tractors.
The FAS minister agrees.
"The first work on the cost-based cost-based elements has already been developed: constructive price methodologies have been developed, estimated on these indicators," said the RGB Chief of the Department of Constructive Activities and the architecture of the Ministry of Elena Zukova.
As a pilot, the road construction sphere is selected.
However, experts believe that the problem was much more serious.
As the RGB said by the head of the Profi-Invest company Anatoli Demianco, the estimated norms have long been expired, but the other business mechanism has not yet been proposed.
"And as regards the proposed calculations on constructive elements, it is in practice difficult to realize, as in building buildings are often used entirely different technologies," he believes.
It is not a secret that the building is developed in much due to the State Procurement.
According to the Chairman of the NP, the Expert Community of Professional Professionals, Ekaterina Lezina, today the State is the most capable of paying.
Deputy Director for the Industrial Capital Building Centre, Rosatom Vladimir Malahov, noted that today the market is conditionally divided into companies with access to the portfolio of contracts and to companies owning monopoly competences and non-competitors.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is maximumly imposed by someone's management effect.
The Expert Board was invited to form a State order system in a way that the same executor could not receive more than one contract at a sum of more than 1 billion rubs or several contracts per sum of more than 1 billion.
The minister believes that this approach should be evaluated in terms of business impact, as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
As Elena Žukova explained, it would be necessary to provide the procurement with the functions of the gender-contributor, which would lead to the increase in the procurement and budget costs.
Professionals will, however, have to have knowledge to assess the quality of the work carried out by the contracting organizations and their safety.
It will often be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the object as a whole.
Furthermore, this approach could result in the scope of highly qualified procurement procurement participants with regard to uninterestedness in obtaining a public order for incomplete work and a small amount of contracts.
The headquarters of the Institute for Procurement, Alexander Eustašenkov, believes that the procurement procedure has now become a business game for the contractor's attention.
Example: " Participant in filling the application should specify "concrete indicators" without the word "or equivalent", "must be", "of", "more", " less", "analog", "or", "type", "not below", "not below", "mode", "mode", "may be", "may be", "not above", "not above", "not above", "not above", "not above" and so on.
Thus, the customers often abuse their right to establish the requirements for the content of the application submitted by the underlying organizations.
Another problem of 44-FZ, according to Eustašenkov, was the need to evaluate the quality of the request through the " paper" proposal of the party.
Considering the request of the party, it is possible to evaluate only the qualification of the contractor but not the quality of the work that has not yet been initiated, the expert believes.
The quality of work can be evaluated only when they receive it.
The Expert Board also proposed the transfer of marginal income from the top to the bottom of the echelon so that intermediate contractors could disappear.
The Chairman of the Expert Council, the Secretary-General, FAC Desert Chief, Andrej Carikovski, believes that this should not be done, as the gender is responsible for the order.
Otherwise, how in the famous repression of Arcadia Rikina, "Athelee: "There are any claims for buttons?"
Israeli children return to school after war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories next to the Gaza Strip again went to school on Monday after they spent summer in bomb shelters when rockets and mines rained their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed during the reconstruction of the territories.
The beginning of school classes brought the feeling of joy and anxiety to the missiles affected by the settlements of South Israel, but the signs of warfare remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the staff of the Pashosh Children's Garden, in which the missile was caught, removed the trails of declines from the walls and the children’s mountains before the students came.
"We are a little afraid, but we are happy to look into the future," said Ronith Bart, a resident of Kibuza Saad and an English teacher in his school.
Many children in our area really need to come back to an extensive life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shannon Bart, said that suddenly she started going to school again "a little strange."
"It was a difficult time, and we were not leaving our homes at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibuz, near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before the ceasefire agreement stopped the war last week, thousands of inhabitants of foreign settlements, such as Saad, did not go out or leave their homes, traveling to safer areas away from the Gaza Strip to save from missile and minometers.
Many Nahal Oz, a village near the Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by the Palestinian mine, doubted that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families still haven't returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited the school in Sderota, a city on the border of Gaza, which has long older than the Palestinian Fire.
He advised the children to learn thoroughly and said, "We will do our best to give you knowledge and to ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite reconciliation last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately put an end to combat action, but key issues remained unsolved, for example, the Hamas requirement for the withdrawal of the Egypt-Israel Block of Gaza and the opening of airports and maritime ports in Gaza.
Israel wants Hamas to put his weapons and restore the bodies of two Israeli soldiers who died in war.
The new stage of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2100 Palestinians died in the war, including three quarters of which were peaceful citizens, and at least 494 children, according to the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel contradicts these figures and claims that at least half of the men were killed by warriors; despite that, he did not provide substantial evidence that confirmed this allegation.
66 soldiers and six peaceful residents, including one Thai worker, were killed on the Israeli side.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza warriors released 4591 rockets and mines on Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, however, carried over 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of houses in Gaza have been damaged and have been destroyed, and 250,000 people were estimated to be found asylum in over 100 schools that have been converted into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters, and the fights continued, the officials responsible for education deferred the start of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon be opened to enable us to complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in Gaza's schools.
According to the popular criterion, real estate prices showed the largest winter growth in seven years.
The RP Housing Index Data CoreLogic Hedonic for housing prices in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, reported the RP data on Monday.
This increase led to a total increase in June, July and August by 4,2 per cent, the largest winter-month increase since 2007.
The annual increase of prices was 10.9 per cent, more than twice above 12 months by August 2013, but the increase was not equally distributed by the country.
The Director of RP Data Tim Loules reported that Sydney and Melbourne were running a bi-level market.
The RP Data digits show that in Sydney, housing prices have increased by 16.1 per cent in the last year, while in Melbourne are 11.7 per cent.
The following markets were Adelaide, Brisbain and Darwin, where the prices increased from five to six per cent.
The other end of the scale was Canberra, which took place by government reductions, where prices were only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lawles said that now that the spring began, there would be a increase in the number of real estate objects available to sale during several months, which would be a "real test" for the market.
"In view of the current high rate of auction sales, the total sales rate and the current low-percent rate conditions, the housing costs will probably grow in the next three months," he said.
How people live in the oldest house of Ufa
In the former home of gold industry and miningers Eudokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (ex Great Kazakh) 18 apartments.
The house of the 18th century has not been practically changed since the construction period, unless the highest was considered.
Foreign people walk here as a trip, and the residents suffer more than they are rejoiced, from their privilege to live in the oldest Ufim house, whose walls are remembered by Colonel Alexander Suvorov.
The building date of the house is incorrect, historians indicate two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it's a building without 300 years old.
Old court, always opened doors, screaming stairs.
The doors to the apartment are close to each other, the walls squeezed, and the streets were seen in the lights of the scrambled slippery.
Looks like it's a fair word.
And the local people say, "You don't think it's true."
It is very difficult to live in a wooden house of the 18th century," said Tatiana Lukianova, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is on the disposal, but the money for its content is not paid for tens of years, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities simply forgot.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still screwed, but the foundation was screwed.
Many inhabitants still go to the toilet on the street, and once a week wet in a public bathroom.
How can we be happy in such conditions?
The road goes right under the windows, not even a walking zone.
Tatiana's pulling off the curtain.
Now it's all that's been heard before: car flows under the windows.
You see, the glass are always drilling, the windows can't be opened, but they're used to noise.
A man gets used to everything, to good and bad.
Our apartment is still model, thank your husband, his hands are golden.
In addition, we have two rooms, we live three with our son.
Other families have a lot worse condition, the second floor of the ceiling is about a half a meter high.
For the contrast, Tatiana offers a visit to a roommate from apartment No. 6 of the Lumile Starship.
A pleasant woman offers a cup of coffee from the threshold and with a sad smile tells:
We have a single apartment, 14.5 m2 on four people, so we live: my husband and my granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been another housing, and Lumila's been circling the room with the eyes: anthresoles, two couches of "g" and one of them had a granddaughter with the laptop.
It's very close and smallly different from the normal domestic interior: only the roofs are beautiful, historical.
But the ceiling is regularly flowing: the water system is nowhere.
Ludmila speaks about her apartment incredibly and incredibly at the same time as the Italian woman whose house is in the Roman ruins.
So it brings into a very old and recent, daily and legendary:
The waterway was spent about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then we got a small kitchen in a corner and a toilet from the former cupboard.
We live right where Demidov and his family were living on the second floor of the servants.
Our apartment is not privatized, so why?
Ufa's real estate Centre says that privatization is no significance.
We can only get one room, but we can't pretend for more.
Four months ago, we were promised to be displaced, but the promised case was not going.
I'm not used to complaining or I won't.
In this apartment (room!) there was a whole dynasty: my grandmother and grandparent, my mom and Dad, I am with my husband and my granddaughter.
It's been every time.
For example, the healthy rats were running in the kitchen.
Look at the fligel walls, they're meter thickness!
They say the solution was involved in eggs, so it's been held so long.
The house's built for a reason, thanks to Demid!
It's probably the only reason that anyone was killed by a crushed ceiling or his own.
Only the building still slowly dies in our eyes: the boards and the berries of the houses rot, the floors have failed repeatedly, we filled with cement, but all useless - solution goes into the ground like a well.
They say that it is under our room of secret looseness and the journey to the White River, which has specially been made by the old believers here to be able to hide from danger, in case.
They were persecuted.
Ludmila Starstina tells them how a historian came to them, begging for him to start a digging apartment.
And then he convinced them to give them a housing in exchange for his one in the October Avenue.
Sowmila rejected the historian:
Where are we four to one?
And here, at least, there's a little hope that they'll give the apartment more space.
If we agreed to exchange, we wouldn't win anything anymore.
However, the Families of Olders won nothing.
The greatest dream of Ludmila was to be displaced, and the daughter with a 16-year-old grandson gave a separate room.
I mean, two families have allocated a two-room apartment instead of the most magnificent ruins in which two generations live now.
A nice, miniature girl, Olesia Karsakov, from apartments No. 11 and 12, shows the second floor of the house.
There are two tight rooms of a common area of 23 m2, named apartments, a large family.
We're seven people, two children.
You can see what conditions are.
The cartridge is declined by pieces, as well as window frames, walls in the kitchen and rooms cross-holes.
The water in the crown is only cold for a year.
By walking through the apartments of the oldest Ufa house, you can be sure that most of the happiest of the spouses of Lavrentiev from the apartment No. 4.
They take the most spacious rooms of the first floor.
You're right, lots of places!
A place in 75 squares, three people are prescribed.
We live just in rooms where the legend stopped by Suvorov during his stay in Ufe," said Alexander Dmitrijevic Lavrentev, head of the family.
The roofs are high, space.
One bad thing. Everybody's smashing around, falling down, falling down.
The neighbors must have already told!
The most of the torture we have with the floors: wooden boards were rotten, the earth literally went out of the feet.
I put backs, claws; there's nothing else in the hall, and we're walking in the other room, like we're screwing up on the cocktails.
A house of trader Eudokim Demidav Aleksandr Dmitrijevic could tell better about any excursion guide.
The gold industry is treated as a family, speaking of him with admiration.
Indeed, the identity was urgent: the Master of Cagin and Uzian factories built homes, poured guns and blobs, held Ural mines.
Shopping real estates are proud of their ancestors, but they no longer want to live under one roof with history.
I have moved here as a child, in the '40s of the 20th century,” said Alexander Dmitrijevic.
The wooden rooms for carriages, stables, and caraulic boxes were then removed.
In 1968, they wanted to clean our house, but something stopped...
History has been repeated in 2014: new housing has been tricked again.
We, as a team, gathered all documents, covered the necessary instances, and suddenly learned that the transfer to the apartment was transferred for 2015 or 2016.
There's something we don't believe in...
Two years ago, Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Baškortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
The housing officials didn't accept.
They were sent from one table to another and then, in a laugh, issued a paper without signature and printing, "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the displacement of residents."
I've even felt that our house has been out of town for a long time, since it was first under number 57, then became 57 A, and now 57/1.
It's like it's been taken down in the '70s.
The Russian Planet addressed the head of the information and analysis sector for land resources management of Ufa Vladimir Barabas.
The house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the settlement programme of housing.
I cannot be responsible for the actions of the 70s officials, but I know that there was a plan for all old homes at the time, despite the historical importance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities to restore all old houses on the street of the October Revolution representing architectural value was successfully implemented.
The inhabitants are soon planned to settle in new apartments.
According to Barabash, the home of Demidov will be restored by Italian experts who were participating in the restaurant of buildings in Venice.
The architectural biennale is currently being held in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is presented there among others.
Hopefully, by 2016, the entire old Casanese Street will be restored,” said the official.
The home will be acquired by the appropriate species that were before three centuries ago.
The home of Demidov will probably be a museum opened to all those who wish.
In addition, at the Government level, it was decided to make the street walking on weekends.
Unfortunately, there will be no way to be too high in the city.
The displacement of people from the future museum Vladimir Barabas promises in 2015.
Nevertheless, they may not remain satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the present.
Only from another age.
The forest fire began in the Primorie.
The dry storm was the cause of a forest fire in the Territory of the Hunting Party forests in the Primor region.
A grouping of forces and funds is being raised at the scene of explosion.
According to the Guide of the KGSB, the Naval Aviation Base, the conditions established at the fire are required to attract the air forces.
Vasilij Medvedev, Deputy Chief of Aviabaza:
The fire in a difficult area was discovered by an observer from the board of an N-2 patrol aircraft on the 3 hectares area.
The wooden remnants are burning on the old burner.
The huge degradation of the territories and the crude slope of more than 45 degrees, the absence of fire disposable grounds creates significant difficulties in torture.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The shipping of forces available to the airbase by the MI-2 and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the detection of the fire, four firefighters were immediately exploded.
The main challenge of professionals is to gas fire and to prepare a field for additional forces and fire equipment.
In the area of lunch, three firefighters are additionally delivered to the village of Lovenich.
As soon as the helicopter lands in the fire area is ready, the experts will be transferred to the seat of dust, reported on the website of the Administration of the Primorian Land.
My father never hugged me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of the seven children born in the family of immigrants from Jamaica to Dudley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory, and their relationships were limited.
Henry is practicing the comedy, "Red Rudy Plate", which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and has grown from a series of radio 4.
Saundtreck is a mixture of reggy and a tail, and melodies are vivid.
However, Henry had to get through some difficult memories of childhood.
After his mother died, there was a lot of treatment, in addition, Henry often thought about his father's relationships.
He was very unavailable.
You've never seen his face; you've heard his voice, "Don't noise.
Get off your sister.
Move!
I want to watch the cricket.
My senior brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the form of a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket.
I've never spoken to him like that.
He was such a smiling guy in the corner who read the newspaper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a lithium workshop in Dudley and, although the conditions were better than in his father’s day, he could see what his life must have been.
It's a little better now, but it's dark, smoke, labyrinth depths with flames of fire and smoke and a dog of sagi.
My father climbed into the bath and just lived there, and you heard him sing slowly because he wanted to wash out of the lithium workshop.
When I got there, I realized that he was doing this for years and years to make money for us, and I began to appreciate it more.
Nevertheless, Henry left a child deprived of parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
Only when my mom got sick at the end of her life, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Franch, allowed him to share the love he lacked when he was a child.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don Franch.
Why don't I get friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still excellent friends with Franch, whom he was married for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I get friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I've been very, very well and I've had diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.
Then I began serious exercises with fittens, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
No one eats carrots.
The change in Henry's career trajectory may be reflected in his noble, short-shaved beard.
Since he received acknowledgement of critics for his Othello, he was totally flying into the theater.
Followed the "Commedia of mistakes" and then "Feeds" of August Wilson.
This work is different from sitcoms and comedies, which were the inalienable attribute of its saturated professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed him paroded on the scene and wrote about it in the New Face.
His television career started in mid-70s, "I've been the only black parodist/comic on TV for a long time."
He was at work.
I didn't just have to grow in the eyes of the public, but I had to learn to be an effective ridiculous car between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working on TV, and it was very difficult.
Lenny in New Persons in 1975
Since his manager had the right to "Black and White Arrows" show, a light fun program in which people "make their face" Henry found out that he was speaking in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I think I wish that's never been with me, but I don't regret doing this.
Although it was a strange, condemned position, I worked on large places and learned to work with a crowd.
But what was "the reward of the easy entertainment classic on British TV years and years" was also "grothesic parody on black people".
Representing characters that have even been abusing the culture of black people in Britain and singing it, Henry worked in an alternative comedian project in the 80s.
The first season of "Show Lenny Henry" was translated in 1984, and in the '90s, it was known as, among other things, the chief cook Garrett Blacklock from the "Chef!" comedy series.
The advertising films, documentary movies, televisions and movies took the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC series in 2008, LennyHenry.tv, he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little bit like you're taking the time or you're turning a little bit away."
Further was a series of documentary transfers to Radio 4 entitled "What's Good in...?"
The first one was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergic to Shakespeare.
You can't say that I'm taught this in school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the prerogative of white people in the middle class with collaborators and the capustate at the bottom of the front.
So I was really afraid of him.
Everyone who took the interview for the transfer, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You have to try.
Don't blame it until you know what you're talking about.
Speak out some of these words, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from the last Otello monologue for documentation, and he was trapped.
I feel like I can do this.
It's like they fixed my head.
"It is a serious matter, seriously, learn your text, conduct a little study.
So the trial was hard, and I've read this play months and months before we set it up.
And she had a success.
They seemed to be waiting for a disaster, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started the "Commedia of mistakes".
Suddenly I'm at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical disorder, and Henry instinctly felt that his case was to entertain the public.
"Your voice inside me said, "You have to work 10 minutes until they make the computer."
Instead, the assistant of the director announced that the presentation would be resumed as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the scene and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my duty.
I can let someone else handle this.
"You're playing a play, stay in the role."
Henry's in the Bays at the Daches Theatre.
It was hard to learn the text for the Ovens.
Panic is pretty useful, it strengthens the muscle.
She was also accepted well, so it was like a sign above, showing, "That's what you need to do."
He said that, of course, by the voice of the GROMO.
So I'm holding it.
I really like that.
I like being in the rehearsal.
By the way, Henry still has a comic thinking - the whole road of our conversation smacks his humor when he starts, it ends with paroding.
I just decided not to work in the stenda, because this thing with the immediate remuneration from the full room of strangers, I think it's pretty dangerous.
If you're trying to do this all the time, it might be a bit of a trap.
Sometimes I work at the Primous Air in Apollo when I want, but mostly, I don't get the same pleasure as I used to.
I'm asking if he'll give a stendap tour again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shaping the beginning, in the middle and in the end of the road - I don't think I'm ever going to give up.
So that's his new invention?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a nice party.
You always tell a story, and there's a great place for that.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers public officials to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya began the biometric registration of all public officials in attempting to remove the “invisible workers” from the government's payment statement.
The Government's statement states that the staff who are not registered for the next two weeks will no longer pay.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive wages after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyath promised to reduce corruption in public structures after he arrived in 2013.
The audit check earlier this year found that at least $70,000 ($700000) per month is missing through the payments of " invisible workers" and other financial violations.
The Government suspects that wages continue to come to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves a public service, reporter of BBC Vanyam Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All state officials must appear in the identification centres for the next two weeks to ensure that their data will be collected through the biometric registration procedure, stated in the Government statement.
Anyone who does not do so without respect will be excluded from the payment statement, it is reported.
"The procedure will significantly improve the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public officials, and will also be used to cleanse the payment statement at both levels of the Government, thus end the problem of invisible workers," said Anne Weiguru, Secretary of the Ministry of Planning and Structuralization.
Dozens of Turkish police have been arrested for “contract” against the Government
All 33 police officers were detained in Turkey under suspicion of “contract against Government”, reports local information agencies.
The police representatives did not comment at once.
Among the detainees were 14 high-level officers, reports Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them participated in corruption activities last December, which were aimed at verifying Government staff, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested under suspicion of organized criminal grouping and telephone hearing.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (which was at the time Prime Minister) identified their actions as part of the measures taken against him and other authorities, the Islamic Cliric of Fethullah Gullen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
The schools in most Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a great event for families, and, as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenium Yacenuk took his daughter to school.
He said to the anticipated journalists that not all schools were opened again, but that he would do all the best to protect the country for future generations:
The ceremony did not take place in every school on September.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for the peaceful heavens.
All Ukraine, a huge one Ukrainian people's front, must fight for the peaceful heavens.
Alexan Pastuchov, the director of the school in Slovenia, whom Yacenuka's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future life.
The first day the school is traditionally noted by the children wearing shirts, holding airballs in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Ronna Fairheed BBC, she may have found such an impressive manager she needs.
It follows the glory from the world of banking, media management and internal circles of the Tori Party.
In fact, she has her own experience in management positions.
Her career began in a consulting company on the global management of Bain and Co, and then continued in Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the world in Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, retiring, when the high post in Pearson's headquarters took a man who was a less low-posted colleague.
They say it's nearing a million pounds.
Its political evaluation is also strong.
It was recommended to David Cameron Brown, former head of BP when he tried to bring specialists from the private sector to Whitehall: she became a ministerial adviser.
Her husband was Tori's former advisor.
Previously in May, I called the work of the chairman of the poisoned cup.
BBC is not only a huge and complicated organization in the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two directions: the upper level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but also the voice of public concern and anxiety when something goes wrong.
It is almost unattainable dupolium, which requires a full radical reform.
However, what new chairman would risk coming, exhausting and destroying the Institute as complex as the Chinese dynasty if he had to lose his own work in this process.
It's a difficult decision.
It wouldn't be so difficult, many people would be happy to see the BBC shortened, after revising its powers, finances and status.
As competitors scale the circle and new technologies challenge comfortable old habits, inevitable negotiations on the value of the licence are a special danger for BBC.
For a modest amount of £145,50 a year, the British acquire a share in definitely the biggest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that the results of its work cover 96 per cent of households and costs only 40p per day.
Furthermore, Beeb's popularity is increasing: 53 per cent have been supported today against 31 per cent of 10 years ago.
The BBC view and use models have changed: I now receive the news headlines on the mobile phone and look at the missed iPlayer programs.
But it remains a very popular and impressive establishment.
He needs an impressive chairman. I hope he found him.
Perry from Texas says that a humiliating tweet was written by someone foreign.
The Twitter from the reaffirmed account of Governor Texas, Republican Rick Perry, on Sunday night, contained an insulting picture of the District Prosecutor from the Democrats, which is in the centre of the criminal prosecution of the abuse of power.
Tweet was later removed and followed by another Perry account in which the record was desaved.
I just got a tweet published from my account, which was written by someone else.
"I do not approve of this tweet, and I removed it," reports the later record.
Perry's assistants did not immediately respond to the request for comment.
Although the records were loaded from the Perry account confirmed, it was not clear who was actually a publisher in that tape.
The early tweet contained an awkward cartoon on the prosecutor of the District Travis Rosemery Lemberg, who recognized the guilty of driving in the state of drunkenness in April 2013.
Perry prohibited the financing of her agency when she refused to resign, which led to the trial of a great jury in Austin in this month against Perry, which was a potential candidate at the 2016 elections.
Your signature says, "I don't always drive a car in a state of drunkenness three times above the acceptable level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do it, I'm accusing Governor Perry for telling me about it."
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg message did not investigate a major jury against Perry.
They were dealt with by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Anthonyo, who was appointed by the Republican judge.
Perry did not recognize himself guilty and called the charges a political trick.
His powerful legal team asked the judge who led the case to dismiss the accusation by saying that the law used for pursuing the governor who has been pursuing his duties longer than all over the history of Texas would disagree with the constitution.
Perry stopped funding for $7.5 million from the State Public Control Division, which is based in Travis County and pursues corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
Veto filed a formal complaint by a public control group with left views.
Perry's confirmed account is often updated, and sometimes it becomes famous.
At the fifth meeting of the party in Iowa during its presidential campaign in 2012, Perry replied to the rumors that he could get out of the game by publishing a tweet with a photograph of himself running next to the lake and said, "Here we, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reported that the real estate market returned to "normal state"
One of the most famous constituents of London warned that the real estate market in South-Eastern England has turned back to a normal level of activity.
The house in the capital was the subject of a live demand and rapidly growing prices, and the fears of the bank of England will be embarrassed by the credit bubble in June to establish the limits on mortgage loans.
Tony Piggley, the founder and the chairman of the elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday, " Since the current financial year, the market returned to the normal level of transactions from the year 2013," added that this provided a “stable work environment”.
The London real estate market was successful during the decline, since foreign buyers moved to the capital.
The prices in the city increased by 18.5 per cent for one year, according to the Earth’s Inventory, by substantial average of 6.7 per cent in England and Wales as a whole.
The average market prices on private, accessible and student schemes of Berkeley increased about one fifth last year, reaching $423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London's real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of which also stopped the introduction of new taxes on real estate and political rhetoric around the potential " taxes on qualifications" in the next May.
The London Employment Agency of Foxtons last week warned that April's reform of the mortgage market, under which more strict conditions for loans were introduced, would also reduce market growth both the sales deal and prices in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from the Bank of England showed the decrease in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, assuming further refrigeration on the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its price growth for London real estate for 2015 to 3 per cent on the basis of a weakening price for real estate.
The volumes of transactions, however, fell to a quarter compared to the previous year in the most expensive regions of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfer and Kensington, on WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the demand for houses in the capital was very useful for Berkeley, with a sale increase of $2.2 billion.
Mr. Piggley added: "The demand for good-designed good and best-local goods remained old and, reflecting that, sales were kept for a period of time."
In June, the company reported that it sold 3742 new homes in this year until the end of April, almost a third of the docrisis peak of 2007.
The annual tax income increased by 40 per cent compared to the previous year to $380 million, income by 18 per cent to $1.6 billion.
On Monday in front of the company's annual meeting, Mr. Piggley reported that the alleged revenues of Berkeley for this year would be in line with the current market expectations.
According to analyst's unanimous views, income is expected for a year before the tax payment of $450 million.
The cost of the shares of Berkeley was held at £23.96 at the end of the afternoon at the London market.
Naked Jennifer Lawrence photos published online by hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrived at the 85th ceremony of the annual prize of the American Academy.
The photos of the naked actress, Jennifer Lawrence, who received the Oskar Prize, were presented on the Internet by a hacker who assured that she had a "catalog" of the other 100 eastern stars.
The representative of the star Hungry Games confirmed that the photographs of Lawrence were real, and condemned the hacker for "a sudden invasion into the personal space".
The law enforcement authorities have been addressed, and they will persecute anyone who will publish the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Photos that were initially exposed to the 4chan photos website were allegedly received because of the lack of the Apple iCloud online storage system, and the alleged " catalogue" of the victims of the breakdown includes the names of dozen women, including Ryana, Kim Cardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
I don't know how many of these photos are true, although the Scott Pilligrim star against everyone, Winstead also condemned the invasion in Twitter.
"The one who watches the photos we made with my husband a few years ago when we were alone at home, I hope you're proud of yourself," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justis, from the Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victory winner", denied that she wrote on the photos in Twitter, "Twitter's so-called photos of the naked me FALSHIVEKI, people.
Let me stop it in the fertility.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that the pop star representative of Ariana Grande objected to the fact that the photos on which it was supposed to be true.
Exclusive fragment of Howard Jacobson's new novel on love and letter "J", which called for criticism
They were dissolving, best to say so, they gradually broke up like the cardboard box that they left under the rain.
Only sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, hard in association, tense, closed and perhaps a little irritating.
And then she squeezed his hand.
He saw his irritation.
He was a bitch, like a barrel, yeah.
The last victim of this ring was a small romance that he expected more than usual, relief from lonely and boring life, and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a tremblingly crushing beauty with shaken hair and a heartbreaking from the northern island village, even more remote and cruel than Port Royben.
She arrived south with a satellite older of herself, which Kevern considered her aunt, and the last she had inherited a house in a raw, but similar to a paradise valley called the happy name "Ray Valley".
No one has lived in the house for years.
The tubes flowed, the spiders were sitting in the baths, the slippers left their traces on all the windows confident that the house belonged to them; the garden grew up with squirrels like the giant coaches.
It was like a house from a child book, a scary and charming, full of mysterious garden.
The author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose "J" novel was included in the longo list of the Booker Prize in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week
Kevern and Eileen were sitting behind their hands in broken sheslongs among high grass, enjoying a sudden warm spring day; they both connected to a cheap console that supplied the country of peaceful music and calming news when he looked at her brown legs, he remembered the old song of a long-forgotten black performer who loved to listen to his father, deserted the curtains in the house.
You've got too big legs.
Because of their aggression, such songs were no longer lost on the console.
They were not forbidden. Nothing was forbidden. They were not lost anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, just as the word "archaic".
The public taste did something that would never be achieved by orders and regulations, and just as among the books people chose memoares of riches who grew up in poverty, culinary books and loving romans, they chose ballades from all the music.
In this day, Kevern began to play in imaginary piano and a rough comic voice to sing the big legs of Eileen.
Eileen didn't understand.
"It was a popular jazz pianist named Fates Waller," he said to her, putting two fingers on the lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she drops off his lips.
This started with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father played with her with his father, as he told him.
Start the word "J", forget to put two fingers on your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew he was expecting it, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen never heard of him.
Neither did Jazz play, even though he was not openly forbidden.
Improvization is out of fashion.
There's only one "if" place left in life.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it was going to end.
It's just the same thing with a embarrassment.
His unpredictableness affected people.
The jazz was an awesome expression of music.
Although he was 10 years old and never heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew about the jazz from the father's half-secret collection of discs.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fatts Waller was black.
In view of her age, she was unlikely to remember the time when the popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressures.
The society was obedient, which meant that each of its segments had agreed with gratitude to those preserved by the fate - with the principle of grouping.
The people of the Afro-Caribbean origin of the temperament and physical characteristics were good for entertainment and sports - and they sang and run.
Exiters from Indostan, as if from nature, talented in everything that affected electronics, had taken care that no family would have left the working electronic phone.
What remained from the Polish diaspora was sanitation; what remained from Greek was a tape.
Exiters from the Persian Gulf and Levanta, whose grandfathers did not quickly leave the country when they had opened restaurants with labs and nails, were not exhausted and missed by the flames, in fear of their own, saying that the flame would swallow them by the following.
Everyone on the ability.
Since she had heard only ballades before, Eileen was hard to understand how insulting words that Kevern had just spoken to her could have been put on music at all.
Music is the expression of love.
"They are not really insulting," said Kevern.
Unless, maybe for people who have big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He said too much, but the running garden gave him a illusion of security.
No word could come through the sound of the giant leaves that looked like couches.
Eileen still didn't understand.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say that it was a joke, but he didn't want to press two fingers again at her mouth.
She already thought it was weird.
"He seemed ridiculous," he said instead.
She shook her head uncertainly by closing the Kevr overview.
There was nothing in the world but the land of her black hair.
Nothing he'd like to look at.
"Well, if you say so," she said, staying with her opinion.
But that still doesn't explain why you're eating it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
The boats, maybe, a little bit...
And you're saying you hate me because my irons are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you because you have fat irons," he tried to say instead.
I have such a pervert.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
The attempts to joke often led him into uncomfortable situations, because, like his father, he lacked the calming charm that could mitigate the brutality of the jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted, too, Kevern.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons was red and risen from the shezlong, spinning the console and spilling the wine they were drinking.
The wine from the bowl, so the drunkenness could not serve him as an excuse.
In her enthusiasm, she seemed to be trembling like palm leaves in the hurricane.
"And I like you because you have a stupid head," she said...
Even though you don't like you.
He was sorry for her and for the excessive rudeness of his words, and for the fear that appeared in her view when she resisted him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She did not talk to him about life in a cold northern architecture where she grew up, but he had no doubt that she was mostly like this.
The same enormous ice ocean smashed both of them.
The same men, even more sensitive and embarrassed after what has been done, if their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers were floating from pub to pubs, ready to raise their hand on any woman daring or irritating them.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid fist if she hadn't been careful!
First, the kiss would now become the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote from the fresh ballades that the console issued -- first to kiss her and then hit her.
Absolute clarification, in Kevern’s opinion, because the kiss of himself has already been a cruelty.
Eileen Solomons showed that he had to leave.
He climbed out of the shezlong like an old man.
She felt the gravity of the pencil, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She was watching him leave, and from the top window she watched him leave, her satellite was a man who put his weight on her own.
Adam, who left the garden, thought she.
She felt an illustration of compassion for him and men at all, even though some of them had raised her hand.
The man who turned away from her, with a grieving back, beaten, beaten, all the ability to combat left him - why did she think she knew it so well if she couldn't remember any case, until today, when she saw that?
Again, Eileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above or around that Esma Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at Offnau, the informal public-controlled monitoring service, prepared a small report on the preservation of low and medium-sized violence in the same parts of the country where it was expected to be reduced if it was not completed, taking into account the resources and forces allocated to its eradication.
"Mnogy have been done and many are done," she wrote, "to mitigate the inferior aggressiveness of people who fought in thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these screwed branches and narrow dissociations in the area, where despite the seasons of churches, the gentle breathing of human goodness was rarely experienced throughout history.
However, some qualities are unexpected.
The higher the pinch would seem, the lower the passions that it produces.
The population tears over sentimental ballades, swallows stories of overcome obstacles and declares its dirty faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old roughness remains strong in the rural and urban communities, but there is also data that new and wretched diversity in houses, at workplaces, on roads and even in the playgrounds.
"You have an awkward habit of writing too much," said her scientist, reading the report entirely.
I think you should read less of the romance.
Esme Nussbaum's head down.
I should also ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," answered Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esma again insisted on her right to private life and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I ask," Luther Rabinovic finally said, "not because I am against atheism, lesbian or feminism.
We don't have any prejudice here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some of the types of hypersensitivity, completely acceptable and commendable by themselves, may sometimes distort the results, such as what you showed me.
Obviously, you are predicted against the church, and what you call "worst" and "grub" others would interpret as the expression of natural lifelessness and energy.
Continue to offer on TOM what has happened if it has been more generally, as if it happened, if it even happened yesterday, would mean to deprive the country the necessary life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinovic spoke.
For his head, pink, like Flamingo, the lightlight letters repeated the councils that "Offnau" gave to the country the last fourth century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, value your husband, listen to the ballades, go to music, talk on the phone, talk, explain, listen, accept, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the word of the song is better than the written word, but there's nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you're saying," said Esme Nussbaum quietly when she made sure that her scientific leader had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything but that we have not cured as effectively as we persuade ourselves.
I am concerned that if we are not ready, we will find that we are repeating mistakes that have initially led to what has happened if there has been more.
Only this time we will throw out our anger and untrust on others.
Luther Rabinovic connected his fingers to the pyramid.
This gesture had to mean endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "a calling the mistakes" actions that have done or did not do our grandfathers.
You're going too far and when you're saying that they threw their wraths and the untrustedness into others.
In your place, a person should not need a reminder that, understanding the past, that is, protecting the real, we don't talk about us and them.
There were no "we" and no other.
It was a mess time, that's all we know.
"Which, if being honest with yourself," he dared to insert Esme, "none part of the society can justify himself well.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good - what was done, it was done.
It was then.
You don't have to say anything else. We agree here.
And if you don't have to blame anyone, you don't have to be excused if it was appropriate or if it could be fixed.
But why the past, if not to learn?
The past is for us to forget it.
If I can add one word to that...
Luther Rabinovica's pyramic crashed.
"I will consider your report," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on the way to work, she was beaten by a motorist who went to the trip, as they described, "in awful rage."
Coincidence occurs.
The Lesoto Army claims that the turn was not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The representatives of the Lesoto Army rejected the preparation of a revolution to demolish the Government, claiming that they acted against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanaticians.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabanne left the country, saying that the army of the country had surrounded his official residence and captured government buildings in the capital of Maser.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa, claiming that he had been threatened with an attempt on his life.
The representative of the army, Major Ntlele Ntoi, stated that there was no conversion, but that the army had responded to the threat of political fans whom the police tried to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the command of the Lesoto Armed Forces has taken action by receiving several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police forces that really plan to arm some political, young political party fans who were ready to create chaos," he informed the vote of America.
The representative of the South African Government, Clayson Moniela, stated that the action of the army was a turnover.
"Which no one has made claims for the capture of power, the actions of the Lesotho armed forces are now mainly reversed," he said.
The representatives of the Lesoto Army reported that the soldiers returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, the Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Metsing manages the Government in the absence of Taban.
Tabane said he believed that he was being attacked in connection with attempts to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesoto was very tense since June, when Tabana suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in its united Government.
He stated that his actions had not been undermined by the Government, despite the charges of the opposite.

Production in the eurozone at the lowest rate for 13 months
The growth of production in the eurozone slowed down to the lowest rate of 13 months in August, according to the popular study.
The latest significance of the business activity index (PMI) of the euro area on Markit has fallen until 50.7 in August, describing from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders have been delayed, and enterprises have suffered from increasing tensions between the EU and Russia in relation to Ukraine.
The European Central Bank Assembly (ECB) came to significance on Thursday.
The markets will wait for a clear plan of how to deal with the recovery of the eurozone and with the threat of deflation in the inflation of only 0.3 per cent.
There is an assumption that the ECB leader Mario Dragi later this week could provide additional signals that he was considering the quantitative mitigation scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although some growth is even better than no growth, the braking effect of growing economic and geopolitical indetermination on producers becomes more obvious," said Rob Dobson, senior economist Markit.
The PMI production sector of Germany, the largest Russian trade partner in the EU, fell to the lowest of 11 months of mark 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second size of the block economy, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to cause real concern, as is the weakening of Italy from stable growth to stagnation.
The signs that the pulse of the growth has stopped mainly industrial engine, Germany, as well as Spain and the Netherlands, also do not add confidence," said Mr. Dobson.
The slowing of industry, most likely, will still pass the oil into the fire of analysts waiting for additional monetary or budgetary incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI grew up to 57.3 since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the main economist of IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about August's study of the Eurozone business activity index is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: "The eurozone manufacturers are apparently finding life very difficult at present, since the current increased geopolitical tension, particularly related to Russia/ Ukraine, adds uncertainty to still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension was apparently hit by business -- especially on consumer confidence, and it may lead to some orders to delay or even cancel, especially large orders.
He said, "It's more like that," that the ECB would, of course, have to make some sort of quantitative mitigation, "although we suspect it would be limited."
Marioupole residents will expose a living chain against adolescents
In Mariupol until last week, it was all calm -- no one was in the way to organize the Mariopoly People's Republic, the city in the Azov Sea lived and worked.
Now the inhabitants are looking forward to the arrival of the mutuals.
According to the version of politologists, separatists have been invaded to Marioupole to get to the Azov Sea, recently taken by the city of Novoazsk, which has not been composed of self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariupolis decided that the Ukrainian army would protect them, but she had little forces against the well-armed representatives of LDCs, and was about to help the troops.
They're rotting roofs, building blocks and strengthening.
On Saturday night, several thousand inhabitants arrived to the eastern border of the city and stood there in a living chain, singing Ukraine's hymn.
They're going to do the same in the case of an attack.
Volunteers collect and ride equipment and foods, collect drugs, issue the newspaper.
The city has gradually closed shops, banks and bankomats cease.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years since the horrible school enrollment, as children who have been in it, are still suffering
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were hostaged by Czech warriors at school in Beslan, Southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of whom children were killed during this three-day test, which shook the world
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who have deceived death during the sovereignty at school.
Just ten years later, after the horrible abduction of the Noslan school, 334 people, including 186 children who survived the heroic disaster, warned about the new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When terrorists, Islamic fanaticians, took and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, it seemed like an extreme degree of possible evil.
The tragedy united the east and the west in disgusting, which then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future under the most difficult tribulation.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who deceived death during the wickedness of school.
We have discovered remarkable young people who opposed trouble, although the memories of terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now tormenting Ukraine, where children like them are dying, will now end.
A girl who's trying to get back to the shooting sports hall.
It was sealed in a picture of a famous Russian photographer, Dmitri Beljakov, when she tried to get back into a fired sports hall after the mine explosion.
In disgustingness, Aida was desperately looking for her mother, Larissa, now 40.
There were fears that they both died, but indeed they survived.
"The woman told me to run all the way, but I couldn't," said Aida then.
My legs were covered with blood.
I got up and climbed back to find my mother.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a row of operations, she thought she was completely recovered, but yesterday she said, "The pain came back three months ago.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
A few pieces left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become dentist, to help people just as doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it certainly didn't break it," she said with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and it can't change the fact.
Once a year, I always go to this sports hall to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Jerra Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed about going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my school and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says that the capture remains with her, although the memories are a little overwhelming every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from Britain and everywhere.
When I see a photo on the Internet where I go into the school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and make it not happen again.
The boy who ran through the city of bullets, considering his mother dead
It was his first day in school (the Russians start school at 7 years) and he survived three days of encouraging his mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mom told me to go down if there was an explosion and hold her for the hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Get away."
Fearing her dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the road, grabbed the child for his hand and ran through the city of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara got free and was in a hospital with foot wounds, in turn thinking that her son died.
After they were reunified, she said, "I cried from joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran and hugged me.
Damir was later brought to London (now existing News of the World), where he was rewarded as the Protector of Children from the Barnardo's Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sherry.
"This horror returns to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him," he said yesterday.
Anyway, I can tell you, he's missing me.
I remember when I threw out all my toy weapons right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard that never came out.
We never say they're killed or dead.
We're saying they're staying in the sports hall.
I remember my journey to London so well, especially a toy store where I was allowed to choose everything I want, and a car with an open top.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the tribulation that he and his friends have experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who worked volunteer work last week in a female monastery.
I want to help.
I want to serve at the police once, and I hope I'll be enrolled in the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the horrible silence right after the capture, just there were no children who would scream and run around, and this silence went on for months.
She remembers her journey with Damir to London.
People in London cried when I was telling our story.
I realized how people on the other end of the earth can understand our feelings, they can provide support.
She was grateful to " Sherry Blair and her fund for that reward and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I'd like to call Sheri and just tell her that it's been ten years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat a borsh, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in the restaurant, Damir shot them from his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And only a month after our nightmare then.
I was thrilled that the British were so prepared to divide our pain and support us.
She said, "I don't think this world's been better for ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of children were killed and killed.
They're just the same kids as ours.
I think for many people the war is a news report they're listening to when they're bored or when they're busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, awful of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, not aggressive or angry at all.
He's not looking for messengers, for example, he's not in the past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the sports hall from time to time and burn candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it -- I remember he was lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw out all his weapons and other military toys.
I can't believe that I've been so sure that he's dead for hours and that I'll never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and get on my feet, I looked around, and I saw hell around me when parts of the body lie everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy couldn't survive in this hell.
"I remember screaming to him, Damir, run, run," but I was so sure he didn't hear me again.
But he heard and ran.
This is how life continues for us, unlike so many others.
Georgie Ilin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photograph after capture has become a tragedy in Beslan
Room: Beslan Georgie Illin and his mother Fatima after capture in 2004, and Georgie's right today
His bleeding face had a fearprint when he was saved from death when the Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, the chief physician, took him to school the first day of school before taking the senior son of Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before terrorists ran into court, so my little boy remained alone for three nightmares," she recalled.
Not exactly alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
My only Georgia survived.
The closer this date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is no day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time in my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
The photograph of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking attacks and was eternalized in the sculpture (right)
I remember that Georgie wanted to go to school the day he said he wanted to hug a teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of Georgia's crying in San Marino.
Georgie doesn't like to look at this photograph, and it's hidden in a bookbox in our house.
I understand, but I also feel that this picture makes people from around the world feel our pain.
George now says, "It's important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever learn the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never learn the truth.
Now they're investigating the Boing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what it was called?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, so how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need tens of years to forget her a little bit.
She influenced my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years I dreamed of nightmares because of the enthusiasm, but now it's getting better.
I returned to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I continue to go to this sports hall every 1 September.
I want to give the memory to my old friends of childhood.
It's hard for me to go into the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I'm not sorry for myself.
My life continues.
I graduated from school this year and went to medical university in Vladikawaza.
I'll learn to become a cardiac surgeon.
My first choice was to go to the army.
I wanted to be military, but health didn't allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
George Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived, despite what he was at the foot of the killer's terrorist
Unbelievable: Georgi Farniev was at the feet of a terrorist who had been captured, but he survived.
During the capture, he was photographed in a sports room sitting next to the bomb at the foot of the killer's terrorist.
Really, it's a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," said Georgie, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer at the FSB, but couldn't do it because of the damage caused by his health during the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say the kids are easy to deal with bad events - I have to say it's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget that.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the next year was the first and last time I entered this sports hall again.
I've lost my consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show me where I was sitting on this famous photograph.
Personal: Georgie Farniev today with a photo of himself open on the laptop in the hospital after capture
My pain is enormous, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
With regard to the physical condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but I'm walking right now.
But health didn't let me go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical opinions, and they said it was impossible.
My second interest was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've studied there for two years.
He's learning to treat all animals from cats to cows.
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
This is not what children should know, and of course not what they must experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary comes near.
I'll go and attend the ceremony that will be held to mark it.
I know Georgie won't go.
It should be even stronger for him because he was there, and I didn't.
I was waiting for him home and I couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me.
He's staying with us.
Georgie is now adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something's so terrible injustice happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it because of his knees.
He had several operations, he could walk, but he can't sport.
I'd say he'd overcome 50% this nightmare, but it's impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This horrible experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and that only strengthens my pain.
I've lost a lot of people I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son with me, and it's the best gift God could do to me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know the families where new children were born, but I know the widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life continues, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what happens in the world -- wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how did it happen that we were fighting now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure a lot of children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If you could grab all the rebels and throw away as far as you can.
Allena Zkaeva, 10 years old
A bride who was touched to the safe place of specialized men
Rescued: Allenu Zkaev is carrying the Russian Specialnase (left) to a safe place.
Now she's ten, and she doesn't even remember the monster crime.
The world had stopped breathing in 2004 when the Russian police had taken Alenna out of school captured in Beslan.
She was released by terrorists, but her 30 - year - old mother, a 10 - year - old sister Christine and brother Mahara left her in the school sports room.
Mahar, who was then three years old, was saved, but Allen’s mother and sister died in a fatal battle.
Her father Ruslan has married again since, and they and his new wife Lightlana have a little daughter he called Christine in memory of the daughter he lost.
Allena, who is now ten, does not remember anything about the capture and flourishing into a smart and lifelong girl, say the neighbors.
"They are the great happy family now, and Allena and Mahar are both beautiful children," said a close friend.
Ruslan is a brilliant father and wants to keep them away from all the memories when the tenth anniversary is marked.
You can understand why.
Semi-protected Cindy Kagawa, who returned from the Manchester United to the Dortmund Bureau, said he was looking forward to coming back in a German club.
He said that this transfer is a joyful event in his career.
Of course, I'm very glad to play for Borussia again," the Bild of Kagawa's words.
I feel very good.
I'm looking forward to getting back on the Borussia field.
Recall, Kagawa was transferred to the MU from Borussia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he could not have been able to build up in the English club for two seasons of only 38 matches at the English championship, slamming six balls and giving eight efficient transfers.
A man accused of a girl in a pelican walk to Fife
A 78-year-old man will be presented in the case of a three-year-old girl in a pelican walk to Fife.
Gordon Stuart must have beat a girl on the move to Pittenvin to East Newk.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stuart had conducted his Audi Q3 without due care and attention and beat the girl, resulting in a trauma.
Stuart, 78, from Anstruter, denied his guilt at the Dandy Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles McNary, a royal attorney, appointed a January court date.
Obama, Merkel and Olland will not be loaded in Vladivostok
The Duty Free Airport Trade Store Hang a table that prohibits the purchase of a number of world political leaders in this store.
Not to be loaded with the ghosts, vodkas and horsemen.
The shop's administration decided that US President Barak Obama, Chancellor of FRG Angel Merkel, French President François Olland, Vitalia Kličko, Julia Timošenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other famous companions would not be able to be loaded with vodka, horseman and spirits in their shop.
And she pulled a tape to the door.
Rather, Obama had been prohibited from appearing in a less accessible facility - Dietical tables of IGU, as reported by the public site.
Did the American President dream ever eat in a diet meal in Russia, not known, but the authors of the bans clearly seem to be terribly clever.
Has there been cheese after embargo: Medvedev advised agrarias
Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev believes that new technologies should be equipped under the conditions of embargo for Russian agricultural agriculturals in order to manage the issue of cheese buyers.
The Council was presented during the visit of the Yugticeptor of the Agrocomplex company.
The head of the Government also advised the restauranters to reorientate the Russian meat, whose quality is at the right level.
The annual embargo for food imports has been introduced in Russia since 7 August.
The Chief Coach of Russia, Valentin Maslakov, is pleased with the outcome of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, the third place is a good result, taking into account the lack of targeted training for competition.
Our athletes have spoken at their level -- the whole sports of Maslakov's words.
Third place is to confirm our high-level level.
It's glad that the advantage of the French and even Americans over us is minimal.
We have to take note that we were not preparing for these competitions.
The season is over, and we have not committed our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we were second at this tournament, but in this season, we have been renewed.
The French, on the contrary, exhibited a competitive team, including 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which they had repeatedly declared publicly.
But even such a competitive composition could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians have spoken in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some types were below the same "Briliant League".
Season finished.
Of course, sportsmen are no longer so important as to competitively competitive.
The main thing was here was the place.
As a result, it was absurd when 1500 m of men were so excited with tactical tricks of running that showed the result of lower average... female races.
4 hints how to achieve better quality of submarine photos and videos
If you want to photograph or take a video underwater, you have a number of options on the machine.
The cheapest option is a water-neproducing mill, for example Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an exchn camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for approximately $300.
I made these photos on a family celebration with several cameras, all at a price of $350.
No matter what equipment you use, several rules must be respected in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have an aquatic camera, make sure that the battery is closed.
Furthermore, set up your camera for that type of photos or videos that you will film.
Some photographs and videocams have image modes or types of object that optimize exposure for dark subconditions.
And before jumping into the water, find out how deep your device can fall.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Take a look at our customer's leadership and digital camera ratings for both traditional and aquatic models.
Take a few shots, because many of them won't work.
There's a CTD that will help you compile the photos, while the eschen camera usually doesn't have them.
Even if you have CTB, it will be hard to see under water, and the frame will be a random process.
So make a few shots.
Also, if your camera has a serial recording mode that takes a few shots with a little different exposure installations, use it.
Stay in the surface.
The number of lights is significantly lower than you go deeper under the water.
If possible, stay on the surface when you take off the pool, river or the ocean.
This will also allow you to transmit more colors on the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Swim closer to the film objects.
This is an excellent council to take off the land, but it is even more important under water because of the dark light conditions.
Especially important if you take it to the eschen camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle line, which means you have to get closer to the film objects if you want to fill the frame.
The 2012 Bronze Prize of the Olympic Games for Free Fighting, Billial Machov, could become a Greek-Roman fight.
This was reported by the chief coach of Dagestan on the free fight of Sajid Sajid.
The specialist did not exclude the participation of the sportsman in the peace championship in Taschent in September 2014.
Billial Machov is currently at the "classic" team, the words of Sajid Sadzid Sajidov in the R-Sport.
In fact, Billial was in both ways.
At the youth of the world in 2005, he became a winner of the volunteer tournament and a third prize in the Greek-Roman competition and decided to focus on the free fight.
A long time ago, talks that the new stage of our career will take our difficulty in the Greek-Roman fight.
I'll tell you more, Machov can speak at the world champion in Tashkent if he wins a concept.
But the crucial word is always behind the coach head with Gogi Koguashville.
Andrew Lawson was a person whose power of personality could have struck all around, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
The consulting anesthesiologist devoted his career to the excuse of both the suffering of the illness and the torture of treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife recalled the MI-6, officer who had to live with the destructive consequences of torture.
Lawson understood that while the doctors were involved in diagnosis and diseases, those who were treated primarily disturbed something completely different — pain.
Once in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel like usual," he wrote in May last year.
It was hard to find strength in me.
By fighting symptoms like the flu, he found that he irritated his wife, Juliet.
"I want this to happen faster than later," he said.
When Juliet left for a week, Lawson discovered that he was unusual and unusual why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to make a chest cell rentgen.
Just two weeks earlier, he was riding skies in the French Alps.
The rentgen results are here.
It was a mezotheliom, an insecurable cancer that affects the plug, or the lung shell.
For most cancers, it is difficult to find the exact reason.
Although some smokers have cancer of lungs, not all of the patients with cancer have smoked.
But the mezotheliom is different.
Almost in all cases, the cause is to contact asbestos, fiber construction material, which was once called "master", but which, as now known, is deadly dangerous.
For most of us, mezotheliom is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbest, eventually, is a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the recommended industrial ban has entered into force.
Even when it was used, only individuals from specific sectors worked closely with him: tube-izolators, builders, carpenters and docks workers, for example.
Industrial toxicity from another age, it is hardly seen cause for anxiety today.
But such calmness is wrong.
Great Britain appears to be on the epidemia epidemia today.
This is where more people die from mezotheliom than in any other country on the planet.
In the annual mortality, about 2.500 people die more than twice as a result of car accidents.
Annual deaths of mezotheliom since 1980 and predicted deaths in the future in Britain
The reason why we now feel his death implications is that, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (as all types of asbestos were eventually prohibited in 1999), mezothelioms are usually declined for the development of decades.
And the attack of mezotheliom is not limited to the veterans of industrial construction.
Asbest was, and in many cases, it remains in the house where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we learn, and the stores where we go for shopping.
As a result, mezothelioma does not pay attention to the class, the level of enrichment, profession or age.
The electoral basions, from the fashioned London universities to private schools, turned out to be saving.
The parliamentary building was asbestossed.
Even hospitals designed to treat us have proved to be reservations of this deadly cancerogene.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a tube-izolator.
In fact, he had to think where he could contact asbestos.
Then he understood.
"It seems to be a lot of asbestos in the tunnels in the Gay Hospital, where I spent six years at the internship," he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors and trucks used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my classmates will be sick with the same disease.
It was a question that, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"From four doctors who were trained in the Gay hospital and who had later developed mezotheliom in the past five years," he noted in his letter in 2010, "I have been one alive."
How many of us will get sick of this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed "mezotheliom" when he was 48 years old.
When he died, on February 17, this year, he was 55.
Living so long is unusual.
Fifty percent of the patients with mezotheliom die eight months after diagnosis.
She's always dead.
So now we can only repeat the question of Lawson, "How many of us will be sick with the same disease?"
According to the leading mezotheliom expert in Britain, Professor Julian Pito, most likely would assume that between 1970 and 2050, when the azbest epidemic in Britain should survive, about 90,000 people will die.
Most now don't know they're going to die like that.

The rapid review of the courtroom records, where the victims are often claiming compensation, shows how far the attack of mezothelioms has been spread.
In this June, for example, Marks & Spencer recognized that Janice Ellen had been contacted with asbestos in the underestimation.
She worked in the net for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, running two clothing departments, one of which was the main store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children older than 20 years old.
"Before it happened," she said, "I never heard of mezotheliom, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn't think that would touch me.
A few people really know much about asbestos.
In fact, the asbest is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They have received their name from the word "asbestistiform", which means a fiber structure that tells them the strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
The crizotil, widely known as white asbest, is much frequently encountered in buildings today.
It was used in roofing panels, tiles, thermoizolation of pipes, collapse, even in brakes of cars.
It is less mortal than other forms of asbestos, but yet recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a serious source of health damage, which can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, is a brown asbest (amozite) and blue asbestos (crokidolitis).
Great Britain was once the biggest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that " there are strong, although indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exclusively high number of patients with mezothelia [in Britain]."
Marks & Spencer was affected by asbest at the Oxford Street main shop, London Alamy
Janice Ellen may not think of herself as a typical mezotheliom victim, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her history is far unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that “the significant percentage of mezothelia, when there is no known impact on work or at home, was likely caused by an environmental asbestos.”
Most of this impact, he said, is caused by "ordinary use and weather" on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The report of Goddard Consulting, which was considered by the Westminster Palace, shows how people, even in the centre of the government, could have been affected unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines outside parliamentary committees were infected by asbestos, whose death fibers could be carried into something as harmless as " strong air flows".
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems to be the opposite.
Although the Parliament ' s Technical Services Directorate insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a " clean sanitation certificate", she now recognized that it was necessary to carry out a £1 billion for the reconstruction of the parliament, improving electricity and removing the asbest and that, after the general elections of 2015, members of the parliament may be sitting in the QE2 Conference Centre, not in Westminster's green chambers.
The Goddard report noted that “the situation with asbestos was not managed in accordance with different rules”.
It is not possible to find out whether this management error would be worth life.
All we can do now is wait.
One of those who have never detected their asbeth contact is Graham Abbott, a general practice doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50 years old, suspects that he was affected by asbestos when he worked in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital that had been successfully filed the asbetic lawsuits," he said, "But I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places where he worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in the beginning of December 2009, when he was hit by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the surgery late night.
Suddenly, I got a fever.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a physician, Abbott knew that pain was coming from the plunger, the shells around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he had no reason to suspect mezothelia.
Finally, he couldn't go to work for a month.
The disgusted doctors took rentgen images of the breast cell and placed plural categories to extract the liquid from the lungs and send it to analyses.
However, his condition remained undiagnosed.
He gradually improved his health, and he returned to work.
At times, however, the same symptoms were returned, often after he was at sports and breathing hard.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to him in a reception with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed "mezothelioma".
However, even then Abbott did not link this to his own case.
Finally, his patient was tens of years older and worked directly with asbestos.
The connection was obvious in this case.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition has increased again, and his consulting physician showed his results to the CT and the X-rays to the expert group.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott began to feel bad, the sensor equipped with the camera was incorporated into a shelter between his breast cell and his lung shell.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just go on," he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, honestly.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came between Christmas and New Year, "I was told that it was mezotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosticated mezotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott went into a meeting with nurses Macmillan, one of which invited him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"Asbest appears to have been used widely, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos termoizolation on pipes has been very often," he said.
People who have been affected by asbestos in these buildings are now sick of this disease.
Thus, mezothelioma is now impressed by more youths of non-type professions.
The most dangerous asbetic pipes in the hospitals were in the basement, so it is unlikely that patients are affected.
However, many of the officers who walked through the walking tunnels to get from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or to eat in the basement tables (as Graham Abbott often did) are almost likely to be affected by the toxic substance.
During a few decades after the war, hospitals appear to have been a place where, theoretically, they saved life for patients, but a place that threatened their life for doctors who were treated.
It's still being removed today.
Students set up Bunzen's heats for asbestos
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, shops, libraries and bureaues because of its amazing isolation and firearming characteristics.
Schools, too.
In fact, many were probably first affected by asbestos in class.
In countless chemistry lessons throughout the country, schools were setting up their Bunzen burns for asbestos.
Web sites have appeared to focus on the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, the nail tiles or roofs of the barbecues were generally containing asbest.
"This is a industrial poison placed in a huge number of our buildings," said Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against the Gay Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman could remember was a garden bark in the 1970s.
So be careful, wear garden barns.
The effect of diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is insecure, is huge.
"It takes a lot of time to realize," said Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I spent two weeks in surgery.
Then I realized that I had to go and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not meeting Christmas again.
One of the hardest things was the transition from the doctor's situation to the patient.
As a countless number of patients before it, he remembers the amount of information that had to be taken.
"It was hard to realize," he said.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I won't meet Christmas again.
That's it."
Mezotheliom is particularly dangerous, because the mechanism of how we support life is -- the very act of breath -- causes the cancer that kills.
Most of the cases of mezothelioms are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbest consists of small fibres.
When the asbestos is destroyed and the fibres breathe, they can be stuck in the plugs, the lung shells.
The azbest fibers irritate the pellet and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is due to the breath of the needle fibres of the asbestos," Professor Tom Treger, a cardiac surgeon who arrived in the Gaya Hospital in 2001.
That is the hospital where, as Andrew Lawson suspected, it was affected by the asbestos, now, by irony of fate, leading the Centre for Mezotheliom Treatment.
The Trader knew Louson and he treated some others who were likely affected by internshiping at the hospital.
When the needles of the asbestos fall into the lung tissue, Trager says, "their breaths push them to the periphery where the shell is.
This is, in fact, an invasive process from the beginning.
The ordinary treatment of other cancer forms is much less effective in mezotheliom.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, causes hot disputes.
Some people feel like it's worth trying.
The treacher doesn't agree.
"It's impossible to cut the plum," he said.
You can't get the knife around her.
In the meantime, this cancer is not very well sustained by chemotherapy, which acts, but does not heal.
"There are sometimes sick people who live long," said Trager.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live far longer than they are expected.
The writer Steven J. Guld died 20 years after diagnosis was diagnosed.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis set up, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he was ill, Abbott was acquainted with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after diagnosis set up, became a single support and consultation office for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central," he said lifelongly when they called.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energy.
At first, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and extend his life for a month.
"I was desperate," he said.
I wanted to give up.
Louson, however, "happy to give a little more positive paint."
Having met with several experts, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loico Lang Lazdunski, a professor of toracial surgery in the Gaya hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need a direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," Graham admits.
The medium statistical patient would have to receive the direction and approval of funding.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mezotheliom to obtain the best available treatment.
However, when such treatment is finally ineffective, many patients face another financial cause for anxiety — the future of families they leave.
And then they ask courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Asbest has been known to be harmful for health since 1898," said Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it has become clear that even very small quantities could risk health.
That's when the companies spoke of the inadequateness of the company.
Andrew Lawson and Gaya's hospital eventually resolved the case, but it was not a full-value settlement, Morgan said, since Lawson couldn't clearly prove that his mezotheliom was the result of contact with asbestos in the Gay Hospital.
After the investigation of his death, the representative of the Gaya hospital confirmed, however, that the “asbest in the basement rooms mentioned in the 1990s was removed”.
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbest
In fact, tieing death contact with one company or workplace -- usually decades later -- has been a major problem for patients with mezotheliom that require compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed the owner or closed.
The insurance archives could have been lost.
And those who are protected from the lawsuits know that on their side, of course not.
This year, serious new legislative acts have been replied, which facilitate the mezothelymous compensation process, even if their former employers are not able to be traced.
In accordance with this law, a $350 million fund fund funded by the insurance industry was established for those who had been diagnosed after July 2012 and who could prove contact but no one to judge.
In such cases, the sick would receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could condemn in a normal case of compensation - approximately $120,000.
Approximately 300 successful claims are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan, as many who work with mezotheliom patients, believes that $350 million are "excellent jobs" for the insurance industry.
"It is a contract written by insurance insurers," he said, indicating that the amount was about a quarter of what the insurance officers would have to pay if they had not interfered with the temporary interval and the sick with mezotheliom would be able to track companies and file a lawsuit by usual means.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Pension, admitted that the law was "infinite".
However, Penning and Morgan recognize that, when seven people die every day, rapid action was necessary.
"The people suffer so much, and they need help today," Penning said during the second reading of the Bill on mezotheliom in December last year.
Until then, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Professor Loika Lang Lazdunski 19 months.
After primary consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considered effective.
This followed radiotherapy and chemotherapy -- a tritherapy in which Lang-Lazdunski could commend all 40 per cent of the survivors in five years.
Abbott felt the inflammation of force.
"This, of course, is one of the most important things," said Abbott.
You see this in patients all the time.
There's some power that supports you.
When you surrender, the condition may be worsening very quickly.
Graham Abbott had an operation in March 2012.
By the end of August, he finished the last six cycles of chemotherapy.
The following scans did not show a sign of disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were several fifths [cake] in my breast cell.
I should've just finished 50.
It's not a life threat.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
There's no sign of tumours now.
However, this process is both physically and emotional.
You can think of practical things, when I die, for example, or how to show my wife, how the boyler works.
When you get bad news, you get unhappy.
We need to look forward.
Like Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Tamzin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he said.
It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.
When I was diagnosed for the first time, I told the girls that I had a disease that means I won't get older.
They reacted very differently.
Tamzin is very communicative and energy.
She told all her friends, and many of us called very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such talks are something you have to face with all the sick cancer.
But such discussions are not balanced with hope for patients with mezotheliom, even by the explosion of survival.
This sickness brings a dark determination for Steven Jay Guld.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mezotheliom is not a threat to life.
The bodies of the balsamated Pharaohs are turned into asbestos tissues.
Asbestos fibres are used to strengthen the cattle and to increase heat.
Plinius The Senior describes asbest.
Now it's invented a plates that are not burning.
I've seen the salvets made of it that were melting in the stones on the bankets.
The modern commercial use of the asbest begins in Italy, where it is used to produce a paper (also banknote) and tissues.
The large asbest mines are opened in Canada and South Africa and soon afterwards in America, Italy and Russia.
It is a perfect heat-izolator for pair engines and turbines of the Industrial Revolution.
World production of the asbestos increases to more than 30,000 tonnes a year.
The Prudential statistics show early mortality among those working with asbestos and who are therefore rejected in life insurance.
Nelly Kershaw is dying in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cook testifies that the particles of the asbest in her lungs were "without doubt, the main cause of death."
It's the first case of this type.
The employees of Kershaw, Turner Bros Asbestos, do not recognize responsibility.
The compensation is not paid.
During World War II, there is an intense development of vesselship, one of the most dangerous professions in relation to asbestos.
Voluntary industrial ban on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal reaffirms the first successful suit against health caused by asbestos, in Britain.
World production of asbestos grows to more than 4213,000 tonnes a year.
Britain imports 139,000 tonnes.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety in Great Britain requires that all asbestos contractors receive a licence.
Import and use of blue and brown asbestos are prohibited by law in Britain.
All uses of asbest are prohibited in Britain.
The Mezotheliom Act was adopted in Britain.
Compensation Scheme £350 million was announced.
Asbest is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but the white asbest is still used in cheap construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production is held at approximately 2 million tonnes a year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters swear to revenge
China's Parliament decided on Sunday to prevent the Hong Kong voters from bringing candidates to the elections of 2017, despite the growing demands of democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to start a long-term protest in the Hong Kong business block, since the activists began planning and mobilization in a number of hours after the statement.
The decision of the Universal People's Assembly, in fact, allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It has not deceived our expectations, but it is still angry," said the legislator Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They deceived Hong Kong's people.
And obviously we're dealing with the authoritarian regime.
Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the Common People's Assembly, protecting China, Lee Fei, said that the universal election of the head of Hong Kong would be too " chaotic " .
Since 1997, when Britain transmitted control over Hong Kong back to China, Beijing promised the inhabitants of the region to choose by voting the head of the Government from 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision taken on Sunday as a democratic step forward, as it gives the Hong Kong the right to direct vote; but the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands by the Peking Movement Commission.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who love the country and love Hong Kong will be allowed.
The decision was taken after summer, when one of the largest protests in Hong Kong had been made for many years.
Many of the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong represents the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers threatened to close the financial area of Hong Kong, unless Beijing guarantees this universal election law.
On Sunday night, a few hours after the statement, hundreds of Occupy Central were gathered under rain in front of the headquarters of the Government of Hong Kong.
During the demonstration, the organizers stated that their movements would move to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would rise at the protest waves in the next weeks.
Nevertheless, they did not report details, apparently trying to avoid problems with public authorities.
In the online statement, the organizers reported that the movement " considered the possibility of capture of the central area only as an exclusive measure, actions that could be taken only if all the options of the dialogue were exhausted and there was no other choice.
We are regretted to report that all the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and the central area will certainly be taken.
State authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's statement for several days, and in the Government ' s headquarters on Sunday, security measures were strengthened by police and barricades.
Based on disorder, many in Hong Kong feel that they slowly lose control of their own city.
The influenza of inhabitants from the landscape enhances competition in the field of goods and services.
The fear that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are also being weakened under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations are risking business, the source of the Hong Kong life force.
"The protest they are talking can lead to a great economic damage depending on how much people will participate and how long," said Regina Ip's legislative, who has long been criticizing the movement.
We don't want the concern that Hong Kong is out of control.
This is a concept that is harmful for investments.
China's public media also reported on the last days in which the Hong Kong democratic activists were shown by diversants directed by Western Powers.
This summer, the activists organized an informal electoral referendum, which attracted 780,000 participants, more than one fifth Hong Kong voters.
And in July, tens of thousands came to one of the largest prodemocratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
American graduation culture comes to university life: first classes were invited to arrive on a private plane
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the first in Britain the Lux travel service for the current students.
In order to make a impression from the arrival to the university, the company also offers transport options such as a private plane, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stuart also said that the service had thought of security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their stuff across the country in a dangerous car.
In conjunction with our new VIF options, we look forward to helping students this year reach the university with minimal efforts and the maximum of luxury.
The representative of the company said that since the service has just been launched, orders have not yet been made, but added that " students will start ordering this service in the next few weeks."
The company also stated that, despite the need to pay $9000 a year for students, it hoped to find a market for that service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in the regard of expectations and hopes: more important than ever, to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes to do.
Nevertheless, the National Union of Students has criticized this service as a non-reality.
Megan Dunn, vice-president of the NSA for higher education, said: "This project appears incredibly distracted from the lives of most students.
Many students who will start a university study this month face a crisis of life-value when the available financial support in the form of credits and grants does not succeed in rapidly growing costs for basic needs before they can even begin to think about to extract thousands of pounds for something like a simple arrival in accommodation.
Feminists raised the issue of racial jurisdiction and conduct of the police after Ferguson
A teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
The incoming men raise their hands, scanding, "Right up, don't shoot," while they wait in a row before the funerals.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri related to the killing of Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed the interview of white feministers in the Internet.
According to its experience, white feminists who had left comments had put gender above raciality when it was about promoting reproductive rights and inequality of income.
However, as the tension in the Middle West increased and attracted national attention, Perez saw the responses of white women focused on 100 per cent raciality.
In comparison with the reaction of black women shortly after the killing of 9 August, the personal esees with titles such as "Ferguson's thoughts from the face of a white woman" and "feminism -- not only the oppression of women" appeared relatively late.
But for Perez, they demonstrated a substantial movement.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic for the crisis we have encountered, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so linked to raciality, they felt that it was necessary to point out.
For an English professor at the Ohio University of Coryta Mitchell Ferguson, the problems with which the black Americans face every day, but which are not regarded as women's problems in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something ridiculous on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and I'm getting 150 lays everywhere," said Mitchell.
When I write something about the way colorful people are attacked in their own country, silence is deaf.
"Why are women safe to speak publicly about relationships, but not public security?" she asked.
For black women, such as Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomia between issues relating to racial nature and gender.
In her view, black women are in a position to clearly share these problems; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women are now combining racial issues and gender in the feminist mainstream, Angel Hattery, professor of women and gender studies at the University of George Mason, said that their predecessors were doing the opposite.
" Between 1865 and 1890 linchewals, at least 10,000 black men, and almost always served by rape of a white woman," said Hettery.
A white woman needed to confirm the story to justify the linching.
From the point of view, the break between white and black women occurred when white sufragists, such as Susan B. Anthony, studied the situation at the end of the 1800 ’ s and saw that struggle for electoral law would only be effective for one of the groups: women or black people.
"They have decided to put all the eggs in the voting trash for women, and the right to vote for the black would have to appear later," said Hettery.
Looking back at such things gives us clear idea why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women had reached the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to join white women against the Linching Association of Women in the South for the prevention of lincens.
The group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From the point of view, Mitchell, the response of white feminists to issues raised by the Ferguson situation, the conduct of the police, racial discrimination, reflects the time when white feminists had to " prosecute" problems with which black women had dealt with in several generations.
"Well, would it be great if activists with such [traditional feminist] ideology had the right to raise a child as they relate to the right to contraception?", asked Mitchell.
The feminists of the second wave that have made careers to combat reproductive rights and access to contraceptives now begin to understand what this means.
A famous white feminist activist, Gloria Steinne, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, used the Facebook and published a sharp article of the Guardian Rebecca Carol, which required white Americans to participate more in racism protests.
"I hope that women with a different but similar reason to understand the danger in the body -- and the view of racial issues that are significantly different in public surveys -- will be in the head of the change," Steinem wrote.
Although Stein is guaranteed for a more cross-cutting feminism, which includes racial concerns and gender, its comments on race in America are still surprised by some.
The American Entrepreneurial Institute, Christina Summers, author of She The People, said that young men in the United States, particularly colored young people, were " much vulnerable than their sisters," but the Stein of Ferguson contradicted the criticism she had previously expressed.
Now we have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small programme, "Saver to my brother" to help vulnerable black and Spanish youths, there was an awful response from many feministists, including Gloria Steinne.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem promoting the front line of traditional feminism.
After the US Border Service arrested about 63,000 minors without accompanying the south-west border this year, the reform of immigration has returned to the surface -- this time as a problem of women.
Andrea Mercado, co-Chairman of We Belong Together, who mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that she had only to share the history of women immigrants in order to address this problem as a matter of importance for women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the overwhelming majority of work visas are issued to [man immigrants], women who come with them are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"Those stories have a response from women's organizations," she said.
The Ipswich house "with pig" is sold
The photo of the house presented for sale in Saffolka was removed by real estate agents when it turned out to have a large pig in the living room.
For sale of $120,000, a separate house with one bedroom stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was a picture of the house's living room -- a pig with the head of the couch.
The Connells real estate agency reported that the pigs on the photo was a pet of the owner of the house.
"And the photograph was mistaken and has already been removed," said the representative of the company.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former house of the congregations as "a unique house with one bedroom".
Although the Agency removed the photograph from its website, it remains in advertising materials.
The sale of the house was interesting in social networks where some asked whether pigs were sold along with the house.
The Russian tennisman, Maria Sharapowa, in the Fourth Circle of the U.S. Open, declined by Caroline Wozniazka, believes that she is lacking stability.
According to the sportsman, she wishes to finish a year worthy and try to get to a new level, transmitted by Vasilia OSIPOW from New York.
How do you evaluate your results at the Big Helmet tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad I won Rolan Garros.
With regard to the other three tournaments, I was lacking stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
I couldn't even get to the fourthfinal.
What tasks do you have before the end of the season?
After an insulted defeat, I have a huge motivation to get to a new level.
I have something to work on, and I'm going to do everything I can to finish the year worthy.
The Asian series of tournaments begins in a few weeks.
Member of the Committee of the Committee of the Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former champion of the world, Nikolay Valuev, invited for the implementation of the GTO rules to give bonuss when accessing a liaison.
He said that the norms will be the same as in the Soviet period - people will administer the norms for the dragging, running and other exercises.
Recall, 12 entities of Russia will begin to implement from 1 September in their territory of the standard of GTO.
I also invited the students who gave the GTO to give bonuss when accessing the tears," Valuev noted.
For example, they can be added to EGE scores.
There are also suggestions to provide additional voluntary business workers that have passed the sports tests.
A new millioner in the city of Harvey, South Wales, after the lottery wins
The Harvey lottery player this month.
There is a search for a new millioner in the southwest of Perth, where one lucky man will take home almost $1.1 million from a lottery game on Saturday night.
The paper kiosk in Harvey brings gold to the main prize for the second time in five years, the last win was a million dollars in November 2009.
However, a successful winner still has to declare himself.
The owner of the store Steve Forward said that the victory caused a victory in a small town to the southwest of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everyone is very excited.
We thought that win could be a secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated the primary prize last month, noting the conclusion of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week, the Canning Weil players became one of the five million Augusts, after a huge $7.5 million winning a couple from Belmont just a few weeks before that.
The winner couple has been playing for 20 years and reported that the winner gave them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new home.
Harvey's millionaire brings the number of winners of the main prizes in Western Australia up to 59 this year, with a total of $85 million.
Mini-economic development wishes to accelerate the growth of the electricity market
This week, the Mineconomic Development will introduce a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally clean transport in Russia, said the Deputy Director of the Department of Ministry of Oleg Plužnikov at the round table held by the " Knowledge" in the Moscow Carroll - 2014.
The plan is composed of the Government, one of the main objectives is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document was expected to be adopted at the end of September - early October, said Plužnikov, the proposed measures relating to electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of vehicles in the gas fuel in Russia is already available.
The plan (copies of the News) is calculated for 2014-2017.
The criteria for evaluation of electricity and hybrid transport are to be developed and decide how to stimulate the use and production of clean vehicles.
The report of the Government, in which the tax and tariff support measures will be described, will be prepared by December 2014; an easy loan scheme and a leasing scheme will be developed by April 2015; proposals to reduce the price of machines, to stimulate localization and to establish service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015 it is expected to amend regulatory acts in order to facilitate the conditions for the construction of charge infrastructure (on parking stations, auto-fuel stations, etc.).
Furthermore, federal officials intend to make proposals for the regional authorities in 2015 to promote the use of environmentally clean transport, in the form of providing it with the advantage of movement and parking, for example; and to February 2016, and to expand procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the mineconomic developments will make a list of indicators for the assessment of the activities of the regional authorities of the criteria reflecting the effectiveness of the production of environmentally clean transport, the development of charge infrastructure.
The electric vehicle market in Russia has only been formed -- about 100 electric vehicles were sold throughout the country in 2013.
In the beginning of 2014, the imports of electrical vehicles were renewed, so sales were about 500 grand, foretold by the Chief Executive Director Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey Pankov.
However, the five-fold growth does not make the electrical vehicle any notice: in 2013, in Russia, according to the European Business Association, 2,78 million light and light commercial vehicles were sold.
Only Mitsubishi Motors imports electrical vehicles to Russia.
The Renault company is preparing to start imports, said the Director for Strategic Planning and Partnerships in Russia, Nikola Remiz.
Most of the other electric transport producers have taken a waiting position on Russia.
Electric vehicles also have ", " GAZA, " but a poor issue.
For example, in January-July 2014, according to the ASM-holding, the AutoVAZ released 30 electrical vehicles.
The demand is low because of the expense of electrical vehicles, recognised by the Director of AutoVAZ on the engineering of Sergei Amanov, without the master of the segment, there will be no breakdown...
The development of the Russian electricity market other than the road cars (the electrical vehicles sold in Russia, the average double-transparent analogs with internal combustion engines) prevents the irregularity of charge infrastructure (purchase units), devoted by Sergei Celikov, Director of Autostate.
Due to the expensive and low rates of reducing electrical vehicles in the nearest 3-4 years, the Russian market will remain a low segment, predicted by the main editor of "Autorev" Michail Poputanski, Celikovs agrees with it.
On the contrary, autoproducers say that some electrical models are close to the value of normal.
The Russian electricity market has good prospects, mainly to make consumers confident that " Electromobility" is real; that, inter alia, will contribute to the appearance of all new charge stations, stressed the President of BMW Group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are implemented, for example, the Rossety Hoscompany: several stations are built in Moscow, and there will soon be about 80 more.
The negotiations on the construction of a network are also conducted with other regions.
According to the Director of the Department of Rossets, Vladimir Sofina believes in the electric vehicle market and is ready to build fuels throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for the loading of various brands.
Furthermore, Rossets as a network company do not have the right to sell electricity, it is designed to do so with regard to the charge of electrical vehicles.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of the establishment of the electric vehicle market in Russia as the most effective measure of customs e-mails.
The zero rate will take effect until the end of 2014, the possibility of prolonging it, the expansion of the easy list.
The replacement of the transport tax on environmental (the idea is discussed and related to all vehicles) will also support the market, but not as sensitive as the tavied preferences, the Pankov believes.
Transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, in contrast with Norway, where tax reduction has led to rapid sales of electrical vehicles -- now there is 12 per cent of the market.
Russia also requires promoting measures for owners, such as free parking in the centre of the city (as already done in Moscow), sure Pankov, or the possibility of moving electrical vehicles on elevated trails, which is not yet available in Russia.
The private plane crashed in Colorado
One motor plane Piper PA-46 crashed in the American state of Colorado.
Three of the five people who were in it died are transmitted to ITAR-TASS.
The survivors were delivered to the hospital.
The accident occurred several kilometers from the landing bar of Denver Airport.
The causes of tragedy are now set.
In the Donetsk area, they deal with prisoners of the Donbass battalion.
Carriers were surrounded under Ilowaiian.
They were dedicated to their own commanders, and dozens of rape were killed under fire.
The survivors say that if they knew the situation in the south-east of Ukraine would not go to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky.
The caratels from the Donbass battalion remained alive after the "meat" in which they were caught under Ilowaiian.
In the surrounding of the Donetsk People's Republic, the warriors spent several days, actually abandoned by their commanders and the authorities of Ukraine.
When the headquarters reported that the ring could go along the apparently provided corridor, the column moved.
But literally, a few minutes from all sides, the bullets and bullets.
"With the information I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to go out," said the deputy commander of the battalion called "Lermonts".
And when we went down between Multipole and Red Sea, the crossfire started from the anti-bank missiles, from the bullets, the 30-milimeter granatomets, the automatic BMD guns, the small arms.
I got four cars ahead and three behind, and only two left in the end.
The officer with the Lermonts calls said that almost immediately at least 60 people were killed, dozens were wounded, many died afterwards.
The survivors now provide medical assistance to those who have come to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give food, medicines.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and condemned to return to death.
We were just betrayed, they said.
The colon, the whole battalion to destroy it.
In the Donbass battalion, like many of his companions, Alexei was volunteering, since the Ukrainian news was told about the wickedness that appeared to be done in the south-east of the separatists.
Alexei has already seen a completely different picture here.
His mother in Lugansk was killed, not anyone, but Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that there was a minometers shooting, that it was probably Ukrainian armed forces, says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
I wanted to leave the battalion after that.
We were not released from Ilowaisk, they said we were in the ring.
I've already made a deal with the commander, and the report has already written about leaving.
We were immediately taken from the Zurahovo congregations to Ilowaisk.
According to the prisoners, a man 300-350 was stuck in the cotle under Ilowaiian.
Now some survivors admit that if the time could be restored again, they would not have entered a carnival battalion for nothing.
All prisoners were transferred to the CNR forces.
Everyone will be checked for the involvement of military crimes.
In the region there was a headquarters for reducing the prices of products

The head of Rosnefty Igor Secin stated that the company appreciated the damage to the shooting of the Lisician NPC in Ukraine in $140 million.
That's what he said to Speegel's interview.

Recall, on 18 July, in connection with the shooting of the Lisican NPT, the oil storage tank burned and the two storage buildings were destroyed.
The Lisician NPZ is the main oil processing factory in Ukraine, the first incorporated in October 1976.
The total power of the Lisician NPT is approximately 7 million tons of oil raw material per year.
The facility is capable of exposing the fuel of the Euro-4 standard, as well as the Euro-5.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the Lisician NPT were suspended due to its loss.
The company was decided to start repairing.
A year later, Rosneftt received the Lisian NPT with other Ukrainian assets of TNC-VR.

Twitter tried to become more interesting for new users
The Twitter service has changed the user registration process to quickly engage new participants in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microblogs.
The new Twitter users will now look at a large number of accounts recommended during the registration in order to make their reading circle immediately.
Recommendations are based on the interests indicated in registration.
Twitter automatically sets a subscriber for all automaticly selected accounts.
Because of this user, it will have to take off its own slippers in order not to read those who are not interested in it.
If only avatars of recommended users were seen before, Twitter now produces a model of one of the popular blogger Tweets to help make an impression on a person.
This is the greatest change in the Twitter registration page in the last three years.
Twitter has recently been working on the modernization of the service.
Such activities are mainly related to the continuing attempts of the service to achieve security.

This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising.

Since 1 September in Russia, the vehicle utilization programme has been resumed.
10 billion rubles will be allocated for these objectives by 31 December 2014.
As the head of the Minprom trade of RF Denise Manturov explained, the money is allocated from the limits that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade by re-distributing from other directions of support.
The programme will affect all cars over six years.
The amount of compensation will be from 40,000 for a light car to 350 thousand rubbers per cargo.
In Russia, such a vehicle utilization programme has already been implemented.
The main distinction of the current project, explained the Minister, is that not only the use of machines for further discount, but also the possibility if the car has reached over six years of age, to acquire a new discount when the older is transferred to the dealer, the Interfax is transmitted.
More than 16 billion rubles have been spent on the previous federal programme of utilization since 1 January 2010 until 31 December 2011.
It resulted in the 2010 level of the production of light vehicles of around 1.2 million (this is plus 101.4 per cent by 2009).
Creator Coming Out Simulator will play a game about modern journalism
The gamma designer Nikki Case, known as Coming Out Simulator, decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He told me about his project in the Kill Screen interview.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but it was only now widely known.
The source of inspiration for the game was the events in Ferguson, where protests were now coming after the police killed an unarmed black adolescent.
The focus of the project, which has not yet been named, will be how the information lighting of stories will affect their consequences.
The hero of the game, a civil journalist, will need to photograph what is happening in areas where conflicts between the police and the population occur.
The hero could take a different picture of what happened, which would affect the progress of the events.
If he takes off the scene so that the police will look heroes, and the protesting bandits, the police will start treating it better and letting them go where the ordinary person can't go.
If it highlights events differently, its photographs can turn peace protests into a huge rebellion.
The scores in the game will need to be collected by the hero Twitter, in which new subscribers will appear if the photographs set out there will be popular.
The game has no name yet.
Date of exit and platforms on which it appears are unknown.
Case, however, published a picture showing how the event could change depending on how the photograph was made and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen Case, he explained that he had been considering the concept of this game for a long time, but he was beginning to want to devote it not to protests in the United States, but to the events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started gathering materials for the game, he realized that he lacked knowledge and skills to light the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media enlightening the events in Ferguson, he decided to play on the motives of what happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who plays browsing games.
The most famous project was the Coming Out Simulator in 2014.
This game describes the events of Case’s biography, which devote to how bisexual adolescent is trying to tell homophobic parents about his relationship.
Heleta is incorporating Ukraine into the continued bloodshed
The Minister for Defence of Ukraine Valerius Heleteus calls for further “dozens of thousands” victims to be prepared to include the people in continued bloodshed opposition, stated in the MID RF report.
"In Moscow, of course, the statements of the head of the Ukrainian Military Department, Valeria Heletheas, who claimed " to complete an execution operation for Eastern Ukraine from terrorists" and the start of "The Great Patient War" in which the losses will be calculated by "dozens of thousands".

On its Facebook page, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday, "An informal channels, the Russian party has threatened that, if the resistance continues, they are willing to apply tactical nuclear weapons against us."
He stated, however, that the “release operation of East Ukraine” was completed.

True, one photograph surprised and disappointed couple worshippers.
It's a picture made in the Javensky.

The Army controls the new Thailand Government
General Praut (right) appointed the Minister for Defence of the Government of Wongsuwan (left)
The military ruler and Prime Minister Thailand, General Praut Chan-Oca, announced the composition of a new office of ministers of the country, in which more than a third of the posts are resigned by the generals or generals.
The representatives of the army received key posts: defence ministers, finances, foreign affairs and trade.
On Monday, Priut Chan-Oca was approved in the Prime Minister ' s position as the King Thailand officially approved the appointment of the Chief of the Interim Military Government to this post.
The 60-year-old military force in the country was the only candidate for the premier post as a result of the 22 May imbecile revolution.
He was elected by the Prime Minister at the parliamentary meeting.
Previously, the army appointed parliamentary deputies.
According to Praut Chan-Och, the turn was the only way to maintain stability.
He was preceded by six months of demonstrations, during which protesters required resignation from the Government of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat.
The Chan-Oca officially will be a temporary prime minister, as the military plans to make universal elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are fears that soldiers are trying to strengthen their power in the country.
The military came to the authorities on 22 May
in the background of a full civilian authority.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporarily arrested.
As soon as military forces arrived, they arrested the country's leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglyk Chinawat.
Some journalists and public actors were also detained.
The current political crisis departs from roots in 2006 when the army has placed the Prime Minister of Brother Yinglyk Chinawat Taxina.
Both of them enjoy the popularity of rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has made them successful at elections.
However, many medium-class and capital elite representatives entered an anti-governmental movement, which almost paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one ever said that the midi salad would be better, I didn't promise you that, a waitress from Palm's new brasserium.
It has to be formally recognized that it is true, but the mind and stomach remain inclined.
Because everyone knows a long time ago, we say "Belgia" -- we mean midia, we say "midia" -- the "Belgium".
Restaurants like to deeply claim that the success of the establishment depends on three factors: the location, location and again.
There are places not to be good, or even great, but some unfortunate places.
In fact, when I was sitting behind Palm's table, I remembered that there was a Café City (in the same television), then Odessa-Mom, and a restaurant "Bohole" and a beer friendship.
Now it's beer again, but it's not nostalgic-soviet, it's Belgian.
Only the top of the iceberg has been placed above the ground: a bar stand and a couple of tables, and the rest of the space is deprived of even the intensity of sunlight.
But it's fun in the child’s room: red, yellow and green walls, different chairs, instead of window televisions where girls swim.
The Belgian institutions in Petersburg have not been new for a long time, so compare them to something.
There are eight types of pipe beer (260-300 rubles per 0.5 l) and a countless amount of bottle (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive waiter has a lot of fun presenting the menu, telling that " midias are the fine large seeds" and it should be noted that, despite the individual deficiencies, the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected to be content, but often very unexpected.
Well, for example, it is suggested that a meat roll with a vallonic black slide (280 rubles) is actually a carpaccho that is so thin that the pergament paper compared to it will appear to be fat.
You can only feel a taste if you shake a half-law together.
The salads are even worse.
The classic League (260) would be the right thing to recognise the crime against the Belgian people: some sculptured iceberg, opened once long ago, oxygenous Kenyan beans, bacon chips plus a marine bowl.
You don't want to meet anyone with such a league salad!
The composition of the Belgian salad was partially different, but the impression was not positive.
If the unsuccessful quarters of cherry tomatoes or burned champions were still able to close their eyes, why the midians looked like they had been frozen and frozen several times in their lives!
Because I already know, there's a totally normal white sea midwife here!
They are given in "in your choosing sauce" (490-560 rubles per 0.5 kg).
The sauce of half dozens, the one of white wine, the selderea and the carrots, did not make it clear.
There are vegetables, and there is no smell of wine, and it remains a mystery.
But they are good to the midian frytoes with home majonesis.
The chicken waters here are not a flavor that is so thick that, depending on the mood, you can decide, the first or the second meal before you, but just a pleasant limb.
It was stated that the rabbit cooked in a beer sauce, and nothing was said of rosmarine.
The situation was diameterally opposite: the rosmarin was silent.
It was impressed that the rabbit had been feeded exclusively with rosmarin cups, which produced such an unusual smell.
But the rabbit had been administered to the foot -- no, just a fine row in a caramelysed crush.
The vafles in Palm are offered not only sweet but also fine - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The clone sauce was excessively watery, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager that came to the table was very informally interested in the mealed impressions.
So we should come again.
The dollar course rose to IMMB above 37 rubles on news about new sanctions prepared by the West on Russia.
It's a new historic record.
The dollar by "tomorrow" by 10:29 MSC rose by 26.9 coins and was 37.02 rubles, the euro was raised by 30 coins - up to 48.73 rubles, the data of the Moscow Bank.
The basket rose by 28 coins to the level of previous closing and cost 42.28 rubles.
By the time of the Crime event, the dollar reached the maximum of 19 February 2009 -- then it cost 36.43 rubs, and on 3 March 2014 it was already 37.005 rubles.
At the night of 29 August, the White House reported that the President of the United States Barak Obama and the Chancellor of Germany, Angel Merkel, discussed the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the rubber is a long-term nature, both in a couple of euros and a couple with a dollar.
The long-term forecast suggested this marking," said the senior alpari analyst Anna Bodrova.
Anything related to Ukraine will be reflected in courses anyway.
As long as this continues, investors will respond.
Today, rumours about the invasion of troops are not confirmed on either side, but the market has proved very emotional.
All the talks that he was sustained to such news were overwhelmed yesterday.
Week, according to the expert, would be closed around these levels -- 36.90 and 37.05 bucks per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, policies, sanctions, gas transit problem through Ukraine -- all these are the sounds of one chain.
The inflation range is also foreseen: current prices for autumn will be added from 5 to 10 per cent.
In addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will be ended and some vacuum will come up until the networks are reoriented into other suppliers.
"Dollar approached 37 rubles, passed it, and returned, and there was no powerful history," commented the chief of the Market Analysis Division " Opening Broker" Constantine Bushuev.
They will still see if the promised sanctions will be introduced on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
Ruble said that he had severely weakened after the closing of the tax season, followed by the news on Ukraine, while the CB said that by the end of the year, he had been fully transferring to the swimming course and denied any currency intervention.
If you look at the daily hesitation, it was not different from the previous in this month, the 37 rubles were intimidated, the analyst continued.
Now, there's nothing powerful in the traffic plan.
Monetary times for the currency market were, recall, when the higher currency demand was noted at the end of January, as well as on the third March, when the BC reloaded the recorded amount of currency.
The UFS IC also see the positive side of the weakening of the rubber.
First of all, this is an increase in the income part of the export transactions and the improvement of the competitiveness of domestic producers by trafficking, said the UFS IC Analyst Alexei Kozlov.
The travel of import goods and services may be negative.
The sharp qualifications of the Russian currency have significantly reduced the attraction of investment in the Russian economy, caused the growth of inflation pressure, and resulted in renting money, which, in turn, hampered the development of the country's economy.
With regard to the market of shares, the devaluation of the rubber has somewhat reduced the prices of shares expressed in the rubles.
For example, the IMMB index decreased by 1.67 per cent during the Thursday trade and the RTS Index lost 3.27 per cent.
Such a significant difference in the relative size of the index reduction is due to a weakening of rubber over a day by more than 1,5 per cent.
The weakening of the rubber is emotional and caused by a mass desire to buy a currency.
Practice shows that the emotions are gradually offline, while the rubber cottons partially or fully renew the lost positions.
"We suppose we will soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar," said Alexe Kozlov.
Genetic violations are often misdiagnosed
The British reported that she spent years thinking she would die after the wrong diagnosis.
Karen Rogers spent most of her teenage age thinking that she was living only a few years after diagnosed another disease.
In fact, she had Sharco-Mari-Tuta (SMT) disease, a group of inheritance violations that cause nervous injuries outside the brain and the spine.
The charitable CMT UK reported that the wrong diagnosis was a frequent problem among SMT people, because it was so little known about this condition.
Approximately 23,000 people in Britain have SMT, which may cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, uncertain walk and thumbs of legs.
Patients may feel inferior or pain, and the condition is not cured and progressed, which means that symptoms are increasing with time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from the Friedraich attack (AF), a state for which the forecast was very bad.
Rogers thought she'd be attached to a wheelchair until she was 18 and died before she was 30 years old.
The mother of two children, now 51, said, "I knew as a child that I couldn't do what others could do.
I fell down every day, and I took more time for it.
I could never ride on rolls or skateboards with other children, and I had a lot of fun at school because I was walking and running.
Rogers said that, when she was 13 years old, after a few operations to release the ahill drill and to fix her feet, she looked at the medical map when her doctor left the room and said that she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I put my nose where I shouldn't, and therefore I didn't tell anyone, but I came home, found information about this situation in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received information in reply, I was shocked and experienced the most horrible panic as possible.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair chair at 18 and die before I was 25, and that I would gradually lose all my ability in this interval.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funerals.
She said that when she was 17 years old, she realized that her ability to walk was not as worse as she thought, and asked her doctor.
He just got up, he hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you're having this sickness because you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that's a much smaller threat to life.
After several genetic surveys, she found SMT.
"When he explained what the SMT was, I thought I pulled a happy ticket," she said.
The charitable organization of SMT of Great Britain announced a month of information on SMT to try to draw attention to this disease.
Tax burden on businessmen of the Washington Zone grows as the economy is recovered
The recovering economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
The tax accounts at the state and local level for companies across the country were modestly increased last year when the economy was accelerated, according to the new study published last week, and the Washington Zone was not exceptional.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia totally paid $27.6 billion to the execution of the state and locally in the financial 2013, 3.8 per cent more than $26.6 billion gathered for 2012.
The tax burden for the state and local business last year increased by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent earlier, and this was the third year of growth after each year, when the accounts were reduced in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased faster, 4.3 per cent than local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to the research carried out by the company providing professional services, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Centre, the Tax Group.
More than half of the tax revenues in the district, 56 per cent, are taxed by entrepreneurs, while 36 per cent of Meriland's tax income is in business.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, delivers the lowest tax income, proportionately from entrepreneurs.
A large increase in tax income resulted in returning to the remaining level of real estate, researchers say that it raised taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three years in order to increase less than 1 per cent.
While the large share of these incomes is in large states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same is happening in the Washington Zone.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia totally paid $10 billion for state and local property, $9,6 billion more than $4.2 per cent in 2012, compared to the previous year.
However, the observed return of real estate value does not have any similar impact on the growth of tax revenues at the state and local level in Maryland, where taxes on real estate barely exceed one fifth tax accounts of companies.
Virginia and Colombia companies pay about half the tax accounts at the state and local level in the form of real estate taxes.
"What happens in Maryland is that such a majority of their real estate, especially the tax base around the County of Colombia, belongs either to the Government or to non-commercial organization that does not pay taxes for real estate," said Douglas Lindholm, executive Director of the State Tax Centre.
Thus, Maryland is forced to be much more reliable, for example, on income taxes to pay the same services in other states.
Recent tax income from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the renewal of the real estate market.
The entrepreneur's income appears to also go to amend, according to these data.
Companies in the region have declared a corporate income tax at the state level of $2.3 billion per $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland gathered a billion corporate income taxes, most in the region.
Although trends are directed in one direction, the tax burden of local entrepreneurs does not increase with the same speed in all three areas.
The level of growth in the Colombia district was at the same level as the average country, 4.3 per cent, while the growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
Only in Virginia, tax revenues were raised below the average, equal to 4.1 per cent.
In Virginia, the lowest corporate income tax from three jurisdictions (each of which is the same corporate rate) was equal to 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while the district is relatively high to 9.975 per cent.
A similar study of the United States Trade Chamber earlier this year showed that Virginia was below taxes for entrepreneurs at the state and local level and, in general, more favourable climate in terms of business taxes than in Maryland.
The district was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia experiences competitive pressure by its neighbor from the south.
The North Carolina recently signed a legislative act that reduced the corporate rate from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent this year, as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continues to achieve tax income goals next year, the law could make a income tax for entrepreneurs even up to 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, a small business in the Washington Zone seems to feel better and thus pay more taxes at the state and local level, according to a recent study.
Taxes for entrepreneurs paid as individual income tax by small business owners are a transitional structure for which most small companies are established in the Colombia, Maryland and Virginia County have increased by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher growth rate than taxes for enterprises in general.
Researchers say that the trend and increases of business taxes across the country would probably continue this year, when taxes from trafficking in the state and local governments increased by 6.2 per cent for the first three blocks of 2014, compared to the same period of last year.
However, the Washington Zone may retire, since the reduction of federal costs affects the labour market in the region.
The Bronze Age of the Russian Judo
The home championship of the world for judo brought two silver and seven bronze prizes to Russia.
According to this indicator, the Russians were only departed by the main favorite of the Japann collective competition.
The tournament in Chelabin was launched on Monday, and the first day the Russian team brought a silver medal.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, speaking in a category of up to 60 pounds.
However, in the equal final fight against Boldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the opposition was decided by a single comment received by Russianian.
The second day of the tournament became the most successful for the collection of Russia -- three medals were conquered on Tuesday.
In male competitions in category up to 66 kg of silver, Michael Pulayev was reached, and Bronza Kamalu Han-Magomedou.
In the final battle, the Russians resigned the world champion in 2011 and 2013, the Japanese Masasi Ebinume.
Han-Magomedes, at the fourth-final stage, who lost the country's family, had won a comforting tournament and became a holder of the bronze prize.
The female tournament of the categories up to 52 pounds was also reached by Natalia Kuziutin, to the third step of the pedestal.
In the half-final, she lost the current world champion of Milinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who was under the flag of the International Federation of Judo and successfully protected the title.
In the fight against Kuzutin's bronze, Ma Inan from China, but after the end of the tournament, she admitted that the third place was not what she was expecting.
Again, the obstacle in the russian road to the gold was Kelmendy, who beat Kuzutina in the final of the European Championship.
On the third day of the Chelabinian bronze tournament, Moose Moushkov, combated up to 73 pounds.
In the fourth-final, his offender became the former representative of Moldova, Victor Scovorts, now speaking for the OAE team.
However, then the Russian won two fights and became the owner of the reward.
Moushkov spoke at a home champion with the injury of the golostop he planned to heal soon, so he would take a break in competitions.
As for the ex-moldovanin Scorcov, he and he reached the bronze medal on this tournament.
Interestingly, the other member of the OAE, Ivan Remarenko, who adopted the Sports Citizenship, had completed the bronze in up to 100 pounds.
The fourth day of the CM-2014 also brought to the Russians one bronze that Ivan Nifont conquered in a category up to 81 kg.
In a severe fight of the small final, he defeated the French Alan Schmidt by comments by competitor.
On Friday at the tournament, three awards were played immediately, but the Russians were limited to one bronze in a male tournament to 90 pounds.
Her owner was Cyrille Questions, and the medal of Russia was guaranteed that his contest for the comforting final was the contributor of Cyril Dennis.
However, there was no competitiveness: the rival of the questionnaire was unable to get off the dads because of the injury.
The male bronze was conquered by the masters, and on the sixth day of competition, she was placed in a bunch of Saids Renatus, which spoke in more than 100 pounds.
In a comforting final, David Moura had a pure victory over the Brazilian.
This was the end of the individual part of the world's first-wide world.
The last day of the Chelabinska tournament, Sunday, the world championships in team competitions were played.
Both Russian and male and female communities were one of the main awards, but, as in individual competitions, the representatives of the beautiful sex had not been lucky - they did not get to the medal.
The Russian judoist conquered a team silver.
In a decisive contrast, they declined to the Japanese team, in an intense fight against the account of 2-3.
At the same time, the Russian collection led 2-0 after the pure victory of Han-Magomedov and the Denis Jarcev (weight to 73 kg).
However, in the more severe categories of weight with their Japanese rivals, Murat Habakirov (81), Magomed Magomed (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100).
The same scenario also developed a bronze match in a female tournament, where the Russian collector, with 2-0, declined to Japanese - 2-3.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, attended a team competition in Chelabin, who congratulated the silver museum after the end of the tournament.
"The second place is very honorable, but I mean, it was obvious that you could be the champion," said Putin, whom the words of the RIA News are invoked.
To lose the Japanese, the rodents of judo, there's nothing dark here.
But I'm sure you can win.
The Russian congregation at the world's home championship was much better than a year ago at the Rio de Janeiro competition.
There were only three medals in the Russian team, one silver and two bronze.
The current tournament was passed by the Olympic Champions Arsen Galstian and Mansur Isaiah.
We're all great masters, of course.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle comes into eight stronger, he's a potential winner of the Olympics.
More in sports like judo," the RF sports minister Vitalij Mutko, which is the champion's press service, failed.
The congregation of Japan was expected to be the best in Chelabin, conquering 11 different dignity medals, five of which were gold.
The next championship of the world will take place in Astan in the summer of the future year.
Other materials, news and statistics are available on the summer sports page.
Joan Rivers' family hopes for the best
Joan Rivers is unconscious of arriving in a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that a 81-year-old comedian actress will be relieved of disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in the statement today.
We're hoping for the best.
Her mother arrived to the Mount Sinai hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had a heart stop at the Upper East Side Clinic, Yorkville Endoscope, reported sources.
The doctors intentionally keep her under drugs and under strict supervision until they are satisfied with her condition that remains "fatal".
The response was broad, including numerous support on the Internet from such as Donald Tramp, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
Everybody will be able to make kings.
The Royal Blood Group's debut album is a new hope of the British rock, which led rock duets from clubs directly to stadiums.
The Duet Royal Blood is on the scene all year, but has already been awarded to the BBC music fee, a warming trip at the Arctic Monkeys and visiting the New York Concert from Jimmy Paige itself.
Their uni-named album had received 100,000 procurements in a few months before the relief, and the contract for the issue was located in the Major Laybla Warner Music portfolio.
Given the current painful situation in the music market, the situation from a series of outbreaks is not a new Lana Del Ray or a regular sweet voice representative of the new R'n'B, and the duet of the bikes of the British who played that level of loudness and intensity, which was last in fashion a few decades ago.
In general, the first album rates in connection with all the above circumstances have been particularly high and have already been fully justified.
Duet took a name that could have been touched before, except that the desperate hairy metallists, and the blood of the kings, as they seem, had in their veins, is also understandable.
This is, of course, the heroes of the previous level of Led Zeppelin: as well as a large quarter, the Royal Blood aims to strike the permanent blood of the British rock by bringing it to a new height.
Prognosis about the success of the undertaking may be early, but there is something to be claimed.
A dozen songs in 30 and a few minutes are not as much as a demonstration of the phenomenon of the composer's gift as a confident and powerful declaration of intentions.
Some dignity of individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: let's say, the pilot single of the Black is characterized by not melodial line, but by the drum party.
The musicians are joking that it's easier to knock this song than sing.
A powerful "Little Monster" and a closing plate of "Better Strangers" with a Shakespeare quote in the title.
The truth is, however, that each of these songs will sound great at the Hard Rock Favorite party, but they are combined in more or less one-born plates.
And it doesn't have to be bad, even the opposite.
The force of Royal Blood is that they do not pretend on the laures of the new Lennon and McCartney (as soon as they are targeted by the successors of Motörhead), but have produced many rock duets from the ghetto of indi clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, was created for stadiums in a room of less than a few thousand people, is obviously close.
The secret is partly in the smart use of the bass, which replaces the guitar in a custom form created at the beginning of the The White Stripes.
However, it is not only instruments but also the very approach to the composition of songs.
The heroes of the retroclosure of the zero, hardly chose beyond the postmodernist paradigm, with enormous inconvenience to recognise themselves not just as epigons, but by self - controlled creative units.
The Royal Blood sounds so powerful and urgent now that this effort is successfully drawing some of the secondaryness and firmness of the music material.
Well, after all, who said that rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON has just confirmed what information reported on Friday morning: Online store and video-producer and hundreds of other things - purchases a Twitch stream-producing service for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
This news was not a surprise because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of the Google video services for a good billion seemed ready, and it seemed natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a stream service of general nature, the version of YouTube in real time.
Instead, he quickly turned into a platform where gamers translated their internal game moments; "YouTube for real-time games," said Business Insider.
The Twitch Interface.
And "let's play", a genre of videos in which the all-knowledges give (usually old) the processing like the "The Mysterious Theatre" is already popular on YouTube.
The thing is, YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch was met without particular interest, a classic example of a corrosive technology company buying a potential competitor.
This is a secret why the YouTube deal failed, given that, according to the information, he was prepared to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have right now is a statement from the Executive Director of Twitch Emmet Shir: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us reach them faster."
Another secret, honestly, it's an incredible Twitch success.
Snobbs like me, who claim that they're better at sports than watching it, are difficult to understand the attraction of watching games instead of taking a joystick in their own hands.
One thing is to look through a friend's shoulder at 3:00 a.m. when she slides through Resident Evil, and the other thing is to see how a stranger gets 20 shots in the head in the middle of Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are counted on one person, so watching their image without self-controlling, may be a prescription of the headache worth Do It Right.
I agree that the rapid passages in which the Rogers of the Bannisters of our e-electronics end all the games in record dates are entertaining.
But if it's not about a game or a humor virtue, it's unlikely that its Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, which is the fourth largest source of the spacing internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon make money for that?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch will turn to Amazon Instant Video as delicate as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
However, Twitch has the pleasure of any company: the crowds of young men dreaming of advertising.
According to the chapter of Twitch Shir, Amazon and Twitch, both believe in the future of games, and this channel does not provide signs of introduction, even - oh - as a visible sport.
Over 330 people died in 2004, including 186 children.
Over 800 people were wounded.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked to survived hostages -- almost all students now, with the parents of the dead, with the watcher of the cemetery -- the city of Angel - Ramón Kaspolatov, head of the Committee of the Susana Dudiev Mother, who participated in the Special Operations of the Officer of the ICC, said the correspondent of the Department of the Society of Elizabeth Antonov, who worked on the special project.
After returning to Moscow, they met with Aslambeck Aslahanov, who was the President of the Northern Kavkaz 10 years ago and had negotiations with terrorists, as well as with the Officer of the FSB of Russia, Vecheslav Bocharov.
I was particularly excited at work on this topic -- that in Beslan, it was like it wasn't in the past ten years.
This topic is very painful for all who have anything to do with it, people hardly agree to talk about what happened.
The impression of the journey is very difficult.
But we cannot forget Beslan, and I hope we have done our job," said Antonova.
The special project was prepared by the Cold Rambler & Co Info Study, which has worked in the company since the spring of this year.
The previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15th year of the residence of Vladimir Putin.
UNDR launched a small distance missile
North Korea launched a small distance missile to the Japanese Sea Aquatorium, reports Renhap.
The launch was launched at approximately 10.30 a.m. from the province Chagando, located on the border of North Korea and China.
Apparently, the missile fell into the Japanese sea, flying about 220 km, said in the United Committee of South Korea Heads.
Deputies proposed acceleration of the entry into force of the Law on Personal Data
In the event of success of the initiative, Russian data will not be stored on abroad servers since 1 January 2015
The State had introduced a draft law to transmit the date of entry into force of the already adopted Russian Personal Data Act from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is located in the legislative framework of the Lower Chamber.
Its authors were deputated by the State of Vadem Dengin, Jaroslav Neilov (LDPR), Eugene Fedorov (United Russia), Vladimir Parahin and Alexander Yuschenko (CPRF).
Such a change would, in the opinion of the authors, contribute to the more rapid and effective security of RF citizens ' rights to the preservation of personal data and compliance with the secrecy of the communications in the information and telecommunications networks.
The Act, which has been rushed by parliamentary parliamentarians, compels to keep in the territory of the RF personal data of Russians processed on the Internet.
It also made mandatory recording, systematization, accumulation, storage, clarification and extraction of personal data of RF citizens in the databases located in the territory of Russia, as well as information on the location of such databases.
Furthermore, the Law grants the Roscomnaversary the right to restrict access to information processed in violation of the PF legislation on personal data.
The Law also suggests the establishment of so-called " black lists" of violent sites, an automated information system " The Registry of Personal Data Violators".
The law was adopted by the Lord during the summer.
The draft law was made by Andrew Lugová and Vadim Dengin from LDPR and Alexander Yustenko from CPRF.
Dengin and Yushenko are also one of the authors of the current Act on the Transmission of the date of entry into force of the law already adopted.
Those who have no centre dates in the RF will have to pay for rent
In commenting on the draft law introduced to the State today, the first head of the Thinking Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin stated that he did not see problems for the transfer of the date of entry into force of the Law on the Protection of Personal Data.
He said that those companies who would not have their own personal data storages in the RF territory would be able to rent them, for example, in Roselecom, which repeatedly said that they were willing to provide their servers to rent and already provide their servers with Mail Group, with Western companies that have already provided their servers.
"There are also several independent centres ready to cooperate in this area," he added.
"If companies decide to implement the law and continue to work in the RF territory, there is no problem - they will receive technological opportunities to place," Levin said.
Conflict Act
As soon as the draft law was published, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications expressed the concern that, in the event of adoption of the draft law, Russians would no longer be able to use many global internet services.
In particular, it is about services for online aircraft and hotels.
According to the Association, "the draft law deprives the individuals of the Russian Federation ' s citizens of the right to order their own data to determine that their recording, systematization, etc. should be provided only in the databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation."
The RAEC statement stresses that a more effective measure would be to establish a user information mechanism on where the recording is carried out, to systemate its personal data.
In that case, he will be able to choose the territory in which the actions will be carried out.
The adoption of such draft legislation on "localization" of personal data in other countries has led to the care of global services and significant economic losses.
The ice-water ice-water testing participants exhausted the jaw
Isabelle Roberts from Britain shouted so much when the ice water was poured on her head that damaged the bone structure of her face.
This test with ice water was not so painful.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed so much during the ice water test that she had exhausted her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts shouted so angry when the ice water was poured on her head that damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, but when I did it, my jaw began to get stuck," she said the Mirror.
It's 20-year-old water.
Isabelle Roberts seconds before an accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but he didn't close, he stuck, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister came to the same understanding and they started hooting, but I had to be taken to an immediate office.
A 20-year-old woman from Britain was taken to the hospital to make a jaw after the participatory involvement on Tuesday.
Clip became a web sensation and was published thousands of times in Facebook and Twitter.
Contributors passed over 400 prisoners to Ukrainian troops
The New-Russian Army claims that Ukrainian Su-27 was beaten and accused the opponent of the violation of the ceasefire agreement
At 10:00, 1 September, the applicants transferred 402 prisoners to Ukraine, 72 of which were wounded, as well as 35 dead soldiers.
The representative of the New Roussian Press Service informed the Interfax.
He added that “the CBI forces in the area of the Mereška population had beaten the Su-27 plane that violated the ceasefire agreements”.
According to the interviewer of the agency, the Ukrainian party at the Lugan airport's artillery has applied the munitions prohibited by international conventions.
The press service representative noted that two Ukrainian BBC helicopters were able to be damaged at one of the field airports, as well as to destroy two armored and two ammunition warehouses.
"The losses in the alive force of the opponent - up to a hundred people killed and wounded, were detained by 13 people," the headquarters summarized.
The Interfax does not have the confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formation of national republics, Donbass, announced the transfer of the Ukraine party in compliance with the ceasefire regime of 223 prisoners and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time, at the night, the LDC army, according to the New-Russian Army, "was interrupted the attempt of the Nazi Guardees to violate previous agreements from the area of surrounding a heavy technique".
At that time, the colleagues reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs, the capture of six tanks and disarmament of 198 troops.
According to the headquarters, the total loss of opponent in all directions (Doncecak, Luganian, Mariopolski) was made up of five tanks, eight armed vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded
At the end of the last week, the large group of Ukrainian troops was surrounded by mutuals in Ilowaisk, the Donetsk region.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, requested the leadership of the national republics to release Ukrainian troops from the environment.
The LDCs agreed to do so under the conditions of arms and ammunition against the opponent.
The first tens of troops began to leave surrounded settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander who was surrounded by the battalion of the Ukrainian Territorial Defense Donbass Semenchenko, there were 14 others who left the carpet on Sunday.
In his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that Ukrainian wounded are “in capture of 137 police 32 RF divisions and 9 tank brigade” where they are treated well.
In the meantime, the MID and the Russian Minodefense objected to the reports of Ukrainian military and NATO on the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
MID RF: Russia will take response to new sanctions for the EU
Russia leaves the right to take response to its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, reports MID RF.
The Russian External Diplomatic Office report states that the European Council ' s " conclusions " dated 30 August demonstrated the inability of EU Member States to overcome the inertion of imbalanced support by their Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in the east of Ukraine, based on " absolutely unproven allegations of the presence of the Russian armed forces in the territory of that country," states the department ' s website.
MID RF regrets that Eurosoft, despite the interests of its Member States, is subject to the influence of countries interested in strengthening the confrontation with Russia.
Members of the Eurosovet should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine, as well as to provide conditions for a full " dialogue between counterparts", the Office stressed.
It is also noted that there are no objectives of assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbass, where the full humanitarian disaster has been deployed, as well as the number of victims among the peaceful population.
Recall that specific proposals for sanctions against RFs are planned for the next seven days in the European Union.
The EU representatives are working closely with American officials.
They are expected to correlate between themselves the measures introduced for the period of action and the degree of harshness.
The new sanctions of the European Union may affect energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government also announced the expansion of sanctions against Russia in the field of defence, finances and oil industry.
Smart ways to save in university books
While the value of university books for many students exceeds $1,000 per year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon go to the second course, has developed a smart way to reduce costs.
He developed a system of ways to collect books from senior classmates, offering them a nominal compensation to postpone their sales.
"My mathematical analysis manual, which is usually worth $180, I got a semester for $10 and a chick-fil-A cookie," said Schroeder, 19, studying at the Covenant College in Georgia.
Needed literature for the last semester would cost $430, he said.
He spent $120.
According to the University Council, the average student spends more than $1200 per year for books and training, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing Internet stores and creative ideas like the Schroeder system.
The book project is increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book during a semester, and it often costs considerably cheaper than their purchase.
The company " Or Incorporated", which belongs to more than 250 university book stores, reports that the volume of books has increased twice since 2011.
Studies show that about a quarter of the books in university book stores during the last spring semester were taken on a project, said Vice-President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the books are acquired in university book stores, according to the Professional Association of University shops.
Here is the introduction course on the best ways to make a profitable deal.
Buying in the Internet store
Sometimes, if you get online, the price for a new book can be one third of what you will see in the university book shop.
The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is approximately $290 for the overview, but a new copy can be acquired for $239,99 on the Chegg.com website, which is specialized for the sale of books.
Procurement of Container
If you're not against other people's marks or damages, the books used are a good option.
The Mathematical Analysis is sold for $93.49 in a maintenance form at Chegg.com.
Matt Cassedei, 25, a fourth course student from the University of Brigham Yang, said that he paid at Amazon.com 42 cents for a supplied copy of the " Strategic decisions in the media: Understanding the Business Part of the Advertising Business".
The book was sold for $48 new.
Professors, for example, Ingrid Bracey, Director of College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts at Emherst, invites students to clarify their professors whether they can use previous publications.
Sometimes updates are not important for classes.
In such cases, old publications can often be found for a very small share of the last issue.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon websites, Half.com, belonging to the eBay Inc., is a popular alternative for the purchase of books.
Project
If you treat them well enough, you will not forget to bring them back, and you will not want to keep them after the course is finished.
You can save more than 80% of the value of the new book.
For example, one student was able to take the Mathematical Analysis project for a semester about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you are taking books, including any fines that can be written to you for labels, highlights and damages.
If you take the book in a project, remember, if you don't return the book, fines can even exceed the value of the new copy.
Electronic books
Electronic books instead of traditional books are another option.
Sometimes such books take their own bills by acquiring an electronic license for a certain period, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematical Analysis" project on the Chegg.com website will cost approximately $61 for six months.
Bracey says that students studying literature can often find the most profitable prices, as many classic works can now be downloaded free, while literature on natural and engineering science can be very expensive.
Nevertheless, look around.
Joe Golt, 29, who is going to start a Legal School of Pepperdin, recommends that ISBN use the ISBN number to find the prices of the book, as it guarantees that you are looking for the text you need.
Before making an order on the Internet, Golt says, you must check if the book is really in the warehouse.
This lesson was difficult for him.
The delivery of the book he acquired was delayed for four weeks, and eventually he paid the full price in the university book store.
Putin declared the full ineffectiveness of the Fund for the Development of the Far East
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, presented at a meeting on the rule of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East, that the budget fund for the development of the Long East, established two years ago, was ineffective, reports Interfax.
"15 billion rubs remained on deposits," stressed the President.
During the meeting, the head of the State ordered to accelerate the approval of the list of territories of the emerging development in the Dale East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the establishment of TORs should be introduced to the State of the autumn.
The Federal Assembly, noted the President, has not yet approved the list of the emerging development territories in the Far East until 1 July, and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin has also formulated key challenges for the development of the Dale East.
Among them, increased transport availability of the region, the withdrawal of infrastructure restrictions, both on the internal market and for export development.
Furthermore, it is necessary to establish additional investments in the region, as well as to form areas of emerging development, which should become competitive to key ATP business centres, stressed the President.
Recall, previously, it was reported that the territory of the emerging development could replace the OEC.
Why the Galaxy Guards were unable to save casso collections
"Incontained 3" Sylvestra Stallone returned less than $30 million from its $90 million budget in the United States, while "The city of sins: the woman for which it is worth killing" returned only $12 million from its $70 million budget.
"Home video" with Cameron Diaz brought only $14,6 million for the first weekend, while children's movies, such as "How to Trash Dragon 2" are also disappointed by delivery.
The film criticism Telegraph Robby Collin indicates that when it comes to children's movies, it may be a bad quality of movies.
Collin called 2014 a "worst" year in the whole history of children's movies, and called "How to supplement a dragon 2" barely "functioning" of the fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at the audience of a few older ages, the problem seems not necessarily to be films itself.
In July, the Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic of each summer-profit film in number of at least 2000 copies between the Memorial Day in May and 20 July, 2013 and this year.
The results that take into account the views of both the cinemaists and the cinematics suggest that the fertility of the films this year is similar to the caliber with the last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that this may be about changing visual habits and increasing popularity of streamlines, such as Netflix.
The director John Favro, who is currently working on the rapidly out-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-school "Lung Book" said to the Hollywood Reporter web site, "I think the time is changing."
We must admit it and not try to pursue what was before.
In contrast to the current decline in Hollywood, Netflix's income from the stream reproduction service has reached $1.2 billion, almost double over the last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studies for being too relying on comics franchises, and foretold Hollywood's collapse.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators claim that there was a share of truth in its dark prophecies.
Since in the summer of 2015, several potential cass hits were expected, including " Vengeances: Ere Altron", "Miñonov" and "Urban Park", other film industry representatives were more optimistic.
Producer of "Human X" Simon Kinberg recently called the fall of the cass collections just "cyclic," said Hollywood Reporter, "The next summer will be the most late summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Product sanctions do not frighten the owners of cavcasian and medium-Azian houses, but for European and Japanese restaurants, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
In general, publicity is still preferred to replace the prohibited imports of products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"There is a little salt cocktail than a bad mozarel," the chief cook of the Italian restaurant, Barlotti Mariano Valerio, is broken about the quality of cheese offered by the suppliers in exchange for Italians.
Mozarella and burrat cheese ended up in a restaurant first, and they have a little time for storage.
Parmezan's stock should be enough for a few more months.
What to do?
Going to Russian?
In 2005, I was in the Dorogomilov market.
Mariano Valerio does such eyes that it is clear that shocking memories still do not let him go.
The meat was on the cart only 30 centimeters from the floor!
There's cats!
Rats!
Then I said that we'd never buy anything in the Russian markets for our restaurant.
I don't know, maybe everything's changed right now.
But they brought me a fish from the Dale East.
That's how she turned out to be a brick!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many of the ordinary things for Italy for the Russian producer in the wildlife.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy a Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is hanged in the frozen cell for 10 days at 1-2 degrees.
It must depend to be soft to relax the muscles.
I did all this with the local beef.
Then they asked me, where did you get this gentle meat?
I said, that's yours, Russian!
Why don't you have anyone to do that?
Five minutes of walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" in the kitchen hangs a stopping list in which the products are not available: French oysters, seafood.
The chief of the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" and the "Shooter" bar, Režis Trigel is not so pessimistic as Valerio: the streets from France have already replaced the tunis oysters, and instead of the French cheese restaurants will buy Swiss.
However, Regis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers, "Capusta is 200 rubles!
I'm asking, "Why is it worth so much?"
They say, "We have to make money, too."
But this coupon should not cost more than 80 rubles!
We're buying weighs from the east, but they live 15 to 20 years, you know how much their armor weighs?
The price is that it's a super delicate.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources for foreign cooking.
Standard history: "The first three months were all right, then the quality fell sharply."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot endure stable calibers and quality.
Many European kitchen restaurants don't know what happens when cheese stocks are over

Sanctions Menu
On 6 August, the President Vladimir Putin signed an order for individual economic measures to ensure Russia ' s security, which are mostly called product sanctions.
The country is prohibited from importing beef, pigs, meat and sub-products from domestic birds, meat delicates, fish, milk, yogurts, made, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugars.
The restaurants started with suppliers: the prices of the products have increased, and we need to find similars from other countries.
The most important thing will be in expensive restaurants from France, Italy, Spain, where the products were placed directly from the "mater" countries.
The community had to rebuild before.
For example, when in the beginning of 2014 Rossellhozzar prohibited the import of Australian beef and a year earlier the American and Canadian flesh.
In exchange, suppliers have provided deliveries of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But summer-2014 sanctions were far more serious.
True, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev adopted amendments to the presidential decree, which exempt from the prohibition of males of Atlantic losos and forrels, free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, garlic and seeds for seeds.
The Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions can still be mitigated.
At the same time, a part of the restaurants exists under uncertainty.
According to the East-West company, one of the largest HoReCa suppliers, import products in the premium segment were up to 70 per cent.
"The expensive restaurants will have to change menus to what local farmers and other countries produce," said Sergei Mironov, the restaurant, the owner of the RestConsalt Agency.
If the chief cook is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
We only have very few cooks, and a new menu can go for two or three months.
The Trigel from the Brasserie Bridge restaurant is ready to do this: 10 to 15 per cent of the meal, half more menu to rework.
In mixed kitchen restaurants are already starting to replace foods, such as marble beefstrogan steak, says Sergei Mironov.
"The cheese from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheese, cheese from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," said the representative of the East-West Oxana Glibchuk.
The slippers and breast products from Europe have analogies in Russia and Belarus.
The chicken from the United States can be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, a salmon and a semga from Norway - łososem, semgoy, Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated by the production of national producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
In the view of Mironov, the budget restaurants will be rebuilt easier than the premial segment: there were hardly gurmans that could distinguish Italian mocarel from Russian.
Although it is difficult for the establishment of the Ginza Project, he considers it.
Ginza Project has several dozens of restaurants under different brands and with its menus.
A lot of time will be replaced," said Mironov.
In Ginza, the comments were refused by referring to the absence of owners in the country.
Café owners of Café and Mediterranean kitchen emphasize that products from former Soviet republics are more smelling than European
But a lot of restaurants whose sanctions are almost not touched.
These include houses from the CIS kitchen: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijan.
"There are no expensive foods in the Georgian kitchen," said Hatuna Kolbaya, owner of the Georgian Saperavi restaurant and cafeteria "You Me!".
All cheese are done for us in Russia, based on many chicken branches, exotic greens we do not use."
Colbai's places have not yet been removed from the menus of any food.
Timor Lansky, the owner of Chihone N1 restaurants with Uzbek kitchen, is not disturbed by sanctions: he must only change lamb into New Zealand.
If Russia gets imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we even win the price, this will be cheaper for us than the imports from Europe, he says.
The CNG can be cheaper for cutting, lamb, tomatoes, barbers, fruits.
It is much better from the "plastik" from Italy, Spain and Turkey, which is being brought from Central Asia.
The Uzbek Tomatoes know they're delicious, sweet.
No one talks like that about Spanish.
Following the sanctions, the representative of Minselvodhoza of Uzbekistan, Olymboy Artics, said that he planned to increase the export of fruit products to Russia twice by 2016.
The intention of replaceing the European imports in Russia almost immediately after the introduction of sanctions was made by Belarus and Kazakhstan.
Fastfood restaurants that responded to the Money's request have also responded quite quietly to sanctions.
The McDonald's press service stated that the location exceeds 85% and the network is working with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanová, the head of the Department of Work with Subway Russia, about 80 per cent of the products of the network is purchased in Russia, although timely difficulties with delivery of vegetables and growth of prices for meat products produced from import raw materials.
In the Teremca, "sanctional products" were not more than 4% at all.
They didn't touch the sanctions and the Walker.
KFC, Burger King and Krasco Cartosk did not respond to the "Monetary" request, but other market participants claim that the localization of Burger King was significantly less than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, the restauranters are willing to buy Chilia rather than the Russian Far Eastern
On his throat
At the same time, the restaurants complain that the demand of prices increases even for local products.
"The prices for Grabley increased by a average of 10 to 15 per cent, for the Italian Cherry Mio restaurant twice," said Roman Rožnikovski restaurant.
Even in Georgian restaurants, a meal will grow by 5 to 10 per cent, acknowledges Kolbaya.
"East West" does not deny this: "For example, the Belarusian breast products have travelled 10 to 15 per cent since August."
"Brazilian suppliers raised pig prices almost twice," complains Sergei Rak, Deputy Director-General Stardogs.
The chickens traveled 35 per cent.
We're expecting prices from China, maybe they'll cold Brazilian heads.
The Stardogs will soon increase the prices by 8 per cent.
Now it's very unwanted to raise prices," says Rac.
Statistics show that the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest indicator since 2010.
Different prices will continue to grow, he admits, but it is unreasonable how quickly: as long as most restauranters have acquired products for the next two months in the hope of availability of procurement prices.
But in two months, no one knows.
The area before the mayor of Moscow is tens of ten ten tens of the tens of green and trees decorated.
In the center of the scene, musicians play valve.
It is a regional festival of funny named "There's time."
"We have been going to make a local food celebration for a long time, and here are sanctions, we have hurryed up, organized a festival," said one organizer.
At the scene with Greek cooks, Anastas cooked salads from macarons and house cupcakes, and there was a master-class of preparing bowl with caramelized apples.
All of the Russian products, they assure organizers.
The tents are the exhibition of the achievements of the Russian people's household.
Honey from Baskiria, olenne from Salehard, vegetables from the sulphur of Lenina's name, cheese from a crushed Italian, Jay Clouse.
"The lossoa for restaurants can be placed quietly by other salmon species from the Dale East," said the owner of the fish store "Our people" Philipp Galkin.
We've got kidneys, cats, squirrels, squirrels, coffins, royal salmons.
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon because it's a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
If you take him in your hands, he's not even moving.
And you can't keep our east salmons in your hands.
Only buildings without special claims agree to replace the Italian national powerall
In his tent, there are shrimps with the Magadan bureau, fever, omel, muxune, Crim's midwigs, far Eastern greaves.
Galkin is sure that it's time to go to fish from the Dale East.
According to statistics, fishing in Russia in 2013 is more than 4 million tonnes, and a large part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea, and even in the United States.
The import of fish in 2013 is approximately 800 thousand tonnes.
The "Our People" lamb has been working since 2012, selling fish through the Internet stores, before the sanctions were introduced, they served a dozen more than a dozen restaurants, such as "Simple things".
Galkin has now received requests from 15 more restaurants.
The same drought can be made of our fish, he's hot.
We've been dark, we've tried different recipes.
Now we sell sushi through the Internet store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is cheaper several times, and the delivery is at least 15 rubles per kilogram.
I've got the Philadelphia in the Galkin tent confirmed.
Unlike the rolls, these must be chewed longer, but the consciousness that this fish is our patriotic is strong.
There are even rolls from the palto and the seafish.
In the sushi bars, it is true that the replacement of Norwegian losos prefers Chile.
Galkin explains this by the fact that cooks of lions come up with new prescriptions with far Eastern fish.
"The Russian fish suppliers have not yet been offered to us," explains the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitri Euseev.
Approximately the same situation as with other products: Russian producers could take the free-free poultry, but that does not happen.
According to the founder and companion of the Lavka Lavka Boris Akimov project, imports from Europe and America could be replaced by imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with strong logistics and large volumes.
They are able to replace the prohibited imports quickly, unlike our farmers.
I mean, the large producers of other countries will win from the ban," said Akimov.
However, in the last month, the restaurant industry received a more alarming signal than the product sanctions.
Following the mass extra-plan checks of the Rossenger was temporarily suspended by three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Ekaterinburg.
"We are examining the importance of claims made for the determination of the activities necessary for the rapid opening of restaurants for visitors," said the "Money" in the McDonald's press service.
No one really understands what's going to happen.
If all are limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, said an anonymous company consultant.
But if McDonald's starts to close all over the country, the scenario will be completely different.
EuroProtocol instead of GIBD questioning
Casco payments will be obtained without GIBD, so the CB intends to stimulate the implementation of the European Colonel in Russia.
The Russian Bank has developed a project of instructions that, from 1 September this year, the insurance carrier would be able to do without the GIBD.
It's true, it's only the case when the accident was formed by the European Circle without the involvement of the road police.
In fact, if only two cars were involved in the DTP, there are no physically affected persons, the damage does not exceed the limit set, and both drivers agreed on who was responsible for the accident.
Since 2 August, the “Europotocol” limits are $50,000, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in Moscow and Leningrad regions, it will be increased to 400,000.
The point is, frequently, even in a minor injury, in a situation where the PDP can be formed on the European Circle, the drivers who have accidents are causing DPS.
Because, when there was a casco policy, there was no reimbursement without a GIBD.
Options contained in the draft instructions are just intended to eliminate this obstacle to the implementation of the European Colonel in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment of the casco in connection with the TFP provided without GIBD staff should not be less than the limit on the “Europroprophocol”.
However, it cannot be even above the limit defined in the Casco insurance treaty.
The idea is definitely useful and theoretically capable of unloading both DPS staff and roads.
But she probably won't be excited by carists or insurance officers.
The latter has already been referring to a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which may lead to new rules of payment by casco.
With regard to drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work to do to overcome the executive Russian conservation.
The driver will wait for an inspector in most cases for hours to make a small accident, because it is more reliable.
And not even known what would be easier to conquer frauds or convince drivers of the confidence of the European Colonel.
The saving certificate will be made named and unresponsible
Minfin wishes to ban storage certificates on the receiver, but it will allow banks to make them analogous of an unresponsive contribution.
Minfin is preparing a bill that will prohibit the reservation certificates of the applicant.
Recently, this tool has become popular, since the rates are higher than banking contributions.
The fact is that the relief certificates of the contractor are not incurred to the investment insurance system, and the bank costs cheaper because they do not have to be deferred to the Investment Insurance Fund (ABC).
The impression of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium-sized banks distributing such certificates and will suffer from Sberbank and the Moscow Bank, which, according to the ABC, control 98 per cent of the profile market.
The share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the Agency, is approximately 3.5 per cent.
The problem, explained in the ASC, is that the small bank clients who bought such a certificate are trying to obtain money from the ASCs in case of revocation.
Some investors, without sufficient financial literacy and buying saving certificates for the contractor, may assume that their contributions are insuranceed.
The lack of insurance payments on these certificates in the event of the revocation of the licence from the bank may lead to disagreement and social tension.
In practice, the Agency had cases when the holders of certificates tried to reimburse the insurance reimbursement through the court," said the ACP.
The problem, of course, is incredible.
In fact, no one will pay the certification buyers, as they have no right to reimburse from the State.
If the instrument was not insured in the ASC, it would also be prohibited by metal accounts where the funds of citizens were taken into account in grams of one of four metals: gold, silver, platine and palladia.
Because these accounts also do not fall into the Investment Insurance System, but they are not yet to be tried.
The issue is, probably, that the certificates of the applicant are a very convenient valuable paper, which can actually act as a quasideng.
Their displacement is almost uncontrolled: any bank client can buy a certificate, transfer to any citizen, and a number of hosts may change before the establishment of a certificate.
It is not coincidence that the reservation certificate must be a precisely valuable paper that must be stored in the depositary.
In order to cute the pill to the banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right of a preliminary exemption.
It is an example of an unresponsive contribution that bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The weekends were protested by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in Newport Centre for a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff's war for what was described as an anti-samith.
Steven Fairclaw monitored the development of events during the weekend and talked to the protesters who arrived from everywhere: from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will put weapons in Iraq to counter the terrorist group of the Islamic State, reporting on 31 August, ITAR-TASS, with reference to the decision taken by the Government of the FRG meeting, headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reportedly to send 30 transmitted anti-potato missiles Milan and 500 charges to Iraq, as well as 8,000 Shooting Guns G3 and G36.
The supplies will be implemented by the end of September.
Furthermore, it was decided to allocate Iraq another 50 million euros to humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will make a public statement on this subject.
Germany has not yet placed its weapons in the burning points.
The views of the residents of the FRG on the shipment of weapons to Iraq were divided.
Some believe that it is the only way to stop the fighters from the Islamic State, others fear that the weapons can eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Communities conquered Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea
The Donetsk Attorneys conquered the Ukrainian patrol board in the Azov Sea, reports ITAR-TASS on 31 August.
According to existing data, this happened in the Taganrogue Gulf near the settlements of Shirokino and the Unnamed (10-20 km east of Mariopol).
A number of Ukrainian media reported the shooting of two coastal guards.
It is clear that the incident occurred today about 16:20 MSC.
Adolescents were taken on a helicopter from the Blue Mountains
Two buchooker teenagers were delivered to a helicopter to a safe place after they spent the night, stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and a 18-year-old man went to a march shortly after Sunday at Hovets Lip in Blackhit.
Comforted relatives called the police about 8 a.m. when they didn't get home.
A search team was sent to the local police and rescue team, and a couple found around 11 a.m. near the Bridal Wail waterfall.
The girl hurt her knee, and a young man fell down and hit his head.
The officers stayed with a couple for the night, and they were raised on the swan on Monday morning.
They were transferred to Blue Mountains in an ambulance.
Two Unions met
The negotiations at the highest level in Minsk did not solve the challenges for which they had been convened but had created a new format: the first members of the European Union met with the first persons of the future Eurosia
Let the EU and the Tamonite Union leaders have discussed a number of " hot problems" for the first time, for the concerns (the situation around Ukraine is not tolerate).
If such a structure is able to work effectively, irrelevantly; but it is clear who took the slippers off the summit.
The questions were taken into account on the evening of 26 August, when the Belarus and the other Europeanians saw the news of the new President Lukašenko.
The Belarusian leader showed an example of excellent courtesy, that was the behaviour of a man who had just broken the jackpot and planned a decent age in a higher society.
How Midan Lucashenko helped
The arrival in Minsk was immediately three major European Commissioners (EU Ministers), who met with Lukašenko and allowed him to speak at a final briefing on their behalf, not just the legitimacy of the President with the 20-year-old age.
This is an application for the recognition of Minsk as a full-level entity of European policy and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
The senior analyst of the Belarus Institute of Strategic Research, Dennis Melianz, is confident that since now Brussels will not be able to talk to Minsk the same tone as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met a tet with Lucašenko gives reason to believe that the relationship with the EU will continue to frozen," he said, "Fire."
The iceberg has a hidden part: the preparation for the breakdown of the Belarus authorities began long before the November Mayan in Kiev in the summer of 2013.
"The results have been achieved and with the EU -- successful negotiations on visa simplification and readmissal, dialogue on modernization -- lists the Fireman -- and international security negotiations have been negotiated with the United States.
The States even took off some sanctions.
With regard to Ukrainian developments, they have only reaction to the leadership of Belarus.
Minsk, on the one hand, has been able to maintain a relationship with Ukraine, is warm enough to avoid losing in mutual trade, and President Porousenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarus leader, who did not recognize Crime's accession to Russia and called for pro-russian generals in Donbass to punish all the rigorousness, did not argue with Moscow.
Minsk did not leave the Tamone Union or the CEDAW, and the Russian Aviation Base is located in Baranovic.
Brussels and Washington noticed the balanced position of Minsk on Ukrainian - and evaluated it, as assured by Belarusian experts.
As Lucašenko ' s movement to political diversification has been successful, it will be seen as soon as Minsk will have to take EU+TS meetings.
In the press service of the EU High Representative on External Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to respond quickly to questions on what Brussels expects from relations in a new format.
The press secretary Ashton Maya Kosjanchić only stated "Fire" that the topic was not priority in the framework of the solution to war and peace issues.
It was reported that the next meeting on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format could also be Kazakhstan.
The drop of degtja for Minsk was a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbaev, which he admitted that it was found to be requested by the representatives of the European Union.
However, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukašenko made it clear that all parties would not mind that Minsk remain a central site for meetings both in Russia-OBSE-Ukraine and at the level of Heads of State and High Representatives of the European Commission.
This means that "the latest European dictator" has a full-handed European leader who helps solve the global problem.
Best friend of the European farmer
The composition of the EU delegation, including the Commissioners for Trade and Energy, has already been emphasized to the conclusion that the main sub-pipe of the summit is not a tragic situation in Donbass, but the economy.
In fact, the schedule for future gas delivery negotiations and overcome the concerns of TS countries on the Association Agreement with Ukraine with the EU seemed greater than the peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
The Commissioner for Trade, Karl De Guht, however, noted: EU representatives " arrived in Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis that has economic implications rather than the contrary."
It seems, however, that the crisis in Ukraine also works for Belarus.
His implications -- and mostly the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia -- are given to Minsk, who is still experiencing the sanctional pressure, the long-expected field for maneuver.
According to the Director of the Scientific Research Centre, the former candidate at the President of Belarus, Yaroslav Romanchuka, European investors are actively interested in the opportunities of Belarus to supplement selho-product to RF for sanctions.
The supplies, for which Vladimir Putin condemned Minsk at the summit.
"The initiators of these schemes, " emphasized Romancuk " Fire" -- not the Belarus businessmen, but the Russian companies.
They have long worked on supplies, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and these schemes have been destroyed today.
The Russian Business is strictly needed to restore them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, continues the expert, is that many Ukrainian companies are able to manage the production in Belarus from Ukraine commodity with the orientation of the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about 4 billion dollars of exports to Russia, and the Belarus productive trade schemes can now be very demanded."
Romanchuka believes that the role of the master of the field for EU and TS negotiations is perfect for Lukašenko and in terms of development of economic links with Europe.
It recalls that the loss of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow sanctions is estimated to EUR 5-10 billion, and the European Commission has now offered only 125 million euro compensation to Agraria.
The Belarusian President may invite Brussels to work together in order to minimize the consequences for European farmers.
This could raise Lukašenko's authority in the EU to an unexpected height.
Hospital without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the summit initiative.
However, the paradox is that the official Minsk from its active role in the birth of the TS+EU format is excreted, and the Belarusian leader at the meeting with the Ukrainian colleague emphasized that the initiator of the new format was Kiev.
"It was your proposal to gather, without any inadequate discussion, not from the barracks to decide, after the signing of the Association Treaty with the EU, to deal with the situation that was at that time in Ukraine," he addressed the cameras to Peter Porochenko.
However, observers interpreted it as an attempt to calm Moscow, it reportedly was initially against Minsk's mediation, which has increased its political weight.
The Belarus diplomatic office emphasizes carefully that Belarus does not pursue useful goals in the organization of EU and TS on its earth, but the final goal of such a format is to create in the future a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
"It is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that in other areas, in particular in the field of security, promoting and promoting the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," said the Fire in the Military of Belarus, a department where the words have recently been scrupulously chosen.
In Moscow, pay-entry zones may appear
The Government of Moscow considers the option of introducing a pay-entry zones as a means of combating the overload of central roads by analogy to other major cities of the world, M24.ru refers to Moscow's entrepreneur on transport issues of Maxim Lixutov.
One of the options that successfully recommended itself is a paid entry.
It's an expert opinion, we'll definitely study it, see all the minuss and positives.
Speaking that some decisions have been made before early," Lixutov said.
Zammera emphasized that the capital authorities are very important to Asian cities, which are similar to Moscow by structure and loading.
One of the decisions taken from these countries has already been the implementation of the central ring road, the Lixutes added.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of not necessarily the whole traffic through Moscow.
If there was a sufficient circuit infrastructure, there was no need for transit traffic in Moscow," said the Zammar.
Maxim Lixutov also stated that the introduction of salary parkings had significantly unloaded capital streets.
And, he said, the capital authorities do not plan to stop at the achievement.
Recall, on 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobinin, participated in the ceremony of the construction of the first Moscow Central Ring Road (CCAD).
Bored
The film of Frank Miller and Robert Rodrigues, City of Sins-2: The woman for which it is worth killing has done the wrong revolution that could have been expected.
The first “Grad of Sins” (2005), taken from the minimum but symbolic, the participation of Quentin Tarantino, has made a revolution in relations between the movies, comics and the literary noire.
Sikwell is also revolutionary: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental for contemporary thinking of the “thesis anti-tesis synthesis” chain (if under the tissue understanding the universe of Nuar and the antithesis is a comic space).
From now on, it should be read: "Thesis antithesis is chaos."
"Grad of Sins-2" is both chaotic at the dramatical and philosophical level: both times it is chaotic in a stupid sense of word.
Yes, part of the heroes are familiar with the first city, although, here, Marv (Mickey Rurk), he remembers, ended his life on the electric chair and here, nothing but manages to grab -- in the role of this people's wife -- from the air of the knives and other sekyes with ducks.
But the old people are literally pushed off by the elbows, as if they broke into the city from some other movie, about the meaning and the story of which the viewers were asked not to worry.
Yes, his story, unhappy overwhelmed by the authors in the most interesting place, has a superior player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
His Lord of Eva Green and something revengeing her Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But the confusion in which Dwighte, let's say, not to distinguish from Johnny -- more people, as well as other parts of the body, are faced with unpleasant regularity, not trouble or even half-beeds.
They're not people, we realize that it's architects of Nuara: a year-old bitch, too sure of himself, a player who's involving a honey trap of sex detective, a corrupt senator.
Well, when architecture walses with architecture and architects, it's not a movie anymore, but read that abstract painting.
And asking abstract painting questions about the logic of the story is funny.
Furthermore, even in this crazy world, there is something permanent.
Fighting whores from the first city continue to keep circuit defense against their native forces of darkness.
And the ghost of Detective Hartigan doesn't look at the fire, and Bruce Willis is always happy to see.
The main problem of "Grad of Sins-2" is another.
Frank Miller was good because as the drawer had tallly connected comic books and Nuar, and as a director, he turned the idea of how to put comics on the screen.
Comic and Nuar are two aggressively contrary "realities".
The comicing phenomenon was born at the end of the 1920s, while the romance of Dashill Hammet "Blood harvest" (1929), "Malthian Socole" (1930) and "Gassy Key" (1931) created a canon of noara named then hard-boiled school -- "cool school".
Or a pulp fiction.
The comics gave Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from the seaman of Popaya, the hunger of the spine, giving him the rich force, Superman, Batman and the finder of Dick Tracy to Halk, Thor, Spider Man and other "revengeers".
But in any cinema on the motives of comics, there was something harmful: creative characters did not want to grow up with the screen flesh, they were pretending to be around their "real" world wills.
Easy to say, they were completely deprived of "existence."
Noir, on the contrary, is the most existent genre of world literature.
After World Wars, the traditional romance - with experiences, characters, family scandals and historical background - lost all persuasiveness.
What are the Forsits, which are Tibo and Rugon McKare, even the Bolcons and Rostovs after Verden, Auschwitz and Hirosim?
Such a novel mutated peacefully in the form of soap opera, and the criminal - by definition of a marginal - the romance rose to the level of philosophy.
Hemmet found out what it was to be a sanitary at the front.
He was a communist.
As a matter of fact, at least they were close to the company and the bands of the genre, such as Horas McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Julie Dassen, Joseph Louzi, Edward Dmitrik.
Therefore, the architecture they have given, first, tough and cynical, and secondly, too social.
It's almost an American option of socialism.
The first “Grad of Sins” was noted by what was unnatural but organicly connected the comic book with the nuar.
For the first time on the screen, the comic book lived without shying his graphical nature, rather than pretending to be a real movie.
The darkness of the sales world, where the cardinal ordered murders, and the senator covered the monster sadist son, was worthy of Hammet's feather.
And the painting details such as the cut off heads by which the sadist decorated his nest, the feather of the genius James Elroy, the Black Orchidea, and the best - the declaratively nasty representative of the neonaire.
"Grad of Sins-2" is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of the radical style of Miller-Rodrigues before the tradition of the comicle.
Probably because of 3D technologies, it's a lot of things.
When you look at the second city of sins, you feel locked in a glass ball, in which snow falls asleep in a toy cloak.
But most of all, it's not a snow, it's blood wreck, but what's the big difference?
Well, there's nothing to say about sociality.
Because it's only possible when somewhere, somewhere in our place, let's make it on the edge of the dirty moor, but there's a normal world where a girl can be returned on the curve path or, say, uncomfortable parents, that her killer is punished.
But when there is no place in the city of sin but a sin, there is no more sin than a norm.
It's boring like any normal.
Chaos City of Sins-2 is just boring.
For justice, the patriotic sale gave this fresh sin a small but a pair.
Titters warn that the film contains harmful smoking scenes.
As regards the vision of the vegetarian episode that is broken by a man by his fingers, it gives a hell of a humor.
Hemmet would love it.
France's socialists should "close and bring France in order," said the key ally of Frasua Ollanda
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left forces to "promote warm attitude" to the attacks of the socioist president whose stops have not been approved by the oppressive majority of French.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay close to him," he said, provoking applauses.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister assured that his Government would not question a controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the burning conflict of proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economy, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Olland begged his companions on the Socialist Party to remain “one” with the Government.
However, Christian Tobira, the Minister of Justice, put her sticks in wheels by coming to the meeting of the disagreeable members of the Parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to " lose faith in the future".
Marin le Pe, the leader of the extremely right National Front, expressed despise to permanent internal conflicts among socialists, saying that she did not imagine that the new Government of Vala would last for more than a few months.
François Olland is a naked king, but naked and Prince Manuel Valle, has been forced to gather a new government when the past was not lasting even summer.
"And the new will not last autumn or winter," said Mrs. Le Penn reporters.
She reiterated the call of her party to disband Parliament, saying that she was convinced that the party could easily win in prior elections and willing to manage.
The Ruling Party of France has suffered a disturbance at the March municipal elections, and the extremely right National Front came first at the EU elections in May.
A survey of Sunday Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is risking a few competitive fractions to the end of Mr. Olland's presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a politician from the University of Seans Po, warned that the French would soon lose their patience if the new socialist Government could not fix the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but the public opinion needs to feel that something is changing quickly," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may become even worse.
"The city without drugs" has gone out of search
The Swiss arbitration court left without consideration the orderary directive of the Regional Ministry for Hospital Management to the " City Without Drugs" Fund.
The acquisition of more than 7 million run as a rent in the centre of Ekaterinburg.
However, the expiry did not appear twice.
Today, the arbitral court of the Sweddlow area has left an executive directive of the Ministry of Public Affairs (MUGISO) to the " City Without Drugs" Fund (one of the founders, Mayor of Ecateringburg, Eugene Royzman).
The representatives of the district authorities intend to seek from the organization 7.3 million run as a rental fee.
Today it was known that the expiry had not appeared to the court twice, which had resulted in a decision to refuse the consideration.
The reason for the absence of representatives in the IUGISO directive was unable to explain, and the Chief of the Legal Division Maxim Titov did not respond to the phone calls.
The fund's representatives also failed to contact.
Recall, it is a loop that took funds in the centre of the city in Belinsky Street, 19 on a remuneration basis since 2011.
That was the decision taken by the former Governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Ministry of Public Affairs Management Directorate filed a complaint to the Sweddlelov arbitration court on the expulsion of the fund from the building.
According to the case, the Office required the court to acknowledge the unlocked treaty of non-retail use as a memorial premises.
In the opinion of the IUGISO directive, there were no substantial conditions for the rent of the cultural heritage object.
The Swiss arbitration court rejected the case, and the 17th arbitration court of Perma, which was satisfied, was appealed.
The Fund subsequently filed a касsation complaint on this decision, which remained unsatisfactory, and the decision was then appealed by the Fund in the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the Court adopted the side of the directive.
In 2013 a new rental contract was concluded, where the fund began to pay the rent again, the head of the city, Eugene Royzman, was told.
The rent was awarded 300 thousand a month.
The previous field administration has transferred this building to remuneration, recognizing our credit for drugs in respect of the fund.
The current administration has decided differently," he said.
Tatiana Drogeva, Ecaterinburg
Why the Mayor of Ecaterinburg was invited to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, the deputy of Ecaterinburg's pride, Alexander Kosinac, invited the mayor of the city, the speaker of the pride of Eugene Royzman to resign.
The criminal case was brought to an arrested suspect of the murder of the deputy deputy of the pride of Oleg Kinev, who was considered as a colleague of the mayor.
How Eugene Rhoiseman found a criminal case
On 1 July, the criminal proceedings on the fact “clears” (art. 128.1 RF) were known in the blog of Mayor Ecaterinburg of Eugenia Royzman.
This was reported in the IMD on the Sweddlow area, where the director of the Legal Centre of the Protection Centre, Anna Filatov, made a statement.
According to her, Mr. Roiseman accused her of his blog records that she was involved in crimes that her ex-husband seemed to be committed.
Mayor Ecaterinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to revenge the truth."
iPhone turns into a wallet
On 9 September, when Apple should present its new developments, the press appears in all the new leaks of what can be expected from the presentation.
With reference to sources, the US media reported that the sixth generation of iPhone would be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint Apple and payment systems project Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to the Bloomberg and the specialized re/code Internet resource, the new products of the Apple, on 9 September, could announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, resulting in a new iPhone 6 mobile wallet function.
Companies themselves refuse any comments on this matter.
This function allows payments on the smartphone tape.
The identification of the payment will be carried out by the user on his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that NFC (near field communication) will first be built in iPhone, which allows non-contact payments using the smartphone and the appropriate recording device on the tape.
The NFC technology itself will be available through a special microprocessor from the Dutch High Technology NXP (ex Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC function was presented for the first time in 2004 in cooperation with Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than hundreds of other companies in the so-called NFC Forum, the Association for Promotion of the Technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with the NFC - Samsung Nexus S was presented in 2010.
In May 2011, Google presented the Google Wallet system that allows users to tie banking cards to their Google accounts and pay off with the smartphone to the Android.
However, American experts emphasize that despite the large investment of high-tech companies in NFC technologies, American rhytelers are still cautious to innovation and are not too willing to spend money on the equipment of their shops with such systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple's exit to the market will still make the rhylers accelerate and actively implement this technology in their trading points.

The official representative of the MID of France, Roman Nadal, stated that Paris was constantly positioned on the delivery of Russian helicopters like Mistral.
"I can remind the statement of the President of the Republic (Francuse Ollanda) made in his interview with the Le Monde newspaper of 20 August: "Now the level of sanctions does not obstacle the delivery.

Thus, the representative of the French Foreign Political Office responded to the question whether the situation in Ukraine would be worsened to change Paris' position on the implementation of the contract
For more information on the delivery of helicopters to Russia, read in the magazine "Ognic" "Mistral" nearly ours.

Activists of the Hong Kong Democratic Movement discontinue the statement of the Chinese representative on the next day following the election decision
The Group of Citizens Loyal to Beijing stood nearby, waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the General Assembly of People's Representatives established a procedure on Sunday, under which only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in Hong Kong's elections in 2017.
All candidates must first receive support from most members of the Movement Committee, which would likely be filled with pekines loyalties.
It makes the decision almost impossible for the democratic opposition to get into the electoral bulletin and forced democratic movement activists to reconcile to stop the Hong Kong financial centre with the Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, since Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will be extended to other cities.
Following the publication of Beijing, the document describes China's control over Hong Kong, in June, the activists of democratic movement conducted an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city's business centre and set up a seating strike.
Briefing Lee is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Association Bureau in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the All-Chinese People's Meeting of Geng Rongshun and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong Bureau and Macao State Council, Fang Wei, were also required to speak in a series of briefings during the day.
Students stated that they would be gathered from the building of the head of the Government of Hong Kong on the afternoon.
Britain has not mentioned the democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to join 400 ha land belonging to Palestinian autonomy
Israeli authorities announced that they were intended to accede 400 hectares of land on the west coast of Jordan, belonging to the Palestinian autonomy.
According to BBC, the decision to join the South Bethlehem was to reimburse the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The Ministry of Defence of Israel stated on the territories on Sunday and commanded the military to set up administrative administration in the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Saiba Arikat sector, the world public should call upon Israel to be responsible for the “continued settlement activity in the west coast of Jordan and East Jerusalem”.
Putin requires Kiev to begin negotiations on " state" of Eastern Ukraine
According to the Russian news reports on his comments, the Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Sunday that the Ukrainian Government cease the fight against separatists in the east of the country and immediately launch the negotiations on the “government” of the separate region.
His press secretary, Dmitri Peskov, later explained that Putin had not meant that the Eastern Ukraine Territory would be part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine had to be revised to give the Russian region the opportunity to protect its rights and interests.
However, the call of Putin to the Kiev Government to initiate negotiations with the pro-rusian rebels as equally corresponded to the apparent strategy that it had to be taken from the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help separatists take the territory and force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly pronounced territory of New Rosy a genuine independence to draw close to Russia rather than to the West.
In an interview with the State First Television Channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the return of the Territory separatists held in the Eastern Donetsk and Lugan regions, which were captured in March and April after Moscow analyzed the Ukrainian Crime полуotope on 18 March.
Kreml and separatists have recently called the territories enrolled by New Russia, or New Russia, a name that sends to the prerevolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believes that peace negotiations would take place in the near future when Ukrainian policies began campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October, while government troops attacked peace settlements in the regions held by separatists, “Illusions captive”, ITAR TASS reported.
"We must immediately begin content negotiations, not only on technical matters, but also on the political instrument of society and the state status of South-East Ukraine, in order to cover the interests of people living there," he said.
Peskow said that the words of Putin on State were in the context of a broader autonomy, which had been discussed with the leaders in Kiev for months in trying to relieve fears in Russian areas, that their cultural and language rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not a matter of discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The interference of the Secretary-General of Kreml to correct the "faithful interpretation" of Putin's words emphasized the decision of the Russian leadership to behave in respect of the separatist rebellion in the east in a different way than the open capture of Crime, where most of the two million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have had to endure a much more difficult battle to join even the Donetsk and Lugan East Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants were not Russians, and the surveys before the start of the conflict showed wide support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that the Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would allow regional Governments in Ukraine to establish trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact, by transmitting Kremlu actual control over the territory that would link the main territory of Russia to Crime.
The Black Sea Half Island, which was accompanied five months ago, is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial marine institutions and historic sea courts.
There are also mines, factories and lithuanial factories that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petr Porošenko invited during his inaugurational speech on 7 June that Ukrainian legislators should have halted the amendments to the constitution, allowing the separate regions to give greater control of their finances and status of languages.
However, his view of autonomy appears to be much different from the views of Kreml and separatists rebels, in arms and incitement, accused of Moscow.
The latest call of Putin to Kiev to negotiate with the leaders of separatists, as equals, followed the new attacks of rebels last week after the Russian troops and tanks entered Eastern Ukraine from the earliest peace area along the Asian Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia have controlled the city of Novoazsk in the attack that Ukrainian Security Services have said they feared that it was the beginning of a strategic coastal campaign until Crime itself.
This has led to a large civil and military effort to strengthen Mariopol, a steady port of 500000 inhabitants, which is between Novoazov and a narrow passage to the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday, the European Union leaders in Brussels called for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which was independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching the point of inauguration," warned Porozenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take certain measures; leaders called for a draft more severe sanctions against Russia, which would be adopted in case of an escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Ilowaya after two Russian armored colons and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support separatists' difficulties, Colonel Andrew Lisenko, the press Secretary of the Council on National Security and Defence of Ukraine, informed the reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers, which are reportedly kept in Ilowaya as a result of Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian aircraft captured in the Ukraine Territory a week ago, Lisenko reported on Sunday.
Scandal with naked photos captures Australian celebrity and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his disgusting to hackers who may have stolen the naked photos of his bride Gaby Greco and the entire list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood was disgusted after a number of open photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence came online as a result of a great hacker scandal with famousness.
It is said that a hacker responsible for this has about 60 open photos of the star "Hold Games" and superstars, including Kate Appton and Kara Delevin, the singers of Ryan, Arian Grande and Lea Michelle and hero Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Страхowski, and living in Melbourne Greco also had been stolen photos as a result of iCloud escape.
The list of 101 names of celebrity.
Edelsten, who made a proposal last month, said Confidential: "This is disgusting."
All private mailing and photos must remain private.
It's terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is in New York, reportedly told the news site that the hacker attack was "shy" and that those whom she was directed "seemed to be invaded".
The hacker is supposed to have 30 photos of Palmer with a former boy Scott Spidman, including two frames where it is located at the pool with a naked breast.
Palmer's work in the movies include "Love and Honor" along with Liam Hamsworth.
Palmer, the star of the "Chack" Insurance and an actress from the "Forbidden Receipt" Browning didn't comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
The representative of Lawrence said TMZ: "This is a rapid invasion into private life."
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his distress at the address of the hacker, wrote on Twitter: "Twittering photos stolen from the mobile phone, actually, is nothing different from sale of stolen goods."
Just from a legal point of view, we cannot tolerate the publication of stolen photographs.
Detected potential way of stealing photos of naked celebrities
The mass breakdown of star accounts may be produced by vulnerability in the application Find My Phone.
The event development scenario described the The Next Web resource.
The Github resource was published in Python script, which enabled the search of passwords for the Apple Found My Phone Service.
This service allows to track the iPhone location.
The same login and Apple ID link is used to access it as well as access to Apple iCloud cloud, from which the photographs of famouss were stolen.
The script allowed the overriding method to recognise the password from Find My Phone.
The method is consistently introduced by all possible combinations of symbols, starting with the most common passwords used.
The author of the script claimed that the number of password options in the Search My Phone service is unlimited.
When the correct security system is organized after several failure attempts, the incorrect password of the account should be blocked and informed the user of the attempt to invade.
Because of vulnerability, the users have not received any communications about attempting to get the password to their account.
Hackers found the Apple ID password and used it to access the iCloud.
According to the Hackapp user on Twitter, vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and it was written by a script program to select passwords.
The vulnerability is now closed: after five attempts of access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the Hackapp user and noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability was characteristic of many services, but noted that there was no evidence that such vulnerability was used to access the star account.
It's not me, plz RT.
On Twitter the Prime Minister again appeared by foreign records
Although there is no strong evidence that the vulnerability of the Found My Phone was used for theft of photographs, there has been a wave of harmful action in the past.
The hackers took over the control of the device and demanded redemption from owners.
In that case, Apple stated the media that the security of the cloud was not compromised, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, the Twitter Prime Minister of RF Dmitri Medvedeva was also broken before.
If the iCloud has been accessed in the way described above, there could be a password to the Government's head's account in the microblogging service.
The Next Web resource failed to obtain Apple's comments on vulnerability in Find My Phone.

The Press Service of the Office reported that.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of the commander of the aircraft and the Bortingen.

Anger was the most universal and functional emotion of humans
The angry expression of the person is biologically universal to humanity, and every body and muscle group are not random, but is an additional means of expressing power and threats, found by the scientists of Australia and the United States.
They told about their discoveries in the Evolution and Human Behavior magazine, and you can briefly read about them at the press release of the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The anger expression of the face -- the displaced and descended eyebrows drawn to a thin lip line, the broken noses are the same in all cultures, and it is made by even blind children who have never seen him, notes the leading author of Aaron Sell.
In the context of a major research project devoted to nature of anger, scientists found that this emotion had occurred for effective disputes during the conflict.
The more physical damage one person can do to another, the more he can dictate his conditions, and he brings it to the interviewer by anger.
Researchers have found confirmations and other hypotheses: the physically strong people are frequently angry and crossing to manuals, they believe that they are incorporated in uncomfortable conditions for others, and prefer the forced methods to address conflicts to peace.
Disturbing that the anger is primarily a “commerce emotion”, scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven muscles that form a angry expression of a person should represent the angering individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interviewer and thus make it as soon as possible to agree with its conditions to avoid conflict.
In order to verify that hypothesis, researchers designed people on the computer where each of the seven elements of the angry person had been presented or absent, and showed them to the informants.
Although the deserted eyebrows or the front beard did not make the person angry separately, the more powerful human characteristics of the study were recognized unanimously.
The human anger, as well as the animals, threatens: excessive manifestation of its own force, forced to accept and obey.
A man blows his noses and squeals his lips for the same purpose as the frog who is drowning, or the granny, who shows his hamsters.
Anger " starts" by rejecting the interviewer's acceptance of the situation, and the person immediately takes the form, as effectively demonstrated to the opposite party the consequences of this rejection.
But the most impressive thing is that no part of anger is arbitrary, they all express the same thing," said anthropologist John Tuby.
The Mincommass proposed 250 million rubbers to the Crime Radio Company
The Mincomships proposed that 250 million rubbers of the autonomous non-commercial teleradio company " Crime " be allocated from the federal budget in 2014.
This is mentioned in the draft decision of the Government prepared by the agency familiar with “Lenta.ru”.
According to the explanatory note to the project, the Federal Budget subsidies will be aimed at “covering the costs of the establishment of conditions for the extensive information on the socio-economic situation and the development of the modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crime, including the acquisition of equipment”.
In particular, it is intended to reorganize a hardware, video walls, central hardware and video server.
The acquisition of a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter is also planned.
Furthermore, the company will pay for the use of the volcano-optic communication line (VALS) and the repair of the energy system.
Subsidies will be provided within the funds of the federal budget for the Mincomship.
The State Television Society " Crime" was established in 1959, conducting a talk in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, crimcotatar, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
Today, the television signal of television is more than 75 per cent of the semi-economic territories.
In 2011, the Teleradio company " Crime" received a licence for a digital television.
