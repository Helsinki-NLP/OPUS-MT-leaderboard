The members of the Wales National Assembly are afraid that they will be called muppets
Among some members of the National Assembly was the consternation, which is the effect of the proposal to amend their title to the members of the Wales Parliament (Angl. of the Welsh Parliament, in shortening of the IWP).
The idea was created in connection with the conversion plans to the Wales Parliament.
Members of the convention from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they can become a matter of ridicule.
One of the parliamentists from the Party of Work expressed their fears of their grouping, saying that the new name is rimed with the Wales words "twp" and "pwp".
For readers outside of Walia: in the Wales word “twp” means a fool, and the word “pwp” is departure.
One of the Politicians of the Party, Plaid Cymru, stated that its grouping was "not satisfied" with the proposal and presented other solutions.
The member of the Whale Conservative Party said that his party was "open" to change the name, but noted that the replacement of the word "MWP" was very close to the word "muppet".
In this case, the walian letter “w” is similar to the letter “u” in the English Yorkshire.
The Commission, which is currently working on the draft amendment of the name, has taken the following position: “Naturally, the final decision on the future title of the Assembly will belong to them itself.”
The law of the Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Wales National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultations on the proposal, and the conversion of the Assembly into the Wales Parliament was widely supported.
Furthermore, the Commission supported the proposal for a change of the title of the members of the Assembly to the “Wallian Parliament”, which is WMP in English, although the MWP shortcut enjoyed the greatest popularity among society.
Members of the Assembly propose alternative solutions. The difficulties in reaching consensus are the burden for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, which should present the draft law in the next weeks.
The reforming law will also take into account other changes in the way of the assembly work, including the rules of revocation of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title during the discussion of the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change of country's name
On the next Sunday, the voters will decide whether their country will soon be named by the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The universal vote should help to compete with the neighbouring Greece, which is the region called Macedonia.
The Government in Athens has long claimed that the name of their north neighbour is a territorial claim and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia and the opponent of the referendum on the change of the name said that he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, plebiscites, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, maintain that the change is necessary to enable the European Union and NATO to join the European Union.
The calls in the New York Church of St. Martin will be silent in connection with the problems of distressing churches in Harleum
“ The older people I'm talking to say there was a bar and a church once at each corner, ” Michael Henry Adams said.
"There is no sign of them at present."
As he says, the bar disappears is understandable.
“Aktually, people are putting themselves in society in a different way, ” he observed.
"The bars have ceased to be a place of regular meetings of members of the community."
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the measures from the sale of property will not be sufficient for as long as the decision-making person considers, and that “before or later, they will be at the exit point. ”
He added that churches can be replaced by the apartments of people who will not support the rest of the temples.
As he said, “the oppressive majority of people buying apartments in such buildings will be white race, which will accelerate the entire closing of churches, because it is unlikely that new inhabitants become members of these parishes. ”
Both churches were constructed by a collection of white faithful ones before Harlem joined the Metropolitan Community in 1870 (St. Marcin’s church joined the Community decade later).
The original convention of white methodists left the neighborhood in the 1930 ’ s.
The surrounding convention of the African Americans took the right to property to the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken by the assembly under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycot against sellers from the 125th Street (the main trade street in Harleme), opposing the employment or advancement of the African Americans.
The 1939 fire has severely damaged the building, but John Howard Johnson's parishes made plans for rebuilding the temple and ordered the construction of a bell team.
Reverend David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor in St. Martin’s church, proudly called a new carilion “poor calls. ”
The expert who blew the bells in July described them in a different way as “Cultural Scarbs ” and“ unreplaced historical instrument. ”
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noticed that it was the first carrilion in the world supported by a black musician. This was the artist of Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the Church of Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he was waiting for a larger team.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said St. Martin's church did not replace him.
In the past few months in St. Martin’s church, there were a number of complicated events involving architects and executors.
In July, the parish council (organ governing the parish composed of world leaders) addressed its concerns to diet, claiming that “she wants to transfer the costs to the council”, although the Council did not participate in the employment of architects and executors sent to place.
Part of the parafian also complains of the lack of transparency on the part of the diet.
The shark wounded a 13-year-old diving to look for lobsters in California
The authorities reported that last Saturday the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old diving in looking for lobsters in California.
The attack took place just 7 hours ago near Beacon's Beach in the US town of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning he swimmed around half an hour with his friends when he heard the call for help. Instantly with a group of friends they flew to the boy to help pull him out of the water.
As Hammel said at first, he seemed excited at catching a lobster, but soon he realized that the child was cried: “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
After reaching the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had a totally broken skin in the area of the carpet.
"I began to scream to everyone to flee from the water: 'There is a shark!'” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by a helicopter to the Children's Council Council Hospital in San Diego.
The species of a shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During the press conference, Captain Larry Giles said that fish had been observed a few weeks earlier, but it was not found to be a species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim had suffered serious injuries from the upper part of the barn.
In order to carry out the investigation and for security purposes, the authorities closed their entry to the Ponto Beach beach in Casablad until after Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles noticed that the area is more than 135 species of sharks, although most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's Sainsbury's network plans to expand activities on the British cosmetic market
Sainsbury's network throws gloves to stores such as Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams, introducing in its supermarkets cosmetic businesses as well as specially trained sellers.
In the context of a significant investment in the British cosmetic market – worth 2.8 billion pounds and continuously grows despite the falls in the fashion industry and household articles – in 11 network shops, more cosmetic products will appear. If the initiative is successful in the next year will be extended to the next points.
Return to the cosmetic industry results in searching for ways for the economy of the area covered earlier by television, microwave and household articles.
According to Sainsbury's network, the number of cosmetic products will be doubled and offered even 3,000 articles. In the asordination, the goods such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. PawPaw will appear for the first time.
Currently sold articles of L'Oreal, Mordalline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space and separate areas close to those known even from Boots shops.
Furthermore, the supermarket network plans to refresh its offer of products for Boutique's makeup. From now on, most articles will be friendly for vegans, which are increasingly demanding young clients.
Furthermore, the parfum seller Fragrance Shop will create test points in two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first opened last week in Croydon, in the southern part of London, and the second resurrection in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, later the year.
The widespread internet sales and daily shopping of small foods in local shops make supermarkets need to encourage more customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, President Sainsbury's, said that the sales points would be increasingly similar to trade houses because the network is trying to fight disconts such as Aldi or Lidl, offering more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's has placed the network points of Argos in hundreds of shops and introduces a series of Habitat networks since the two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increasing sales of food products and investment profitability.
The previous attempt to reorganize sections with cosmetic products and pharmaceutical products has ended with failure.
At the beginning of the 21st century, Sainsbury's created a joint-venture company in Boots, but the collaboration was completed by the conflict on the division of income from supermarkets.
Sainsbury's introduces a new strategy following the sale of 281 apps to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
According to Lloyds, it will contribute to the implementation of the plan, introducing a widespread luxury offer for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four network shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Sainsbury's commercial business, said: “We have transformed the appearance and nature of cosmetic departments to improve customers' feelings.
We have invested in special training for colleagues so that they can help consumers during shopping.
Our marks are able to satisfy all the needs, and friendly environment and suitable locations allow us to draw the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the current ways of procurement."
Peter Jones "angered" after Holly Willoughby retreat from a contract worth 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons' Day TV, was "anger" when he found out that Holly Willoughby is going to retire from 11 million pounds of lifestyle marks to focus on the newly connected cooperation with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Holly Willoughby has no time for their mark offering accessories and articles of the household called Truly.
The activity was repeatedly compared to the Goop mark belonging to Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, 37-year-old presentant announced her departure through the Instagram Service.
A sudden decision to leave a well-prospering lifestyle mark and focus on the newly associated cooperation with Marks & Spencer and ITV taken by Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons' Day program.
According to the sources, Peter Jones was "anger" when the popular TV presenter announced during the Tuesday Nervous meeting in his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts of value to 1,5 million pounds, it would not have time to devote their march to offering accessibility and articles of Truly's household.
The company was previously compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow mark Goop. It was also to double the property of Holly Willoughby estimated by 11 million pounds.
After the announcement of the decision to leave Truly by 37-year-old Holly Willoughby in Instagram, Peter Jones left Britain, leaving one of his airport homes.
The source says: “Marka Truly was the priority for Holly Willoughby.
She connected her future with her, and she wanted to take care of her for the next few decades.
The decision to withdraw from the activities was totally surprised by all involved persons.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday.
In the Magazine in Marlow, goods are ready to sell."
Experts believe that quitting this Morning and one of the most successful stars in Britain could cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investments in products, including articles from pillows to clothing and household articles, as well as further delaying entry into the market.
It may also mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willoughby (the mother of three children) and her husband Dan Baldwin had a close relationship with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp established the Truly mark in 2016, and Peter Jones, 52, joined them in March at his position.
The couples spent their vacations together, and Jones included 40% of his shares in the TV production company belonging to Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is supposed to be Ambassador of the M&S Mark and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebry in ITV station.
The source close to Peter Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business matters. ”
A hard conversation, “and then we fell in love ”
The president was joking of the criticism of the media caused by a note that some considered to be a “failing husband of the state, ” as well as a positive relationship with the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump surrender so much?
Trump said in a laughing voice, pretending to be a TV presenter:
"I didn't give up anything."
The President noted that Kim Jong Un was interested in the second meeting. The first meeting was held in Singapore in June and was screamed by Trump with a great step towards the Denuclearization of North Korea.
However, nuclear disarmament negotiations are delayed.
After more than three months since the June Summit in Singapore, the head of the North Korean Diplomacy Ri Yong Ho said on Saturday to the world leaders at the General Assembly of the United Nations that he does not see “a similar response” from the United States to the early activities of Northern Korea for disarmament.
He noted that instead, the United States maintains sanctions and pressures.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view of his speech.
“ We are doing great with North Korea, ” he said.
"We planned war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
The President said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Un have brought positive effects: resulted in the completion of missile trials, helped release hostages and return to the other American soldiers.
Furthermore, he defended his unusual approach while discussing the relationship with Kim Jong Un.
“It's easy to behave after the president. However, instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get into a stiff stadium, we would have 200 people here”, said Trump, showing a finger on the crowd gathered directly before each other.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations have been told that their assistance is not needed.
Despite the loss of roof over the head by more than 10% of the Lombocu population, the authorities have not announced natural disasters, which is an essential condition for acceleration of international assistance.
“It is unfortunately very clear that the authorities have made it clear that they do not require international support, so the situation is difficult”, said Selina Sumbung.
Although the Organization Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonezian city of Palu, it is not sure for international staff to be able to operate at the scene of the event.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a national advocate for natural disasters, said that the Indonesian authorities evaluate the situation in Palo to make sure that assistance should be permitted by international organisations.
The country remains completely unprepared to deal with nature's forces in the face of the stress that have been constantly affected in Indonesia.
Although the Aceh Province has built shelters in case of tsunami, they are rare for the rest of the coast line.
No syrene warning from tsunami in Palu, despite warnings, was likely affected by the number of death victims.
Even in the most favourable conditions, travel between the Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on the island of Lombok, is going to help victims of earthquake to the city of Palu. However, it will take at least three days to reach the target.
President Joko Widodo has improved the Indonezian infrastructure as the main point of his campaign and has designated a lot of road and railway funds.
However, in the face of future elections, the President's administration is facing the lack of resources.
In addition, Joko Widodo was emphasized with the view of the country’s religious tension, and the members of the majority of the Muslim community accepted a more conservative form of faith.
Over a thousand people died, and tens of thousands of inhabitants lost a roof over their head as a result of the fight between Christian gangs and Muslims with the use of machetes, ports, shootings and other simple weapons on the streets.

Cromwell's monument before the British parliament, the last victim in the dispute about "writing history again"
The remembrance of the monument would bring justice for the similar actions of the Talibs to destroy many English cultural and religious goals by its radical, purritian advocates.
However, the Association of Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as "insaneness" and "a try to write history again".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Association of Cromwell Society, said: “Because of the current debate on the remembrance of monuments, the dispute about Oliver Cromwell’s form before the Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
The image action during English domestic wars has not been ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps for his ancestor Thomas's actions, the wrong Cromwell was decided to be punished earlier.
The way Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell on the monument shows the view that this 19th century policy was enjoyed and that many people are the character that is still worth remembering.
John Goldsmith, in an interview for the Sunday Telegraph, said: “With many people Cromwell was perceived, perhaps more often in the 19th century than now, for the parliamentary defender against external pressures.
The assessment of the validity of this statement is subject to a continuous historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the 18th century conflict has formed a further development of our people, and Cromwell is a recognizable character that identifies one of the parts of the division.
His achievements as the Lord of Protector also deserve honor and memorial."
In China, there was a fatal concern of a farmer by pig
According to local media, the trade in the south-west part of China had a death attack of pigs on a farmer.

They're as curious as kids... they don't want to hurt anyone.

More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s interrogations
More than 20 million people were watching in six TV stations on Thursday's hearing of the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accusing the lawyer of sexual abuse that took place in the 1980s of the last century.
Despite the ongoing political impasse on Friday, the commentators had to stop regularly transmitted programmes to inform the sudden return: the agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI would conduct a weekly investigation on the charges.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Commission of Justice that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was screwing her up in an immediate state and tried to remove her clothes during a high school party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said, however, that he was perceived that this was not the case.
It is possible that the Friday number of televisions was even bigger than the Nelsen company given 20.4 million.
The company calculated the average number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC television stations.
However, other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
Furthermore, Nelsen usually has difficulties with the measurement of awareness among people in workplaces.
The number is closer to the visibility of American soccer games or the division of the American Film Academy Awards.
According to Nelsen, the Fox News Channel station, whose presenters firmly supported the nomination of Kavanaugh, had the highest visibility. It was average of 5,69 million viewers during a full-day hearing.
Secondly, there was an ABC station of 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.2 million.
Interesting the subject remained high after the interrogation was completed.
Jeff Flake became a key form of Friday events.
In the morning, he was caught by CNN and CBS station cameras after the office of this moderate Republican announced that he decided to support the nomination of Kavanaugh. On the record, he shouted at demonstrators who hampered him to enter the elevator on the way of hearing the judicial committee.
Flake with his head dropped for a few minutes listening to unlikely opinions. The whole event was transmitted by the CNN station.
"I stand in front of you and I ask.
Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
You have so many women's weaknesses," you heard from a demonstrating woman.
Before the elevator's door closed, Jeff Flake said that his office had made an appropriate statement and that he would be confessed during the committee's interrogation.
Later, television stations continued to transmit events to await the nomination of Kavanaugh before the entire Senate.
Flake said he would only support the nomination when he knew that the FBI would investigate the charges next week, which the minority of the Democrats insisted on.
Flake was convinced by part of the conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons from the Democratic Party.
Flake made a decision after meeting Chris Coons and several other senators.
The choice of Flake was important because the Republic would not have the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without an investigation.
President Trump filed the FBI's proceedings on the charges issued by Brett Kavanaugh.

After the end of the year from the referendum of October 1, the tension is not weakened. Although the authorities in Madrid considered it illegal, it is still a reason to celebrate for the desired catalonic sessions.
The voting majority of the independence, but the frequency was low because of the widely covered boycott of the opponents.
According to the Catalonic authorities, almost a thousand people have suffered injuries last year in brutal stars with police trying to prevent votes in the election sites.
On Friday evening, groups supporting the independence of the region decided to prevent demonstrations of supporting police officers.
The demonstration took place despite this, but it had to change the route.
Narciss Termes, 68-year-old electrician who joined his wife in the separatist protest, said that there was no hope for Catalonia's independence.
“In last year, we survived one of our most beautiful moments in our life.
My parents cried for the joy they could vote, but now we are stuck in a point without exit," he said.
Despite the significant, a small victory in local elections in December last year, parties supporting the Catalonia session have difficulties with the continuation of action. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave or expect to be arrested for the process in connection with the role played in the referendum and the later announcement of independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old mechanist who recorded a telephone protest supporting the police, said that politicians on both sides of the dispute foster conflict.
“ The situation becomes increasingly tense, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine catalonic leaders held in custody since the end of last year, announced the desire to launch in the future elections to the European Parliament.
"The candidation in elections to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the crisis of the democratic value of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car entry into the house

Mengi gate provides Livingstone victory over Rangers 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingstone brought the team a victory.
Playing this season at the extraclass of the Livingston Club has led the Rangers to be freaked out, causing Steven Gerrard only the second failure in his 18 games at the Ibrox Park Coach position.
The Dolly Mengi gate turned out to be victory, and Gary Holt's team moved to the second place in the table with Hibernian.
The Gerrard's team will remain in this season without victory to travel to Premiership, and next Sunday the team will face the leader of Hearts, where he loses eight points.
Earlier, since on Thursday, Rangers will visit the Rapid Vienna team as part of the EUFA League.
Livingston has extended a series of victories in his division to six matches.
Livingston missed several possibilities against unavailable opponents
The Holt team was supposed to take over a lot earlier, because the team's game has contributed to a lot of problems.
At first, Scott Robinson went through the defense and put a shot in the gate light, but he failed to shoot a naked, and then Alan Lithgow didn't hit the head of Craig Halkett.
The households allowed the Rangers to play closer to the gate, knowing that they could threaten the rivals during the constant parts of the game.
And that's how the settlement gate fell.
Once the Rangers dropped the Livingston team found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created the situation of Menga, who got naked from the middle of the criminal field.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possessions, but they couldn't force the defense of the household and have made no bigger problems to Liam Kelly.
Alfredo Morelos put one shot on Kelly's gate.
The attempt of Scott Pittman was protected by the Rangers Locker Allan McGregor, and Lithgow failed to get into the light of the gate from another permanent piece of lawsuit for Livingstone.
The Rangers continued attacks in Livingstone's criminal field, but they couldn't use the situation. They demanded two penalties after Halkett's intervention against the alternator Glenn Middleton and one hand-playing. In both cases, the claims of competitions were rejected.
"Fenomenal" show Livingstone – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
A great show and a result for Livingstone.
He believes they played a great game, once again walking beyond expectations.
Their style and composition almost changed from return to extraclass. However, you should appreciate Holt for motivating the team to the game.
This game had many heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role, running a greatly organised defense, and Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall have to be very careful over the whole game.
The Rangers didn't want to fight.
Although Gerrard's leadership has a great moment, they did not support their standards in the game.
Their game seemed to miss something: only once it was possible to pass through the defense of the household. It should be a serious warning to the Rangers who found themselves in the middle of the table.

The hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, including many Kurds, also decided to express their opinion, condemning Turkey's leader's policy and the German government's decision to adopt politics in the country.
On the contrary, protests reflect the divisions that the visit of a hero politics shouted by a part of Turks living in Germany and recognised as autocrat by others.

Sudden floods caused by the hurricane of Rosa threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (may beneficial influence on drought areas)
It is rare for tropical depression to reach the state of Arizona. It is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week. The rest of Rosa's hurricane moves across the desert areas of the Southwest, creating the threat of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about the possibility of a sudden flood on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona, Southern and Eastern Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa will go directly over Phoenix on Tuesday afternoon and the rainfall will begin on Monday afternoon.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix informed the Twitter service that “only ten tropical cyclones held the state of storm or tropical depression 320 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Huragan Katrina (in 1967) approached the distance of 65 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict declines from 5 to 10 cm. In some areas Mogollon Rome in Arizona can reach even a height of 15 cm.
In the other desert regions of the Southwest, including in the central mountains of Scale and the Great Catlin, the height of declines will probably be between 2.5 cm and 5 cm and in some areas up to 10 cm.
For persons outside the areas threatened by sudden floods, declines accompanied by the hurricane of Rosa may make a relief because the region has been fighting drought for a while.
Although the floods are a serious threat, part of the falls improve the situation in the Southwest, where the dry state is.
According to the weather.com portal, U.S. Drought Monitor applies that nearly 40% of the Arizona area combat touching droughts belonging to the second of the highest categories.
Hurragan Rosa will first arrive at the California Half Island in Mexico.
On Sunday morning Rosa was still moving with the hurricane force, reaching speed to 137 km/h. It is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is heading north with 19 km/h.

Then the hurricane of Rosa will pass through Mexico in a northern direction in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, early mornings, he will reach the Arizona's border as a tropical depression. By Tuesday night, he will wander to the Southern part of the state of Utah.
“The most serious threats created by the hurricane Rosa or its remnant are very rich rainfalls in the California Sealand, in the north-western part of the state of Sonora and in the south-west areas of the desert of the United States,” states National Hurricane Center.
According to the forecasts, rains cause sudden floods and displacement of pollution in the wilderness and mud storms in the mountains.

"The voice given to Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the absolute and disturbing process of the Democratic Party," Trump said at the Wheeling fair in the West Virginia.
Trump concluded that Kavanaugh “faithful and anger” of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh witnessed before the convention, and stated and emotionally denyed the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford. The woman claims that a few decades ago, when they were both teenagers, a man had committed sexual assault against her.
Ford also testified during the interrogation of her charges.
On Saturday, the president said that that day, “Americans could find out about the brightness, class and courage ” of Kavanaugh.
“The voice given to Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of support of one of the most famous lawyers of our times, the expert of the law of great communities,” he stated to the crowd of servants in the West Virginia.
The President did not directly refer to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of the frequency of the Republicans in half the presidential elections.
“We are divided by five weeks from the most important choices in our life.
I don't run in these elections, but I remain very active," he said.
"I'm still fighting for our great candidates."

Thousands of victims of earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
As stated by the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people have died — from which many have been abducted by high waves breaking about the beaches — as a result of a strong earthquake and tsunami that have visited the Sulawes Indonezian island.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to participate in the festival city. At the darkness of the coast, waves reached even 6 meters high, abducting many people and destroying everything on their way.
Tsunami was the result of the earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the threat occurred yesterday, people who stayed on the beach did not escape immediately and have fallen as a victim of tsunami," said the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, advocate of the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disasters of BNPD at the conference at the Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
“The tsunami attacked everything on its way, abducing cars, balls and houses, ” said Nugroho. Then he added that before reaching the coast line, he moved to the sea with a speed of 800 km/h.
As he said, some were saving themselves climbing the trees, and they survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palo.
In the airport photos published by the Agency for Natural Disaster, there are many destroyed houses and shops, damaged and crashed bridges and water carpets.
On Saturday, the coastal city had secondary shakes.
A number of earthquakes occurred in the territory of 2,4 million people.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT), energy released by broad Friday earthquake was approximately 200 times bigger than the energy of the atomic bomb thrown on Hirossima during World War II.
The statement stated that the geographical position of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay could have increased the effects of tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said that the crash was down hundreds of houses, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels.
Then he added that the bodies of the victims were found under the invaded buildings, 540 people suffered injuries, and 29 are considered missing.
Nugroho said that death victims and damage could be greater along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Donggala, which was closer to the earthquake epicentrum.
According to Nugroh, the communication was “perfectly paralyzed ” and there are no reports from the Donggala Province.
“There is more than 300 thousand people ” — can be read in the Red Cross statement, and it is also added that workers and volunteers of the organization are going to places affected by disaster.
“ We can now talk about tragedy, although the situation can make significant deterioration, ” states the statement.
On Saturday, the agency met with a widespread criticism for the lack of information on the blow of tsunami in Palo. The authorities said that the waves came right after the warning.
At the amateur video available in the social media, you can see a man who screams from the building, trying to warn about the coming tsunami of a person in the street.
In a few minutes, the wall of water broke down on the coast, abducing buildings and cars.
The Reuters agency was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused significant shortcomings in the supply of electricity, preventing communication in the area of the Palo.
According to the authorities, the military has started sending transport planes through Jacarda and other cities, but the evacuated persons still need food and other basic articles of the first need.
Airport opened in the city only for humanitarian transport. The airport will remain inactive until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo will visit the centres for evacuated people in Palo.
Over 800 victims of tsunami in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
As reported by Doseba T. Sinay, director of the World Vision, the staff of this organization came safely from the province of Donggala to the city of Palu and found a shelter in the tents placed in the office.
“ They told me they saw a lot of ruined houses, ” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although a part of the groups slowly begins to provide assistance, the criticism has appeared that foreign humanitarian organizations with rich experience are not able to travel to Palo.
According to the Indonesian law, the adoption of funding, resources and personnel from abroad can be launched only after the announcement of the scene of disaster as a area of national disaster.
It's not done yet.
"We are still officially dealing with a regional disaster," said the Indonesian Red Cross Advocate.
"When the government considers that there was a national disaster, we will be able to start accepting international assistance, but that has not yet happened."
After two days of the Friday earthquake and tsunami in the Palo, friends and families of missing persons continue to hope that their close ones will find themselves miraculously among the destructions.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the channels.
On Sunday, the rescueers released a woman who spent two days under the burden next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian parallel representative, trained two missing parallel parallels who participated in the end of this month in Asia games in Indonesia.
As Peter Mandaga said, other people in Roa Roa were his disciples.

Gendon Subandono told him that during a few hours since the communities accompanied by the parallelers of information about the crash of Roa Roa Roa desperacko sent messages by the communicator WhatsApp to the sportsmen participating at the beach festival.
His messages were marked with only one gray hook instead of a couple of hooks in blue color.
"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.

Canye West: raper changes his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
When he announced his intention in the Twitter service on Saturday, he wrote about himself: “A person known earlier as Kanye West. ”
Forty-one-year-old musician has been using the Ye pseudonym for a while. It is also the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change occurred before visiting the Saturday Night Live program. The artist is expected to present his new album, pt. Yandhi.
It will replace Ariana Grande’s songmaker, who, according to the creators, quit “for emotional reasons. ”
West has already concluded that the word “Ye” is not just a short of its present artistic name, but is religious.
"I think "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible. The Scriptures mean "You", said West in the previous period of the year, discussing the title of the album with a radio presenter on the pseudonym Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it's about us.
First I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I'm Ye – the reflection of all our good, bad and disgusted characteristics.
The album shows who we are."
West was found in the group of other famous rapers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former West colleague, also recorded his alias in different ways, with a connection, without a tie and a large letter.
The President of the Election of Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador is obliged not to use military against civilians
In the preceding 50th anniversary of the bleeding demonstration of students, the President of the Election of Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obarador (AMLO) had never pledged to use military against civilians.
On Saturday, on the Places of the Three Culture, López Obrador promised “without use of the army to repression the Mexican nation. ”
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers opened fires on a peaceful demonstration scene, killing even 300 people.
López Obrador promised to support young people in Mexico, providing a monthly financial assistance for students, as well as creating more free public schools.
He said unemployment and no educational chances for young men to criminal groups.
United States should double the financing of research on artificial intelligence
As Kai-Fu Lee says, the investor and artificial intelligence expert working for Google, Microsoft and Apple concerns, together with the increase in China's activities in this area, the United States should double the costs for research in the field of SI.
The comments made are related to artificial intelligence announcements published by various government agencies of the United States, although the United States does not have an official SIS strategy.
However, in the past year, China presented its plan, according to which by 2030 they want to become the most innovative state in the artificial intelligence area.
“In the beginning, the budget for research on SI should be doubled: all other countries are far beyond the United States, and we are trying to make another breakdown in this area”, said Kai-Fu Lee.
In the CNBC interview this week, he also said that double funds could twice increase the chances of a further breakdown in the artificial intelligence area in the United States.
Lee, whose book, “AI Super Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” (Supermocy of Artificial Intelligence: China, Krzemova Valley and the new order of the world) published Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in this month as president of Sinovation Ventures. The company invested in one of the most important companies involved in artificial intelligence in China, known as Face+++.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University on the creation of the SI system, which defeated the best American player in the Othello game. He then took the lead at Microsoft Research and was the chinese head of the Google company.
Lee acknowledged the success of the previous technological initiatives of the American government, e.g. organized by the Agency of the Advanced Research Projects in the Defence Area (DARPA) of the most interesting robot projects. He also asked for the next edition of combats, as he believed it would help find future visioners.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often need to try hard to receive government grants.
"They are not China's best representatives of the academic environment, but corporations," said Lee.
For several years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired excellent scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, change in immigration policy could also help the United States in the development of SI.
“I believe that those who are dealing with artificial intelligence that have obtained a scientific degree of doctor should automatically acknowledge the green card," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published an artificial intelligence plan for the next generation.
As Lee noted, the Chinese National Natural Science Fund (National Natural Science Fundation of China) provides funding to members of the academic institutions in a way closer to the American National Science Fund and other government organisations granting funds to American scientists. However, the quality of academic activities in China is lower.
During the previous period of this year, the Department of Defence of the United States established an integrated centre for artificial intelligence (Joint Artificial Intelligence Center), which will be involved in the work of partners from the world of industry and science. The White House announced the establishment of a special committee for artificial intelligence (Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence).
During this month, the DARPA agency also informed the determination of 2 billion USD for an AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than 100 billion USD per year in research on SI.
At the same time, an American initiative aimed at creating a National Intelligence Security Commission for months has not made a step forward.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change of the name of their country
On Sunday, the Macedons voted in a referendum on the change of the name of their country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, and the movement would allow a few decades of arguing with Greece, which blocks the efforts of the country to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where the historic country of Macedonia is located, maintains that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim to its territory, and therefore encourages the accession of the country to the EU and NATO.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the name, but nationalists claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonia.
President Iwanow said that he would not participate in the voting. The boycot encouragement campaign raised doubts about whether the frequency would achieve a minimum level of 50% required for the recognition of the referendum as binding.
The referendum asks: "Do you support joining NATO and the EU as a result of the adoption of the agreement with Greece."
The members of the change of the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, argue that it is worth paying the price for the possibility of joining Macedonia, one of the countries created after the fall of Yugoslavia, to organisations such as the European Union or NATO.
"I voted in favour of my country's future so that young people of Macedonia can live free under the European Union's parasol. The EU membership will provide us all more security," said 79-year-old Georgievska Olivera from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, the sufficient number of parliamentists declared that it would respect the vote results.
The change in the name requires support for two third members of Parliament.
The electoral committee informed that no unlikely events have been recorded until 13 hours.
However, the frequency at this hour was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections of 2016. 66% of the authorized persons then gave the vote.
"I voted for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Tanewski, a voter from Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, the Prime Minister of the country Zoran Zaew, his wife Zorica and the son Dusko voted in a referendum on the change of the country's name to open the way to membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliamentary building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small scene and set chairs in front of the tents placed by the boicoting referendum.
"We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organizations with a head-down, not with the back doors," Kawardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can contact other countries, such as China or Russia, and become part of the euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaew claims that NATO membership will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, where unemployment rate is over 20%.
"I believe that a huge majority will appear to change the name in the referendum, because 80% of the citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaew said after the vote.
He concluded that the vote for "yes" was "affirmation of our future".
In the prosecution published last Monday by the Macedonian Public Research Institute from 30 to 43% of the voters declared the desire to participate in the referendum. This is less than the required frequency.
According to another report carried out by the Macedonian Television Telma TV in the Sunday referendum, 57% of respondents will vote.
70% of the surveys claimed that they'd be able to change the name.
In order to make the vote successful, the frequency must be 50% + 1 voice.
The failure in the referendum would be the first serious strike in the Western government's policy since the reign of the authorities in May last year.

Scherzer wants to break the chances of the Rockies win
After losing chances to participate in the play-off phase by Washington Nationals Scherzer did not have to appear in the first composition.
However, the fan of Scherzer's competition hopes to attend a Sunday meeting against Colorado Rockies, if only Rockies keep the chances of play-off performance. Currently, the team has one victory more than Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West Division.
Rockies can count at least on a wild card if they win a Friday meeting against Nationals result 5:2. However, they still want to get their first title of the Master of Division.
"Although we play "o nothing", at least we will go to the field, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the event of opponents will be at the highest level, as in the rest of the season.
Why should I not want to participate in this meeting?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the launcher for a Sunday meeting, but the team is inclined to exhibit Scherzer in the first composition.
It would be Scherzer's thirty-fourth show in the first composition. The player took part in the Thursday bail training and hopes to show on Sunday.
The right-hand team team from Washington records the results of 18-7 and ERA 253.3.3.3 times eliminated the pillars and counted 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
Trump in Western Virginia
Trump did not directly refer to his nomination, Brett Kavanaugh, to the judge of the Supreme Court, discussing the importance of the frequency of the Republicans in half the presidential elections.
"In November, we put all the achievements we have achieved.
From one of the most important choices in our lives, we are divided for five weeks.
Although I am not launching, I remain very active, constantly defending our great candidates," he said.
Then he continued: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats, and we see their actions in our own eyes.
They are determined to take power with all possible means.
They do not care whom they will injure and whom they have to hurt to obtain power and control; the coverage of authority and control is their goal; but we will not give it to them."
As he said, the Democrats are carrying out the mission to “consist and disrupt the activities. ”
“It was very good to see in the last four days,” he stated, calling the Democrats“ evil, evil, unpleasant and untrue. ”
The President referred to the Senatic Commission of Justice, calling on the name and name of the American Senator from the Democratic Party, Dianne Feinstein, which happened with a loud voice from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the expiry of the document?
"Oh, listen?
It was the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
The Work Party is no longer a grouping of people with different views.
Party is not tolerant to individuals expressing their own opinions
When actors of the Momentum organization in my party voted for giving me a naked, I wasn't surprised.
Finally, I am a member of the Group of Ambassadors of the Work Party, who has recently been told that they are not welcomed, and all of this because of expressing their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan met with similar treatment because she opposed antisemitism.
In my case, the application for award was due to the difference between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences related to the importance of responsible economic, national security and European policies, which, for the irony of fate, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders in these issues.
The Friday announcement on the meeting of the parliamentists of the Nottingham East Party, was read: “We want meetings to be open and productive.”
For eight years of my function, most of the Friday Friday meetings of the General Committee looked like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings are being held differently, while the promise of “heartful and meeker” policy has been forgotten for a long time.
It is increasingly clear that the Working Party does not tolerate different views. Each opinion is assessed in terms of conformity with the leadership of the Party.
It began soon after the presidential position of Jeremy Corbyn. The colleagues, in whom I thought we had similar views, began to expect me to change the direction and to take the positions I would not agree with before.
After every public appearance, regardless of content, I meet in the social media with attacks calling for nomination, condemnation of centerism or abandoning the Work Party.
It's not just my experience.
I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the attentions directed under my address are rather political.
I admire professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience sexist or racist treatment every day, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the present policy is the transition to a daily order with insulting others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Work Party should support the culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a grouping of people with different views, and with every proposal for “inconfidentiality” and any change in the rules of choice of the world's views of the party is a narrow.
In the past two years, I have been repeatedly suggested that I should not turn away and keep my mouth shut, and then everything would be “all right. ”
But that's not why I took care of politics.
Since joining the Work Party 32 years ago as a student in the neglects of Margaret Thatcher's government, which led to my school class, I am trying to take care of better quality of public services for those who need – both as a local council and minister.
I've never covered my convictions, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in the Nottingham East knew my position and knew about the differences with the parties' authorities.
To those who supported the Friday proposal, I would like to say that I cannot understand the desire to waste my time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the President of the Labourists in the face of the nearing Brexit, which would harm households, businesses and public services.
However, the most important transmission is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters (including members of the Party of work and others): I am proud that I can serve you. I promise that no threats to revoking nomination or clear political goals will cause me to act in accordance with my beliefs and in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr versus Melrose 38:17 – Unbelievable Ayr again upstairs
Two late examples could somehow mismatch the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr team deserved a victory in this extremely interesting Scotland Extraligy game.
The team was first in the table and remains the only unbelievable team.
In the end, the defence and the better use of chances led the team to win. Coach Peter Murchie could be pleased with his supporters.
"The so far matches were a challenge for us, but we are still invincible, so I am pleased," he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose’s team, said: “We should pay respect to the Ayr rivals, and they have benefited more than us. ”
Ayr went to lead at 14 a.m. after Granta Andersona and the rise of Frazier Clime. However, the yellow card for the Scotch Rory Hughes, who came to the team from Glasgow Warriors, allowed Melrose to equip the result when Jason Baggott caught the ball after the unusual chance to raise.
Climo increased the leading of Ayr after the collapse from the punishment just before the first half was finished. He first obtained an appliance, and then took the chance to raise, obtaining the result of 17:5 for Ayra.
Melrose started the second half, and the appendix of Patrick Anderson, which was raised by Baggota, decreased the loss to five points.
Then there was a longer interruption of the game because of a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott. The player was removed from the carriage on the carpets. After renewing, Ayr increased his conduct after Stafford McDowall and Clima's elevation.
In the next order, the captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card. Melrose again used its number: the application with an unused attempt to raise Bruce Colvin was reduced.
The households took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for the slaughter of Clim without a ball. MacPherson got an appliance on his back.
Climo used the chance to raise, and then he reinforced the result right after the game renewed when Kyle Rowe caught a shot from the punishment and allowed Gregor Henry to get the fifth apple for the household.
The star of the Still Game starts a career in the gastronomic industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game, seems to start the activity in the gastronomic industry. Recently found that he was the manager of the restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor is involved in Jack Jarvis' role in the popular BBC station sitcom. He plays and combines the series together with his multi-year comedial partner Greg Hemphill.
Duet announced that the coming ninth season will be the last one in the history of the series. It all indicates that Ford Kiernan is planning the future after leaving Craiglang.
According to official data, he was the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, though the Scottish Sun informant suggested that Kiernan is trying to engage in the “developing gastronomic industry” in Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us," the deprived access to the sea of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its path to Pacific
Mariners are patroling around the Navy base in La Paz.
Blue flags come from public buildings.
In the ports of the military marine from the lake Titicaca to Amazonka, there is the following motto: “The sea is our law.
His reimbursement is our duty."
In the absence of access to the sea of Bolivia, the memorial of the coastal line lost on Chile in a bloody conflict of resources from the 19th century is still alive. It is as a dream of a re-floating sail after the Pacific.
These hopes may be largest for several decades. Bolivia expects the International Court of Justice's judgment. It will be issued on October 1, after the five years of trial.
“Bolivia's activities are acquiring a dissemination; the residents are unanimous, optimistic and count on a useful verdict”, said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many of the Bolivians across the country will have to share the meeting of the International Court of Justice. They hope that the organization with the Hague residence of Bolivia and after decades of ineffective talks in Chile will have to join the negotiations on the provision of independent access to the sea.
Eva Morales, a charismatic President of Bolivia, who is in the next year in a controversy to fight reelection, also hopes on Monday's judgment.
"We are very close to the return to Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts claim that the possibilities for the benefits of Bolivia are small and that even the acceptable decision would not change much.
The United Nations Organization in Hague has no power to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile, and he also noted that it would not affect possible discussions.
As Paz Zarate, Chilean specialist for international law, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be issued six months after the presentation of the final arguments.
Unfortunately, the last four years of Bolivia could have removed the country from the goal.
"The issue of access to the sea has been covered by the current Bolivian administration," said Paz Zarate.
The unprecedentable retory of Morales deprived the Chilians of any remnant of goodwill, suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume conversations at some point, but it will be very difficult to face the situation.
For both of these countries since 1962 there has been no exchange of ambassadors.
Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, former President and representative of Bolivia in Hague, disagreed with the opinion that the decision-making process of the court was extremely fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring a “extraordinary opportunity to start a new age for relations with Chile” and the possibility of “continuing the 139-year period of disputes with respect to mutual benefits”, he said.
Calzadilla also denyed that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America — used the sea’s access as a part of the political game.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to access to the Peace Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an excellent opportunity to make sure that we have to deal with the past."
The Lords of North Korea claim that nuclear disarmament will not occur until they can trust the United States.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, claims that his nation will never get rid of nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made during the Summit in Singapore between the leaders of both countries.
His comments appeared when the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, seemed to be at the end of the renewal of the suspended nuclear diplomacy over three months after meeting in Singapore with the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims that the "frozen" is as if there was no sanctions and opposition to the United States to the declamation of the ending Korean war has ever been thrown to the Northern Korea on the knees.
Washington does not want to agree to sign the declaration without prior action by Pjongjang specific disarmament steps.
Both Kim Jong Un and President of the United States Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is a widespread scepticism that Pjongjang seriously approaches the elimination of arsenal, which is seen in Northern Korea as the only safeguarding measure.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month in preparations for the second summit of Kim-Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows report the latest line of large head covers in clothing stores.
If you want to increase your collection of hat or fully cover from the sun, we have good information for you.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne's fashion designers represented a bunch of crazy, over-dimensional head covers in their summer collection for 2019, which enlightened in style during the week of Paris Fashion Week.
Instagram this summer was incredibly unpractical hats. The designers decided to present their incredible creatives on the race.
Valentino was a huge bee hat decorated by a wide, peeled ring of the heads of the models.
Other overdimensional accessories included arbuses decorated by jewelry, wizard hat, and even ananas — not designed to warm their head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of extraordinary masks — at the same time at Halloween.
Many colored masks had sewed their mouth and were more like Hannibal Lecter's style than haute couture.
One design was like a floating equipment with pipe and glasses, and another looked like ice creams.
And if you don't want to break up with a big fashion, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge hats can get into clothing shops.
Incredible hats are followed right after “La Bomba, a broken hat of 61 cm wide, which they were wearing — from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural mark behind this incredibly unpractical hat, which came through the social media, represented another great creative race — a screwed beach bag almost as large as the model in the bathing suit.
The burned orange bag from the rafia, finished with rafia frizzels and wrapped with a white skin hand, was marked in Jacquemus La Riviera's collection for the summer season 2019 during Paris Fashion Week week.
Luke Armitage, a star stylest, said FEMAIL: “I hope that large hats and beach bags will appear in the next year’s stores — because the designer has made such a great impact, it would be hard to avoid the demand for overdimensional accessories. ”
John Edward: Language skills necessary for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland continue to enjoy their scientific achievements — in 2018 they could be commended with the following excellent results of the examinations, supported by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other social enterprises.
Presented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) schools attending over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, they seek to ensure the best level of services provided to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, selected by them professional career paths and to indicate their role as world citizens.
As an educational sector that has the opportunity to develop and implement a school-school learning programme, we see modern languages are still popular and desired subjects for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: “If you speak to another man in a language that understands, then it gets to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it gets to his heart."
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely on English only when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that the languages are first in the League ratings and the highest performance rates occur in the case of independent schools.
In total, 68 per cent of students learning foreign languages have received a higher evaluation of A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of the students received a higher evaluation of A in Mandarin and 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French and 63 per cent of Spanish students have also received an evaluation A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the necessary skills that children and youth will certainly need in the future.
Today, language learning, as electoral objects, is conducted in the same scope as the STUM (scientific sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and other places.
The 2014 study carried out by the British Commission on Employment and Skills (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) showed that, for the reasons of difficulty in the employment of employers, 17 per cent, the lack of language skills of candidates was in line.
Therefore, the linguistic skills are increasingly needed to prepare young people to start a professional career.
These skills are necessary in a globalized world with a growing number of jobs demanding knowledge of languages,
A skill that remains for life, such as learning a second language, will provide a great advantage in the future — regardless of the chosen professional development path.
The possibility of direct communication with people from other countries automatically increases the opportunities of a multilingual person against competition.
According to YouGov 2013, in which more than 4000 adults of British participated, 75% of them could not speak in foreign language enough to speak, and the French was the only language whose percentage of people used was two-digit, i.e. 15%.
Therefore, investment in teaching foreign languages is so important for children today.
The knowledge of several languages, in particular the economies in developing, will give children a greater chance to find adequate employment.
In Scotland, every school will differ in terms of the languages that it teaches.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered the most important for the Great Britain in 2020, such as mandarin and Japanese.
Regardless of the interest of the child, in independent schools there will always be many languages to choose which will be taught by specialized personnel in this area.
Scotland's independent schools are involved in the creation of a education environment that will prepare children and weapon them in skills necessary to refer to success — regardless of the future for them.
At present, it is not possible to deny that in the international business environment, languages are still key to the future of the country, and therefore it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be treated as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer Scotland young people a large choice, diversity and level.
That's just what it's supposed to be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's Debiut at Lakers team on Sunday in San Diego.
The fans wanted to see LeBron James' debiut in Los Angeles Lakers finally waited.
Luke Walton, Coach of Lakers, announced that LeBron James would play a Sunday pre-season game against Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
We don't know how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one but less than 48," said Walton on the official website of Lakers.
The Lakers team reporter, Mike Trudell, on Twitter, announced that James would probably play an incomplete number of minutes.
After the training that took place at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-sessional Lakers matches.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need to take part in pre-sezon matches to prepare," he said.
Tramp's election in Western Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of elections.
This is the first of the five elections planned by Trump, which will take place next week, along with positions in his friendly places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In addition to a vote confirming the sustainability of his choice to take a free position in the Supreme Trump Court, it is striving to build support in the nearing elections in the governments, as the Republicans may threaten loss of control over the Congress when the votes are passed in November.
What time will it take tonight, so the Trump election in Western Virginia, and where will you look at it on the Internet?
Trump's voter in Wheeling in West Virginia will be held today at 19:00, i.e. on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
So the Trump election in Western Virginia will be able to track live through the Internet in YouTube service.
Trump is likely to describe this week's interrogations of the candidate nominated to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, which took place in a tense atmosphere in connection with the charges of sexual behaviour and the predictable vote in the Senate on the suspension of the election for a period of at least one week, for the time of the investigation by the FBI.
However, the main objective of this series of elections is to grant support to the Republicans faced with difficult November elections.
Thus, the campaign of President Trump with five larges next week aims to “mobilize volunteers and supporters to assist the Republicans in protecting and enlargeing the majority of the Senatu and the Represent Chamber” — Reuters.
"Congress's control is so important in the president's schedule that, as the worst season of the campaign is approaching, he will visit as many states as possible," said Trump's campaign prosecutor, who did not agree on his name, Reuters.
Today's voter at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling may attract members from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and the attention of the media from Pittsburgh” — West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit the West Virginia, the state in which he won more than 40 percent in 2016, for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia candidate to the Senate, the Republican Patrick Morrisey, who loses in the surveys.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in the surveillance," said Simon Haeder, a politician from the West Virginia University, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States team shows a spirit of battle, retaining hope for winning in Sunday Singles
After three single-sided sessions, the foursome format held on Saturday afternoon could be what Ryder Cup needed.
The collapse of the discharge is a totally invented sports concept, but the one in which players really believe, and the most in such competitions.
So, what's their shift at this point?
"They were leading six points, and now only four leads, so I think we have a small stretch," Jordan Spieth said.
Europe, of course, leads four points, while it is still twelve.
However, the Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind in the boats and have valuable patterns to imitate, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them could approve of acquiring three points from four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and gives an example.
The screaming on the whole throat, which was a sign of excitement, became increasingly loud during the duration of his round, drowning the key path and winning the game when he and Thomas gained two holes in two hits.
His reflection on the earth that gave them a victory with the result of 15 met with a similar scream, which gives understanding that the American team is still in the game.
"It'll be enough to focus and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left to each of these rivals.
18 holes to win.
The only players who won more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unlikely story of Ryder Cup.
A strange, but a lovely couple of the European team won four of four and didn't make mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only couple that did not count Godey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the godeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back on Friday morning.
The way of the game and how their energy seems to flow to both and from a noiseful crowd proves that these players should be conquered on Sunday and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari that could seal the potential victory of the European team on Le Golf National.
It would be the best thing they played on different holes at the same time.
However, talking about the winning of the European team is too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of fourball, when he and Alex Norren were spoiled.
Godey and two-fold double on the front nine dug the Spanish and Sweden into a hole that they would never get out of.
There's no one who can help get out of the hole on Sunday.
Fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and how a change of the strategy may occur at one point.
Europe played better so far as a team and took a significant advantage of the last day, but the four-some session also showed that the US team had a struggle to fight, in which some, especially in the United States, doubted.
Europe with the results of 10-6 includes the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe with significant advantages in the last day of Ryder Cup after winning with a result of 10-6 Saturday games fourball and four-some with the United States.
The inspired duet — Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari — has assumed a warfare, having two victories over the fighting Tiger Woods, boosting its current results on Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, trying to maintain the trophy that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an uncertain American team in the morning form of fourball, wining a series of results 3-1.
The United States had more resistance in foursome, winning two matches, but they couldn't make losses.
In order to keep the trophy, the team of Jim Furyk has to get eight points from 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debiutant who won four points in a row, while with Molinari (the team was called Molliwood after the sensible weekend) are only the second couple in Ryder Cup history, who won four points in four opening games.
After Woods and Patrick Reed broke up in a fourball format in a great style, they defeated the pomped Woods and the American debiutant Bryson Dechambeau, obtaining even more empathy.
Woods, who was tired over two Saturday matches, eventually showed genius brightness, but lost 19 out of 29 matches in fourball and foursome formats, and it was seven in a row.
Justin Rose, unparticipating in the morning fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in foursome format to overcome the result of 2&1 Dustina Johnson and Broox Koepka — taking place in the world's ranking, accordingly, items 1 and 3.
The European group, however, did not all go through the thoughts of this pleasant, cold day in the southwest of Paris.
The triple major Jordan Spieth winner and Justin Thomas set up a reference point for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory with the result of 2&1 over Spain John Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball format and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 results in foursome format, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, the team was able to make a four-point loss, starting alone, although the Furyk team would only be remissed to keep the trophy.
However, taking the second seat two days ago, the Sunday Contract seems rather unlikely.
North Korea says "no" to unilateral disarmament without trust.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday during the UN talk that the lack of sanctions only increases the lack of confidence in Northern Korea in the United States and there is no way that this country unilaterally renounces nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the Annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken the “significant measures of goodwill” last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, disposal of nuclear tests and non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see any specific answer from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security, and in such circumstances there is no unanimous disarmament of North Korea."
While Ri repeated the known North Korean complaints about Washington's disagreement to the “step” approach to denuclearisation, in which Northern Korea would be rewarded for gradual action, its statement seemed to be significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearization as it had happened in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump at the first in history of the summit between the official President of the United States and the leader of the Northern Korea, who took place on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim Jong Un was committed to work for the “denuclearisation of the Korean Self” and Trump promised the security guarantee of North Korea.
North Korea expected a formal end of Korean war (50-1953), but the United States representative announced that Pjongjang had to quit nuclear weapons first.
Washington also resisted calls to mitigate raw international sanctions against North Korea.
"United States insist on "denauclearisation in the first order" and increase the pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a force, even opposing the signing of the "declaration of the end of the war", said Ri.
"The claim that sanctions can put us on the knees is the disgustingness of people who act in ignorant manner.
However, the problem is that the lack of sanctions increases our uncertainty."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, mentioned at the beginning of the week of the United States leader at the United Nations Forum.
Instead, the Minister noted three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korea leader Moon Jae-ine in the last five months, and added: "If the party was South Korea, and not the United States, there was no such impass in the Danuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula."
However, the ton of Ri's speech was completely different in comparison with the past year, when he said during the UN General Assembly that targeting the Northern Korea rockets in the United States is inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump (Mr. Bad President Trump) called Kim Jong Una "rocket man" (the man of the rocket) on a suicide mission.
This year, at the UN Trump Forum, who threatened the "complete destruction" of North Korea last year, commended Kim Jong Una for his courage in taking steps to disarmament, but also said that there was still a need to put a lot of work and said that until Northern Korea was deprived of nuclear weapons, sanctions will not be removed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not designate the time range, saying: “If it takes two years, three or five months, it is no matter. ”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for the steps taken.
However, the US Secretary Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the United Nations Security Council forum: "The execution of the Security Council sanctions must continue and be continuous until we find full, final and verified denuclearisation."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously explored sanctions against North Korea, trying to sustain the financing of the Pjongjang Balistic Programme and the Pjongjang Balistic missile.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly Forum and later said that next month he will visit Pjongjang again in preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called success.
He left Pjongjang in July, saying that progress has been made, and in a few hours North Korea condemned him for “gigantic demands”.
North Korea committed a meeting with Moon Jae-ine this month to dismount the location of testing rockets and nuclear complex if the United States take “suitable measures”.
He said that Kim Jong Un told him that the “suitable measures” that he cares were security guarantees for which Trump had committed in Singapore, and taking steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard attend a course on adequately long resting
The new course at Harvard University, which took place this year, provided more sleep to all students, which aimed at combating the growing macho culture, which was to learn from “the full - night students driven by coffee. ”
Academic students from the world's best university often have no idea of the grounds for caring for themselves.
Charles Cheisler, a doctor of sleep at Harvard Medical School and a specialist in Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believes to be the first of that type in the United States.
He was inspired to make a course by speaking about the impact of deprivation of sleep on science.
"And after the speech finished, a girl came to me and said, "Why is that telling me just now when I'm at the last year of college?"
She said that no one ever told her about the meaning of the dream, which surprised me," said The Telegraph.
During the course that was held for the first time this year, students explain how good sleep habits help to achieve good results in science and sports and improve the general self - emotion of students.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatric professor at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University of Health, said that this course was decided to be introduced after it was found that students suffered from a serious lack of sleep within a week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of room at the academy where students click on coffee glasses, curtains, exercises and books to get information about the influence of caffeine and light and how the failure of sleep affects sports results and how important it is to maintain the regularity of sleep.
In another section, participants find out how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart failure, brain attack, depression and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to consider their daily routine.
"We know that this will not make a immediate change in the behavior of students.
But we believe that they have the right to know -- just as they all have the right to know what health effects we have with smoking cigarettes," added Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride from "the whole-science" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and continuingly increasing pressure on students means a growing problem of lack of sleep.
Ensuring sufficient sleep of good quality should be a “secret weapon ” of students who fight stress, exhaustion, and concern, and even allowing to avoid weighting, because the lack of sleep causes the brain to pass into a hunger mode, and the student is still hungry, ” he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler develop a course after taking part in one of his classes last year during his first year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press on the introduction of a course for the entire campus.
The next step is to ask all students to complete a similar study program before going to a competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommended that the students set a reminder when you need to go to sleep and when you need to get up and to be aware of the harmful impact of the “Blue Light” emitted by electronic devices and lighting LEDs that can disturb the day rhythm and lead to problems with sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga is taking over Gerrard's team
The Rangers have suffered again during the struggle in Livingston, when Dolly Menga with his arrow led to the failure of Steven Gerrard's dismounted team, obtaining the 1-0 results.
The Ibrox Stadium team wanted to note its first victory from February 4-1 on St. Johnstone, but the team of Gary Holt for the second time defeated Gerrard in 18 matches, causing for his team the difference of eight points with the leader Ladbrokes Premiership — Hearts.
Menga shot a naked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers showing a lack of commitment didn't seem to make it better.
While the Rangers recorded the fall to the sixth place, Livingston risen to the third — right behind Hibernian with a loss of one naked.
The Rangers team may have another problem with the need to preserve the head wound of Judge Calum Spence's linear wound after he was hit by an object thrown out of the guest tribune.
Gerrard introduced eight changes in the team, which allowed Ayr to emerge and go to Betfred Cup's half-final.
Holt went through with the same eleventh Livingston, who took the point to the Hearts team last week, being excited the way his well-trained team tortured at every step of his opponents.
The Rangers may have dominated the ownership of the ball, but the Livingston team did more with the ball when they got it.
They were supposed to get naked in only two minutes when this first ball exhibition through Menga let Scott Pittman face the gate of Allan McGregor, but the assistant didn't use his chance.
Then Keaghan Jacobs addressed a deep drop of free to Captain Craig Halkett, but his colleague Alan Lithgow who played at the defender's position could only stay on the back position.
The Rangers regained control in the third square, but it looked like they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos definitely recognized that he had a penalty for 15 minutes before the end of the game, when he and Steven Lawless arrived, but Judge Steven Thomson developed the Columbian's claim.
The Rangers were able to give only two customs shots in the first half, but there was an Ibrox locker, Liam Kelly, who was barely concerned about the head of Lassana Coulibaly and the weak shooting of Thisvie Ejaria's.
While Livingston won in 34 minutes a goal opening the game could be contrary to the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their efforts to gain.
Again, the Rangers did not deal with the deep permanent part of the game made by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher threw a ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm, delivering Menga to a simple end of action.
Gerrard did not embarrass Coulibaly on Ryan Kent — the replacement almost immediately affected the wing that threw the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it from his position.
The Livingston team continued to drag guests into the game exactly what they like when Lithgow and Halkett performed long administrations each after another.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the last minutes, but McGregor was well standing in front of Jacobs, and Lithgow removed the game from the corner.
The Reserve Rangers, Glenn Middleton, was hoping again for a punishment when he connected with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes back.
Almanac: Geiger inventor
And now the page of our Sunday Morning Almanac: 30 September 1882 – 136 years ago... the day he was born in Germany, the physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactiveness, which eventually led to a device known as Geiger's number.
From then on, Geigera has become both the element of science and the popcultural, such as the "Bells of Coronado" of 1950, in which these seemedly unlikely cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
A man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s number, used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these listeners on, you will hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals."
Evans: “Now hear something! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that wears his name has survived until today.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “observe” enemy cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “observe” enemy cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise the enemy cells in treatment.
This method is to separate immune cells from your patient and change them into the lab.
Then they can "see" protein common for many cancers, and then they are injected again into the body.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman treated by a teaching immune system to recognise enemy cells, an infection of egg cancer has been observed for over 18 months.
The method is to separate immune cells from the patient, to change them into the lab so that they can "see" protein common for many cancers called HER2 and then reinitiate the patient of these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that this vaccine is very good. ”
HER2 “produces the growth of several types of cancer”, including breast cancer, eggs, lungs and fat injury, explained Professor Berzofsky.
Similar approach based on acquisition of immune cells from patients and “training” of cancer cells has worked in treating a type of protein.
Canye West is heading for pro-trump diatrics in the Saturday Night Live program with the MAGA hat on his head.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was "explored" in the studio during the Saturday Night Live programme after he commended the President of the United States Donald Trump and said he was going to seek office in 2020.
After the night he performed his third song titled Ghost Town, during which he had a founded hat with the "Make America Great", he conducted a debate against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"As I speak to white people, I hear, "How can you like Trump? It's a racist!"
If I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America for a long time," he said.
The SNL programme began with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star laughed at the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Court of Justice on sexual attacks brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't transmitted, West's recording was sent to social media by Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock wanted to laugh at West by posting.
In addition, West complained to the public that behind the rounds had problems with his hat.
“ They took me behind the rounds.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They got on me!
And then they say I have no choice," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you say that I have no choice?", dodating: “I'll put on a “pellery of superman, so you will not be able to tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Let's accept."
His words twice caused the “bucking ” of the public, and the members of the SNL team looked as disturbed, reports Varieta, who was in the study during these events:“ The grave silence was in the studio. ”
West was invited to a program in exchange for Ariana Grande's songmaker, who had been a boy, raper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West intrigued many by performing the song I Love it in the dress of the bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the TPUS Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who set up the following tweet: “To one of the bravest: I thank you for making the MAFIA. ”
The speaking show Karen Hunter on her Twitter said that West was just "he was himself and it's absolutely great".
"BUT I will NOT reward the person (with buying its music or clothes or supporting its art), which, I believe, accepts and spreads harmful to my community, ideology.
He's free.
Similarly, we are free," she added.
Before the raper program, he announced on Twitter that he changed his name and that he was now “formally called Kanye West”.
However, he is not the first artist who changed his name — followed by the tracks of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A friendly raper, Snoop Dogg, accepted the name Snoop Lion, and the music legend, Prince, changed the name into a symbol, and then an artist known earlier as Prince.
Prosecution of attempting to kill a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempting a murder after he stabbed a man's knife in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
This happened in Ballyhackamore, as the police say.
The accused is to stand before the County Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecutor.
The star of the Kit Harrington throne moves the issue of toxic manhood
Kit Harrington is known for his role by Jona Snow in the medium-economic series of HBO “Game for throne”.
31-year-old actor hit the macho hero stereotype, saying that showing such roles on the screen makes young boys often think that they have to play hard to be respected.
In the Sunday Times Culture interview, Kit stated that “something went wrong ” and wondered how to deal with the toxic manhood in the MeToo age.
A whale, who recently married his partner from the Tron Game Plan, 31-year-old actor of Rose Leslie, admitted that he feels "sufficiently" by moving this issue.
"I feel pretty sure at this point -- where we made a mistake about manhood?" he said.
"What did we teach men when they grew up, seeing from the perspective of the problem we're dealing with now?"
Kit believes that a toxic male development can be partially responsible television because of the presentation of very male characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are born, and what are they taught?
What does he learn on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys start to think that they have to stand on a certain side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can you do to change it?
Clearly, it's not all right with young men."
In his interview, he also admitted that he will not play in any prequel or sequel of the throne game after the end of the series next year, saying that he “finished with fields of battle and horses. ”
Since November, Kit will play the Trie West art of Sam Shepard, which is a story about the film producer and his brother, the thief.
The actress recently stated that he considers the best thing that happened to him in the throne Game.
"I met my wife on the plan, which provided me with my future family and a new life," he said.
In this many times rewarded Emma's fantasy series of fantasy Rose played Ygritte — an object of loving interests played by Kit, Jona Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 in the area of Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China notes 14% increase in new cases
China announced 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people are affected by this problem, as reported by the health workers of the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, about 40 000 new cases were reported.
The determined majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which means a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV virus is rapidly spread in some parts of China as a result of the transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected by HIV was almost totally reduced, as Chinese health officials said at the Yunnan Province Conference.
However, in comparison with year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
Transfer of HIV through sex is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexualism was decriminated in China in 1997, but the discrimination of people from the LGBT community is widespread.
Given the conservative values of the country, research estimates that 70 to 90% of the men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of disease result in insufficient security during having sex in these bonds.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided widespread access to HIV medicines through efforts to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies the fact that a member of her team has revealed the data of the Senators of the Republican Party — these are “dangerous lies” and“ theory of conspiracy”.
The member of the United States Representation Chamber, Maxine Waters, rejected the charges on Saturday as if a member of its team had placed the personal data of three Republican Senators on the Wikipedia-Legalers.
Member of the Democratic Party of Los Angeles assured that these accusations were issued by experts and websites related to “ultra-related wings”.
"Lyes, lies and even more vulnerable lies," Waters commended in the Twitter statement..
Public information appears to contain home addresses and phone numbers of American Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, and it was placed by an unknown person on the Capitol during the interrogation of the Senatu Panel on sexual offences against the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The excursion took place some time after the Kavanaugh candidature was questioned by three Senators.
Conservative parties, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP identification address of the post source was linked to the Waters office and published information on the member of the Waters team, as said in Hill.
"This unfounded charge is completely false and it is a 100 per cent lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my team — whose identity, personal data and security have been violated through these fraud and false charges — was not in any way responsible for the expiry of this information.
This unfounded charge is completely false and it is a 100% lie."
The Waters statement quickly criticised on the Internet, including Ari Fleischer, a former press reporter of the White House.
"This way of denying is bad," Fleischer wrote.
“It suggests that it does not have the appropriate temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he can't be bad.
He can't provoke.
He can't question the motives of the accuser.
He has to remain calm for that."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the criticism of Democrats at Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive anger during the Thursday interview.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate in the Mediterranean elections to replace the Waters' position, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's a thick case," he wrote on Tweet.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed her “the proper authorities and authorities of the prosecution of these deceived accusations. ”
“The managers will be demasked and drawn to legal responsibility for all their actions that are a threat to any of the members of my team”, she announced.
Review of Johnny English film: Nokaut — a spy parody with a weak Rowen Atkinson
Looking for references to Brexit in every new film with the British thread has already become a standard. It seems to apply in the case of a new part of a series of films from the kind of action and the Johnny English comedy, which started in 2003 from the film “Johnny English” and which returned to movies in 2011 with the film “Johnny English: Reactiveation”.
Will a self-excretion satire about how hopeless we are become a new export product of the country?
In any case, an incompetent Johnny English, who has ever been surprised, has received his name and his name more than anything else, signals that it is an expansive, comic product designed for non - English viewers.
He is of course a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange pleasures in smoothie glamour, has some of the inspector Clouseau, the scope of Jasia Fasoli and a drop of this guy adding one note to the melody of the Chariots of Fire at the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a world - mystery man — Atkinson played in the forgotten television ads of Barclaycard, in which he left chaos.
In the latest series of Johnny English, there are one or two moments of attention.
I really liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter, being dressed in a medium - century armor, while his helmet was rhythmically hit by the shovels of the shovel.
On the screen, you can clearly see the gift of Atkinson for the physical play of comedy, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low and unnecessary, especially that at present, the “great” filmmarks, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, offer comedial elements as part of the film.
Humorist elements seem to be directed to children rather than adults — I think the crazy adventures of Johnny English are not as ideal and coherent as the gags in the German Atkinson films on Jasia Fasoli.
Forever the current assumption is that the United Kingdom has serious problems.
Cyberhaker crosses the British supersecret spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents operating in the territory — to fear the agent at the service, Kevin Eldon, who, unfortunately, played a small role.
This is the last drop in the bitter prime minister, which is a pompatical, wasted figure already and so suffering from a nervous disturbance caused by lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything in her power, involving Teresy May, but the scenario does not give her the possibility to develop her wings.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that, as a result of the identity of all active spys, she will have to return to the service of one of the retired agents.
And this means the incompetent Johnny English in his own person, currently employed as a teacher in an elegant school, giving unofficial lessons about how to become a secret agent — a few fine gags during the Spieing Lesson by English.
English is called to Whitehall to escort, reconnecting to his former assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with a submarine boat commander — a jolly, but a little tired figure played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin participants in the secret service of Her Majesty return to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatals of Ophelia Bullet, the form played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously controlled by a charismatic billionaire-technique who claims that he can solve computer problems of the Great Britain -- it is a vicious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crossing from absurd situations: dressed as waiters burn the French restaurant; they introduce chaos, swimming into the luxury jacht of Volta; and English sows desolation when using a set for virtual reality to meet the inside of Volta's house.
In this last sequence, all limitations are missing, however, despite a nice and humble performance, the whole film is very similar to the TV for children.
Typical diameter.
Like in other movies in Johnny English, I couldn't resist my thoughts: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson the role that would really fit his talent?
The work party denies as if it was designing a plan for the British for the four-year week of work for which they would receive a remuneration in five days
The Jeremy Corbyn Work Party will consider the introduction of a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week, receiving a remuneration in five days.
Accordingly, the Party wishes that business chiefs provide savings to workers through the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI), giving them an additional day off.
As a result, the employees could enjoy the three - day weekend, getting the same amount of remuneration.
The sources indicate that this idea will be "incorporated" into the economic program of the party and the country's exit plans against workers.
The fourth week of work was supported by the Congress of the Professional Unions as a way to use workers to change the economy.
The Sunday Times, a senior member of the Working Party, said: “I expect a policy change to be announced before the end of this year.”
"It will not happen from day to day, but the four-year working week is something that is included in the approach of the Party to restore the economic balance to the benefit of the employee, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the Party.
The Work Party is not the first party that supports this idea — the Green Party committed to introducing a four-year week of work during the 2017 election campaign.
However, these plans are not currently supported by all members of the Working Party.
The rapporteur of the Work Party said: “The week of work is not a party policy and it is not considered by it.”
John McDonnell, the Chancellor of the Shadow Office, used the last week's Labour Party conference to present his vision of socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to restore power from "free directors" and "speculants" in public benefit companies.
The Chancellor's plans from the shadow office also mean that the present shareholders of water companies may not recover their entire participation, as the Government of the Labour Party could make "decision" on the basis of detected abuses.
He also confirmed the plans for employees to be placed in companies' offices and for the establishment of integration of property funds in order to transfer 10 per cent of their own capital from the private sector to employees who receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer the "60 minutes" program to ask if the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh can make them change their attitude
The FBI's investigation against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote of his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and caused a question whether the establishment of the investigative office could encourage the Republican Senators to withdraw their support.
In the interview held on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that could change their attitudes.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Caroline.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the interrogation, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened when the charge came up, and I asked him, "You did it?"
He was firm, determined and clear."
But Graham's opinion seems to be scratched in a stone.
"I made a decision on Brett Kavanaugh and a strong charge is needed to change it," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denyed it firmly," added Graham, calling Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people he has given it could have verified it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything will change."
What is the event of the Global Citizen Festival, and has it at any rate contributed to reducing poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will take place next Saturday in New York, the annual musical event that can be honored by an incredibly impressive composition of stars and as an impressive mission — the elimination of poverty in the world.
The seventh Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people arriving in Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy the events of such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the realization of the most important goal of this event as the elimination of extreme poverty until 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was started in 2012, is the enlargement of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of actors to combat poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for this event (if it was decided to buy a VIP ticket), the concert party had to perform a series of tasks or activities, such as voluntary, sending e-mail to the world's leader, carrying out telephone or other important actions helping to raise awareness of the goal of the elimination of poverty.
But what success can Global Citizen be commended in the vision of 12 years remaining to meet the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concert a good way to convince them to require action, or another case of so-calclictivism, when people feel that they do something important, signing an Internet petition or putting an entry on Tweet?
The Global Citizen Organization claims that since 2011 it has noted more than 19 million “actions” to support the action in order to achieve many different goals.
It also claims that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and provisions of over $37 billion to affect the life of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group had accompanied 390 commitments and declarations of its activities, which already paid or financed for at least 10 billion dollars.
The group estimates that the security measures have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world so far.
Some of the key commitments include the Power of Nutrition, the British partnership of investors and implementers involved in “helping children in reaching their full potential”, which promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help to eliminate dishes in this country after members of Global Citizen sent over 4700 tweets.
“By supporting the British government, the donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizen, such as you, we can make social injustice, such as food, go into history” — Tracey Ullman, Ambassador Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after the implementation of more than 5000 activities calling for Britain to improve the quality of mother and children, the government announced the financing of the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach up to 5 million women and children with food problems.
On one of the most frequent questions on your web site, which sounded "Why can we be sure that we can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road — sometimes we will confront and fail.
But as in the case of the former major movements for civil rights and the fight against the apartheid, we will be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the stars occurring this year in New York, whose hosts will be Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the military marine for the “bloc” of the Russian energy exports — the Secretary of Internal Affairs
Washington may “in the case of need ” escape to his marine to prevent the flow of Russian energy to markets, including those in the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of Internal Affairs of the United States, Ryan Zinke, Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that the involvement of Russia in Syria, especially where it works to invite a legal government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is the will of intermediate energy trade, as it is in Eastern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"United States in the case of their military marine are able to ensure that the seaways remain open and, if necessary, create blockade to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group of non-profits that describes itself as the name of the “voice of energy consumer” in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more of the use and replacement of fuel," he said, comparing Russia to "the dog knowing one trick" with the economy depending on mine fuels.
These statements appeared when the Trump Administration continues a mission aimed at increasing the export of scratched natural gas to Europe, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers in comparison with Russian gas.
To this end, the Trump administration officials, including the President of the United States Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” project of Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin “slave” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that Nord Stream 2 gassage of 11 billion dollars to double the existing passage to 110 billion cubic metres is only an economic project.
Kreml argues that Washington's zealous objection to the implementation of the project is only a economic cause and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should have the possibility of selecting suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The position of the United States has caused a violent response from Germany, which confirmed their involvement in the implementation of the project.
The leading industrial organisation of Germany, the Federation of the German Industry (BDI) called upon the United States to integrate the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I believe that this is a big problem when the third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of the German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting, Chancellor Germany Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said she would consider running for the President in 2020
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said on Saturday that after the Mediterranean elections she would consider running for the president.
During the Holyoke meeting, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidature.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair the corrupt government, and it is also related to women with the highest position," she said, "The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will consider my candidature to the President's position."
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trump, saying that “the country is leading in the wrong direction. ”
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren expressed her criticism against Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday on Twitter Warren, she wrote: “Of course we need the FBI investigation before the vote. ”
However, the report published on Thursday showed that most Warren voters do not believe that they should be candidated in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the Massachusetts voters who choose "probably" said that the senator should not be running, as a result of the Suffolk University of Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Twenty-two percent supported the candidature.
The survey showed greater support for the former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 percent of his potential candidature, and 48 percent were opposed to it.
Other known names from the democratic camp have been taken into account for the potential candidature in 2020 were Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision until January, as Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress team (PTSD) Track Gorina during the election chamber of Donald Trump
Track Palin (26 years) spent a year in Iraq after he dragged into the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, through which he has to go back, I understand other families that feel the effects of PTSD and the wounds with which our soldiers return," said the public in the election sector of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest of her son “theme of tabu, ” and she said about her son and other war veterans:“ They return a little different, they come back, they come back, wondering if their colleagues will be respected for what soldiers, aircraft and all other members of the military have given their country. ”
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilla in Alasca and accused of domestic violence on a woman, indicating false testimony in the report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in an immediate state, as said Dan Bennett, a prosecutor of the Department of the Vasilli Police.
18 states and Columbia District support the fight against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Columbia District support a legal challenge for the new United States policy, which refuses to grant asylum to victims who flee gang or domestic violence.
The representatives of 18 states and district submitted a letter of amicus in Washington on Friday in order to support the asylum enforced by the asylum against this policy, according to the NBC News.
The full name of the reason in the law of Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union organized in August against federal politics, was not disclosed.
She said that her partner “and his brutal sons from the gang ” were harassing her, but American officials rejected her asylum on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
The prosecutors of the states supporting Grace described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum-seekers in the U.S. as countries facing common problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new American asylum policy has rejected the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee from domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the Prosecutor-General of the Columbia District, said in a Friday statement that the new policy "is ignoring state law, federal and international law since the decades".
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered on the basis of concrete facts and circumstances, and that prohibition violates this principle”, as it says in the amicus list.
The prosecutors continued to argue in the letter that the policy deniing immigrants to enter in harms the United States economy, claiming that they can become entrepreneurs and "to establish the necessary labour force".
The Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions in June told immigration judges to stop giving asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and gangs.
“The asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear in racial, religious, national or due to the belonging to a certain social group or having such and not other political convictions”, said the Sessions in its statement of 11 June on asylum policy.
Asylum was never intended to solve all problems — even those serious — with whom people around the world fight every day.
Desperate rescue trials in Palu when the number of death victims has doubled in the race, which aims to find survivors.
For survivors, the situation has become more tragic.
"It's a very intense feeling," said 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, comforting his excited son in the evacuation center in the destructed city of Palu.
"Each minute, the ambulance brings the body.
There's no clean water."
The residents were seen to return to the destroyed homes, searching through the water of things and trying to save everything they could find.
There were hundreds of people injured, and the hospitals damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 degrees were rapidly filled.
Some wounded, including Two Harris, who had experienced breaking the circuit and arms, rested outside the military hospital in Palo, where patients were treated outside because of strong secondary shocks.
The tears filled his eyes, as he was telling about a violent earthquake that shakened the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was pushed into the rumovisco wall," Harris said Associated Press, adding that his family arrived in town for the wedding.
“ I heard my wife calling for help, and her voice was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
The Ambassador of the United States accuses China of the “business” of advertising.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper set up a four-strong advertising advertisement in the American journal, advocating the mutual benefits of American-Chinese trade, the US Ambassador in China accused Peking of using the US press to expand propaganda.
The President of the United States Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to China Daily's payable supplement in Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in Iowa, accusing China of attempting to interfere with the United States Congress, which will take place on November 6th, to deny that charge.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere with the United States elections confirmed what American officials said to Reuters that this is a new stage in the escalation of Washington's campaign to create pressure on China.
While it is normal that foreign governments include advertisements promoting trade with their countries, Pekin and Washington are currently leading to an escalation of trade war, which has led to the increase in customs tariffs for mutual imports.
China's remuneration tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were to touch exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Trump Party — Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States in China, and had been a multi-year governor of the state of Iowa, the chief exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had injured American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in the article in the Sunday issue of Des Moines Register that China “this is now double forced to start harassment, putting advertising in our own free press. ”
“With its propaganda, the government of China uses the respected American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, putting a payable advertisement in Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
For this, there will be no opposition votes in the street in Beijing and there will be no real reflection of the distinct opinions that the Chinese may have on the disturbing economic direction defenced by China, taking into account that the media are under strong control of the Chinese Communist Party”, he wrote.
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish ” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
The Republicans warn each other from the Mediterranean elections of women with the right to vote by the Kavanaugh affair, the analysts warn
While many leading Republicans support and weapons nominated to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several sexual attacks, an analyst warns that these members will meet during the approaching Mediterranean elections with a violent response, especially women.
The emotions accompanied by this event are extremely large, and most Republicans already want to vote.
“It can't be reverted” said in the Saturday article Grant Reeher, a Professor of Political Sciences at Maxwell School at Syracuse University.
Reeher said that he had doubts about whether the efforts of Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona) to conduct the last moment of the investigation by the FBI were enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow and will not forget it until November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and a national advocate of the MoveOn progress group on Friday, as the newspaper issued in Washington.
On Friday morning, protesters scanned the password “Arrives November”, showing in the Senate Hall for the decision of the Republicans to control the Court of Justice of the Nomination of Kavanaugh, despite the statements of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as Mic said.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation level will go beyond the scale," said one of the information pages of Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say he's already been tall," and it's true.
But it may be higher, especially among undecisive women from pre-grads and younger voters aged 18 to 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before the public testimony of Ford, in which she detailed her charges for sexual attacks addressed to the Supreme Court of Justice, the analysts suggested that if the Republicans decided to approve the candidature, this could be a violent response.
"The Republican Party must deal with a small mess," Michael Steele said at the beginning of last week, former President of the Republican National Committee, as the NBC News reports.
"It is not only about the vote of the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it is also the way the Republicans managed and how Ford treated it," said on one of the Guy Cecil information channels, director of the US Priorities, a group that helps to choose Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be slightly divided about whom to believe in the face of the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little greater support for this last.
The new YouGov review shows that 41 percent of the respondents were determined or rather believed to Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent claimed that they were determined or rather believed in Kavanaugh's testimony.
Furthermore, 38% of the respondents argued that Kavanaugh was likely or surely lying during the testimony, while only 30% claimed the same about Ford.
Following the pressure by Flake, the FBI began an investigation on the charges made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports the Guardian.
The Ford testified last week under the oath before the Senatic Court Commission that Kavanaugh attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominated to the Supreme Court showed her his genitalia during the events at Yale University in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Creator plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, World Wide Web Creator, launchs a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform, Solid, belonging to Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which persons have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company Berners-Lee, he was joking that the purpose of the creation of Inrupt was “domination over the world”.
"We must do it now," he said, referring to the startup.
"There's a historical moment."
The application uses the Solid platform technology to enable people to create their own "Web Stock with personal data" or otherwise.
It may contain lists of contacts, lists of things to do, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in the same browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of the Internet store with personal data is that it is entirely dependent on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls it “personal power through data. ”
According to the chairman of the company, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills to help the Solid platform to all people.
Currently, Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a number of developers employed to work in the project and the volunteer community.
Since this week, technology creators around the world could create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to “Facebook and Google about whether to make a total change that will bring back all their business models from day to day.
"I do not ask them for permission."
On Saturday, on the Medium Post Berners-Lee platform, he wrote that “the Inrupt mission is to provide trade and ecosystem energy to help protect integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform”.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technology Institute.
In recent months, Berners-Lee had a lot of debate on network neutrality.
Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely excited to think about the next period of development in the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest's celebration by Victoria Cross during World War I
The memory of the only priest of the Church of England, who, during the first World War, was marked as a combatant by the Victoria Cross, was held 100 years later in his family city.
Reverend Bernard Vann was marked on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never discovering that he was marked by the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a stone of memory during the Rushden Paradise in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the opening of the stone at exactly the 100th anniversary of Grandpa’s celebration had “extraordinarily symbolic nature. ”
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Pułk Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Channel “in a very dense fog and under strong fire from fields and machine weapons. ”
Then he hurried to the fire line, and with “the greatest courage ” he led her forward, and then in a single way he caused an attack on the position of field divisions, disrupting three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 — a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandfather’s actions were “why I would never be able to meet, but also something humble. ”
With his brother, Dr. James Vann, he put a vein on the end of the parade by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt “very honored to participate in the paradise ” and added that“ the courage of a real hero appears in support from many people. ”
The MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206, instead, they got a Peppa pig.
Imagine that you haven't slept all night to look at Bellator 206 gala and finally not see the main battle.
The gali program in San Jose consisted of 13 battles, including six on the main map, and was shown live at night in Britain on channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, the viewers in Great Britain were shocked by changing the program for Peppa.
Some were disappointed after they were not sleeping until early mornings, especially to see this fight.
One of the Twitter fans described the substitute for a painter for children as a “sick joke. ”
"In accordance with the government Regulation, the content of this type is inappropriate to allow it to be released at 6 a.m., and it was necessary to change the program for children," said Dave Schwartz, the senior vice-president for marketing and communications of the Bellator organization when he was asked for a transfer.
"Peppa pig, yes."
The President of the Bellator, Scott Coker, said they would work a schedule to take into account the viewers of Britain in the future.
"When I think of the situation again, I think we can fix this," Coker said.
"But it is Sunday sixth morning, which will make us not be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time and Monday by their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when there was a change in the program, there were a lot of comments that none of us sounded friendly.
We tried to fix this... we thought it was a technical disturbance.
But it wasn't a mess, it was a legal matter.
I can promise that this situation will never happen again.
We'll limit the program to five fights instead of six — to the standard quantities, and we're too strong to satisfy the fans, and we're unfortunately preconceived.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "worst" because of sexuality
Tom Daley, the Olympic Jump to Water, says he was growing up, feeling worse than everyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him motivation to make success.
24-year-old said he didn't realize that they weren't all like him until he went to high school.
In the Desert Island Discs station Radio 4 led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give to others “nade. ”
He also said that he was a parent, and he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
The customer who has been emitting this program for many years, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months free because of the disease.
When Daley showed up in the first program by Laverne, he said that when he grew up, he felt “ less valuable ” than others, because “the contemporary love of boys and girls was not socially acceptable. ”
He said: “To this day, it is a sense of less value and being other is something that gives me strength to be successful. ”
He said that he wanted to prove that he was “which is worth something ” so that he would not disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The two brown Olympic medalists became a loud LGBT community actor and used his performance at the annual Community games in Australia to invite more countries to decriminate homosexualism.
He said he decided to express himself because he felt happy to live openly, without any implications, and so he wanted to give the hope to others.
The triple champion of the world said that falling in love with a man, a American filmer, Dustina Lance Black, who he met in 2013, “wild be surprised. ”
Daley married Oscar’s winner, who is 20 years older, last year, noting that such a difference in age was never a problem for him.
“ When you go through so much in this young age, ” he meant his first Olympics aged 14 and father’s death for cancer three years later, ” he said he was difficult to find someone in the same age who experienced similar fevers and destruction.
The couple remained in June by a boy's parents named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his perception of certain things has changed completely.
"Latest year was the most important thing for me to get a gold medal," he said.
"And you know what, there are more important things than gold olympic medals.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 when he was 40 years old after diagnosed his brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for the Olympics in London in 2012 — wanted to take place in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him: 'You won't be with us to be in the first row, Dad," he said.
“I held him for my hand when he stopped breathing, and just when he stopped breathing and died, I realized that he was not imperfect, ” he said.
In the next year, Daley participated in the Olympic Games 2012 and gained brown.
"I knew that this was what I dreamed all my life -- jumping into water before the crowd of people in the Olympic Games -- was the best feeling of the possibilities," he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song — Heather Small Strip — that was accompanied by the preparations for the Olympic Games, and which still gives him a gussy skin.
The Desert Island Discs program is issued at the BBC Radio 4 station every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Showing the lack of form Mickelson on the bench during the Saturday Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when it plays its 47th game in Ryder Cup, but he'll have to work on his shape so that she doesn't turn off her fifth.
Mickelson, who played 12 at every two years of event, was sent to the club by Captain Jim Furyk during the Saturday Fourball and Foursome.
Instead of being in the center of action, as often happened in his case in the United States team, the five-way winner had to spend the day on the doping of the team and working on the improvement of his game in hope of fixing the cause of his reference to the bench.
48-year-old who never gave the simplest hits, even at the top moment of his career, is not very well checked in the close field of Le Golf National, where the wrong strikes are punishable by long roughs.
And if the field itself is not enough disgusting for Mickelson, the ninth game on Sunday must face the precision of the British Open winner — Francesco Molinari, who has connected forces to Tommy Fleetwood debutton to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans (with the loss of four points at the beginning of 12 singles) start the game with the struggle, the Mickelson game may be extremely key.
Furyk expressed confidence in his competitor — he probably couldn’t do anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, he knocked me on my back, hugged me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow, ” said Furyk.
"He is very sure of himself.
He's in the glory gallery and has brought many to play his teams both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two matches.
I thought there would be more of them, but that's what we had to do.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record about Rider Cup games on Sunday.
This may mean the end of his career in Ryder Cup, which never compared his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories on his account, 20 failures and seven remissions. Furyk said his presence has brought a lot to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, funny, and it's good to have it in the team's room," he explained.
"I think the young players had fun with him this week, which was nice to see.
It's more than just a game."
The captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that a large point advantage may soon be overwhelmed
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before the start of the single in the last day Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
The Danian debited in the Valderrama field in 1997, where he and his Vice-Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the target line passed the shortest of the possible hair, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"We can't forget that we had a great advantage in the Valderrama field; we also had a great advantage in the Brooklyn field where we lost, and in the case of Valderrama, we won only hair," said Bjorn, on the picture, after the win 5-3 Class of 2018, both on Friday and yesterday, which led to leading 10-6 in Le Golf National field.
The time will show me to all the members of the team that this isn't over yet.
Tomorrow, you're making everything out of your mind.
Get out there and do everything right.
It'll be over until the table shows the points.
We have a goal to gain the trophy, and we need to concentrate on it.
From the beginning, I said that I've focused on 12 players who are on our side, but we also know well who people are on the opposite side, the best players in the world."
Bjorn, delighted in how his competitors managed to deal with the difficult field, added: “I wouldn’t do that better.
But tomorrow, it's different.
They start alone tomorrow, and this is another matter.
It's good to play with a partner when everything goes by thought, but when you play alone, your golf skills are tested to the limits of opportunities.
This is a message that you have to transmit to the players is to give everything out of you tomorrow.
The partner also has to give everything to himself."
Jim Furyk, opposed to Bjorn, will expect from his competitors to achieve better results alone than during the game with a partner, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points from four.
Sam Furyk experienced great returns to the last day as a victory team in the Brooklyn field, and then defeated after the European team had done “the marvel in Medinah field”.
"I remember every word," said Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, in response to his last day.
“Tomorrow we play 12 important matches — you would like to start a game in a fast pace, as it happened in Brooklyn and Medinah fields.
If this move goes one way, it'll make a big pressure on the middle games.
We set up our composition accordingly and set up boys in a way that would allow us to charm tomorrow."
Tomas was assigned to direct a contradict, facing Rory McIlroy in the main game, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, other European team players in the leading half of the program.
"I have decided to take this group of guys in this order, because I think he can handle all the games," Bjorn said about his elections on a single basis.
New German warship has been delayed again
The latest fregate of the German Navy should be devoted to the use in 2014 to replace old warships from the time of the cold war, but this will not occur until at least next year, due to the failing arrangements and growing at the scary rate of costs, as local media reported.
The dedication to the use of Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the new fregate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was moved to the first half of 2019, as Die Zeit said, referring to the words of the military prosecutor.
The ship should be incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but, as a result of the problems that have occurred after delivery, it was necessary to amend the ambitious project.
Four units of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy of War in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class fregates.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful workshop, a series of anti-flying and anti-ship missiles, as well as technological solutions to prevent detection, including reducing radar traces, under red and acustical.
Other important characteristics include longer periods between maintenances — the use of new fregats should be possible even for two years away from maternal ports.
However, continuous delays mean that these modern warships to enable Germany to respond to foreign situations, at the time of starting service, will be overlap, noted by Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 fregate appeared on the first pages of the newspaper last year, when the German military marine officially refused to devote the ship to operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ship in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the ship after delivery.
Not much was known about the causes behind the return, but the German media informed about a number of key “software and equipment” that made the ship useless in the battle mission.
Particularly, software failures were important because the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class should be supported by a crew counting about 120 mariners, which is half less than in the case of the older fregats of the Bremen class.
It also turned out that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its achievements and reduces the possibility of carrying out by the navy of future modernisation.
The weighting 7000 tonnes of the Rheinland-Pfalz ship is considered to be twice tougher than ships of similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the failing equipment, the problem is also the cost of the entire project, including the training of the crew.
It is said that it achieved a scattering level of EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion USD), while the initial cost was 2.2 billion.
The problems of dedication to the use of new fregats are of particular importance in the light of the recent warnings that the German force of the marine fleet is crushing.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Defence Commission, admitted that the mariners will “continue the ships capable of use”.
He also said that this problem has eventually increased to the result of the withdrawal from the exploitation of old units without providing replacement ships.
Furthermore, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the fregat of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be included in the Navy fleet.
National Trust listens to the secret life of the nucleus
New research carried out in the scotch area of Highlands aims to show how the netopers use the landscape when they acquire food.
The results of the research are expected to give new light to maintain these exceptional flying suckers and help direct future measures to protect them.
Studies conducted by scientists from National Trust for Scotland will be subjected to patches of populous and small, as well as brown ears of long ears and netopers from the family of red nights in Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
In key places around the property, special registrators will be placed in order to monitor non-tope activity in full-season.
Workers and volunteers of NHS will also conduct research in the field using portable detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings aims to determine the frequency of signals sent by the netopers and the way to behave individual species.
Then a seating map and a report will be developed to create a detailed image of their behaviour in the scale of landscape.
Rob Dewar, a Nature Protection Adviser in NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of settlement are the most important for the netopers and how they are used by each species.
These information will help to identify the benefits of the management of sites, such as the creation of arcs, as well as the best ways to maintain forest areas for nitrogens and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout the Great Britain, the population of nettopeers has declined significantly during the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affect the hills and loss of accommodation.
The wind turbines and lighting installations can also be a threat, as well as flies sticky and some chemicals used in construction materials and even home cats.
They're not really blind.
However, because of the night - to - night hunting habits, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in catching the gains.
They use a complicated echolocalisation technique to search for worms and obstacles on their way.
The NTS organization, which is responsible for the care of over 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes it very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, controls, and sometimes even rescue action.
The organization founded even the first and the only dedicated reservation in Scotland in the property of Threave in Dumfries and Gallovey, which is a home for eight of the ten scotch species.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says she's for a perfect territories.
"Threave has an excellent area for the netopers," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and fabulous seats.
However, there are still many unknowns about the netoper. The work we do here and in other propertys will help us better understand what they need to develop."
It emphasizes the importance of control in terms of the occurrence of the netopers before accessing the maintenance work in the property, since unintended destruction of one group can kill to 400 males and young men, which may lead to the disappearance of the entire local population.
They are protected — killing, harassment, or disturbing them, and destroying their cities is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotch Officer Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public opinion to provide assistance.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our netoppers, and in many species we don’t even know how their populations are dealing with. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, while his lawyers intend to sue German storage
Cristiano Ronaldo referred against him the charges of rape as "fake news", saying that people "will promote themselves," using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue the German information magazine Der Spiegel, who published these charges.
The Portuguese attacker Juventus was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the Friday reports, a football player Der Spegel would pay a woman $355,000 for silence.
Ronaldo (33 years), a few hours after the announcement of the charges, in the instagram message on live to his 142 million followers, described these reports as “fake news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's reports are fake news," said the five-blown winner of the goldball.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of my work.
I'm happy and everything's fine," a football player added with a smile on his mouth.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spegel's storage for the charges that they called “inadmissible suspicions in the area of privacy” — says Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the football player would demand compensation for “moral damage in the amount corresponding to the weight of infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the past years. ”
The rare event was held in June 2009 in the hotel hotel Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorg reportedly went to the football room, where he seemed to have raped a woman analytically — as indicated in the district court of Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her that in “99 percent he was a good man ” who was visited by this“ one percent. ”
According to Ronaldo's documentation, the couple had sex, but it was done by a mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she was “fearing revenge ” and“ public humiliation. ”
A 34-year-old girl says she wants to discontinue the deal now, because she still can't forget the apparent event.
During the suspected attack, Ronaldo went from Manchester United to Real Madryt, and this year he moved to Juventus after he paid 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain would regret the departure of car manufacturers at all times
Great Britain "will regret it forever", if after leaving the European Union, the world leader's status in the production of cars, the Minister of Business Greg Clark said.
He added that he was "attended," when the representative of Toyota U.K. said in an intelligence for BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, the production in the Burnaston factory near Derby will be temporaryly suspended.
"We need agreements," said Clark.
The representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of the border delays in the absence of a Brexit agreement may lead to reducing jobs.
The Burnaston factory, in which Auris and Avensis models are produced, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% have been exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union at the end of March without agreement, then the production will be stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of the Toyota company in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers fear to leave the EU without agreement on how to operate cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW intends to close its car factory Mini in Oxford month after Brexit.
The main concerns, as claimed by car manufacturers, are the threats related to the supply chain in the event of leaving the European Union by the Great Britain without agreement.
Toyoty's production line is operating as “just-in-time”, where parts reach every 37 minutes from the suppliers both in the Great Britain and in the EU for cars produced on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be difficulties at the border, which, according to the industry's representatives, may lead to delays and disadvantages of parts.
As the representative of the company said, Toyota would not be able to endure more than one day without delivery to its factory in Derbyshire, which would sustain the production.
Clark said that the Chequers Theresy May plan on future relations with the EU is “concretely designed to avoid border controls”.
“We need agreements and we want to achieve the best of the possible agreement that will allow us not only to enjoy our current success but also to use this situation accordingly," said BBC Radio 4.
"The statements not only Toyotes but also other producers show that we have to continue with what was composed of a very effective supply chain."
The representative of Toyota was unable to determine how long the production will be stopped, but it warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the establishment, which would lead to reducing employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and has been a member of the Union Union's headquarters, said that the union members are increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if there is a job elimination, they will never be restored.
The governor of the government said: "We have set up a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the European Union."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, as the White House says
The important meeting of Donald Trump with the Deputy General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein may be “lack for another week” because of the continuing fight for candidate to the Supreme Brett Kavanaugh court, as he said on Sunday, the White House.
Rosenstein is supervising the work of a special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is examining the possibility of the Russians' involvement in the elections, the link between close colleagues of Trump and Russia and the potential difficulty in the act of justice by the President.
It's whether Trump will release the Deputy General Prosecutor, threatening Mueller's independence for months, it's a hot topic in Washington.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about hearing in order to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility to remove the president from his position on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denyed these reports.
However, last Monday, he went to the White House in the face of reports, as if he was going to be dismissed.
The date of a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was appointed on Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, and there was a meeting to avoid collaboration with the senatic court committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump managed a weekly investigation of the FBI on charges against Kavanaugh, which also delayed the voting in the Senate.
Trump's press reporter, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Sunday at Fox News Station.
When she was asked to meet with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for this meeting has not yet been set, it may take place this week and may be moved for another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We'll see, I'm sure I'll let the press know."
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference of the White House since 10 September.
The manager of the program, Chris Wallace, asked about the reason.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences is not caused by an inconvenience to "entential" television journalists, and then she added: "I will not hide that they are "statational".
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The current President has held more "query and answers" sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding without giving evidence: "We have met the numbers."
The press conferences will continue to be held, Sanders said, but "if journalists will have the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States questions, this is a much better solution than talking to me.
We are trying to do this regularly, and in the past few weeks, we have done this very often. The press conferences will take place to such sessions, where you will be able to talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions during leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with guesting dignitars.
Sol press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why it is, acting too free and sometimes strange before the gathered journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to workers from the European Union employed in NHS Scotland in the face of concerns relating to Brexit
The Minister of Health has made a letter to workers from the European Union employed in the Scotland health service to give them thanks to the country and request them not to leave in Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scotland Parliament, sent a letter for less than six months before the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scotland Government has already pledged to cover the costs of questioning applications for settled status for EU citizens working in decentralized public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “In summer, negotiations on the exit of the Great Britain from the European Union continued, and the appropriate decisions will be taken in the autumn of this year.
The British Government has also intensified preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know it's a very disturbing period for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of each personnel, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from all the EU and outside of it provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we really want you to stay here."

Foreign purchasers will be charged with a higher treasure fee in purchase of property in Great Britain
According to the new plans of toriss buying from abroad, higher treasury fees will be charged for the purchase of real estate in Great Britain. The measures that will be obtained will be allocated to homeless help.
This move is to reduce the success of Jeremy Corby's actions to attract a young election.
Increasing the taxes will cover those who do not pay taxes in the Great Britain.
The Ministry of Treasure envisages that this will bring even 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will inform today that foreigners buying property in Great Britain will be charged with a higher treasury fee, and the additional measures obtained in this way will be allocated to help homeless.
This move is taken as an attempt to reduce Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract the young election to the promises of cheaper apartments and to increase the burden of more earning people.
The higher treasury fees will be obliged by individuals and companies that don't pay taxes in Great Britain. Additional measures should help the government fight homelessness.
The additional fee, which is calculated in addition to the current treasury fee, including the two years ago higher rates for the second houses and the apartments purchased on rent, may be even three per cent.
The country's treasure expects that this move will even get 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents of other countries, leading to price increases and impeding the purchase of the first house or apartment.
Because many foreigners buy property and spend most time outside the country, many wealthy regions — especially the capital — have become “the cities of spirits. ”
The new rules apply only a few weeks after Boris Johnson calls for a reduction in treasure fees that would help young people buy the first home.
He accused large dewelopers of maintaining high property prices by taking the field, but not using it. He also called on May Prime Minister to lift the cheap apartment limits to eliminate the “housing scandal” in Great Britain.
Jeremy Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent regulation and the end of the execution "without reason".
He also wishes to grant local authorities greater powers to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “Latest year, I said that as the prime minister, I would rebuild the British dream that every next generation would be better than the previous.
This also means repair of our inflammated housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it's not right that those who don't live here and foreign companies can easily buy real estate here as they work hardly for British residents.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become very far away, for this humiliation related to the need for sleeping on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: “My greatest ambition is to become a Scotland selector.”
The Sunderland team coach, Jack Ross, says his "the greatest ambition" is to be a Scotland selector at a certain point.
This 40-year-old Scott is working on the healing of the North-East Club, which currently takes third place in League One with a three-point loss against the best team.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after the last season he introduced St. Mirren Club back to Scottish Premiership.
"I wanted to represent my country as a competitor,
But I only managed to get to the B personnel," said Ross in an intelligence for the BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“ As a child, I often watched the Scotland game with my father in Hampden, and it always attracted me.
However, this possibility will come only if I have a success as a coach of the club."
Among the precedents of Ross at the Coach Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Alloa Athletic claims that he does not feel discouraged by taking the role of such famous personalities in such a large club, rejecting previously proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"I will now be able to bring this club back to Prime Minister League.
Given his structure and convenience that it is available, there is no doubt his place," he adds.
"It will not be easy to do, but I will probably feel that I have been successful here, only if I can do it."
Ross' coach's career has only been three years ago, he was a coach assistant in Dumbarton, and he belonged to the Hearts Coach Team for 15 months.
Then he helped Alloa to reinvest after degrading to the third League, and in the next season, he led St. Mirren team from the edge of his succession to the championship.
Jack Ross says he now feels much more comfortable than when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real conversion point”, says Coach Alloa's position.
"I really believed that taking the team is much better than playing.
It'll sound weird, because as a player, I worked well, and I made a few measuring successes.
But playing is a heavy piece of bread.
You have to get through different situations every week.
They still meet me about the stress and pressure of the coach's work, but I feel good in this role.
I always wanted to train others, and now I do it, and I can say that at this point I feel the best place in my adult life."
The whole intelligence in Sportsound can be heard on Sunday, 30 September in the Scottland Radio between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
Studies show that the best beer pour is 5:30 a.m. on Saturday.
The summer wave of heat caused a violent inflow of customers to British pubs, but it struck in the restaurant networks.
Studies showed that the sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July, but the restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a consulting company from CGA, who developed the data, says: “The continuous heat and longer than envisaged the participation of England in the World Championships caused the results of July to be similar to the June, when the circulations in the pubs increased by 2.8 per cent, with the difference that the restoration profits fell even more.
The drop of sales in the restaurants in July 1,8 per cent increased even more.
The offering beverages and bars have made their best — their sales growth exceeded the fall recorded in restaurants.
Food pubs also suffered during heat, although not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people were just desirable.
The sale of drinks in controlled pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent this month, and the food dropped by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, a RSM analyst of the entertainment and tourism industry, says: “They are incorporated in the trend we have observed since April.
The most important factors affecting the consumption 'except home' remain weather and major sports events or social events.
The fact that the restaurant networks experience difficult times, it is not surprising, although the sales decline by 4,8 per cent compared to the previous year will have particularly relevant consequences, taking into account continuous pressures on cost reduction.
The long and hot summer came at the least useful moment for the owners of the sites who serve food and time will show whether a little more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring such needed breathing."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, taking into account these newly open, amounted to 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowness in the development of the marks.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the pubs, bars and restaurants in Great Britain, collects and analyses the performance of 47 operational groups on the total traffic of more than 9 billion pounds.
One in five children has secret accounts in social media that he hides from his parents
Studies showed that one in five children — some of them aged only 11 — has a secret account in social networks that hides from parents and teachers
A survey conducted among 20,000 students of over-base schools showed an increase in the number of Fake Insta pages
Those news have encountered fears that the contents of sexuality are published on them.
Twenty percent of the students found that they have the main account that they show to their parents
One in five children — some of them aged only 11 — provides an account in social networks that he does not disclose to adults.
The survey carried out among 20,000 students of over-based schools showed a rapid increase in the number of accounts “fake Insta” — the name refers to the Instagram service where the photos can be shared.
Those news were aware of the fear that these accounts served to publish sexual contents.
Twenty percent of the students admitted that he has a devoted “the main account ” that shows to his parents and also has private accounts.
One of the mothers, who ran into the secret side of her 13 - year - old daughter, met a teenager who instructed others to ‘ rape them. ’
The study conducted in independent schools by the UK Digital Awareness Agency and the Association of Headmasters and Headmistress Conference (HMC) showed that 40 per cent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them are awarded to maintain private accounts.
The President of the Association of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers create their places on the Internet where parents or teachers cannot find them. ”
Eilidh Doyle will be a "sports voice" in Scottish Athletics
During the annual general meeting of Scottish Athletics Eilidh Doyle, she was elected to the Board as an inexpensive director.
Eilidh Doyle is the most obliged scotch-athletic. President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who run sports to benefit from its rich international experience that she has gained in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scotland, British and World Lightweight community and we are sure that introducing it to the Board will bring great benefits to Scotland's light athletics”, said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very pleased to have the opportunity to give the Council the voice of sportsmen, and I hope I can really help to manage sports in Scotland. ”
The American, who among his four gold Olympics, has a victory at 200 and 400 meters on the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, and now regularly appears in the BBC as an expert, cannot go through a cross-blood attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said the time would show me if I could get back and how much.
It was a cabinet work, but I was fully healed, I learned to walk again, and I went back to training!
Thank you for all the words of support!"
The lactator advertising that compares mothers to cows raises extreme emotions on the Internet
The lactators produced a storm on the Internet, publishing a advertisement that compares mothers feeding breasts with cows.
In order to announce the market’s introduction of “first quiet lactator in the world to wear under clothing, ” his manufacturer, Elvie, published an excipient advertisement in the form of a telediscope, which highlights the freedom that he provides to mothers.
It presents four real mothers dancing in a sean-filled fabric for a song in which they say, "Yes, I do, but you can't see the tail" and "If you don't notice, it's not just my tits.
Refren goes: “Fill them up, pump them, feed them on, feed them, pump them, pump them, I feed my ladies. ”
The advertising, which was published on the Facebook website of the company, has caused great controversies on the Internet.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. The users express extreme opinions, many of them claim that it is inappropriate to joke with "horror", which is happening in the milk industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like humans to give milk, they must become pregnant and have a flesh, with their children taken away after a few days of their birth,” wrote one of the users.
Elvie's laktator can be noted under biustonosis for feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “It is of course traumatic for both the mother and the child.
Of course, let's use cows to advertise lactators for mothers that can stop their children."
Someone added: “This advertisement is completely distracted from reality. ”
Others with a clip weapon — one of the women claimed that the song was “funny. ”
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I kept feeding my breasts, I'd buy it.
I felt like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I'm not looking for the other day.
It's a brilliant invention," someone wrote.
Someone commented: “It is a fun advertisement directed to the mothers that distract food (often at work or toilet) and they feel like 'cows'.
It does not aim to praise or criticize the milk industry."
At the end of the movie, women were dancing with the lactators attached discreetly to their chest.
The campaign was inspired by the view that many feeding women feel like cows.
However, Elvie's laktator is completely quiet, there are no cables or pipes and you can carry it unseen under the biustonosis to feed, which gives women freedom of movement, holding children on your hands, and even leaving the house while dragging food.
Anna Balarin, a creative partner and director at Mother’s company, said: “Elvie’s lactator is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a courageous and provocative premier.
By composing women feeding and milk cows, we wanted to show all the challenges they're connecting with distractions of food, presenting also in a funny and consistent way the incredible sense of freedom that he provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's lactator hit the paper's heads.
During London Fashion Week, Marta Jacobski showed up at the race, a mother of two children with the same product.
Thousands of immigrants were secretly transferred to the tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained immigrant children is rapidly growing, although the number of people crossing the border every month does not actually change. It is partly caused by a raw retoric and the principles introduced by the administration of President Trump to make children more difficult to place children in sponsors.
Most sponsors are usually undocumented immigrants who fear the deportation exposure if they sign up for a child.
This risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that from potential sponsors and other adults living in the common household, fingerprints will be collected, which will then be transferred to immigration offices.
Last week, the senior official in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Matthew Albence, testified before the Congress that his agency has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as sponsors for children left without care.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrests had not been recorded before.
“Nearly 80 percent of those who are sponsors or live with them in one household are illegally staying in the country, and most of them are foreigners with criminal history.
That's why we're constantly pursuing them," he said to Albence.
The shelter officials say that under efforts to accelerate the situation of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, as it had happened according to the previous standards.
Many will be placed through the video conference, not in person to ask the immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who do not qualify for release will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports published in the past months, the longer children are in custody, the easier they can become anxious or depressed, which may lead to explosions of aggression or escape attempts.
The defenders found that these problems are even more serious in the case of larger centres, such as Tornillo, where because of its size, it is easier to overlook the signals that something bad happens with the child.
They also added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them an adequate time to prepare emotional preparations or to say goodbye to friends may increase the trauma that many of them already face.
Syria calls for American, French and Turkish occupational forces to immediate withdrawal
During the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister of Syria, Walid al-Moul, also called on refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in this country has lasted eight years.
The Moul, who also serves as Vice-Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are staying on the Syrian land illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and “we will judge them accordingly. ”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally”, said the Assembly.
Moulus claims that “the war against terrorism has almost ended ” in Syria, where more than 360 thousand people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says that Damascus will continue to “keep his holy battle until the territory of Syria ” is cleaned by both terrorist groups and with“ all foreigners living illegally on it. ”
At present, there are about 2,000 American soldiers in Syria who are mainly training Kurdian forces and Syrians opposing President Bassar al-Asad and advising them.
Furthermore, more than 1,000 French soldiers are located in the destruction country.
With regard to refugees, Moul concluded that the conditions are sufficiently good to get back, and accused “some Western countries ” of“ incentive of unbalanced fear, ” which disturbs them to return.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help in these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing things that should be cleanly human."
The United States and the European Union warned that until the President of Assad concludes the opposition of the political agreement to end the war, Syria won't receive any help to rebuild.
The United Nations diplomats say that the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large bastion of rebels in Idlib created the possibility of continuing political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has helped to prevent the great attack of Syrian forces supported by Russia from a province in which three million people live.
However, Moul emphasized that the treaty has a “clear time frame” and hoped that the military action will be targeted in the Džihadists, including fighters with the Al-Qaida Front of the Defence of the Levant People, who will be “eliminated”.
The UN Ambassador, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of the new committee composed of the members of the Governing Party and the opposition to develop a sketch of the Syrian military constitution and to prepare for elections.
Moulem stressed the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Commission, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to “verifying the records of the current Constitution” and warned against ingerence.
Why Trump wins the elections again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected in 2020 for a second mandate, unless, as he is likely hoping for many liberal observers, his president will sooner end with the removal of office and scandal.
It would, of course, be “the most dramatic final of the president. ”
As far as there are no signs of tired sights.
Since 2014, the CNN channel's performance has doubled and reached 1.05 million viewers, and the MSNBC channel has almost tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nelsen Fox News, it attracts 2,4 million viewers at the highest watch hours, which is an increase from 1.7 million from four years ago, and the MSNBC programme “The Rachel Maddow Show” has reached the highest results among cable TVs, attracting up to 3.5 million visitors of the evening information programs.
"The people fly like smoke to fire -- this is something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, the chief producer of the ABC series "Designated Survivor" on the Secretary of the Bureau, who becomes president after the attack on Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian creator and author of the book Only the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking In the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
It recalls that before the 2016 elections, she took a cab in Boston.
The driver said he'd vote for Trump.
“Why? ” she asked.
“ Because it makes me laugh, ” he answered.
"Chaos has a fun value."
Of course, reports from Washington could as well as nothing else showed on TV could judge the future of Roe v. Wade, the affiliation of immigrant families or the state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Furthermore, it is not only to be a well-informed citizen when you watch a panel of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward's secret informants during the writing of the book “Fear” on Paul Manfort's jacket from the Struss' skin for $15,000 (the clothes of overloaded pride), as described in the Washington Post) or on the effects of shocking the details of President Trump's anatomy revealed by Storm Daniels.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario like before.
"What he does, partly looks like reality show in this regard that every evening provides new contents," said Brent Montgomery, Director-General Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of the Pawn Stars, changing the observation and daily returns to the Trump show (as an attack on the NFL League players or the praise of Kim Jong Una).
You can't afford to miss the segment because you're going to have a lot of interest.
When I met Mike Fleiss this week, the weather on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, where he had his home, was beautiful, but he was sitting in the middle, watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from this, not when Brett Kavanaugh was standing right before the Senate Court Commission and the future of the Supreme Court was evaluated.
"I remember how we used to do all these crazy programs and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right."

Money flow from outside to campaign to Congress
It is not surprising that after the reorganization of the electoral circuits, which has resulted in a single position now two congressmen now officials, to the 17th electoral district in Pennsylvania, a river of cash flows.
This recently created Pittsburgh County represents the representative of the Democratic, Conor Lamb, who gained his place in another district during the special elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, the Republican Keith Rothfus, presently representing the 12th district in Pennsylvania, which is largely covered by the new circle 17.
The circuit maps were corrected after the January judgment of the Supreme Pennsylvania Court, which decided that the old circles were imposed inappropriately, which was the advantage of the Republicans and was incompatible with the Constitution.
The race in the new circuit 17 began with the fight to finance the campaign between the main funding authorities of the Party — the Commissions of Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamba's name was popular in Pennsylvania after the winning of hair in the widely commented elections until 18th electoral district held in March.
The Republican has been in this position for over a decade, and Donald Trump won 20 points in this circle.
Political experts gave the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered Salvador's punishment for supporting China, but they resigned from this idea.
The diplomats noticed that Dominican and Panama already recognized Beijing, despite a light opposition to Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a heartfelt meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varella, and until the exile by the partners of the Trump Organization, he had a hotel in Panama.
The officials of the State Department decided to cancel the heads of the US diplomatic missions from Salvador, Dominican and Panama for “the recent decision to stop recognition of Taiwan”, as she said in her statement of this month, the Department Advocate Heather Nauert.
However, the examinations were to be imposed only on Salvador, which, according to the estimates in 2017, received $140 million from the United States, including the aid for drugs and the support of development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions that were to cover the restrictions of financial assistance and granting visas to certain persons would be very affective for this Central American country that fights a large unemployment and a high rate of murder.
As the progress made in international meetings, the officials of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference to address the proposals of a similar gathering last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from moving to the United States.
In the mid-September, the High-level Administration officials clearly stated that they wanted the conference to take place, thus putting all considerations on sanctions against Salvador.
The diplomats say that now, at the conference, which is currently scheduled for half October, Vice-President Mike Pence is going to be an invitation to the meeting of the representatives of the administration.
Three American messengers returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and Dominican. No new raw communications or punishment from Washington.
John Bolton's rapporteur from the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate, which were presented by three American officials, including two diplomats, who, provided the provision of anonymity, agreed to discuss internal relations.
Their relations were confirmed by an external analyst from the administrative environment, who also expressed anonymously.
Learn History
Another element can be the report of the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible impairment of justice action by President Trump, which is now specific evidence available publicly.
According to reports, the investigation of Robert Mueller also examined whether the Donald Trump campaign had something to do with the Russian attack on American elections.
If the Congress is changed, the President Trump will be responsible for preparing for the re-enterment of the voters, or may even be judged in front of the jury.
There are a lot of unknowns here and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or the people in equal positions in Europe, is inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of Atlantic, which will decide how long it can take.
In 1938, the German officers were willing to strike the state against Hitler, if only the West would resist him and support Czechoslovakia in Monach.
It failed, and we lost the possibility of avoiding the years of cutting that happened after that.
History wheels turn around such reverse points, accelerateing or slowing the inevitable democracy.
There's a few of these reverse points in front of the Americans now.
What do we do if Donald Trump releases the Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who depends on the future of the investigation of Robert Mueller?
Rosenstein's been in trouble since we discovered in our newspaper that he proposed a secret recording of the president last year and speculated that he was not suitable for this office.
According to Rosenstein, the relationship presented by the Times is incompetent.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation on Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or unfair or if it is appointed to Judge the Supreme Court, despite the reliable accusations of sexual assault and false testimony on him?
And first of all, will we choose in the middle of the presidential office to the Congress those who will bring Donald Trump to responsibility?
If we don't get through these trials, democracy will be difficult times.
However, I believe that we can do this because of the lesson I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took my residential ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light sabass candles on that table designed by swasti.
With such heritage, how could I not look at the future optimisticly?"

Rangers Club player, Graham Dorrans, with optimism awaits a game with Rapid Vienna team
Rangers take Vienna Rapid on Thursday with awareness that the victory with the Austrians, obtained after the improving remission from the Villareal achieved this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances to qualify from the G League of Europe.
Until remiss 2:2 from Villareal knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes that the result will work on the Rangers as a trampoline for greater success.
"It's good for us because Villarreal is in good shape," said a 31-year-old.
“We went to this game with faith that we could achieve something — and we fought the point.
Maybe at the end, we could still push them, but generally, the remiss is probably a fair result.
The Spanish were probably better in the first half, but in the second, we were better.
With regard to Thursday, this is another important evening for Europe.
We hope that we can get three points, but this game will be difficult, because our opponent has obtained good results in his last match, but I'm sure that by supporting the kibbits we'll go through and that and fight a positive result.
Last year, it was definitely hard because of all my injury and changes in the club itself, but now we all feel well in our places.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we can move on, leave the last season behind and make success."
Fear for pension savings spends dreams to women from eternity
Although people involved in the survey knew exactly how they wanted to take care of them, few talked about it with their family.
In a study carried out by the Nationwide, about half of the participants found that she was talking to her husband about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they were talking about this with the kids.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the Nationwide selling life insurance.
Where do you start?
Talk to your husband and children: You will not prepare your family to care for yourself if you do not express your will sooner.
With your consultant and your family, discuss where and how you want you to be cared for, because this choice will be an important factor in determining your costs.
Ask for help from the financial advisor: He may help find a way to pay for these expenditures.
Long-term care funds may come from a traditional policy to such hybrid policy that allows you to pay cash to cover such expenditure or from your own assets, if you have it.
Prepare legal documents: You will avoid this trial.
Design a trusted healthcare officer who will supervise and ensure that appropriate persons proceed according to your will if the communication becomes impossible.
Consider also the employment of a supervisor who will deal with finances.
Choose a trusted person, because it will make financial decisions for you and ensure that all the accounts are paid if you can't do this on your own.
Do not forget details: Imagine that your parents, aged age, suddenly need medical assistance and are just going to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
You can write all the information to make it ready.
“ It's not just funding, it's about what the doctors are, ” says Martin.
"What drugs are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
It's worth having this plan."

Earth earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that visited the Indonezian city of Palu on Friday. The number of victims will probably increase.
Because of a broken communication, the rescueers failed to get any information from Donggala's capulet, which is north of Palo, near the earthquake epicentre of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from the Pale’s disaster.
Here are some of the most important information about the city of Palu and the Donggala couch on the island Celebes:
The Palu is the capital of the Central Celebes, the province located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island. According to estimates in 2017, it was 379 800 people.
When the earthquake and tsunami arrived, the 40th anniversary of his assumption was held in the city.
Donggala is a cabupaten (administrative unit below the province) stretching along the north-west coast of the island for more than 300 km.
It is estimated that 299 200 people were residents in 2017.
The main branches of the Central Celebes economy are fisheries and agriculture, which have developed particularly in the coast of Donggala's coast.
Other sources of provincial income are mines of niklu, but they are mainly in Morvali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to the Indoneian Agency for the Elimination of Events of Catastrof in the past 100 years of earthquake and tsunami visited Pala and Donggal several times.
In 1938, tsunami that hit Donghala killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
In 1996, nine people died as a result of tsunami in the west Donggali.
Indonesia is located on the active Pacific ring of fire, and the earthquakes are very regularly there.
The largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake, which visited the western coast of the Aceh province in the north of Sumatra, caused tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, from which over half in Aceh.

This time, the tsunami wave didn't come up, but the bullshit buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: The large earthquakes have visited the tourist island of Indonesia, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on its north side.
They caused thousands of homes to be destroyed and brought temporary problems to thousands of tourists.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested under the charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and the candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested under charge of attack.
According to the report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers from Vasilla's 29-year-old town on Alasca, he was arrested with domestic violence charges, disruption of reporting and resistance against arrest.
According to the police report when a suspect's friend tried to call the police to file a notice of crime, he took her phone.
The KTUU station states that Palin is being arrested by an investigator Matt-Su and has a set bail of $500.
According to her information last Saturday, he stood before the court, where in his defence language, he said he was “probably innocent. ”
There are three pregnancies in the Gorina class A, which means that he can receive a sentence even for a year of prison and $250,000 fines.
He was also accused of the offence of class B, for which the penalty of the Day of Prison and the penalty of $2000 was threatened.
It's not the first time the Gorin has been charged with penalties.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is now in front of the Alaska court for veteran's claims.
In January 2016, domestic violence was accused, disruption of the reporting and possession of weapons in an immediate state in connection with this incident.
His partner says he hit her face.
In 2016, the veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin, who linked the aggressive behavior of her son to the post-traumatic stress team that he gained during the Iraq ministry.
Thousands of people have died due to tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by the Friday earthquake that violated the Indonezian island Celebes.
The earthquake of 7.5 degrees caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication are not working and the number of victims is expected to grow in the coming days.
The earthquake appeared near the centre of Celebes Island, which is located north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Jacarda.
In the social media, films are circulating the moment of disaster.
When tsunami hit the coast, on the beach in Palo, where the festival was held, there were hundreds of people.
Federal Prosecutors demand death penalty for a suspect of a terrorist attack in New York.
The federal prosecutors in New York demand death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York, resulting from eight deaths, which is a rare punishment, has not been committed in this state for federal crime since 1953.
For the attack that took place in October on the bikeway along the West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan, Saipov seemed to have used the rented home Depot truck, which he broke the walkers and bikemen on his way.
According to the Southern District of New York, the notification of the intention of demanding death penalty to justify its need, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious injuries.
According to the judicial document, both of these charges are threatened with death.
Several weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Justice presented the Act of Prosecution to Saipov incorporating 22 positions, including eight charges of murder under illegal activity, which is a procedure used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to prosecutors, the organizing of the attack required “a solid planning and thinking, ” the way Saipov carried it, was defined as“ monstrous, cruel and immoral. ”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has brought injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandra Damian Pagnucca” – states the intention notification.
Five of the victims were the citizens of Argentina who were tourism in New York.
The last time the death penalty in the southern district of New York was incurred ten years ago.
The accused Khalid Barnes was considered guilty of killing two drug dealers, but finally in September 2009 he heard the sentence of life.
The death penalty was last executed in New York in 1953 at Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The marriage was lost after two years earlier they were considered guilty of conspiracy and spying for the Soviet Union during the cold war.
Both Rosenbergs were lost on the electric chair on June 1953.
According to the court documents of Saipov, which originates from Uzbekistan, he has not demonstrated his conscience in months after the attack.
The police say he told the investigator he was feeling good with what he did.
According to the Act of Prosecution, Saipov admitted to the authorities that the ISIS films that he watched on the phone were inspired to the attack.
According to the police, the ISIS flag was also required to hang in his hospital room.
In the case of a 22 charges, he's innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defenders from the office representing Saipov, said that they were "for obvious reasons disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to require death penalty and to reject life without the possibility of earlier release after confession will only extend the suffering that these events have led to all interested persons," he said.
The Saipov defense team asked the prosecutors earlier not to ask for a death penalty.
The toris parliamentary said that NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for the Brexite negotiations
During today’s protest, which took place during the toris conference, Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the army of the people. ”
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) said that politicians must "sense hot" from eurosceptics, when one of the parliamentists of Theresy May suggested that he should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
Deputy of the Conservatives, Peter Bone, told the protestants in Birmingham that if Farage was a Secretary for Brexit, “United Kingdom would have already been outside the Union. ”
However, the integration of the toriss opposing remaining in the community to a separate protest against Brexit, which was held in the city, further emphasized the burden of the task of conforming its deeply divided series before Theresa May.
The Prime Minister has hardly tried to achieve its plan for compromise from Chequers among the attacks of the Brexit constituents, his opponents, as well as the European Union itself.
Her allies argue that, despite objections, she will seek to conclude a contract with Brussels and force Eurosceptics and labourists to choose between its proposal and the chaos.
Peter Bone told Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "flip the plan out of Chequers".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should be the authority to be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had taken care of this, we'd be out of the Union now," he said.
The Deputy of Wellingborough added: “I support Brexit, but we must throw out the plan from Chequers. ”
In presenting his opposition to the European Union, he said: “It is not why we fought in world wars to be subjected to anyone now.
We want to establish our rights in our own country."
Peter Bone rejected the suggestion that citizens had changed their opinion since the vote in 2016: “The thought that the British had changed their mind and wanted to remain in the Union is completely false.”
The demonstration was also supported by Brexit Andrea Jenkins from the Toriss Party, who told the reporters: “I'm just saying, Madam Prime Minister, please listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not satisfied with the general support, the opposition will not vote on it, our party or our activists, who are allocating the streets and who have chosen us, also do not support it.
Leave the plan from Chequers and start listening."
In a statement addressed to the Prime Minister of May, she added: “The premises keep their positions when they keep their promises. ”
Nigel Farage concluded that politicians involved in the demonstration must “sense hot” if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“It is now a matter of confidence between us — the people — and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them "We won't let you do this."
Turning to the distracted crowd, he added: “I want you to make politicians who are on the edge of Brexit’s treason feel hot.
"We mobilize the army of the people of this country that gave us a victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom."
At that time, the opponents of Brexit marched through the city to the center, where a two - hour demonstration was held.
The activist's bunker was waving "Toriss v. Brexit" after the group was created this weekend.
The Laburist Activist, Baron Andrew Adonis, laughed at conservants for the security of the party application at the beginning of the conference.
"There are people who claim that they can organize information systems and all technology to support the Canadian plan plus, liquid border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete ferry.
There's nothing like a good Brexit," he added.

According to The Boston Globe, the representative of the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke of her future during the meeting with the voters held on Saturday in the West Massachusetts.

Arrest a mortal shooter in which the LSU team player, Wayde Sims died
The Baton Rouge Police in Louisiana informed the suspect's arrest on the Friday Shooting in which a basketballman in LSU, Wayde Sims, died.
The police department in Baton Rouge informed the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson during the conference that took place at 11:00 a.m.
On Friday, a shooting record was published with a request for help in identifying a man on it.
Two-four-year-old Wayde Sims died from a shot near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot from a firearm in his head, and he died," said the media head, Murphy J. Paul, according to the 247sports service.
Wayde stood in the defense of a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted he was at the crime scene, had a gun with him and shot Wayne.
After the detention that he did not resist, he was transferred to arrest at the East Baton Rouge County Department.

Grand Prix Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team's command enabled him to win with Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the Mercedes team's command will have a great impact on the race.
Bottas, who started from the first field, started very well and almost beat Hamilton, defending his position in the first two circles and forced Vettel to attack his colleague from the team.
Vettel went to the service point first and let Hamilton ride in the tail of the peleton, which should decide on the fate of the race.
Mercedes's competitor went to the box in the next circle and appeared behind Vettel, but after a round round, in which the Ferrari driver unwillingly left the internal part of the track, risking the defense after a double rival movement to defend the position on the third turn, Hamilton went to drive.
Max Verstappen launched from the end of the rate and at his 21th birthday at the end of the first circle he found himself in the seventh place.
He then led a large part of the race because he did not change the tyre to perform a fast finish and take the fourth position to Kimi Raikkonen.
Finally, he went to the 44th circle, but in the remaining eight circles he couldn't speed up.
"It was a tough day, because all the weekend Valtteri was doing a great job and turned out to be a gentleman when he was told to let me go.
The whole team has given everything to take two first places," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad speech of the body.
During the meeting that took place on Saturday, President Donald Trump screwed up from Senator Diana Feinstein, who claimed that she did not disclose the contents of a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which she accused the judge of the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in Western Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the testimony made by Christina Ford before the Commission of the Senatu for Justice. Instead, he found that what happened in the Senate showed that people were “looking, malicious and liar”.
"What could have happened was one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate, which we have witnessed for a few days when we see anger, when we see people who are angry, wicked, wicked and liarful," he said.
"We see what was published and revealed, and then they tell us 'oh, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianno Feinstein, did you disclose that?
Remember her answer... did you disclose the contents of this document? -- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't tell her."
Wait, wait, wait.
We have revealed... No, we have not revealed," he added, cutting the Senator.
Diana Feinstein received a letter from Christine Ford with a description of the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and his content came out at the beginning of September. The Senator denies as if the source of the excursion was her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's insinuation, I didn't reveal her history," Feinstein told the Commission, as the newspaper The Hill reports.
"She asked me for discretion, and according to her request, I did not disclose these contents."
However, her statement was not convinced by the president who commented so during the Saturday meeting: “I tell you, it was really a bad speech of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing the defense of the candidate to the judge of the Supreme Court, whom three women accused of sexual abuse, the President suggested that the Democrats are using insinuations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take power by all means.
It appears to be violent, evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to destroy in order to take power and control," said the President according to the mediaite service.

The giants quickly gained a two-door advantage on the shots of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownies have equipped the result, and then Dwyer revoked the Giants to drive.
Francois Bouchard re-equipped the result by gaining naked for the Dundee team, and then two gates shot by Lucas Lundvald Nelsen sealed her victory.

The air traffic controller is dying, helping hundreds of people in the plane escape from earthquake
Indonezian air traffic controller was screamed by the hero after he died, helping the plane safely launch with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people died, and many were considered missing after a large earthquake that hit the Indonezian island Celebes on Friday, causing tsunami.
There are still strong secondary shakes in the area. In the city of Palu, many have been imprisoned in grudges.
Although his colleagues fled, saving his life, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in a disrupted tower of flight control at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palo.
He remained there to make sure that the Batik Air Air Air Air (lot number 6321), which was just on the starting belt, was safely launched.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he seemed to have crashed.
He died in the hospital.
According to the Australian station ABC News, an air navigation advocate of Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the controller's decision was likely to save lives to hundreds of people.
We organized a helicopter from Ballipapan to Borneo to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthony left this morning before the helicopter arrived in the Palo.
“ This message broke our hearts, ” he added.
However, the authorities are afraid that the number of death victims can reach thousands. The National Agency for the Elimination of the Effects of Disasters informs that the possibility of reaching the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"We believe that death harvest is still increasing, because many bodies are still under burdens and cannot reach them," said the prosecutor of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Agency.
Six metres of waves of tsunami destroyed the Palu, where the mass funeral of the victims will be held on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to the Sky News station: “The ambulances are constantly importing bodies.
It's starting to miss drinking water.
Small shops are slittered."
John Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said CNN: “Indonezian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we don’t know what we're going to do.
It's a tragedy, and it may be even worse."
On Sunday to Palo arrived the President of Indonesia, Joko Video, who turned to the army: “Please all of you to work day and night to perform all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
This year, Indonesia has already encountered the earthquake that killed more than 550 people on the island of Lombok.
Air Niugini airline catastrophe in Micronesia indicates that one person is missing after the plane crashed on the lagoon
The airlines that have broken down on the lagune in Micronesia in the Pacific informed that one person was missing and earlier claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the drowning plane.
Air Niugini informed that, according to the data on Saturday afternoon, one man who traveled by a ferral plane could not be arrived.
They assured the local authorities, hospitals and investigators that they were trying to find him.
However, they did not give an immediate response to requests for additional details on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane hit the water while trying to land on the island of Chuuk, the other passengers and crew members were helping local ships.
The officials informed on Friday that seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airlines said that there were still six passengers in the hospital on Saturday, all stable.
It's not clear what caused the catastrophe.
The airlines and the United States military marine claim that the aircraft landed on the lagoon near the launch band.
According to some witnesses, he fell out of the belt.
The American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was very low.
“ This helped us very much, ” he said.
Jaynes said he managed to get through the water to get out of an emergency airplane.
He said that the members of the board personnel paniced and screamed, and he himself had a harmless head injury.
The U.S. Navy war informed that in the rescue action, satellite seafarers who worked nearby on the modernization of the coast, and they managed to transport people to the shore before the plane drowned to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network database in the last two decades in aircraft disasters registered in Papua New Guinea, there are 111 people who have died, but there is no Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructed events from the night when a woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecutor ended the presentation of evidence in the re-process of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Analyst from the American Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, has been testifying for many hours as an expert on information analysis.
He described the judges using cell phone records he reproduced the route of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
According to Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he had obtained data from the location of various cell phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers on the ferral evening.
When the data confirmed that at the time when Quinton was going to stay with his friend, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to interview Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified he wasn't in town that day.
On the question of whether Tellis was telling the truth, saying that he was at Sanford’s truck that night, he answered that “he lied because my truck was in Nashville. ”
Another incompleteness is Tellis' claim that he knew Chambers for about two weeks.
Mobile phone registries showed that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed her contact data from the phone, as well as SMSs and connections.
“ He removed it from his life, ” he said.
The final defense talk is to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that the same day the case would probably be transferred to the jury.

The creation of artists such as Akala and Lowkey has recently been observed in Great Britain as regeneration of artists such as The Fugees or Common.
Another black?!
Nanny from New York suits a couple for release after "racist" SMS
Nanny from New York suits a couple for dismissing her from a racist work after getting the wrongly addressed SMS, in which the mother of the child complains that she is a “never another black person”.
The couple denies as if they were racists, comparing the lawsuit to the “shanting. ”
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly concentrated when the new guardian, Giselle Maurice, who was on the first day of work in 2016, was black skin.
“NEE, A BLACK PEOPLE”, she wrote to her husband in a message.
But instead of sending him to him, she sent him to Ms. Maurice twice by mistake.
According to the New York Post newspaper, when Plasco-Flaxman realized that the gaffa was done, the “crupted ” released Gisella Maurice, claiming that the hearty nanny, who is African American, had been wrong with her duties and was expected to be a nanny from Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice received the pay for the day of work, and then sent her home by Uber.
Now it requires a pair of compensation for the release of $350 daily multiplied for six months, for which it was initially employed with residentiality, although she has not signed the contract.
"I want to show them that it's not doing such things," she said to Post on Friday and added "I know it's discrimination."
The couple renounces racism, claiming that the collaboration with Ms. Maurice was justified, because after she was offended, they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her.
“My wife sent something to her that she was not going to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said the Postman, Joel Plasco.
“Would you trust your children to the person you have made a regret, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
Come on."
In comparison with the lawsuit with “shanting, ” Plasco said that his wife was born just two months earlier and was in “very difficult situation. ”
"Do you intend to blow up something like that?
This is not too nice," added the investment banker.
Although the case in court has not yet ended, the public opinion quickly condemned a few social media, criticizing it for its behaviour and way of thinking.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of the Paddington books feared that readers would not feel the relationship with the speaking mice
The author’s daughter, Michael Bonda, Karen Jankel, who was born soon after a warm book, says: “It’s hard to stand in the place of a person who read it for the first time, even before the book was published.
Now it's very funny that we already know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
She claims that her father, who, before a little blister inspired him to write a book for children, worked as a camera at the BBC, was sure that his work would be rejected, and adds that after his death last 60th anniversary of the book appears to be “sweet and bitter”.
About Paddington, described as “a very important member of our family, ” she says that her father was secretly proud of his success.
“ He was a quiet man, he was not cheerful, ” he adds.
"But because Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who has achieved something -- you feel proud of him, even though it's not your credit.
I think Paddington's success has seen more than that.
Although he made it up and created it himself, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After her daughter landed, she was moved to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nicea, where doctors tried to save her life for nothing.
"Nad called regularly and said it was really bad, that he probably won't get out of it," says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then he called to say that Natasha will die in two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors administered to maintain the heart attack slowly stopped and were expelled from the body.
She died a while earlier, and it was the end of all.
I could only sit down and wait with awareness that all this has grown.
I couldn't scream or scream because I was among other people.
I really had to stick with it."
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who was already mourning the loss of her daughter, entered the ship along with other passengers, unconscious of what torture she was going through.
“No one knew, ” she said.
I had a head down, and my tears were all the time flowing.
It's hard to explain, but in the plane, I felt an incredible compassion for Nada.
I felt she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women's postcards in mourning should help prevent suicide from a bridge
Two women whose loved ones commit suicide are trying to distract others from their intention to take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are placed on the Welsh bridge with inspiring news and phone numbers under which people can get help.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he was depressed.
“ I don’t want any parents to feel the way I feel every day, ” she says.
A 45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, tells her son was a good cook of infective smile.
"Everyone knew his smile.
They always said that they could light it up every room."
But before he died, he quit his work because he was “in a really black place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother was 11 years old and he was the one who found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of the dominant effect."
Sharon Davis created cards, “to tell people that there are people to whom you can contact and whom you can talk to, even if they are only friends.
Don't sit in silence, talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, soon after her mother died, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years.
He says: “Nothing he said he feels awkward, sad or something. ”
“A few days before God’s Christmas, we noticed the change in his conduct.
On Christmas, he was already in a complete hole, and when the kids opened the presents, he didn't even look at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “It is a hole in the family.
He's breaking us off.
But we must continue to live and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is hanging in Italy because the FBI is initiating an investigation.
"I thought that if we were really able to get what he asked -- the investigation limited timely and limited -- maybe we could achieve some unanimity," Jeff Flake said on Saturday, and he added that he was afraid that the committee was "depreciated" to the opposite camps that led to impase.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republicans want to investigate the FBI?
They're not willing to come from a moment.
The elections to the Congress are within a few weeks - 6 November. If the Republicans lose them, the chances of selecting a person to the Supreme Court in the country are significantly reduced.
George W. Bush has already raised the phone to call the Senators and encourage them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House and met his wife, Ashley, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens when the feds report?
The Senate, in which 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting, will be voted.
It's not sure if Brett Kavanaugh gets at least 50 votes of Senators, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the impasse and bring it to the Supreme Court.
Under the Governments Kima, the number of refugees from North Korea declines
According to the South Korean legislator since seven years ago, Kim Jong Un took power, and the number of people fled from North Korea to Southern has fallen.
By quoting the data from the South Korean Ministry of the United States, the Byeong-seug Park said that 1127 escapes were recorded last year, and in 2011 - 2706.
He believes that the key factors that have affected this situation are more precise checks on the borders between Northern Korea and China and the higher rates taken by human traffickers.
Pjongjang has not issued a public statement in this regard.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea is finally proposed by the citizenship of South Korea.
According to the authorities in Seul since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 Koreans from the North have illegally crossed the border.
Most are running through China, which have the longest border with North Korea, which makes it easier to cross it than closely protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers refugees illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often send them back to the country.
Relations between the North and the South, which theoretically are still in war, have been clearly improved over the past months.
This month, the leaders of both countries met in Pjongjang, where they talked about the denuclearisation negotiations that had previously stood in a dead point.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Jong Un, which was held in June in Singapore, and the result of this meeting is a general agreement on the purification of the Korean Half of Nuclear Weapons.
However, on Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of lack of progress in this matter.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security, and in these circumstances, there is no way that we can disarma ourselves as the first," said Ri in the talk he made before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Kavanaugha "historic" and claims that he is not suitable to work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the Representation Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Brett Kavanaugh Court "historic" and said that it is not in nature to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed these words during the interview she shared on Saturday during Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I think that if a woman acted like this, she would be considered "historic," Pelosi said to her reaction to the testimony that Kavanaugh made on Thursday before the Commission of the Senatu for Justice.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusations of the apparent sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In a minute during his preliminary speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions — almost screaming and losing his speech when he discussed family and high school years.
He also clearly chased the Democrats from the Commission, determining the pregnancy charges of “grotesk and coordinated attack on reputation” organized by the Liberals that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi concluded that Kavanaugh’s testimony indicated that it was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court, since it revealed his prejudice to the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself by making these statements, as well as by the way he attacked Clintons and Democrats," she said.
She asked if she would have tried to cancel Kavanaugh from the office if he had received a nomination and if the Democrats had won most of the Representation Chamber, Pelosi had hesitated.
"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also serve in the court in which he is currently working," she said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the circuit appeal court in Colombia.
Pelosi added that as Democratic is afraid of Kavanaugh's possible judgments on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade process, because he is considered a conservative judge.
During a confirming case, Kavanaugh has overlooked the question whether he would dismiss some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time to introduce a hysterical court, a preliminary person who would expect us to say "but it's wonderful," he added to Pelosi.
And women have to control her.
It's a good diatribe, months and years of anger, and she can't throw it out of her without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"It's pretty common, isn't it?"
She added: “A woman who was a manager in a company, she said that she was crying when she was mad, but she came up in a way that when she was nervous and crying, she said to the person with whom she was talking 'Surely you think I am sad because I cry.
I'm mad.
And he keeps doing his own.
I thought it was brilliant."
The tears are permitted as part of anger because they are basically misconducted.
One of my most apparent memories of one of the first jobs in a man’s office was how I began crying out of inexplicable anger.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're happy to have you baked."
Patricia Schroeder from the Democratic Party, then deputy to Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a lover on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the race, frustrated to Patricia's borders, she realized that she could actually consider the idea of self-charge for the president.
“It was not a thoughtful decision, ” she said, laughing, 30 years later.
“Seven other candidates have already become elections and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone has described this situation as "The Queen of Snow and Seven Pigeons."
Since the campaign has lasted for a long time, Schroeder has been in the gathering of funds and has promised not to race if she doesn't collect two million dollars.
It was a battle condemned to lose.
She then discovered that some of her servants, who gave the men $1,000, had only 250 for her.
“ Do they think I have any discounts? ” she wondered.
During the talk she announced that she was not going to run a formal campaign, she was so full of emotions — appreciation for those who supported her, frustration because of a system that has so hardened the collection of money and calling to voters, not delegates, and anger to sexism — that the voice had bound her in her throat.
“I can think that I've been through a nervous breakthrough, ” says the press reactions.
"You can think I'm sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember wondering what they're gonna write on my grave.
"Was she crying?"
What benefits can Beijing have the economic war between the United States and China
The salvies that have initiated the economic war between the United States and China have been deaf and while the battle still continues, the conflict between these countries may be useful for Beijing, the experts say.
First warning was fired this year by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, imposed duties on key export goods of China, including sunny panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week after the introduction of new customs rates for goods worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds) resulted in the taxation of half of all goods that are coming to the United States from China.
Every time Beijing regained himself in nature, receiving recent duty to US goods worth $60 billion from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every US strike, and it does not seem that the second economy in the world will soon fall back.
Forceing Washington to withdraw means accepting demands, but public decline in front of the United States would be too disturbing for President China, Xi Jinping.
However, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards well, the US trade war pressure could in a long way strengthen China, reducing the relationship between the two economys.
“The fact that a fast political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the disturbance of economic chaos in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than the observers have already been granted," said Abigail Grace, a researcher in Asia in the mind of the Center for New American Security tank.
According to the Foreign Minister, Syria is ready to return refugees
The government claims that Syria is ready for a voluntary return of refugees, and asks for help in rebuild the country destroyed in the result of over seven-year war.
In his speech before the General Assembly, the UN Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid al-Moul, stated that the conditions in the country were improved.
"The situation in our field is now stable and safer through progress in combating terrorism," he said.
In order to restore normality, the government is rebuilding areas destroyed by terrorists all the time.
All the conditions for refugees who have had to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic moves targeted in their daily life and maintenance measures have already been fulfilled so that they can voluntarily return to it.
According to the UN estimates, more than 5.5 million citizens have left Syria since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to receive assistance in rebuilding the destruction of the destruction country.
However, he emphasized that he would not accept the aid provided by the conditions or offered by the countries who sponsored the rebellion.
Europe seals the Rider Cup victory in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 by defeating the US team by 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National field in Paris.
In the European country, the United States has already lost six times in a row, and since 1993 they have not won Ryder Cup in Europe.
Europe restored the trophy when under the leadership of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn gained 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who most of the tournament didn't work well, hit the ball from the base right into the water of the 16th PAR3, giving Francesc Molinari match.
The Italian golfist Molinari shineed through all rounds and became one of the four players, who since 1979, when the first time this tournament took place in the current format, the result was 5-0-0.
The American Jordan Spieth was eliminated by the 5&4 lowest classified in the European player ranking, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the highest position in the world's ranking, lost two holes before the last hole with the Englishman Ian Poulter, for whom it may have been the last Ryder Cup tour.
The European with the largest number of wins in Ryder Cup was Spain Sergio Garcia, who had already participated in eight of these tournaments and gained 25.5 points of career.
“I usually don't cry, but I can't stop myself today.
It was a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas that he believed in me and chose me.
I'm so glad to get the copper back.
This is the success of the entire team and I am glad I could help," said the excited Garcia after the victory of the team from Europe.
He gives a stick to his cousin, John Rahm, who defeated a single American golf legend on Sunday, Tiger Woods, as a result of 2&1.
"I feel amazing proud of winning with Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all the games in France and now has the results of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
It's an unprecedented statistics, like one of the biggest players of all times, who got 14 most important titles and only departed to Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team had all week's problems with tracking, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing American composition, his captain, Jim Furyk, said: “I am proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point, this morning we pressed some Europeans.
We're back.
The hats from the head before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really good.
We will change the group. Together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way to move forward.
I love those 12 guys, and I'm proud I can be their captain.
I'm full of admiration for the opponents.
They played a lot better than us."
