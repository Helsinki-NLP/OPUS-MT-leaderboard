The newman helped Trabzonsspor to the second place, and the Scotch also hit
Defense Philip Novak helped goals in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonsspor to the title of vice-minister.
His team won 2:1 at the Kayserisspor field and kept the third Besiktas behind him.
The attacker Milan Scoda gave the tenth gate from Slavia after the January offence of the Rizespor, which was saved, even though he fell 1:3 on the Fenerbahca field.
The new man confirmed the productivity of the seventh goal in this league year on the defense.
In the 63th minute, the Kayserisporu golman just launched a strong shot and the Czech footballist in the corner burned the ball into the grid.
The homemade managed five minutes before the end, but Trabsonspor in the sixth minute of the setting, took off the victory on his side when he successfully finished the four-to-one.
The damage in the introduction of the second halftime of the struggle with Fenerbahca balanced by salt to 1:1.
Although the dispute had not held the undecided state for long, it was not necessary to regret it, because the results of the rivals remained three points above the departure zone.
The competition ends the Sunday duel of the Master Basaksehir at the Kasimpass field.
A well hidden cave in the forests in New Bor was actually not a resident.
In the northern Czech underground of the Lužic Mountains, near the New Bor, in the forests led by the County Road, are hiding several sand rock offices.
Natural and artificially created.
And we'll go behind the human hand created.
The place is called the cave in the desert.
But in fact, there was never a desert who lived here, and the cave served as a shelter, more precisely hiding chamber on grain.
The cave is removed from the side to the rock caution and accessible upstairs.
Nevertheless, it is practically not seen until the last moment.
It will be delivered to the tight stairs leading to some rock gallery from where it is just entering the rock.
Although the chamber seemed to be far away from human habitats, it could have been on the upper surface where the forest is today, the field.
"The fact that the object has no window and not in the traditional place of the location of the tower, clearly proves that there is no desert who could ever survive the winter," explains historian Camille Podrožek from the Philosophy Faculty of Jan Evangelist Purkina in Usto over Labe.
Single space object only has a stone lamb in the back, which apparently serves for disposal of vessels.
"I see it as a room to store some food or products from the field," Camille Puzzle adds.
There are signs of tools on the cave walls.
Breaking the sand with a peak was pretty simple and fast for the dedicated.
All you had to do was use the sparres properly and the sand is gradually breaking.
According to the length of the track after the peak and at all the shaving methods, the period of cave can be defined in a framework.
According to history, it's probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible, and according to the mess that appears in it, there are sometimes sleeping in today’s day.
If you approach the cave at the top of one of the forest roads and take you under the cave flowing streams and the nearby railway, you will definitely find the path down.
And on the way out of the woods, you may be caught by the nearby Hawaran rocks.
Joki Minarik is after a severe fall in Germany in an artificial sleep
"Philip's in the best hands now.
The Institute is arranged for similar cases, and we also have a part of the family in Hannover.
This makes me very much easier for the situation and also the care of Finn's daughter," quoted the server Jezdci.cz the statement of Minarik's wife, Katjia.
"Everyone does the maximum, Philip now needs time for a reconvalescent.
It doesn't make any sense of prognosis.
Anyone who has ever met the problem with the trauma of head and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We all need to be patient now and give him time," said the woman of the fifty-year-old joke.
To financial support of the injured Minaryk, he also called on the Twitter of the star Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh achievement of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes on Saturday, to balance the legend of Lester Piggott.

Video judge took the footballists Sassuola four goals, lost 0:2
Footballists Sassuola received four balls into the rival gate on Saturday match in Neapoli, but eventually they had to reconcile the defeat of 0:2.
None of their goals judged after consulting the video because of the site.
According to the Italian media, it's a recorded negligence of technology, so many interferences VAR has never lost to one team.
"VAR was more strict on Sassuolo than a road radar and punished him as no team yet.
New technologies break records," Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in the commentary.
"The celebration of the unprecedented goals of Sassuola.
The VAR has never been so strict to one team," Corriere dello Sport added.
Neapol took the lead on Saturday at eight minutes, after half an hour of the game, but it seemed to be a balanced Sassuolo.
Phillip Duricica's goal was not recognized after a video-deposition interview because of an offside.
For the same reason, no other Djuricic's interference and hits of Francesca Caputa and Domenica Berardi were gradually paid.
On the contrary, they added another goal.

In the Czech Republic, the most in history

The other large players, such as PRE and E.ON, producers of Tesla's electrical vehicles, are also reported on the market, but also the supermarkets of Bill and Lidl.
Classical pump station operators are represented again by the MOL.
But it doesn't have any numbers yet.
"Our electromobility network we only started building loons," explained the speaker of Jan Juskov.
However, the revision of Dennik exclusively obtained data from all 216 electrical stands operated by the CEZ.
As a result, the drivers from stations have taken an average of 13.5 kWh.
This corresponds to the arrival of approximately a hundred miles of smaller electrical vehicles.
If we pass a small drawing to 1 kWh, the average charge takes two and a half hours.
The vulnerable majority of tanking then took place in a free tariff.
If the engineers were already paying for the pickup, their typical loss was about 330 crowns.
Electromobility is mainly in the capital.
In the territory of Prague, there are all five of the most burdened CEZ winners, which also shade their popularity in the region.
Then Olomouc leads between the regions.
On the contrary, the smallest interest is the distance station in the border, such as in Godmin or in Prahatics, which often remain all day without use.
More than four thousand electromobiles are currently registered in Czech Republic.
Only in the first half of the year, 1274 new e-autoes arrived.
In an extensive survey of the "Cechy in Movement" daily, eight percent of the readers indicated that they consider buying electric vehicles in the family.
But only a third of the respondents know where to find the nearest charge station in their neighborhood.

The progress of most disease is mild, only three percent of infected in the hospital
Either a minor form of coronavir is spread by Czech Republic, or the summer dose of the sun has significantly improved our immunity.
The infected hospital department is half empty, even if the numbers of infected are growing.
"The situation is completely different today and in April, and it is given primarily by the number of hospitalized people," the Minister of Health, Adam Vojciech, confirms.
It's worth reminding that on April 11th, when the first wave of the epidemic was at our top, all the guns were wearing, the army's extractions were carried out, the Republic was closed, and the Czech Republic used disinfections for a year ahead.
Still, ten people died a day.
The daily increases in the number of infected are now higher, but every day with covid-19 dies at least two people.
The highest number of infected populations still has Karvinska, similar numbers have Jihlava because of the fire in the local Alzheimer Centre, where 57 are already infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.

The introduction of the fight was mutually balanced, the fracture came at state 8:7 for the Belgian shooter.
Van Day Bergh took his pants with a 13-shot leg, and he had the top since.
His competitor literally smashed his game, and a significantly more experienced "Flying Scot" was just hard to get into duplicates.
The way "The Creator of dreams" had him in his garlic also shows that the dedicated Anderson played his first maximum until the 24th leg.
Furthermore, the young Belgian man managed great high checkouts.
The last time he was losing in the 11th leg, in an inappropriate state, he caught a big fish and closed 170.
At the end of the fight, she saw a huge frustration on Anderson.
He just threw the arrows and his triumph walking competitor started completely sovereign.
Van day Bergh transformed the first of three matches of gifts and received his name -- he wrote his big dream.

The last player who was able to defeat the van day of Bergha is Karel Sedlack.
In Nantes, the fire of the cathedral was charged, a man confessed
The cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began burning last Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original visual windows of the 16th century and destroyed the bargains.
Suspects of burning were checked because the fire went through the temple from three different places.
At the same time, the police didn't find any signs of getting violence into the cathedral.
The defendant is a volunteer in local diet, a ninety-year-old Rwanda refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without launching a criminal prosecution.
Now the prosecutor informed that on the basis of new evidence, a man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faced charges of burning.
If he's found guilty, he's in danger of ten years of imprisonment and a high penalty.
According to his lawyer, a man regrets the act and decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, Le Monde wrote.
Wars: We will present "semafor" on Monday for epidemiological measures
The new system is to fulfil the role of the pandemic plan, which is due to the absence of the government and the Ministry of Health of Critics.
"They will be gradually according to the power of community spread," the Minister explained.
He added that, for example, the Morausles region or Prague would now reach a medium, orange degree.
The system is designed as regional, because the situation in individual regions is significantly different, complemented.
The Ministry has cooperated on the system with the epidemiology and the Institute of Health and Statistics (UZIS).
The Minister shall take specific measures to each degree, whether the duty to wear pipes or organisation of special hospitals.
To create an epidemiological plan in the television television of Prima Party, the Minister of Interior Jan Hamachek (CHSSD) called on people to have clear information about what measures can be expected if the epidemiological situation gets worse.
The daily growth of confirmed cases in Czech Republic has increased in recent days, even though the number of hospitalized remains low.
The soldier commented that nothing of the essential inferior is not in the place to speak of the statement of extraordinary status or the reunification of the crisis headquarters.
In view of the growing number of infected since Saturday, the government has reinstated the obligation to carry roofs on internal action over 100 people.
Since Monday, the capacity of these actions will be limited to 500 persons, now representing 1000 people.
The government's progress was not clear in the last time, what measures and when they start to pay or when they are announced, the criticism was expected.
"I think in a relatively tense situation, the main factors should create a sense of certainty and the confusion to compare," Senator Marek Hilsher said in the questions.
The measures may now differ according to the region, for example in Prague since Sunday, they are obliged to wear pipes even in non-residency health facilities, such as in pharmacists or waiting rooms with a doctor.
The obligation to wear crops during the visit of health and social equipment or pharmacists has been taken from Friday to the Liberian and Austeck County.
It is necessary to wear pipes in internal public spaces, MHD and health facilities since 14 July.
On the contrary, anti-epidemic measures were released in the Morauxlesland region, as well as in the Mediterranean region in Kutnogorska.
The Czech Government has already approved a so-called semafor for Europe in early June, which colourfully distinguishes the risk of disease in individual European countries, and therefore regulates rules applicable to entry into Czech Republic from these countries.
In low and medium-risk countries, the authorities do not require a negative coronavirus test for Czech citizens from 15 June or do not order a quarantine instead.
They are obliged to return the Czech countries with high risk.
At this point, all EU Member States are now in a low-risk category.

If the number of participants weren't reduced, the police would have hit it.
In the television show Prima Partie, the Minister of Interior Jan Hamachek (CSSD) said that.
However, the number of participants decreased under 1,000, so the police evaluated that the intervention was not necessary, nor has the hygiene station or the Ministry of Health asked for it.
The Czech Television (CT) indicated on Sunday that the technopartments also extended to surrounding lands whose owners did not agree with the use of technopartments.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will require the reimbursement of damage.

However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance that the snake snores you're not too high, she's afraid of herself in common contact.
And if he's got space to do it, he likes to fly away for a loud syringe.
He only attacks if he feels very threatened - for example, if you mistakenly stick on it.
Even her choking is not a tragedy, but her poison is very effective against small suckers, but it will not kill people.
It can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from allergies.
Therefore, the risk is primarily in children, seniors and allergics.

The Czech Republic has arrived by bio LPG, promises ecological operation
The burned oil gas, shortly LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), is a very well-known alternative fuel in Czech Republic.
It is particularly popular for its substantially lower price against petrol or gasoline given significantly lower consumption tax, but it also benefits from lower CO2 emissions per mile.
Like gasoline and oil has its ecological variance - "by LPG".
However, this is a whole news - the first time it appeared on the European market and the Czech press report of the Czech Association LPG arrived several days ago.
"In these days we received the first 15 tonnes of bio LPG, which will be distributed in the mixture with the classic fossil LPG to our drawing station," quotes the Association of Jiri Karlik from Primagas.
Bio LPG, however, cannot be taken as bioethanol or bio oil.
According to the association, the chemical site is consistent with the classic oil LPG that tanks a number of motorists in his cars now.
Therefore, both versions can also be mixed freely.
"The only difference against the classic LPG is a way of production," said LPG Ivan Indrac, chairman of the Association.
This also includes one of the major advantages of LPG against other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored, and distributing infrastructure is relatively good, for example, compared to hydrogen or electricity.
This gas is currently obtained as an adverse product in the production of bioethanol from the remains of food and sugar shark.
In the future, it should also be made targeted, for example, from cellulose biomass, that is, from wooden waste.
Furthermore, the classical oil LPG forms partially as an adverse product in the refinancing of oil, partially separated in the processing of the natural gas.
Therefore, depending on the production technologies and sources of the operation of the LPG bio LPG is 40-70% ecologically more genuine than the carbon trail operation of the LPG and up to 90% compared to oil.
But it's not about CO2 emissions from car exhaust, but about the ecology of fuel production, the so-called part "well-to-tank" (the Czech "from the source to the tank").
Between one of the biggest LPG manufacturers currently belongs to the petrochemical company Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the recent update of the National Action Plan of Clean Mobility (NAP ČM) is investigating the possibility of production and Unipetrol in its Lithuanian raphineries.
According to the estimates of the Association in Czech Republic, about 170 000 vehicles are driven to the LPG; the Ministry of Environment indicates in NAP ČM a little higher number, approximately 200 thousand.
According to the transport statistics, nearly 6000 car reconstructions were carried out on the LPG drive only last year.
The LPG tanking in Czech Republic is possible to approximately 950 stations of different operators.
The military revised the numbers of infected, the number dropped by 1775 cases
The Minister of Health, Adam Vojciech (for ANO), ordered the Ministry to revise the numbers infected by the virus coronavir.
New statistics published the Ministry of Health on its website on Sunday.
The number on Sunday afternoon dropped from Saturday 5254 to 3479 cases, which is less than 1775 infected.
Therefore, 3422 patients are currently sick in the Czech Republic.
"After a jump increase in the number of healed data revisions, which hygienics have recently failed to update," said Jaroslav Dušek, head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people in Czech Republic were infected with coronavir, 11,419 healed and 371 Covid-19 diseases, unfortunately.
Mobile Election Units or correspondent choice.
Politologist and sociologist were looking for options for the pandemic period
In order to vote in the quarantine for coronavir in October and Senate elections, the vice-premier and the Minister of Interior, Jan Hamachek (CSSD), is required to change the law.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He said it on Sunday at Prima's TV Party.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss a solution with the representatives of the parliamentary parties.
"Let's do anything, it's going to have to mean a change in the election law," Hamaček said.
The Senate called on the government to find solutions within the applicable legal rules.
However, the Minister stated that the provisions of the law should be adjusted, according to which people in the quarantine are unable to vote for health.
For example, the prohibition of vote should remain preserved for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop in the OVM series stated that the options for correspondent elections have been delayed since 2004.
Even the current draft of the law, which is in the Parliament, counts on its introduction for abroad vote, but not in Czech Republic.
The proscope also considers the concerns of ANO or CHSSD (because it would, according to foreign experiences, rather record other types of parties) from the correspondent choices as overestimated.
Personally, it is against the option of electronic vote, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Clima said that now ad hoc is needed to invent mechanisms (volebs), which could be implemented this year and with the least health risk.
It considers it to be prepared for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be made in Czech Republic.
The correspondence choice (before in a foreign or also in Czech Republic) considers one of the functional methods.
As another, they see the already mentioned election units or, perhaps, the possibility of a representative vote within the family.
He added that there was a possibility to learn how similar situations - elections at the time of coronavir - were addressed in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of coronovir disease, various types of elections in 67 world countries have been postponed this year.
Protests in Bulgaria: Swine ears were throwing demonstrators into the government building
Participants in the demonstration against the Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojk Borisov and his office were throwing pig ears on the building of the government.
It was another number of protests against "mafian rule" that have been held in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
Organizers are planning a whole state blockade in the middle, according to the DPA Agency.
Today's protest, which has been held 18 days after itself, has been weaker than the previous part of the Radio Free Europe/Radio Freedom.
By 8:00 there were about 300 people, some streets had to be closed for transport.
The demonstrators played a theatre scene before the government's building, symbolically locked in the prison cell of Prime Minister Borisov and General Prosecutor Ivan Geshev in connection with the arrest of two advisers of President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the President of the government.
The resignation of both belongs to the basic requirements of the protesters.
They also demanded abolition of the public health reform and the end of corruption in the construction of the Black Sea Coast.
The Protestator Nikolaj Hadjigenov, today in the publicly speaking, stated that the "top of escalation" in the form of "national manifestation in Sofia and blockages throughout the country" is going to be on Wednesday.
He repeated the requirement to retire Borisov and his government, as well as to make early elections.
The correct ones should be implemented in March 2021.
Borisov already told me that he didn't retire.
It has caused, inter alia, the need to implement Bulgaria's pandemic covidu-19 and the economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he exchanged five members of his government team so that he would not calm down the deputy of the demonstrator.
At the beginning of this week, Borisov's government stopped in the Parliament's vote on confidence in the parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovic doesn't want any more games without the watchers
Coach of footballers Boloni Sinisha Mihajlovic has already had enough games of Italian league without audience.
Serbian coach hopes that the fans will return to the stadium since the new season.
"What we're doing here right now is not a football.
I've got tooths full of games without the watchers.
It's a sex football, it doesn't bring me any emotions, no joy.
These fights are worse than training.
Playing this is awful and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks it," Mihajlovic said before the fight against Lecca today.
After the coronavirus breaks, the matches of Seria A are followed in a fast track, and even though they play until evening, their actors are exposed to the hot.
"We play every three days in a terrible vedro.
In such conditions, they don't even know how the teams are.
To end this season.
These measures had to be approached to the competition, but I hope that the fans will be back since September," said a coach who had led Fiorentin or AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovic, this season is unusual even because he missed four months for leukemia.
"Despite my illness, the interruption of the league and all other things, our team has been able to move a higher level.
We want to continue to grow, and we need players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We have become the target of the cyber attack of foreign countries, Iran claims
Since the end of June, a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, but also oil raphineries, power plants, factories and businesses have been reported to fires and explosions.
Some Iranian factors indicated that the fire that had broken in the underground nuclear operation in Natanz could cause cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
The speaker of the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Ababas Musavi told journalists according to the Iranian media that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure daily faces "thousands of cyber attacks".
He added that it was not a new phenomenon and that most of them could be reflected.
In the past months, several broader cyber attacks have been recorded by Musavia, according to the analysis of "determined governments and groups".
However, he did not share more details about possible perpetrators according to Reuters.
Musaw also complemented that fires in forests, raphineries and other places are common in summer.
The Iranian State Agency of IRNA discussed this month that the enemies of Iran, like Israel and the United States, could stand behind recent incidents.
None of these countries have been accused directly of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States interrupted diplomatic contacts shortly after the 1979 Revolution, when the Iranian military students attacked the American embassy in Teheran and held 52 American hostages for 444 days.
The long-term tensioned relations between the two countries were sharp in 2018 after Washington departed from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers and introduced sanctions against Iran which have a strong impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the US Army killed Iranian General Casema and the Iraqi Military Head of Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3th.
Then Iran fired on bases in Iraq on January 8, where the Americans operate, the number of missiles.
The United States confessed that tens of American soldiers were injured.
Israel considers Iran its main enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu is the main opponent of the international nuclear agreement with Iran of 2015.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop a atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
The TPCA car extended the production rate, now by 25 May
The Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) wheel car renewed the production rate for coronavir.
Manufacturing lines should be restarted on Monday 25 May morning.
The race is accompanied by dozen hygienic measures, said the speaker of the car Tomasz Paroubek.
Manufacturing is due to the pandemic of coronavir since 18 March.
The company originally planned to renew it on Monday on May 18th.
The reason for prolonging the passage is the closed border and closed dealing, so there is no one to sell.
According to Paroubka, the company will be manufactured at 100 percent from the beginning, that is, for two shifts.
The coronavir is affected by the key markets of the company, such as Italy, UK or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Currection for Colin) said that the production rate in TPCA is not signed in the city.
"It was from the beginning to know, it was empty in the city.
But the streets are gradually filling, especially now since Monday, when it's been very relaxed.
So the city is full," said Kaspar.
According to him, there are no complications with foreign workers who stayed in the habitats.
"We didn't have to solve almost any problem in those two months," said Kaspar.
For example, the Youth of the Scoda Auto, which also discontinued production because of the coronavir crisis, renewed it on Monday 27 April in all its three production races in the Czech Republic.
None of the races works at 100% of capacity.
The renewal of production in Scotland was accompanied by more than 80 hygienic measures.
At the night of Monday on Tuesday, the first time after the renewal of the production was held the third, the night shift.
The TPCA is currently working for about 2500 people and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time employers in Colinsk.
Cancer killed the bride shortly after the wedding: She left a message to her family
For more than two years, she fought Gemma Sisson's cancer, and when it seemed like she had beat cancer, the disease came again.
A nineteen - year - old woman who loved culturalism eventually ended up in a bed in a hospice where she still had enough to marry her love for life.
Unfortunately, the weakness has fallen.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message for the closest appeared on her account on the Facebook social network.
Gemma Sisson, who came from English Leeds, loved culturalism.
With a friend Ricky Moor, who has lived more than 16 years, they traveled through competitions all over the world.
The ninety-year-old woman sported and lived healthy, yet in April 2018 her cancer was diagnosed.
Gemma started exhausting treatment, radiotherapy, hopefully healing.
After months of treatment, Gemma really seemed to be able to win cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned and this time attacked the cream.
Culturist and personal trainer, according to the British Journal Daily Mirror, performed a ten-hour surgery of the knee and followed again with drastic treatment.
Of course, everything was in vain.
At the beginning of this year, at her nineteenth birthday, the doctors informed her that she had a few months of life left.
In April, a beautiful blonde decided to enter a hospital in Leeds, where her family, who even arranged her wedding with her love, visited her every minute.
Marriage took two months.
Ricky took Gemma on their two-month anniversary to the restaurant last time.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after her death on her social network account, a contribution that Gemma wrote for her family.
"If this was published, it means that I finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I'm going to have a broken heart that I'm leaving my loved ones here, I'm so happy to get rid of what this terrible illness caused me.
I can't thank Ricky, who was on my side all the time and gave me a huge amount of love and assistance during that terrible time," she wrote to the social network that pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support that I have received from all my social network trackers," she wrote with the fact that everyone should appreciate his life and live fullly.
Art automaties sell a pot list, amulet of mushrooms and pexeso
For a hundred crowns he gets the passing pocket work mostly starting Czech artists.
Pictures and other creations are created directly for art, so they know ahead that they have to go into size 8.5 to 5.5 inches.
Every piece is numbered and signed.
"In packing, there is always a curator text about the artist and then the work itself," stated Peter Widž's courier of the project.
Artmat works with a coincidence principle.
The buyer may be surprised what artwork he gets.
Currently, it may become a new owner of fantastic illustrations of Alexandra Stopple or mini views from Teresa Bonaventura, which can also be sent.

The cards need to be parsed with homemarks.

The health fees will increase by at least five percent next year.
The greater increase is not real according to the Voytech
Health payments could increase by up to five percent in the next year, said Minister for Health Adam Vojciech (ANO) in Václava Moravca in Czech TV.
The requirement of experts to increase up to 15 per cent is considered unreal.
He also said that the State should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective aid.
He thinks the hospitals have their supplies now.
"I think that growth (payments) may be up to five percent," said the Minister.
According to it, the current situation should be reflected when it has been affected by the choice of a insurance pandemic of coronavir and government regulation against its spread since March.
Insurance income then dropped.
"By 15 percent, I'm getting an increase at this moment unreal," said Voythech.
The average monthly medicinal product of the doctor in acute bed care according to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (URIS) is likely to reach 88 312 crowns this year, nurses 47 498 crowns.
The difference between the payment of sisters in state hospitals and the remuneration of other crowns will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The data show that the loss of health sisters in hospitals has been stopped.
The average remuneration in Czech Republic was 34 125 crowns in 2019 according to the data of the Czech Statistics Office.
The representatives of the experts already stated in June that for 2021 they would require a minimum increase by 10 per cent, perfectly by 15 per cent.
They criticize the long-term difference between the salary of doctors and sisters in state hospitals, which must be managed by plativers, and contractual remuneration in hospitals of cities, regions or private.
Therefore, they require that healthcare plates be united.
This year, the difference will reach up to seven thousand crowns per month.
For example, in the doctors last year, the wages grew faster than the payments.
According to the President of the Czech Dental Chamber, the experts should see how state is at the moment.
The Covid epidemic has recently approved an increase in the annual deficit of the state budget on the records of 500 billion crowns, of which 1,75 billion should be paid for healthcare rewards in hospitals and social services.
The Council of Medicinal Care providers according to Smucler with the general increase of payments in the next year does not agree.
He believes that remuneration should be determined by hospitals and health facilities themselves, and additional money should go to them through a remuneration statement.
The Military also stated that hospitals now have enough protective facilities.
The President of the Directorate of State Material Reserves (SSHR) Paul Schvagr said this week that the administration has no health care in real estate.
He's waiting for the completion of the election procedures.
According to Vojtech, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March when they were purchased.
Stating according to him should try to be as self-sufficient as well as to shopping from Czech companies.
Smart quarantine quarantine might be taken by soldiers.
We're ready, they're reporting
"Smart quarantine works, it's what to improve, of course.
We're going to discuss this with the army tonight.
The army works perfectly, and the question is whether they shouldn't drive it again," said the government's president on Sunday in his Facebook show, "Hau people.
According to it, IT systems and hygienic stations cannot be connected sufficiently, which must gradually go to more modern functioning methods.
The problems were according to the Prime Minister in the Morausles region, where one of the current fires of the epidemic.
The speaker of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pajšek for CTC stated that the information on the Sunday negotiations had not been available and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army is ready for this step.
The Smart quarantine project took over the Ministry of Health on May 25th.
By then, a smart quarantine was led by a ninety-third central governing team established under the army as a advisory authority of the government, which led the former Minister Roman Primula.
The drowning project criticised the Minister of Interior Jan Hamachek (CSSD).
He also said that he could be taken back from the army.
Deficiencies in the project have also been accepted by the government official for IT and digitalization, Vladimir Jurilla, who is responsible for it.
"The system works, but it's still working on.
Twenty years it came up separately and non-systemically, and now we've been trying to unify it in a few months.
It can't be a trick.
People in the march, poor hygiene in the march adapt the new systems and actually catch those mistakes," he said.
The Ostrav Primator Macura won't run again, because he doesn't want to "fuck in politics"
The current island primator Tomasz Macura (ANO) will not be running in the next community elections.
The reason is to try "not to screw up in politics," said the server Respect.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the President of the ANO Movement, is the Prime Minister of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, the candidate of the ANO movement in Ostrav won it nearly a third of the votes.
Macura originally wanted to be only for four years.
"I thought I could hold one functional period and with the experience of business here in that time, I could turn it all over and put it on my feet," he said to the Respect.
He added that he was allowed to negotiate to a certain extent during the second election period.
"But it's the maximum for me.
I don't want to be foolish in this policy," added Macura, who, in his interview, described himself as a difficult introvert, who does not meet common contact with people.
According to Respect, Macur's possible end of the ANO movement has been speculated for a long time.
The server recalls that Macura has criticised the ANO movement several times, for example for association with the SPD movement or for the support of Milos Zeman in presidential elections.
As one of the smallest personalities, ANO supported Zeman’s contra-candidate, Jirih Drahoša, in the elections.
From the ANO movement that entered in 2017, Macura does not plan to leave.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in movement, that it is not a completely vain fight and that no one does not make it, I have no immediate motive to end," he said to the Respect.
Sixty-fifty-year-old Macura studied the High Economic School in Prague.
Before he became the island primator in 2014, Macura was, inter alia, directed by the manufacturer of the Walmark pharmaceutical company.
He was also sitting in other companies.
To Brna will return Uber offering transport services
By the end of July Brna will return to Uber, which offers transport services.
It is the consequence of the change in the law, stated on Thursday in the press statement of the Council Brna for the transport of Peter Kratoquil (ODS).
Towards Ubera in Brna, taxiers protested, pointed out that Uber did not meet the conditions such as taxi or taxameter.
However, the change in the law has changed the conditions for the operation of normal taxes and those alternatives since July.
In the last few weeks, the shortwall had a few negotiations with the representatives of Uber.
"On their basis, this company decided to return to Brna at the end of July this year with its services.
This step is the result of a change in the law that allows the company to act legally.
The city was familiar with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services in the limits given," said Kratoville.
He worked in Brna in the past.
A taxiist protested against him because of the non-significance of vehicles as taxi or a missing taxi.
The court has issued preliminary measures that Ubera prohibited from driving in town.
Brno originally supported taxiers, but the Primator Marketa Vaňková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brna.
According to the later court decisions, Uber could drive in Brna, but the company did not use it.
Now he will return on the basis of the change of law.
Since July, the taxi with light and taxameter can be easily operated by the transport service ordered and paid exclusively through the mobile application.
Too much bujara celebrations in Brno: a flying chair has reached a meter from a man on the walk
From the fourth floor of the apartment flyed out on Saturday night in Brna's office chair and reached about a meter from the walk.
The walker went after him at the moment who called the officers immediately.
The patrol immediately after arriving at that address in the west part of the city noticed the open window, under which she still lied in the chair and next to her several bars and non - palms.
"The bedroom from the fourth floor suggested that there was a relatively noisy celebration inside.
The officers went out at the hall to the apartment and asked three present young men aged from sixteen to nineteen years of explanation," the speaker of officers James Ghanem informed.
Request to appeal to Rafaje will discuss Babish with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babish (ANO) plans on Monday with coalitional social democrats to discuss the request for an appeal to the chief of the Anti-Monopoly Authority (UOHS) Peter Rafay.
To appeal to Rafaya, the non-profit organisations called for the government's anti-corruption Council and the County of the Aust.
Social Democrats indicate that the exchange in the office is on the spot.
According to information, the CTK Rafaj was not invited to the Government's Office on Monday.
His second mandate ends in the middle of the next year, according to the law, it cannot be appointed for the third time.
His appeal is in the competence of President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the challenge of non-profit organisations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar request from the Usteck district.
The reason should be Rafay's causes since the last time.
In the past week, the Prime Minister refused to express its request by introducing materials and the governments would take a "some opinion".
He also stated that the challenges have not yet been dealt with the president, he has no appointment with him in the nearest time.
According to the statement of UOHS to appeal, it is not a reason because Rafai was not accused of anything.
The IHNED.cz servers and Currently.cz wrote last week that the police were interested in Rafa's meeting with Heitman Jir Chunk.
Meanwhile, the meetings have linked the competition decision to the project controversial new Zlinic Hospitals for eight billion, which Chunek has strongly prosecuted.
The bunch of the meeting confessed, according to him, they were dealing with his "snatical activities together."
Rafai speaks similarly.
The Deputy of the Usteccan County to appeal to Rafaya called the government at the end of June.
It also requests reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Authority.
The decision of the UOHS on public procurement according to the Deputy Hajtman for the transport of Jaroslav Komenka is not transparent and has signs of will.
Last March, the police interfered with the antimonopoly office because of the tender to choose myths.
This year in June, the server Currently.cz noted that Rafaj uses the apartments written to the company of an influential behind-player ČSSD Alexandra Chuby.
The backup of 3,5 million for the apartment in Brna was paid from Rafai's account.
The President of the Competition Protection Authority, Rafaj, since 9 July 2009, appointed the President of the former Member of Social Democracy in June 2015 for the second functioning period.
In less than a year, Rafaj's second six-year mandate will expire.
The Antimonopoly Authority Act states that the President may appeal to the President of the Office to the proposal of the government.
It can only be revoked if it does not perform the function for more than six months or violates seriously the dignity of its function or independence and impartiality of the Authority.
In the Blane Library, the employees had a hot collapse.
Climate management helps
The new technique will cost 740 thousand and will be operational in the second half of August.
"That's good news for me.
With three children, we go to the library in the center of Blanska regularly.
But in the warm months, it almost couldn't stand there.
There was a terrible hot and bad air.
The wind didn't help.
That's why I'm happy for the climate," said one of the blanean readers Peter Novotny.
According to the director of the Library, Lukas Zapa, temperatures in the building have often risen up to 30 degrees.
The south wall of the facility is curved and works as a glass in the suntimes.
"The sun's also screwed up the building through a large part of the day.
At the same time, a major problem is to wind the separate department because the window must be closed overnight for security reasons.
We often have this since morning in the library up to 30 degrees," said Topa.
The worst was the studio and the numbering room in the third floor.
And on the floor above the exhibition rooms and the director.
The unpleasant climate was also in the childhood department located under the roof of the building.
"A few times, the librarians have collapsed and ended up in worklessness.
The problem was also regularly in the cultural room at tens of people’s lectures.
After a few minutes, you couldn't breathe there," Topa noted.
They originally wanted the city's representatives to make air conditioning this year in all rooms of the library.
Finally, there will be only three rounds of five.
"With limited funding, air conditioning will only have the most difficult areas.
Studio and reader in the third floor.
Thereafter, the cultural room and the children's department on the floor above," said Jiří Sloboda from the Blaneen Investment Committee.
He added that at the first stage of last autumn workers installed the airlock and adjusted the electrical installation.
About 360,000 crowns.
The city library Blansko has almost three thousand registered readers.
It's about nine hundred to fifteen years.
Chicago's backup has expelled coronavirus.
Crawford's coming back to the game
Not every infected sportsman gets out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to an NHL player, who keeps silent about the health of players as a grave and does not open anything.
As one of the little ones came out of Crawford's row.
The fifty - year - old man from Montréal was only present at the first training, since he was missing.
"I would like to inform you all that I was positively tested on Covid-19 and that's why I spent the last fourteen days closed in my house," I explained the reason for my absence.
The fans don't have to worry about his health condition anymore.

Thousands of people protested in Israel against the Prime Minister
Thousands of Israel in several places protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjah deals with the coronavir crisis.
Manifestation, inter alia, took place in front of Netanjahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence or in Tel Avivo Park.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, protests have been conducted regularly for several weeks.
Their participants require the resignation of Netanjahua for the process in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as the way the government deals with another wave of coronavir epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," according to the AP Agency, one of the demonstrators wrote to his transparency, referring to Netanjahu's generally known nickname.
"All see that the Emperor lost his clothes," he stood on the other.
Seventy-year-old Netanjah is the first prime minister of Israel condemned in the performance.
He's accused of three causes of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
All the charges are denied and deemed to be hunting the witch.
According to local media, the process may take up to three years, calling over 300 Witnesses.
The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed in Israel with about nine million inhabitants in nearly 60,500 people.
455 people died in connection with the disease.
The Israeli government in March introduced quarantine measures that helped to reduce the daily growth of infected persons.
However, following the gradual release of restrictions since the end of April, the numbers of infected again began to grow significantly at the end of June.
Netanjahu's criticism claims that the government has not helped enough for example the quarantine-related animals.
Protestors also disturb the fact that the government in the context of the fight against coronavir is providing places of dispute instructions.
The driver broke the car over the tree and died.
The body had to be cut by the firefighters
The tragic accident occurred about 23 hours at Nevekovov's narrow district leading from the Slap barracks.
The driver, apparently, flyed in a low speed down into the woods and broke the car over the tree.
He died at the scene.
The body had to be emptied by the firefighters, among other things they cut off the roof.
The circumstances of the crash are checked by the police.
They ordered a surveillance that should explain if a man had not driven under the influence of alcohol or other habits.
It's over wasting and shaking one collection at a time.
Pietro Philippi discontinues discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech bracelet Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is being made a major change in the strategy.
He's breaking off discounts, and he doesn't want to crush one collection at a time anymore.
The fact that the fashion industry belongs to the largest environmental pollutioners is not a news.
In the burning rooms and on the puzzles, there are billions of clothing ending each year.
The view of slow fashion, often disregarded access to clothing, but over the past years, it changes relatively quickly.
Approximately half of the goods Pietro Philippi sold at full price.
The second half that sold through discounts is not simply buying.
The company does not want to crush one collection at the end of each season of products under their production price.
Furthermore, according to Michal Micah's owner, the days of new and old collections and the blind follow-up of fast changing fashion trends are gone.
"The majority of traders with discounts are counting already at the purchase of goods, so much higher margins are included in full price.
So it's actually a little fraud," says Pietro Philippi Micah.
Furthermore, the company wants to support local business.
"Each product is made of carefully chosen quality substances and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is created by the so-called basic pieces - i.e. by clothing that is overtime and overseasonal.
Worldwide, the segment of the premium marks of absence of any discount is typical, the product price simply corresponds to its quality and discount is not necessary," Mika adds.
The giant graffiti represents the RAF flight Kurt Taussiga
"The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our persecutive pilot who fought in a row of British Royal Aviation in World War II.
The proposal was liked by the city's leadership," said Vacek, who finished his work after 14 days of intense creation.
He needed approximately 300 liters of color and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Tepplich-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15 years old.
During the war, because of his Jewish origin, Nazis dragged him into an international camp where he was held for weeks.
However, the organization of Nicholas Winton helped him and his brother to avoid the concentration camp.
In 1939 Taussig arrived in Great Britain, where he voluntarily entered the Royal Air Force (RAF), and followed a pilot training in African South Rhodesia and Palestine.
He was involved in combat operations at the beginning of 1945.
After the Summit Revolution, he visited Czech Republic and the family Teplica, who gave him honorable citizenship.
Sixty-five-year-old Camille Vacek, whom people in the street art industry know under Camo's nickname, worked in hot streets for over 20 years.
The graffiti started on the surfaces that the Jaroslav Kubera (ODS) was eligible for these purposes.
Hannah's storm arrived at the coast of Texas
Hurrican Hanna arrived on Saturday afternoon from the local time (prior to midnight SELČ at night for today) to the southwest coast of the US state of Texas.
The Texas island Padre Island, about 24 miles north of the city of Port Mansfield, was hit by the Texas island Padre Island, and he weakened on a tropical storm.
However, meteorologists say that it is a great danger for coastal residents.
Because he brought with him a strong wind and intense collapse; along with local floods, the AP reports that electricity and various material damage, including damaged ships, are reported.
The Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced the state of natural disaster in Southwest Texas on Saturday for 32 districts and recommended voluntary evacuation.
The most powerful warnings were received from the coastal belt between Port Mansfield and the Bay of Mesquite Bay, but he had a total inflammation to reach the territory of nearly 500 miles before moving gradually over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hannah is now a tropical storm, a strong rain and wind can rise levels, a dangerous struggle and a single tornade to pose a threat," the US National Centre for Hurricanes (NHC) warned.
This morning, the local time (afterday SELČ) storm was moving in the area of the American-Mexico border and was accompanied by the wind speed of 85 km per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of the year's hurricane season in the Atlantic area on Saturday.
Over the Mexican Gulf, the wind of speed up to 145 miles per hour, but it gradually weakened up to 112 miles per hour, which Hannah from the categories of hurricanes again.
Local authorities called on the storms to wait at home and not forget about hygienic measures related to preventing the spread of coronavir.
Texas belongs to those American states which pandemia of covid-19 sufficies most.
Given the existing security measures and the need to comply with the distances are also a major challenge and possible evacuation.
Provision shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the Texas district of Hidalgo, one of the buildings was also fitted as a shelter after evacuated, who had a positive test on coronavirus or otherwise exposed diseases.
Local authorities have called all evacuated to take guns and disinfective gels if possible.
"We're not even behind it yet.
We expect catastrophic floods," quoted the AP of Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Meteorological Service (NWS) service in Brownsville.
Forecasts argue that in some places a few hours can rain up to 300 millimeters of coast, in some cases less than 500 millimeters, which together with the sea levels could flood a number of sea sites on the coast.
Zeman borrows a general dignity to Colonel Lipk
President Miloš Zeman will rent a general dignity to Colonel Paul Lipk in the middle.
This comes from an overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for entrusting the dignity of the Brigade General is the August's entry to the Staff of the Commander of the Alliance Multinational Division of North-East in Poland.
Lipka still acts as a Deputy Commander of the Czech Army's Land Forces.
The government proposed a promotion to Zeman at the end of June.
Since the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigade General Karla Rijeka with the position of the Deputy Commander of the Multinational Division of Northeast in Poland Elblag, which commands alliance presence in the territory of Poland and Pobalt.
In March, rarely became director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (UNCIB).
The government suggested that Lipku borrow the dignity of the Brigade General.
In accordance with the Law on Provocation soldiers, a higher duty may be lended to the soldier during the time of the selected function or for the time of the service assignment which requires the lending of higher duty.
The Officer of the Alliance Division shall be responsible for the general dignity.
The soldier who has been entrusted with the dignity has the same rights and obligations as to be appointed in this order.
However, he does not have the right to adjust the payment that would correspond to the dignity.
The lending of the dignity takes place in the absence of the reason it was granted.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional preparedness and is a model for subjects.
It is significantly participating in the fulfilment of the tasks of the Czech forces, including the cooperation with foreign partners and the security of military participation in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June to a proposal for promotion.
Medium promotion will be made at 12:30 at the Prague Castle, attended by the Minister of Defence, Lubomir Metnar, or the Chief of the General Bureau, Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavir standards for aircraft
The European Union has agreed on the common hygienic standards for travel by aircraft that are to help reduce the spread of new coronavir.
The German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer announced it.
However, the average seats in the aircraft will not have to remain unemployed between the agreed standards.
She informed the agency Reuters.
"I am glad that my colleagues accepted a German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards," said Scheuer at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement was concluded by officials and that the ministers still have to approve it formally.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover their mouth and nose for passengers since six years, to maintain the recommended distance in safety controls and discharge in the airport.
The aircraft must also guarantee sufficient fresh air and all information must be available in several languages.
The airlines will also be able to capture middle seats.
The common provisions under which the officials agreed meet at least some airline requirements.
Because different standards caused confusion.
The arctic Spicberks fell the temperature record, measured almost 22 degrees there.
"In Longyearbyen, 41 years old record fell," said the Norwegian Meteorological Institute on Twitter.
During the evening, temperature rose to 21.7 degrees of Celsia, by which 0.4 degrees exceeded the 1979 record, he added.
Approximately 20,000 Longyearbyen is the largest city in Spicberki, located about 1300 km from the northern field.
Spitbers warm up faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact emphasizes the danger of heating other ends of Arctida - from Alaska to Siberia, as stated last year in the report of the Norwegian Centre for Climate Study.
The average temperature on Spicberks, according to him, increased by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it may even increase by ten degrees unless the release of glass gases into the atmosphere is reduced.
Temperature growth may result in the Spicberks as a result of everlasting frozen soil, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports, and can also cause more quantities of lavins and soils.
Climate warming also threatens an arctic fauna, such as ice bears or tules that are dependent on the ice cover of the ocean.
British who return from Spain are waiting for a two-week quarantine
The British office also called on citizens to avoid all the ways to land Spain, which are not necessary because of the risk of spreading covid-19.
Therefore, the Canary and the Balear Islands are not mentioned, but even after their return, people have to be insulated for two weeks.
The new rules shall enter into force at midnight.
"The protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," the British diplomacy said in its statement.
"We have always made it clear that if this is necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the list of those safe," she added.
As the British Metro newspaper noted, the latest notifications will affect thousands of British travel plans.
Because Spain belongs to a very popular vacation destination.
The British are, inter alia, concerned whether the hospital will be paid if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after return from holidays.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne ordered a ten-day vacation to Lanzarote, flying on Tuesday.
They have ordered the race since December.
"We were supposed to go all the family, my wife Amanda and Bethany's daughter, but to be honest, after this notice, I don't know what's going to happen.
I'm working as a machine leader and I don't think my employer will come back from the vacation two weeks in the quarantine," said Metro Hunter's log quoted.
With regard to Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
During the last two days there, over 900 newly infected people have always arrived in 24 hours.
In some areas, governments are already attending coronovir measures, such as Catalan, trying to limit all nightlife and prevent people from gathering in large.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has newly noted the increased risk of disease in Catalan, Aragonia, Baskick and Madrid.
The government will discuss the buying of electricity from Dukovan
The government will discuss a model of buying electricity from the planned new block of the Dukovana Nuclear Electricity.
The proposal of the law is based on the fact that if the price of the purchase is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through the tariffs.
In the second case, when the buying price will be lower than the market price, the impact on the consumer will be opposed.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final electricity price for the recipient.
Vice-Premier and Industrial Minister Karel Haviček (as ANO) and the CEZ energy company have earlier stated that the more likely option is that people will save their electricity by building.
On the contrary, the analysts note that the long-term view of electricity prices on the market is always uncertain, which the development of the past has shown several times.
The intention has already been criticised by environmental organizations.
"The buy price can be both under the market price of power power and above it.
The final impact of the rules at the time of application can be both negative and positive.
The impact shall be displaced between customers according to the size of security - at lower consumption or by electricity consumption - at higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) indicated in the basis of the material.
In May, he said that he assumes that the high-marketing price of electricity will grow and people will earn on the construction of Dukovan.
Otherwise, the impact of tens of crowns per family will be a year, which is far less than he believes that people are paying annual invoices for electricity to support so-called supported resources.
He had previously estimated that the ransom price could be between 50 to 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 Kč) for megawatthodin (MWh).
The material submitted does not contain any proposal of the amount, shall be contained in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Bureau for 2021, which now the most supplies are currently approximately 45 euros (about 1190 Kč) for MWh.
"With the difference in the purchase price and market prices of power electricity at 10 euros, the supplement of the average household with 3.3 MWh annually - can correspond to four-party households, standardly equipped by electric consumers, including electric security panels and pipes, which does not use electricity for heating and heating warm waters - less than 100 CZK/year," said the basis for the MPO government.
"We live in an incredibly turbulent time.
The pandemic of coronavir showed us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices as a speculative matter," said the CTK executive director of the Energy Investment Group Tomasz Voltr earlier.
The proposed law considers that the purchase would be carried out by the MPO, the respect of its authorised legal person owned by the State at the pre-defined price.
The contract between the investor and the State guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity would be concluded for at least 30 years, with a possible 10-year extension, even repeated, but not long until the low-carbon production is completed.
The low-carbon production proposal defines as a production of electricity with a nuclear reactor attached to the electricity system with an installed capacity of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havliček earlier stated that the new Dukovan Block should have the performance of 1200 MW and produce nine teravathodin electricity annually, which would correspond to the dozen expected Czech consumption.
The block should be entered into operation in 2036.
The new Dukovan bloc's financing model approved by the government on Monday.
The equipment should be financed in no time, with two per cent interest in operation.
The financial model does not agree with opposition, and it also disturbs the possibility that Dukovani would build Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should be part of the building from 70 percent.
The rest should pay the CEZ, which will also pay all the additional costs possible.
The Director-General of Chez Daniel Beneš in May said that the expected sum of the bloc building at current prices is approximately six billion euros (approximately 162 billion crowns).
The treaties between the State and the CEZ on the construction of a new Dukovan bloc will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development downloaded two billion tourism support materials in the media
The material planned by the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) to spend in the media, online and billboards for advertising at holidays in Czech Republic, has withdrawn two billion crowns from the commentary management office.
Minister Clara Dowalová (for ANO) server List of Messages.cz said that the material is still working on.
On the document in EKlep (electronic library of the Legislative Process) acknowledged the Transport Server on Friday.cz.
The Ministry of Plan has justified a disadvantage of travel due to coronavir.
During the coronavir crisis, there was a decline in income and media.
The proposal has raised the criticism of opposition and travel representatives.
According to a proposal that is now to see on the web clidacstat.cz, MMR planned to give through a state travel agency ChechTurism money on television, television, press, internet, billboards or stations on stations.
The biggest piece of money, that's 700 million crowns, would get TVs.
Most of them would get private TVs Nova and Prima.
Printed journals and weeks would receive 400 million and the same part would give MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
The radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which again private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used in the outer advertisement on billboards, LED screens and surfaces on stations or in the metro.
The campaign to support travel in Czech Republic was to begin in the middle of August and take a year.
"The material is still working, it is definitely not in the form that should be presented," said Dottal without further details of the list of reports server.
The material criticised the opposition, according to the head of the TOP 09 Markets of Pekar Adam, would profit from the advertising media from the Prime Minister Andreja Babiša (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this humiliation will be taken on the autumn at the elections of a wound between her eyes," she wrote on Twitter.
Sustainable refuses that it is actually helping the media of the crisis affected.
"It may be a coincidence, I don't know anything about the media support," said Day N on Friday.
It says that the budget is two billion orientation.
"We, of course, are still counting, it may be less and less.
It's a work material," she added.
Initiative Save tourism does not give a media campaign to support domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for travel companies, not a useless advertising campaign," Tomasz Barchik said on Sunday.
If two billion crowns are located in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, not media, the initiative in the open letter to the government.
Living cream, beer and death as a grass
After death is also the third album named A death is a grass grass poet, an immortal cultural organizer and publisher Jaroslav Erica Frice, who also left a year ago, on May 24th.
In Fritch's disclosure, it is the fifth item and, like in previous titles, there is the main emphasis on Fritch's poetry, which itself is an excellent interpreter.
Frič, 1949, was obviously affected by the American beat generation, but this inspiration passed through his own, personally administered experiences and very inner expressions of faith.
However, he was awakening some agitation, if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, irregressive, absolutely tolerance.
I'm thinking of Godslav Reynek (in contrast with John gardener), the masters will apologize.
Fritch's album offers copy readings from 2006, but also performing with musicians who always emotionally accompanied him, whether it was a violoncelist Joseph Key, or Honza Barton and Victors Holata.
I would like to help - with the words of the island poet Peter Hrushka on Frich's long poems.
"They were sailed with proud and infinite bitterness," says Hrushka, "on the state of our world threatened by the disappearance.
The world, which is increasingly falling into a drowned consumption vain and grossness, is increasingly departing from what his soul was created - from the secrets of faith, humility and human neighbourhood.
There was a grip of one who knows that the values for which he was created are little of interest, but who also knows that only because of the universal concern can not be renounced.
These poems reminded that a person may have to lose everything expensive, but no matter how it will lose.
If he sells to the general destruction, he sceptically resigns, scaryly shuts up, or stays in a quiet and proud moment of insisting on what he believes and loves."
Paroubek is not my advisor, said Hamaček
Former Prime Minister and Chairman of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek is not a paid advisor for social democracy.
The President of the Party and the Minister of Interior, Jan Hamakek, only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamack said it today on the Prima Party TV show.
On Friday, the server informed the List of Messages.cz.
"We write a text from time to time, he sends me some material, and I will read it," said Hamaček today.
He added that, however, it is not official and paid cooperation.
He believes that the CHSSD does not have any means to waste them for similar purposes.
"That I sometimes read his opinion, such people are a lot," he said.
In the subsequent debate with the OSS Minister Jan Crnoch said that many members of the ODS are still "inconclusively listening to Václava Klause's opinions".
He thinks it's fine, because it's an experienced policy and the former President of the party, which is also the case of Paroubka.
The fact that the media are making an affirmation was marked by this year's corn season.
The Report List server wrote on Friday that Paroubek fulfils the role of Hamachek's non-official consultant.
He also wrote that in the fourth place of the party's candidate in the restraining region, the former President of the local cell, Peter Benda, who is connected to the Paroubk and acted as Vice-President of his Lev 21.
The hammer said today that the composition of the candidate would not comment until it was complete and approved.
Duplantis has a mile inhibition, it's a crush in his ass, beating the Swedish challenger.
The 22-year-old American ticker has ambitions and potential to be among the most important competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like for two years of younger Duplantis to be defeated last year at the NCAA Association.
"We had a battle a year ago, then he won, and I was the second one, then we threw it out.
In both cases, it was a very good fight," Nilsen describes, who secured the victory with a performance of 5.95 meters.
But Duplantis has shot the roofs up since then, and at the moment he is lonely in the highest spheres.
In only twenty years he became a world recorder, this year on February 8th, in Toruni, he overcome a 6,17 meters, a week later he added a centimetr in Glasgow.
"He jumped six meters since he was 18 years old when he graduated from high school," his nephew Nilsen remembers for the World Athletics Web.
"It was clear that as soon as he grew up from a boy to a man, all his potential and talent would be ten times.
Twenty years is quite a good age to jump into the world's record," she believes.
Being Nilsen's account of successes is more thin than the one who is proud of Duplantis, the American is putting on similar goals.
He has yet indicated his options on the NCAA races that he regularly winned, this year in February he improved his internal personal record to 5.93 m. Last August. Last year he won a gold medal on the panmeric games in Lima, in 2017 he had been fighting into the American trip to the world championship, where he ended 13.
The closest million then is to taste the Diamond League for him for the first time.
"Certainly my priority is to get to the professional circle and race as much as possible in the Diamond Lia, because there you can make a name," she realizes.
"When you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly take the same action as the Olympic Games, the championship of the world, or the panimeric games."
But because of the pandemic, these high holidays are delayed, which gives Nilsen and others time to improve.
But will it be enough to reach Duplantis, who can easily turn the race under five rounds into just a struggle for silver?
"Everyone is trying to reach him, but I don't think it will be possible at the nearest time," Nilsen considers.
"The boy's been jumping for 16 years, and he's got a mile inclination over all the others."
And before Tokyo starts 2021, he'll want to increase it.
The woman spent hundreds of thousands of disability pensions of an impossible son.
The court is waiting for her.
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from a state as a disability pension is primarily intended for improving the quality of his life.
A woman's defeat is threatened for eight years of imprisonment.
Because of a bad health condition, the court removed the sick man’s rightness and appointed his mother a guardian who, inter alia, had to manage his son’s money.
"Women used part of the financial retirement of the son's disability for his need from half November 2013 to January this year," said the police speaker Dana Ladman, saying that the accused woman had a specially established obligation to protect the interests of the damaged.
Although the woman was in charge of the court, she made an account for her son, but she had his retirement sent to her account.
"After paying the costs associated with the stay of a son in the healthcare and the remuneration of the necessary medicinal products, she used the remaining funds for the purchase of vehicles, electricians and households," the plaintiff states.
That she can't use her son's money for her own needs, she confessed.
But she was trying to help them pay family expenses.
"We had problems with our income to pull a move of home.
We've never been buying anything highly standard.
It was always about things that the son would approve of buying.
I thought it was family money.
I didn't know that I was doing a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised she'd give the money to her son.
North America has been settled for 30,000 years, according to scientists after finding tools
The findings from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican State of Zacatecas include 1930 instruments of vaccination, including gentle blades that could be used to cut the meat, and the top objects that could serve as a crushing of spears or spears.
Scientists found that the oldest instruments come from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean from the University of Zacatecas, and the main author of one of the two studies that were published on this subject in the magazine Nature.
The youngest instruments reach 12,500 years old.
According to experts, people of Chiquihuite cave, located in a large supersea height, have been living for over 20,000 years.
The generally recognised theory has discussed that the first representatives of the type Homo sapiens crossed the land bridge from today's Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spears of spears used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, showed that this clovi culture was subsequently expanded in the largest part of North America.
This model, however, has been produced in the last decades, when several ancient settlements were discovered, which were two to three thousand years older.
In the second study published in the magazine Nature, 42 different locations throughout North America have proved human presence on the continent in the period from 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small quantity of people could have come to the North American land before it was expected.
Some of them could get ships to America.
"It is obvious that people in America have been long before the development of the so-called clovian culture," stated anthrolope Ruth Gruhn of the University in the Canadian Province of Alberta.
The interest in tickets is yet filled with an optimistic scenario, claims sellers.
The prices are also gradually reduced.
The sales are growing every week in Czech Republic.
In addition to last summer, the interest is still approximately half, but demand is increasing every week to 20 percent.
Developing after the crisis, according to sellers, fills the most optimistic scenarios.
Increasingly, the prices of the airlines are also reduced.
Among the most searched destinations are sellers, in particular the Southern European States.
According to Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy and Greece are leading.
The lotuška portal.cz is most selling flights to Croatian Split.
From other countries, then, is the most searched Great Britain, which, however, belonged to the most burdened destinations ever.
The average price of the flights is also reduced.
At the lotuška portal.cz, approximately half a month, it was about 6250 crowns, a mid-yearly 3,000 crowns less.
This is primarily caused by an increase in the demand for European destination, which now constitutes about 85 per cent of sales.
However, the prices themselves to some European places, such as Spain or Italy, have dropped about five in the past weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers who are now buying tickets with much less than before, because they are afraid of the further development of the coronavir situation.
According to previous information, Kiwi.com's time of shopping of a ticket prior to the flight decreased by about ten days each year.
"It confirms the future trend when people will order tickets with a much smaller range, they will require greater flexibility, less risk," said Vice-President for Kiwi.com Products.
Currently, the average booking time is before leaving 21 days.
The number of renewed airlines from Czech Republic is also increasing together with sales growth.
In the Prague airport, regular lines are currently running to more than 60 destinations.
The last summer season is approximately half the destination.

Almost 9,600 of them have already been healed, 368 patients died.
At present, 5 254 people are sick.
It comes from the data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded four hundred times.
Maxim was the Friday 281 cases.
The positive 235 tests were tested on Thursday, a day earlier 246 and Tuesday 206.
In the first working day of this week, 169 infected were arrived.
From covidu-19, 9 590 people have already been healed in Czech Republic, that is 63 percent of all yet infected.
Most of the disease had a mild progress.
In the hospital, according to the recent data of the Ministry of Health, 151 people with coronavir, 19 of which are considered to be serious.
There are several fires of covid-19 in Czech Republic.
Most infected in the last seven days in the count of 100,000 inhabitants continue to show Karvinia, almost 59.
Follows Jihlava's district with 56 and Frydecko-Mestecko with 36 infected with 100 000 inhabitants in the last week.

People must wear roasts on the internal mass action over 100 people, it is about cultural and sports activities, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
Since Monday, the capacity of these actions from the current thousands of people to half will be limited.
In the world, the number of people who have been proofly infected with the new coronavir has exceeded 16 million.
This was stated by the American University of Johns Hopkins, which is a global pandemic development.
The balances of victims who died with covid-19 are approaching 645 thousand according to this source.
The latest million infected arrived in statistics in only three days; the border of 15 million fell on July 22th.

Infections have appeared in almost all countries of the world, the first case has now been officially announced by KLDR.
The household air is up to five times worse than the outside.
Health damages air refrectors and diodorants
Health threatens not only the bad quality of air in outer spaces but also at home.
Carol Abraham, an Israeli expert on human health, already quoted the Journal of Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who had earned the establishment of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, we need to focus on damages in households just now when many have spent more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned the research of the American Environment Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than the outer.
The World Health Organization (WHO) believes that because of the bad quality of air in its homes, 3.8 million people die a year ago.
"Because of the epidemic of coronavir, which has forced many and forced them to work from home, people must spend more hours in their homes than before, so it is time to focus on the quality of air in households," said Abraham.
In Israel, it says that almost no one cares about the quality of home air.
Dangerous, however, may be things with which a person normally comes into contact - accommodation, air refrectors, disinfective means, diodorants or pesticides.
"The poisonous gas also produces the clothes we regularly carry into the cleaning room," said Abraham.
The children, old family members, and respiratory people are most in danger.
Otherwise, individuals can start to suffer problems such as headache, dizziness, irritation of nose roads, nose bleeding, vomiting or skin allergy.
During the long-term exhibition of unhealthy substances, internal authorities and central nervous system may be damaged.
Not all damages, but originate from household objects, the source may also be the material from which the houses are built.
quest on Václav Hawl: How long he spent in prison and what made him write to Chart 77

"I know that Havel's word could not hear at all in his 60s.
But then the president congratulated him on his birthday letter and suddenly his dad's relationship with him began to change," Dominica recalls.
The rest of the ten years later, even Gott invited the former president to celebrate his seventieth at the Ambassador Hotel at the Vaclava Square.
