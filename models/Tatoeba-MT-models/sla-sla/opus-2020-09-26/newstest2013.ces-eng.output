Strategy of the Republican Party against Obam re-elected
The Republican leaders have justified their policy by the need to combat electoral frauds.
Brennan’s center, however, refers to such a fraud as a myth that the election fraud is less frequent than the number of people who die after the bulb.
The Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in the past ten years.
One is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the election participation.
In this regard, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, in the United States, individual States are responsible for organizing federal elections.
And in this spirit, most of the American governments have declared new laws that make the election or recording difficult.
This phenomenon recorded the volume after the elections in November 2010, during which 675 new republic representatives arrived in 26 States.
As a result, only for 2011, 180 proposals of a law restricting election law were submitted in 41 States.
The new election laws require the voters to present the identity of the photograph and the evidence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the election period in advance, disregard the right to register the voters on the day of the elections and take the election right to citizens with a record in the criminal register.
Before the elections in 2006, no American State required the presentation of the identity of the elections with the photograph.
The first state that took this request was Indiana.
The Constitution of the Indian Law confirmed the United States Supreme Court in 2008.
The Republican authorities have hurried to extend this procedure to other countries.
In the past two years, they supported the proposals for such laws in 34 countries to force the voters to present the identity of the photograph.
It should be noted that, unlike Quebec, American citizens have no universal identity, such as the card of health insurance.
In fact, they don't own 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people in age allowing to vote, no identity card issued by the government of their state.
There is no such identity for about five million new voters in 2012.
The acquisition of the required ID is often more than $100.
The new restrictions are inappropriately affected mainly by young, minority and low-income persons.
25% of the African Americans, 15% of persons with income under $35,000; 18% of citizens aged 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years of age have no required identity with photography.
And that's not all.
Students who are acquainted with their tendency to democratic candidates are not authorized in several countries to use their ID with a photograph presented by their school.
On the other hand, States shall allow members of the hunting or fisheries clubs, who choose rather the Republican candidates, cards presented by these clubs in elections.
Until 2004, no State required a civility document for elections.
The first request was made by Arizon.
Since 2011, approximately 12 states have adopted laws which lay down the obligation of the voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly intended to limit the number of votes from the Spanish minority.
It is important to note that two of the three Spanish have preferred the Democratic Party.
In 2011, the Republican legislatives supported laws in eight states which disrupt the record of voters on the day of the elections.
In addition, they restricted the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to the voters who want to register.
These restrictions have their consequences.
For example, during the general elections in 2004, campaigns for recording voters helped to register approximately 10 million inhabitants.
The measures taken after 2009, however, decreased in the recording of new voters in 2010 by 17% against 2006.
In the next five states, the Republican legislators adopted laws aimed at reducing the election period in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general elections, in Florida, the African Americans formed 33% of the voters who voted in advance, although only 13% of the African American voters in this state.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
They created only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voted in advance.
On the other hand, the white people who represented 76% of all voters were only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, against the approval of laws restricting the registration of the voters, democratic legislators and their supporters were very emphasized.
Democratic governors blocked their veto several law proposals.
In order to stop the validity of the most controversial laws, the General Prosecutor of the United States even affected.
Partially, they were able to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 countries accepted the laws required to present the identity of the photograph.
However, the new rules introduced are completely unsupportable in 2012 to the implementation of the voting law.
Democratic criticism speaks primarily of the predictability of the approved laws and considers it obviously an effort to influence the results of the elections in 2012 in key states.
The report of the 2011 Brennan Centre shows that the States where these laws were approved represent 171 of 270 votes in the elections necessary for victory in the presidential elections.
It is too early to declare that these legislative changes at the election system level will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential elections in 2012.
However, one is certain today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on election participation.
In this regard, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Discovery of prostate cancer: absorb the test or not?
The PSA test led to the wrong results that were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, which led to unnecessary medical action.
All of this has increased the hesitation of men who have been so embarrassed to go to the examination.
Let yourself investigate or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
The studies conducted in the United States showed a high level of contamination among individual tested groups, thus it is difficult to interpret these results and to make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, has established a different mortality among patients who have been investigated, and those who did not follow them.
This study also proved after a 12-year-old distance that those who do not go to the examination have a 30-40% higher risk of metastasis.
So I recommend a 50-year-old study or 40 years of age if your direct relative had a cancer of prostate.
The more dangerous groups are also men of African America's origin.
The key is to take the right decision as soon as cancer is discovered.
There are aggressive types of cancer and such species that are intact.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the danger rate of his type of cancer, to offer possible alternatives, not necessarily treat the cancer of prostate that does not have a long-term impact on life, and focus on active monitoring of disease in these cases.
Today, a number of men who have been diagnosed cancer are not treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and is not threatening their lives.
We'll offer them more active surveillance, and we'll offer them treatment in the event of a disease progression.
Still more and more accurately, we set criteria that help to decide, which kind of treatment and which is not.
Nevertheless, I recommend that the examinations be graduated.
However, it is important to engage in an interview with your doctor and to determine whether the study is appropriate or not.
In collaboration with the International Urological Company, the Movember movement created a tool that allows to evaluate for and against in relation to the PSA study.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure for preventing cancer.
Despite progress in research, it seems to be the best means to limit the risk of illness acceptance of the principles of healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if everyone eats healthy and moves enough, 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this information would increase at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, speaker of Canadian Cancer Research Society.
On the contrary, approximately 10% of cancer disease is estimated to cause inheritance.
Some percentage also remains completely unexplained.
The Canadian Cancer Research Society remains the priority of the fight against smoking, even though the number of smokers falls.
Cigarette is worth 85% of the case of pneumonia cancer.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
That makes human health very harmful.
"It's still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," speaker André Beauliu's head.
Encouragement: 10 years after the smoker stops smoking, it reduces the risk of death to cancer by half.
Weight
Temperature and obsession are according to SCC another risk factor for disease.
Increase the risk of breast cancer, fat intestinals and endorsement, barbecue, slippers, and utensils.
"The research shows that regular physical activity has been protecting the whole life from the cancer of the fat infection," the report adds.
Food
The organisation also recommends that the consumption of red meat be limited.
In too high consumption, it may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is appropriate to avoid the harvests that apply to the same.
Conservation of meat with use, drying or salt may lead to the creation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to organism cells and lead to cancer development," the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists focused on the connection between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet made clear conclusions.
Studies focused on vitamin E are disadvantaged according to SCC.
Although one of them has reduced the risk of prostate cancer, other studies speak more of its increase.
Even the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly demonstrated.
Mr. Beauliu continues to insist on how important it is to talk about his concerns and precedents from his family with his doctor.
"Training the examination doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
Higgs' boson is explored
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs' boson has caused a legitimate disturbance in the summer.
There is a view that this boson is participating in a mechanism responsible for all the materials in the universe.
And the latest particle whose existence predicts the standard model - our best or "the least bad" explaining the nature and conduct of the matter - which has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is no 100 per cent certainty between physics yet that this is Higgs' boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle that is very similar to Higgs' boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the large Physical Congress in Kyoto are more confirmed, but there are still all data missing so that we can be absolutely certain.
However, let's assume that this is Higgs' boson, since the risk of the mistake appears to be a small one, and let's see what's actually happening.
In this world, a completely unsubsitable law is applicable, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule can't go around - and don't try too hard, otherwise you'll hurt yourself.
Even though particle physics is a very strange world, it shows that it also applies to a similar law: Pauli's exclusive principle, according to which two particles cannot take the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum" state - this "state" is some of their characteristics.
Fysical particles continue to be divided into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find organized citizens, or farms who obediently follow Pauli's principle.
And on the other end, bossmen, creepy anarchists, who don't respect anything -- of course not this principle, which means that they can be at the same time.
These bosones are further divided into two groups according to the device (in addition to the completely amazing), which is the Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley Labs: the meats that we leave here without notice, and the "power particles", which are spreading large natural forces and which Higgs' boss is probably related to in some way.
However, it is necessary to say that these bosoes are not as exotic animals as it might be expected.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with an unusual banality: photon, or particle of light, which is "measures" of electromagnetic power.
Because when the power bullet particles accelerate or change their direction, it's going to "free" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, just like a bullet thrown into the pond.
This "explosion" comes from an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultrafial radiation etc.) and this wave is nothing but a photon -- and that is one of the bosons, the "power carriers".
Stable fields
It's also with Higgs' boson, just with the difference that "closing" takes another field, the Higgs field to show this boson.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; its excitement needs to be achieved by very high energy values, just as in the freezing pond level, it will be just a very large cotton.
For this reason it is necessary to use such a huge acceleration of the part as an accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large hadronic accelerator with incidence links is a circle with a circle of 27 km! - to be able to develop such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field again fits to explain the relationship between Higgs and the material.
Electromagnetic fields do not react either to all particles or materials.
Some, such as magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep on the refrigerator.
And as well, with the Higgs field, they don't respond to all particles: those who do so have a certain material, while others (such as the photon, let's look at it) have it.
And Mrs. Novak asks, what are all these research about, what are they bringing us?
For science, it is to confirm the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows the physics to examine any disagreement between the observation and the SM forecasts.
In addition, few physicians literally wish to be able to find them, because the smallest difference could open the space "new physics" and heal some spaces in the model.
It is necessary to establish that the model has huge shortcomings so far, does not bring any clarification of gravity (aye!) or dark materials that form approximately 80% of the universe material (again!).
However, the CERN device has not yet revealed such a dispute.
Reactions
The responses of these studies in the daily life of Mrs. and Mrs. Newakov can only be predictable very difficult, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be none.
See: At the beginning of the 1960 ’ s, the pioneers had no laser in Bell’s labs or awareness of the revolution, they will already have their work.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
The physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser radiation (preceding pulse) in 1962, I have already said - the laser was initially considered such a "player to the lab".
Just imagine...
In addition, the application may come from all the instruments surrounding the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small lightsaver in 1969 during his work focused on optics.
This sighter, even though Boyle didn't plan it at the beginning at all, now serves as "o" of all digital cameras in the world and gave him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, it doesn't mean that activities around the LHC have to change our life, but that means that a person really never knows...
Paliative care - Best way to leave your life... ‹ Le Devoir
By means of its Commission for Death of Death, Quebec recently incorporated into a courageous question about the end of his life.
The debate should proceed soon, and the law's proposal is being made at the same time.
There is still a lot to do in this critical area.
The Le Devoir magazine tried to look into this question more detailedly.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Monterregia.
The cancer of prostate that feeded him gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of life and it's seven," he says without emotions on his bed in the house for palyative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where the last day arrived.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The sickness has done its work: enormous weakness prevents him from taking himself to the toilet or just eating himself.
He resigns his taste looking at breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He is courageous and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop at him, brings him medicines, offers bath.
The courage to usual death.
"My biggest wish is to get rid of the barrier, it humiliates me," he conferred.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a drug on his problem.
"In the entire life, a person learns that the men of urine are standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in the Victor-Gadbois device.
Return to the child phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the ability of the man," whether he accepts the return, the psychologist claims.
According to the opinion of a number of people dealing with palyative care, essential moments occur in the same core of such return.
Patients who enter home with palyative care of Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is at least three months of life.
In this stage, the team of doctors and sisters who care for them does not provide their so-called "treatment" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear of dying is "for the drowning of full consciousness."
But the sickness allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I don't have any wishes in my life," he says, and then he will allow us to put her in a breathing device.
Still, they are still looking forward to the last visit of a son from Italy in the next days.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in collaboration with a volunteer group, body care is provided with food.
It looks like a palyatic care that comes, if nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Québek, one bed of palyative care on 11,700 inhabitants is appearing.
That's very little if we realize we're all gonna die once.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Whatever is the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, for example, a brandy or pepsi can be provided, according to the taste.
Diabetics don't have to watch the sugar level anymore.
And death is part of everyday life here.
They wore a beer to Mr. X last night, who died later at night.
This morning, his son will drink a beer for the honor of his dead father.
"We are helping patients as well as their neighbours," Nathalie Savard, director of the custody service, said.
Victor-Gadbois's home is going days after each other, but they don't like each other.
With regard to a thirty - nineteen - year - old man who rejoices with his last meeting with his family thoroughly based on the pillows, while they give him to his honour, a tragically sixty - year - old man surrounded by his parents, his wife and two small children after he tried all the possibilities to survive.
"For six months, there are always three to five beds designed for cancer people over 45 years," Dr. Christiane Martel said.
53% of the patients who come to Victor-Gadbois are coming here from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palyative care
It is said that 77% of the Canadians simply do not have access to palyative care, i.e. to care, which is intended to mitigate suffering when the sick person grows to the final stage of his life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the custody house.
And several organisations, such as Victor-Gadbois and the Home Paliative Treatment Society of Grand Montréal, are specialized more exclusively for the care provided to oncological patients.
And this essential lack of health care in Quebec leads to a number of doctors specialised for palyative care are concerned about the adoption of the Eutanasia law and the assisted suicide.
Since October, the manifest has been signed with a peak in the area of palyatic treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which their disagreement with such initiatives.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not sufficient to ensure access to quality palyative care before it can agree with the implementation of eutanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in emergency in huge pain without making any necessary steps to relieve her.
He fears that patients do not ask for death because they do not receive suitable care.
At the same time, a number of oncologists care for their patients until the last moments, regardless of the adverse prognosis.
The hope for the survival of Helène Richards was minimal when she left a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was finishing the treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she told us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of the sick people who wish to die thank her doctors for not fulfilling their wishes when the palyative pussy team mitigated their pain.
However, it is necessary to say that palyative care is definitely not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, the Paliative Care Director in the Grand Montréal Home Paliative Care Society, patients are preventing the treatment of pain in 8% of cases.
At the end of their life, physicians often use palyative sedatives that sleep until the scope, whether or not the sedatives are permanently administered.
You can't pretend that we don't take this part of suffering.
The patient we don't get rid of pain will have more access to palyative sedatives.
Patients who are not granted sedative always say the same: "I want to die."
But that doesn't always need to mean "I want you to give me eutanasia," that means, rather, "I want you to get rid of my pain."
The implementation of this report allowed the grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extensive reality scandals in Quebec
The travel management officials, the construction and public practices, the lobbyst political parties and the Italian mafia experts continue to tell what they know about the amazing "system" in which buildings, state officials, politicians, experts and mafians are mixed.
This "department" came from Quebec taxpayers very expensively between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has broken up since we have taken essential measures," says Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec messenger and former police chief in Montreal.
In 2011, the scandal broke out on the basis of a consistent investigation aimed at fraud of funds in relation to the Quebec road construction contracts, which then the Liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest approved after long delays.
The Duchesneau report confirmed the direct link between the industry, the non-transparent financing of the parties and the corruption of state officials.
"So far from the beginning of the 2010 investigation," he says, "the Ministry of Transport only spared a billion dollars" when some people kept their instincts on them!
Charbonneau's committee "but leading two mayors to demision," adds with hope that she can "cover the truth of some people".
Permanent Unit for Combating Corruption Based in 2011
The Permanent Unit for Combating Corruption, based in 2011, is also involved in combating its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
In addition, Marteau's family officers have made sure that the Montreal Monetary Cartel of Money Guides, since 2009, significantly mitigate...
In the past few weeks, they conducted a series of searches and accused the fraud and corruption of a number of general representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of one town in the predecession.
The next one on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his function of the mayor of the town of Laval, the third largest town of Quebec.
He's suspected that he repeatedly accepted payments in exchange for public procurement.
The formal charges have already been received from transport engineers from Montreal and Italian businesses, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito called the sensation by explaining the "system" mechanism to obtain public procurement.
He himself devoted 3% of the value of the procurement that he received in Montréal, to the mediator associated with the mafia, which then transferred the Union Montréal side, for which Mayor Gerald Tremblay was running.
In 2000, Zambito was generous to all parties and devoted over 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, but in particular to the Liberals that were at the power.
He also acknowledged that he organized illegal finance search for former Liberal Vice-Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Procurement of moneywaters whose prices he has overflowed
In Montreal, the "system" corruption worked very well.
Gilles Surprenant, former transport engineer, described it very detailedly before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from construction companies, invitation to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and pockets worth a total of $766,000 in exchange for money-level procurement, for which he paid the price.
Other public operators in the transport sector have admitted that they have been allowed to pay rewards for overestimating 30% to 40% invoices through untrue multiplication.
The Mayor's Officer, Martin Dumont, then accused Tremblaye of keeping his eyes on the concomitant budget that brought dirty money to his treasury.
On the basis of these discoveries, Tremblay departed at the beginning of November by throwing Montréal into a large crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal Members who issued a warning signal.
As the mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies region on the east of the island, it has already been argued against the sale of the general property purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1,6 million promotors in the middle of a prosperous real estate trade.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be launched, says that "waits for threads in trying to understand the function of the nurse system to stop the gangren and get the guilty."
The process, according to her, is "sick, but positive."
We are at the stage of cleaning the wound, but we need to set up our own investigative unit in Montréal and ensure that these doubtful practices cannot be restored.
It's like she's cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public actors have removed hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly afraid of the role of "messengers informed about this letter" if they are not wet in these shoes!
It estimates that 70% of the funding of the electoral campaigns in Québek comes from dirty money, and it adds with irony, "I heard it was just a weak courage of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit gifts to the parties to $100, but he believes it will not solve the situation: "If the election costs are strictly limited, dirty money from politics will not disappear."
It proposes a comprehensive control of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We can no longer fall down; if we focus bravely on the element of things, we can rebuild on stronger grounds and with greater control and enforcement of laws."
If this story blackened the picture of Quebec and Montreal in abroad, Duchesneau recommends everyone who laughs at him to look at their own court...
"PG is not FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you and PSG have set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by all individuals walking into each other, or by a completely new dimension of PSG.
Great players came to us.
Every day, I'm getting along with them.
Technical team also helped me.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the game level.
And it's easier at the games.
It's all going so fast in the football.
I'm not losing my head.
Since my beginnings in the preparatory in INF Clairefontaine until after the transition to Saint-Etienne, I have always moved for a single degree.
So you're using the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti introduced...
The supports of this summer are used to play games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And that shows that a player like me has a bigger taste for collapse and wants to make the maximum performance.
Plus, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position.
He's got assistants on his hand, like Claude Makelle, who played on the same post as I did.
And does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all the techniques.
Today he has no equality in the 1st League and belongs to the best European coaches.
He's got huge experience, and he's got a lot of titles with the top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he'll win the other titles in Paris.
In January, I graduated a comforting conversation with him.
I had a number of injuries behind me.
The trust that he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
Lyon took our head position in the 1st League.
But we're staying in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the League of Masters: we have come very easily to the eight-fine.
What is your club's goal in this competition?
Let's try to go as far as we can.
Now anything can happen.
But we certainly want to be a difficult rival for qualitative European teams.
We want to win our qualification group first before Port so we can play 8-final back at home.
Can PSG become a large European club in a short-term horizon?
The budget's already...
In order to become a great European club, Paris must win titles and register history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial page, PSG has funds to achieve this intention.
And would it be a great failure not to win in the 1st League like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year we really want to win a league title.
We've missed enough in the last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We've collected 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had a season even more amazing.
I think it's gonna work this year.
Even though big teams, such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, also strive for the title, I think we have weapons available to defeat them.
Do you think the PSG media expect too much?
It's not unusual to expect much from us with regard to what was invested here and what players we have.
We're totally accepting that.
The fact is, if we defeat Troyes 4:0 at home and there's still something they're counting on in the newspapers, it's not very pleasant.
A person asks what more people can want from you.
Of course it's not to win 4:0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set our game style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Lisa of Masters, we've been able to play.
Look at Manchester City, who hasn't been fighting into the 8th-fine season, and they also invested large amounts!
Given the invested sums, you could expect you to have 15 points in advance!
You insult the other clubs and the French League.
The Lyon and Marseille Clubs, who have failed too much in the last season, have moved with the new PSG to another stage.
This shows how great the 1st League is.
I hope we can smile in May and say that, despite all the difficulty, we have been able to win.
It seems as if PSG in everything relied on the performances of Zlatana Ibrahimovice.
It's good to say there's "dependence on Zlatan."
That means that Ibrahimovic is very effective and gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and proves he's a star of the 1st League.
Wherever he passed, he proved to be a big player, a world star.
We respect man and players in our team.
He also respects the people he's got around.
What he has achieved is really exceptional.
This led to others to increase their own game level.
Thiago Silva, who belongs to the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow alongside.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like disappointment.
I really wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately, I couldn't play the way I imagined.
But I experienced it, and I got stronger.
I can play good games today.
And that's what I've been hoping of since I've come to the representation.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to make our performance example.
How do you look at the first months of Didiera Deschampse headed by the national team?
They're talking the results for him.
We're in a good place in MS qualification.
Coach chooses strictly, is close to players and can inspire for victory.
That was Laurent Blanc.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc has achieved our goal by qualifying for Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.
Is the remise (1:1) of 16 October in Spain a solid standing match?
This game gave us his self-consciousness.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I didn't have a game like that for my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and costs for processing between recipients.
In addition, as often true in these technologies, there is an obvious political view: the belief that the existing financial system built on banking monopols leads to financial crisis.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudom), represents as virtual money (but translated to dollars, euro...), so secure transmission protocol like BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between partners.
Thanks to 15,000 computers involved in the network, approximately 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoines as gifts or as a payment fund.
The bitcoin course first reached the maxima 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later dropped to 2 dollars, today it moves on the border of about $10 (transview courses is listed on the bitcoincharts.com page).
In comparison with the world's exchange for real money or financial products, it is nothing impressive.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its Virtual Finance Report, which came out in October.
Bitcoin refers to "the most successful virtual money", "contesting dollar and euro" and "the period of usual money".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual money by being used as " credit" for the process in a video game that a person gets a game or can buy (and leckdy and back).
The Facebook Social Network has also developed a similar system.
However, each month, the central authority shall monitor and process individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all the nets are the depositors of the book of common accounts, controllers, emissions of money and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user may choose a different address for each payment by providing anonymity.
The information file related to this transaction is electronicly signed by the encryption system with a double key.
This means that the network can verify the right of transaction.
With the content of the file, it is further possible to ensure that changing bitcoins exist in the public book of common accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is in the record of this new transaction in this book.
It takes place by resolving the mathematical task given to the computers whose solvent, some temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.
It is a phase of cutting the file; i.e. transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers will take over this new transaction and add a number to it, and then they'll just cut the whole.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (suitable zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other knots are easy to check its correctness.
The transaction shall then be indestructiblely displayed connected to the chain of all other transactions; any adjustment would change the print.
If the user wants to pay twice the same money very quickly (in ten minutes), the network will only confirm one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned because each of them has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward is shared regularly by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in the circuit is so limited to 21 million, but they can be divided to a hundred million, so the market space is...
The difficulty of the given task also increases with the rising level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its rises and falls.
Web sites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and stored by bitcoin.
"The use of the sculin does not relate to the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paimium, a real money-payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibility of laundering dirty money through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Significant players like Wikipedia reject the gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Constitution in Israel recently analysed the book of common accounts and proved that nearly 80% of the bitcoins did not move.
In November, the "great discounts" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been replaced," Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul with the conversion of bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the pedagogical book on these money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is an equivalent credit card (with real money) or incontact mobile payment, but uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are cheaper.
Furthermore, the carrier manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easily set up in traders where there are no need to install new terminals or software.
All you need to do is give the address that can be "fotografed and recognised", says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users already.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems and transition to more horizontal systems.
"Before the Bitcoin settles, it will take a while, but 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
In addition, in its report, the ECB assumes the re-evaluation of the various risks that are considered to be increased today, if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French units left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and US units should follow the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghanistan army take over its territory and choose their own future and do not expect anything from us.
The greatest injury was suffered by people in the Afghan village that we were punished because we considered them terrorists.
And we also, because we've lost 88 soldiers killed, and all those wounds and crushing.
Talibans are composed of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often are rurals who deny the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even when the Jehadians, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbek, Tadžik.
Now tolerants are being experienced and often helped by local rebels, but if western forces retreat, their support will fall down.
The departure of the French units from the Nyjrab base, which I was watching from the mountains placed by the Mandolans through the French loans, has passed in order.
The convoys of trucks and pencil cars arrived in Cabul without attack at the air escort of the helicopter.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will not be so active in Kabul.
The conditions have changed significantly since their unstoppable process in 1994 to 1996.
Cabul was then empty and the country was in the blood and fire due to fighting between different combat groups.
Their oversight over the country was then considered to be their type of release, return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the darkness of these rurals, who was fully controlled by the Al-Ka'id organization, but their situation has not improved until our time.
Some Mujahedins, Afghan government and current Talibans agree in an effort to maintain women in a subcontracted position.
The chief leaders of the war against the Soviet units returned to power in 2001.
They became businesses, powered state lands that were selling as construction lands to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge American contracts for subcontractors.
They were discredited; most of them were never even in battle.
According to what I heard in campaigns, people want a government that will not create thieves.
A number of young people want to leave as they leave those who have been able to use American generosity: the escape of capital is significant.
Young people are already tired of war and related ideology.
During the exile in Iran or Pakistan, they recognized the modern world, and its advantages took them.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years; 5 million people now live in Kabul, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, public schools are full, girls and boys go there.
These young people will need to provide work, and they do not want to return to the darkness of the previous parties or to corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including armed opposition, likes mobile phones; TVs and Turkish series that show modern world, watch everywhere.
The army's already here.
Will the authorities that stand in her head be considered legitimate?
Some former leaders of the Soviet Army are already renewing provincial police that will be out of control of central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should be awaiting a certain degree of decentralization according to the model of Western States, but the United States wanted to convert it into centralised become with a strong presidential influence, so there was an abolition of the post of the Prime Minister that existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.
The President Karzai does not want foreign controls, in particular when elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been significantly dependent on foreign assistance since the 50 ’ s and previous years.
No industries have been renewed, no barriers are working, no major inflammation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, just fruit and vegetables.
The advantage is a private initiative.
In the country destroyed by three decades of war, government infrastructure control would be necessary.
The news is that Afghanistan has a huge irrigational wealth.
And it just made it sense that the Western States were here only to power it.
Without energy to process iron rude or copper on the spot and without means to transport raw materials over the mountains, no rainbow can run.
The Chinese have already left the mine on the copper of Mes Aynak and left international archaeological teams (for the support of the World Bank) the possibility to explore a wide range of Buddhist areas to maintain the role of the most important employer in the province.
One day, it will also be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depends on large imports and exports, renew normal relations.
The departure of the French fighting units was completed on November 20th.
The new collaboration provides for the continuation of common aid types: girls and boys lycea, French cathedrals in universities, French institute, military, legal, health and agricultural areas, support for archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which has been abolished in 2012, but has achieved a numerous French non-governmental organization of a number of successes in the field of common interest and agricultural renewal in the tens of mountain villages.
These works, in which the quantities of local workers were involved, helped to embarrass the rebellion: moisture, wells, drinking water, forestry, fruit trees, soil protection and proliferation of the processing area.
What memories will we leave after two billion euros of military expenditure?
A much smaller budget would contribute to improving local living conditions that are very difficult in these valleys, which are often at an excessive height of over 2,000 m.
The Embassy received dozens of written applications for small agricultural assistance from local communities in the Kapisa province.
In order to free these farmers from the rebellion of foreign groups, they wish to achieve minor civil assistance in their favour, which would be properly controlled and touched directly.
Hard work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Mursí has entered the next poker party.
While Egypt remains most divided in his history because of the announcement of a constitution which temporarily grants unlimited powers to him, he decided to play a bab.
In the Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the views of all others, that the Constitutional Meeting will approve the final text tomorrow.
A few weeks ago, the head of the State granted this meeting for another two months to complete the necessary work.
For nearly two years Egypt has used a comparison text that has been repeatedly supplemented, which weakens the constitutional stability of the country and leads to legal arguments.
This new initiative has only strengthened the country's diversity.
From the view of opposition, the president is being held in his "autocratic delirium", continues "willing his word" and "crewing the right."
However, his advocates ensure that it is a means as soon as possible to push with the constitutional and political crisis and speed up the transition process.
There should be a referendum in two weeks.
It is a very short time passage that will make the Brotherhood move away from the intention of the text to the Egyptians to explain the article after the article.
It is also a way for the president to re-establish national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country rejects protests.
As he confirmed in an interview for the American week Time, Muhammad Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
Especially because this rapidly organised vote builds the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: "You will approve my text, or I will keep unlimited powers", which should otherwise be terminated after the approval of the new Constitution.
And in this special air yesterday, 85 members of the mentioned Constitutional Meeting with a large majority of Islamists approved the text.
Most of the Liberals in the vote were missing.
In mid November, shortly before the constitution was released, they broke the doors with no possibility to make their opinions.
The defenders of human rights, civil society or members of religious minorities have imitated their step.
To achieve acquisition, 11 persons from a series of substitutes were quickly completed yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brotherhood.
Then it will not be surprised that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators further stopped on the fact that one of the few disputes was turning around that day... prayer hours when some members of the committee had the opinion that the hours in the meeting room were not correctly ordered.
The text that has been voted yesterday is composed of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, is finally consistent with the version of the 1971 Constitution and provides that "the principles of the law of the chariya are the main source of law".
Salaphistic parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoped that they would replace the term "the principles" with the term "regulation", which would allow more strict application.
For Islamists again the fact that this article has not been repaired represents the sign of their good will and respect against the other part of the Egyptian society.
"Operation," say Liberals who see only a speaking problem in this.
They say that the islamation of the constitution is carried out through other articles.
In particular, they focus on Article 220, which entrusts the al-Azhar University's advisory role, in particular for the control of the conformity of laws with the law of chario.
According to the expert at Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing, because "persons called for expression are not chosen and have no democratic legitimacy.
It can be seen in the beginnings of theocracy."
The fears of Liberals even more excites the fact that the next university rektor should be less moderate than the existing.
"No concrete religious consequence has yet occurred.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not disadvantaged but university workers, a number of of them studied in French schools," mild concerns Alexis Bluet, who is preparing the work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, it agrees that "the interpretation of Article 220 may be a dispute, as the term used in it belongs to the religious dictionary.
There is, in particular, a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic Legal Science, recognition.]
And in the future, there may be a question of how competent civil judges are to be able to express themselves."
The approved text yesterday is very criticised because of the enlarged powers he grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that their significant limitations have occurred against the former regime.
Another controversial place: the powers conferred to the army.
In accordance with the wish of the military representatives, the verification of the defence budget will not be carried out by Parliament but by the National Defence Council.
The military courts will not continue to be prohibited from dealing with civilians, as required by the Human Rights Association.
This association speaks about the text that they believe to be directed against freedom, on their doubts.
The punishment act is preserved and the insult is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, in particular for the press.
Furthermore, no article is concerned with the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef from the Human Rights Watch.
It considers that the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word has not been mentioned in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was going to show up on the television speech last night, the manifestations were planned for this afternoon.
The heads of the State will then manifest on Saturday.
In Israel, there are holy places, poops of the world and sea from saturated soli solution
The promised earth combines the size of Bible truths, modern comfort and intactness of nature.
The AAF identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Worship to Holy Places
To visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that all those who enter this bathtub will come up with God's mercy.
And Galilee - the place of Jesus' miracles: the change of water in wine in the wedding, walking through water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here Jesus also appeared to his disciples and after resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers here will pass through the path of pain, or Jesus ’ Cross Road (Latinish Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the court was held, walks through the streets of the Old City and leads to the temple of God's grave at the mountain of Golgota - to the place of crossing, to the stone of anointed and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian poop of the world that symbolizes mankind’s salvation.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where, according to the Christian legend, a tree grew from which they made a cross to Jesus ’ crossing.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - the wall of crying, the rest of the temple that was destroyed by Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people of different confession leave notes with wishes that will then be fulfilled.
Increase the vertical path
The ruin of the fortress of Masada remained from a secret shelter from the enemy Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
The ruin is located on the cliffs in mountains above the sea level of 450 m.
Only those who deal with mountains can reach it by their own forces.
The rest of this historic mountain will take the chain.
And in the northern country, 1600-2040 m height is located in the famous ski center Hermon, which experiences a huge influenza of tourists during the winter months.
To this ski paradise, he transports tourists from the bottom of the hill of the skiing bus.
The total length of the mountain conveyors is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, the pagan gods reportedly lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit all of them in one way.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near Knesset (Parlament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or scrolls from the Dead Sea, found in the caves of the Judah Desert, and some 500 thousand archaeological and antropological exponents.
The Museum of Art in Tel-Aviv also stands for the visit.
In his exposure, the impresionists and expresionists of Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso are widely represented.
In Akkon, you can visit the museum of Al Basha, which presents visitors with several rooms of ancient Turkish bathrooms with users' and bathroom careers from that time.
In Caesarea, there is a visit to a unique private Museum of Ralli, where you can admire the statues of Dali and Roden.
There are no guides or suvenir trades.
The entrance is free and the gifts are strictly rejected.
The Fifth Museum - the Museum of Holocaust, or Yad Vashem in Tel Avivo - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built on the memory of 1,5 million children who were killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You get inside - and you'll find yourself in the total darkness.
The stars are brightening.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the lands in which they died.
Ukraine is also introduced.
Improve your health
Three major bathroom centers of Israel are displaced on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Coast.
Each of them offers pools, aquaparks, dolphineries and oceans.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea, it can also be bathed in winter months, because the water temperature does not fall below 21 degrees of Celsia and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and people are bathing in it all year.
The dead sea is, by the way, the most unusual sea in the world, located in the lowest land point of the planet - at 417 m below the sea level.
Azur water in it is a satisfied salt solution that easily maintains on the level and those who can't swim.
The surrounding land is unrealisticly beautiful.
Get here to be subjected to therapy with salt water - salts, and the medicinal bladder that can treat dermatitide health problems, allergies, asthma, examines, arthritis, inflammation of powders, diabetes to heal fertilised nerves.
Touch the Mysterious Ancient
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Avivu - the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them a famous seaway linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The mentions of this city are in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is a place where Noah built his arch and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which they then lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists really love towels with narrow streets named after the signs of the animals.
They say that if you press on the walls in the street of your "your" sign, your happiness will be favorable.
In Jaffa you may meet new spouses coming here from all over Israel and even from other countries to take pictures.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Heroda - you can walk in the Roman theatre and "fetch" the fortress of crossmen.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pilate Pontian.
A carefully reconstructed theatre is used for tonight’s evening concerts and opera show.
Tourists, to speak
If you're going to Israel, you don't have to worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the Russian population in this country speaks.
It's better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for chequels (this is 1 dollar approximately 3.8 šequel).
The city’s transport is especially buses, but in Jerusalem there is a speed tramway, and in Haifa there is the only line of the metro in the country with six stations connecting the lower city to the upper.
It's basically the underground lane path.
The travel of all types of urban public transport is 6 shekels for which you can drive over 1,5 hours.
In Israel, Jewish tradition celebrates Saturday Saturday.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, it stops working on markets, shops and public transport.
And Sunday morning starts a working week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, you only get a cosser of food: except for pigmeat, sea fruits, fish without bowls and foods in which the combinations of milk and meat are contained.
They offer a large selection of foods from lamb and beef, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish cash hummus, variety of sauce, milk mixtures - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no dogs in Israel's streets.
That's why there's a lot of fed cats here that gracefully "touched according to their taste."
In the evening hours, you can see them asleep on the roofs of parked cars.
They love people's places, and they are tasteful to every kindness.
The car loan will stand from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) until $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And borrowing the bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
Accesses to the museum are in the average of 30 shekels.
Expressed numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Recognizing the country and rest came most of US citizens, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The promised country visited from January to October 2012 to 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"Great and powerful" will notify it to Moscow: emigrants save money for language
While the Members and the Protectors of Human Rights are still debating on the law on mandatory linguistic tests, frauders who sell "fake" certificates have already appeared in the country.
In Moscow, Petrohrad and other Russian cities, 13 million foreign workers are arriving annually.
Most of them are Central Asia Citizens: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenia.
Their only goal is to earn enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, the law entered into effect, under which each working migrant will be obliged to test the knowledge of Russian.
As far as this rule applies only for those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and community economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, the FMS promises that in time the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the tests will consist not only of language knowledge but also of Russian history and the basis of law.
The knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed in order to obtain and extend the work permit.
Exception only applies to citizens of countries where Russian is official.
This law is not subject to people who have successfully achieved an attestation and obtain academic diploma to the SSSR breakdown in 1991.
The benefit, conviction and protection of rights
The network of test sites will work under the protection of the Puškinov Institute of Russian language, the University of Friendship between the nations, the Moscow State University, the University of St. Petrohrad and other Russian high schools.
Migrants can compose tests in all cities; now more than 160 such centres are opened in Russia.
The State Honour and FMS (Federal Migration Services) also supported the initiative to support the introduction of testing.
But before the law entered into force, the defenders of human rights have been able to ask many questions in the press: What does that actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for visitors themselves?
In particular, the representatives of the migration service are answered -- it will allow to reduce the number of people suffering as a result of "slavial work".
Many today speak about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the President of the FMS of Russia in Tadžikistan Victor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be launched before they leave.
Only the system of organised board allows 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
There are problems with immigrants without a job, without education, who don't know the language and have no medical examination.
Without knowledge of language - says Sebelev - the future migrant is condemned to conflict with dishonest people who will provide him with "indication" in horrible, tight accommodations, where he and tens of others, such as he himself, will suffer for months without food and documents and dwell for a period of 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get many complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their country, they promise one thing, but when they arrived, they cheat them, they enjoy passports, they don't pay their promised wages," confirms the Chief Tagian Work Migration Management MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't wear it!
By lessing the fact that many Central Asian citizens who intend to go to Russia are acknowledging that they do not only know the language of the country they want to get into, but have no experience even with a given job.
Of course it's not even their fault, rather the unfortunate: only very few Turkmen, Uzbeki, Tadžik can afford at least proper basic education.
For their families also need to feed children, not speaking of the fact that we need to dress, dress and equipped up for school.
As children grow up to a productive age, they need to work at first opportunity.
Without tongue, it's hard - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and less valuable."
True, in the light of the law on language tests, the protectors of human rights point to one important thing.
The testing will only be carried out in those migrants who have legal positions.
If they don't have it, they won't even make tests or get any other official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or Unprovoked Entrance forbidden"
Many of the incoming employees claim that getting official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all these language difficulties.
Legalization also costs money: from 12 to 16,000 rubles.
But false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police employees know that we basically have fake documents, without registration, and that's the case of blackmail.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," - he shared with journalists his experience with the Tadžikistan Citizen Umed Chuškadamov.
"Come on, don't be greedy, buy a painting."
On the first day of validity of the language law, it has been found that falses are not just migrants' registration documents.
FMS employees have already taken a number of false certificates for the execution of language tests.
Fake documents are printed on ordinary color printers.
Of course, the new owners did not get free: each migrants in hope that it would facilitate the problem with the execution of tests, paid for this document seven thousand rubles.
That is two and a half times higher than the official test execution: it will cost migration workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the nearest future is to ensure the system against corruption so that the workers can not easily buy documents, in which government officials and human rights defenders agree.
The governments may yet promise foreign workers who have failed to test the first time, the time required to graduate the course of Russian bases.
For visitors who do not speak Russian, work is assumed in areas where the active dealings with people are not required.
MVD (Internal Ministry) does not take into circulation an illegal arms market
The share of criminal offences with the use of legally held weapons is very low
MVD Russia presents a proposal for a collateralization of the law in relation to the owners of civil weapons.
It is the reaction of government authorities to the recent events: the incentive was the case of shooting at weddings that hanged without victims, and the massacre prepared by the Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, whose result was seven.
The police want to prohibit wearing dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which we can obtain a license for weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the committee of pride for security and the fight against corruption of Irina Jarovaya, which promised that the changes in the law on weapons will be submitted by the State Dume in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian governments are trying to deal with the problem with the path of "shooting screws".
A open letter appeared in the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organisations - require the rejection of the law 'insensitive cohesion'.
The percentage of huliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasilij Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminalist in the interview with the Russian edition of BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior in six months 2012, 142 criminal acts were committed with the use of firearms of the registered authorities of the Ministry of Interior, while the total of 1168 thousand criminal acts were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the elaboration of legislation in civil weapons does not bring the perpetrators to the black market.
According to their words, we can now find any weapon at a low price in Moscow.
Currently, the Ministry of Interior claims that the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
"Black" market with weapons is supplied with several channels.
The main channels are five, says the Colonel in the service of Victor Baranec, who has been working for ten years at the Ministry of Education and the Directorate General.
Screenshot pages that accept weapons orders
The first of them -- "armed or military road", that means a weapon that was distracted during the fights on the Caucas.
"The weapons were also stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasans themselves," said the Baranac.
Another type of black weapons are stolen criminals from security forces.
The Baranic explains that theft from police stocks and weapons stealed directly from criminal authorities.
Illegal "usually" gets to sell from military warehouses.
Many military warehouses often have explosions.
"It is proved that some fires have been established deliberately - to cover manka," said the former soldier.
They bring their contribution according to Barance and the manufacturers of weapons.
"There are private arms companies that are not competitive at the international market, and are currently exposing weapons that are supplied to the black market, including Moscow," the expert says.
Another source of "black" market is corruption.
Especially a large number of guns and machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's their production, sometimes weapons are produced here in painting, and there was a mafia that organised their gas production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts compiled the approximate share of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons on the "black" market.
The report on this problem was processed in 2011 by the Centre for Analysis of Problems and Designing Public Administration.
The experts discussed the reports of the Ministry of Interior and the Russian Statistics Office, Criminal Literature and data of public data portals focused on the theme of weapons.
Most of the illegal weapons, according to researchers, originate from military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons were found on the black market "wine of official factors whose work is related to weapons," the report says.
According to the data available by researchers, 17% of the weapons of armed conflicts originate, 14% of cases have been stealing weapons in their production, 5% is "black archaeology".
The seller-consultant of one of the weapons trades that asked us not to introduce his name is convinced that weapons found in black digestion "archaeology" are no longer buying -- they are just too old.
Most frequently, as he says, sellers are riding for new shipments directly to military warehouses.
In addition to the deputy, a stakeholder buys a unit, for example, a TT gun.
You order a gun with him and he'll sell it to you over the fence.
"He will take her to the city and sell it for 900 euros in a piece of two stocks," he says.
"The truth is that the police are well in the image, and that's why whenever they start burning their plan in the clarification of criminal offences, they're going to make checks in traffickers with illegal weapons," the advisor adds.
"As in a luxury store"
Selling with the buyer most often find each other through their friends.
I visited websites and blogs until a guy showed up who offered me an opportunity to go to the "Test" platform where a man would lead me to the "angle" where we'll deal with.
I've learned the price mostly from there
Military rapporteur Victor Baranec
If I want to get a weapon, I need a friend who knows the way out, a salesman tells me a consultant. I have a friend who I know, but I don't trust him completely.
The salesmen are on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "of Mr. Ivan Ivanovic, who asked me to make sure that my daughter had fallen out of the teeth."
And now I get there over a man I'm sure.
He will also deliver them to me only because he knows I'm not going to betray him.
The starters are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Victor Baranec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-90s when he was processing a state for publication on this subject.
The schemes did not change according to his words.
They gave him an album with photos where it was "all you thought about."
"I felt like a luxury store," a soldier recalls.
They don't offer rabbits in the bag - you can try everything.
I, the potential client, I just don't buy-- we go with the seller in the woods and build a target.
"They give me a chance to shoot, and when I'm convinced that the gun is shooting well, we're starting to act," the scholar states.
Laundry on the couch
Searchers will bring you on the Internet on web sites and groups on "Contact", where they are offered to buy weapons "for various purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required to do so.
"There's only to have a certain amount of money," they say in the advertising title on the web site "Buy a wargun or automat."
On these pages, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And sales to minors?
"Certainly without the licence," the user "Ivan" (retained) asks.
"I'll buy TT.Moscow" - a short formulation of the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has recently broken down a huge network of web pages and those who want to buy military weapons can bury with a shovel.
People go like hungry fish on the bait and then get carbons on Siberia.
Military Rapporteur and Higher Military Master Victor Baranec
I've heard of these schemes: Web sites are usually registered outside the border of the scope of Russian laws.
People are taking orders.
The buyer will pay through the bankomat.
"In response to this, the seller will send him a photograph and a description with the instructions where the gun is hidden," says the press speaker of the non-governmental organization "Right to Weapons" Dmitri Kislov.
Victor Baranac confirms that you can stay without weapons after you have orders on the website and feel behind the nets.
The Federal Security Service has recently broken down a huge network of web pages and those who want to buy military weapons can bury with a shovel.
"People go like hungry fish on the bait and then get carbon in Siberia," he confirms.
Makarov for $100
When you buy illegal guns, you pay the amount of $100 to $900 according to the expert estimates.
According to the words of Dmitri Kislova from the NGO's "Right to Weapons", you're going to charge Makarov's gun for $100 to 300.
You have to wait a month to a month and a half.
The weapon shall be expedited from stocks to long-term storage through the stocks of the Middle Article.
According to the official statistical office, the number of these crimes in Russia was 7% in comparison with the January period - October 2011, and 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of explanated cases of stealing and blackmailing guns, firearms, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, fastfood and supermarkets strike
Work on "McDonald" treasures will go through to a quarter of all American teenagers.
In the last days in America, a wave of protests against low wages was raised in Walmart's hypermarkets and in restaurants of fast-free chains, such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a wave of nine or if it is condemned to disappear soon.
The entire action is supported by committees and a number of left social organisations.
In addition to the increase in the humble payments received by a number of workers in Walmart and in rapid meal systems, the goal of protesters is to achieve their creation in their professional organisations.
This economic sector is currently practically intacted by the professional movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called "Black Friday", when an orgasm of cheap sales hit America, captured millions of inhabitants, and in some cases it was accompanied by fighters.
On this day, some workers, Walmart, who worked for 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and demonstrated together with commissions and levic activists of supernational chains companies whose goods are assigned to people from lower and secondary class.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from paws across hunting guns and car batteries to suckers, eggs and milk.
Products in his sales are in average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many employees with low remuneration in Walmart’s sales only buy at work.
The availability and sorting of goods made Walmart one of the biggest companies in America.
According to criticists, Walmart can afford to sell so cheaply partly because it only pays little to his employees.
They also complain about bad working conditions, such as lack of automatic wheelchairs or manual scanners.
The demonstrators demanded increased payments for "black Friday" and complained that the health insurance costs provided by the company increased rapidly from $30 to 100 a month.
The typical Walmart employee gets $9.5 per hour, but that does not match the cost, they say employees.
Scientists from the University of California in Berkeley suggest that if Walmart increases the average remuneration of $12 per hour, it will cost $3,2 billion a year.
It's a average of 1.1% more than this company now charges.
If Walmart moves the increase of wages fully on consumers' shoulders, each visit to the sales will only stand 46 cent more.
In a year, customers will spend about $12.39 more than today.
Walmart's defenders point out that the protest was held only in nine countries, and the company should not have practically caused any damage.
"Black Friday" in the company's sales stores lasted from 8 hours at night on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 items of goods per second.
In total, her treasures carried out on "black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.
The representative of the company Dan Fogelman stated in an interview for the left-handed Huffington Post web site that the jobs left totally " less than five" employees of Walmart, and that the protest was "nearly media sensation" organized by the committees.
"Uncontained treasure!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their goals were not Walmart's business houses (they are not too popular in that advanced city, so they are almost not here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he's selling billions of porcells, and then he doesn't even pay you for the hospital, and he doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, City Council member in New York
At present, they make a minimum remuneration for work in accordance with federal laws and regulations of the State of New York, $7.25 per hour.
Fastfood restaurants gradually increase this wage, but only mildly, and in the average they receive their series workers in New York $8.90 per hour.
There's no one in this expensive city.
I don't understand how you can exist in New York for such money.
With McDonald's employees, nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work behind a board after school for a partial job and live with their parents.
Only few people see their main source of living or plan on staying there for a long time.
At present, I meet all the time in the interview with McDonald workers who complain that they have to live from these money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal Forum has a comment that the author notes that it is inresponsible to have children unless you know how to feed them.
Participants of the protests that started on Thursday at "McDonald" on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that the cooks and cooks in rapid meals begin to receive at least $15 per hour, which is more than double of their current minimum wages.
They also demanded that committee organisations be established in the rapid meal sector.
The American laws prohibit the management of defending the establishment of committee organisations and punishing professional activists by scanning and release.
On the other hand, the administration is rarely making life easier.
However, the introduction of a fast refreshment committee organisation is also complex for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusual high cycle of employees.
Disagreement
On this day, there were noise protests in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The summit of that action was at the afternoon meeting at McDonald near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians spoke, especially a member of the City Council, Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald" says he's selling billions of ports, and then he doesn't even pay you the hospital and does not pay you properly for your honest work!"
The demonstrators also looked forward to the support of other prominent New York Democrats, such as a candidate for the mayor of Billa de Blasio, who said that "we must come together to support fastfood workers in order to achieve fair rewards for their work and economic prosperity that each New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times describes, it was the biggest action of his species in the history of the American Sphere of Fast Refreshment.
But only a few hundred people attended it, even though not all of them were rapid meal employees who employed tens of thousands in New York.
Whether this event becomes a spark that burns the flame of mass movement, it's still incorrect.
"So far, the brain fails averagely."
Among modern technologies, virtual reality is a popular theme of widespread reality; in recent times it means to see the world especially through the potato of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer on its annual conference, Google presented a working model of this news, and in November it was announced that the application for the relevant patent was also submitted by Microsoft.
From interactive 3D technology interview with the Cambridge Labs of Microsoft Sharam Isadim, the scientists of this company are already past.
It is a perspective of manipulation with virtual objects in the air with holy hands, creating virtual public spaces.
Please tell us the framework what your research group is dealing with?
- We're dealing with human interactions with machines, but at the same time we're trying to move the border of this interaction.
The humanity has been stuck at the stage of work with pixels on the flat screen, at least sometimes touching the screen with the finger.
We want to look forward for 5-10 years and foresee significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sighter - it's a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sighters, because for everyone is a very interesting possibility of managing with gestures.
What else's going on in the future?
- Despite the fact that Kinect system transferred interaction to the physical level, very many interactions continue to take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output flow is not yet particularly.
We're trying to change it, we're working on really three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projectives.
You need to enter the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
However, for this purpose, it is necessary to know not only the users but also the space around them.
Then we will be able to complement virtual objects into the real world in a much more appropriate form.
And first, hell with those stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think of voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it valuable?
- Surely it cannot be considered all - a matter of privacy is raised, because we do not always want to inform others about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, we had a project in which we were thinking about gestures, but not about thoughtful, just the kind of coated, short.
The gesture would not take off a camera device, but a bracelet that would watch the bone and muscle movements.
He's still big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the bracelet clock.
However, generally, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- How do you ask me to give you this lemonade?
You'll say it, and you'll show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to force the user to adapt to what the machine can at the moment or can't?
- That's not necessary, but it's an interconnection.
I think in the near future, we will have to work mainly on the development of new types of sighters that can more accurately identify human responses.
These may, for example, be laser sighters that provide relatively good depth resolution, that is very important.
- To talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution today, depth or something else?
- In fact, the current generation - that's what we can reflect in our work on a three-dimensional recognition.
Of course it would be good to get 8 mega-pixels at a speed of 1000 f/s.
But it's not just mega-pixels, it's like math and depth.
In the present view of the matter, all current technologies are insufficient for us - it allocates work to algorithm designers.
So we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also Z.
So very important is also the speed, the number of shots in a second.
Human movement is relatively dynamic and current data flows of 30 images per second are honestly said a little bit, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond made a touch tape with a adjustable delay in the length of 1 to 100 ms, while the current, serial-producated sighters are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of a man with the machine.
For me work would be a very useful equivalent to this device, but I just don't need so much touch, but I need some pictures in an extra second.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect system now uses three "camera", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second - the receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera -- it's actually a common visible zone.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
The larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or worsening it because it would increase the necessary amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, play with the curve of the location of cameras and see how this will help to determine a three-dimensional position.
- If I remember well, Microsoft (in contrast to Google) has not presented his glasses publicly.
Don't you think it's one of the most promising platforms about daily use of technology widespread reality using special glasses?
- Of course walking and keeping the smartphone in the hands raised is not too comfortable, but I think the strongest option would be a "preliminatory" form of reality extension when it would be possible to switch any time from the glasses to the smartphone, the projection screen and the next round.
The glasses - it's a very personal device, that's their strength (private things only you see), and at the same time weakness - expanded reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation with virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also to the common mortal.
There is one problem to which criticals often point: there is no touch response!
Hands don't smell anything!
What answers are your group preparing for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the widespread reality -- that's the seventh collapse in interaction between man and machine.
I think the completion of mathematical concepts could be an eighth breakdown.
Meanwhile, one of the interesting tricks is being used - the use of the second hand as a certain basis for displaying.
Excellently records the pressure!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on the addiction of the massity of these "visions in the air" -- such as the interference of several directional ultrasonic lights in the defined point where the finger is located, causes a mathematical sense, but it's still very weak -- as if you were pushing on your finger belly.
There is also a bracelet on the wrist that affects the nervous ending in your fingers - also a promised direction.
- Have you tried to deceive your brain?
So he thinks he feels what he seems to feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another challenge to fight for a long time - how to force a person who is physically located in a very difficult area to believe that he is walking in an open, practically infinite space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not even those in clubs), moving platforms and huge balls.
If brain fraud becomes a goal, work is for many years.
That's what makes work on virtual reality so attractive for researchers -- a lot of things are in the entire beginning.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is the continuation of the project "Petrograd Avantgarda", dedicated to citizens who are headed, are the avantgard of culture and art.
At the top of the list there have already been significant figures of the Petrohrad scene, whose extracts exceed the city's framework, often find recognition in Europe without reaching the universal wax.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is an impressive artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller, a brass man who is all dressed in the red one you meet here at the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, the fashion households and the venisages.
The pictures of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exhibited, always attract the crowds of the watchers.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical petrograd talkers, creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller - it's an impressive man of the petrograd avantgard end 80 and beginning of the 1990s.
In addition to being a cityman, his discovery on the streets causes a smile on the face of the citizens, it increases the mood of everyone.
Recently, he took a flashnet into his hand and became a petrograd bottler, because he grew up to this complex role with his entire Bohemical life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why are you walking around the city all in red and not in yellow or in the turkey?
- I chose red color as a designer dealing with the view and image.
In this world, red color is a compromise between artist, imagemaker and public.
Perhaps it is generally true that everything that is just a little different from the gray is aggressive and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are focused on making an interview.
The whole history of my provocational acts is primarily an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- On the exhibition at the Culture House in Nevia, where my work was exhibited.
I understand what my way is.
At that time, the wave of old free non-official artists and the new, free types of artists I couldn't understand.
I got friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gasonians who brought us to Pushing 10, and the other waves weren't.
It makes me feel like a theatre, dress, music, in all the gloves, except for a word.
- And it all ended up in your art clinic... - It was important to me to be in the center of the culture of Peterburg, where all the best powers of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995, I hired a place on Puškinski 10, and there was a musical and art club, a Bogemic club, a home of the petierburk Bogema before the reconstruction.
There was a lot of birth:NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how Schnura brought with the "Ucho Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sang under the slip of light songs, dressed in suitable tricots, in the middle of them the composer Igor Vdovin, which is now in fashion.
When the band started playing alive, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was running a lot of Hali-Galivian time programs.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Griboyedov" club - it's Art Clinic sound.
That's where our workers and permanent guests left.
I'm the hero of the last century when the culture meant something else.
In 2000, the research was organized in the press, and the special price was "People in our city."
In the nomination of "The Artist of the Year" I was appointed, and it ended my top.
In new times, according to old rules, work is uncomfortable, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In these years, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristic in a distinguished way.
- Many of my images - these are hits in which the reality and intelligence are caught lively.
I'm going to have a program exhibition of the Russian Museum in the clowns.
Clowns are overtime category.
I used to be social, being like that today is painful and horrible.
But in the clowns, everything is erased, tragic is taken off.
I love grotesk, I have grotesk ideas.
For example, save the world by the way of the totality reconstruction in the order of order.
Today, people meet according to their clothes, focus on external mechanics, not on an internal person.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand and you need to spit in his face.
And the lie will be removed by the change.
- We've recently seen you as a city bottler. - The city of culture should have such a hero.
And who should it be if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactical, sweet.
There's a breakdown of cultures.
People used to meet in noises, God loved one, simple other people.
Today everything has broken down in microcommunities, today it's very hard to like everyone.
I'm not a $100 banknote to like everyone.
Today you need to think about who you like.
Today every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And a few thousand viewers will be on Stas Mikhail!
The fans will come up with him. There's a sexually social sphere.
And there will be 300 people on the cultural ground, and 10,000 won't come, and the result is less management, money, everything's changing.
I've got fans, the main thing is, no one cheats them and disturbs what's experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures that hanged on the wall with Falk and Larion.
I started with pictures that people usually end.
Today, people are frequently confusing.
They say: Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There's no consumer culture, that's from the other hand.
I'm a man of culture yesterday, I grew up on examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejecting money for painting images.
And I'm for such a culture.
- Cyril, what's the lack in Petersburg?
- Good experts for culture.
There's a concept: an official over the culture.
Not every one of them can deal with culture.
In the days of the right emperors, it wasn't in everything, the emperors may not understand the culture too much, but they realized that it was necessary to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
With us in Petrohrad, we have people who might be experts, but they are stuck somewhere in the corner, because there are need of great experts who will appreciate these experts correctly and lead them to the right path.
Today the tastes are prospering.
The same thing of Erarta, but it's different by saying frankly that we don't accept all modern arts, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Peterburg?
- Peterburg - it's not the main city of culture, there's much more culture in Moscow, there's the right soil.
And on our angle, art is working poorly.
We need cultural soil, but today we have more writers than readers, that's wrong.
There are very many people in Europe who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
There's only a weak layer in us.
We need art to become a fashion thing, as it was at the beginning of the past century.
The project is implemented for the funds of St. Petersburg grant
Birth in Universe
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with the killer asteroid.
The caravaans of space ships with landscapes on the board are travelling, looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, there is a major question: How can we keep our family in no difficulty or on a replacement planet?
I don't think the choice is big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be won, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," said the highly built scientific worker of the State Astronomic Institute of P.K. Sternberg (SAIS) Vladimir Surdin.
But while there are better conditions for living on Mars, on the surface of Venus, temperatures of 500 degrees of Celsia are reached.
Living there is only a big height or an orbit of Venus... in the universe.
Solving the reproduction issues in the universe, scientists started with the flora.
Seven centuries ago, plant experiments have been performed.
Four generations of bowls raised on the orbit road are nothing different from their earthly relatives.
Then the carriage of insects to orbit was carried out -- very small fruit mushrooms of Drosophila.
In 1979 it was sent to the universe by a crushing egg to check how the embryo develops in the state of gravity.
We get a absolutely normal bird on the exit.
But then there's a problem starting.
"The problem is that this bird has to find resistance, must stand on his own feet and start moving," says the head of the lab of the Institute of Biomedician Disabilities (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sichev.
If they don't find the resistance, the birds are chaoticly falling and making bullets.
After 10 hours, fresh birds were emptied to the total loss of instincts.
Birds didn't react to light or sound.
And the trouble was that they just died in four days.
"We let the birds lick twice, but then we refused, because it's simply impossible to work with them," comments the failure of the experiment with chickens in the universe, Vladimir Sichev.
The last "miniarch" was flying the animals on the front road 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, experiments will continue.
In the "Bion" biosatellite, only beings of one gender will be.
There was an experiment with collars that were transmitting into the universe already gravity.
In fact, there's nothing supernatural.
"It was only on biosatelites, but again - it is a unique experiment and such attempts must be performed," Vladimir Sičev said.
After landing on the earth, a descendant was born with cosmic rats.
However, getting closer to the problem of reproduction directly in the universe has not yet been successful.
It's a tough task.
Animals simply cannot realize their sexual instinct when losing the usual environment.
A man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens controls abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not performed.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest danger was threatened by Tereskov.
The most precious thing humanity has is a woman's body.
Our Tea flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if he could hold a flight to the universe.
Is he able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"Well, no one has ever answered this question," said the veteran of the Vachtang Vachnadze missile and space industry.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight to the universe, the first woman-cosmonautica Valentina Tereskov's daughter was born.
The child’s father was also a cosmonaut Andrian Nikolajev.
In 1988, the son of the second woman-cosmonaut of Savica, who visited the orbit twice and worked in the open universe, was born.
However, the risk remains.
We only have a few assmonauts who have been born and growing healthy after years.
"It may also be dangerous in orbital years," states a cosmonaut-pilot, a hero of the Soviet Union and a hero of Russia Valerij Poljakov.
However, humanity must inevitably seek new paths in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydrolaborator is a mandatory phase of preparation for flight.
Here, in conditions with zero attraction, the cosmonauts are conquering the habits needed to work in the open universe.
Water is imitating the state of gravity.
For adults, perhaps, water is comfortable, but in a strange environment, it is natural for young children.
Little teenagers seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between the child’s average of 9 months in mother’s fruitwater and that it is easier for them to get used to water.
It's basically logical, because since the day of birth, since the first bath, it's only two weeks.
"It's very little to forget the child something," says Marina Axenov, instructor for the swimming of the newborn.
Shortly speaking - if the newborn child's condition is more natural, then natural gravity is more inevitable, attractive force for women.
In the state of gravity, the muscles of the belly, the muscles of the belly are rapidly collapsed, and the body’s ability to throw the fruit down.
We can leave this aside if the muscle stimulators work at birth.
Eventually, it is possible that births take place in a special chamber where the mother’s organism will rise off the fetus.
"And what next?" Valerius Poljakov raises complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the organism does not affect the Earth's attraction, it cannot shape the muscle or the muscle system correctly.
A newborn in the orbit can't be dressed as an adult in a special suit with a burden in which he could train.
He'll just be rid of what he needs for his development unconditionally.
"If we go with you to an experiment that allows a child to be born in a foreign environment, we will bring a healthy person on Earth who will be completely inappropriate to this environment," predicts the IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.
So the raising of children in the universe today is just a theoretical question.
However, once the time will become reality, and the landmen will turn themselves in their ships on a far planet that will become a home of their descendants born in the universe.
Boss of the NKU: Control of the Schwarcsist failed by politicians' guilt
Czech Republic has a good controller and quality legislation in connection with public procurement, but it is inclined in its application.
In an interview for Currently.cz says the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office, Miloslav Kala.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application of its application - that is what we think is missing," Kola comments on the current situation.
Similar conclusions also indicate the common control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of the wrong practice, Peter's access to the so-called "shvarcsystem".
Mr. Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not disturb his controls - is it forbidden or permitted?
"The law must be somehow set up, and if it prohibits anything, the government's president can not stop the activity of the office that is required to go and to carry out the duties," Kala states.
At the meeting of the control committee in the Parliament, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and the German party, which compared legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What was it specifically?
It's a parallel control we started about two years ago.
Simplely speaking, it is that European legislation adjusts how to deal with public procurement, follows it by individual national legislation and then the practice itself.
We have put all this together, and even though the control is not finished yet, we have shown very interesting differences - generally, legislation may be "stricter and more perfect", however, the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to keep creating more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to apply the law itself.
What can this project really do for you? What does it come from?
Such a joint control could help us to stop making efforts to accurate laws, reduce and improve limits when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economy means acquisition of a suitable (but not always the lowest price) in order to exclude enrichment and criminal proceedings.
But by reducing the procurement limit, we don't have to make it necessary.
Maybe the system will be covered by the amount of "paper", that those who want to look for holes in this system will be getting much easier than if the limit remains higher.
You're talking about local problems with the transfer of legislation on public procurement to practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an office similar to our NKW, or is it set differently?
As for the authorities, as the NKU works there, Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized as we do, also has a colleague, just formed a little different way, but in principle both authorities are acting similarly.
The powers are also somewhat similar, however, by the fact that Germany has a common arrangement, so it has these accounting courts even at the level of individual states of the community -- in which the system differs a little from ours.
BRH can only control the municipal money, represented by our state funds.
The public centres that are managed by the regions and the community are checked from the level of the joint accounting courts.
What about the laws there, is it easier than ours?
Generally, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some respects Germany is marked as a model, but it is certainly not possible to say that it is better in everything.
So is it also necessary by having better controllers?
No, of course not, but I say again, I don't like that comparison.
But it is necessary to say that the countries that we consider models are dealing with a number of problems.
Otherwise, there would be no benefit to cooperating with our office, wouldn't it?
With regard to the local legislation, what was the novel of the Public Procurement Act for your office, has any effect of it?
Since the period of validity of this novel is relatively short, it is not yet shown in our controls.
Because we're doing ex post checks, we need to count on a certain delay.
We've seen it only in the process of preparing future controls - we have launched our new tool "detecting risks of inequality", through which we have prosecuted almost 14,000 public procurement orders, and we've analysed them - there, of course, these changes will be manifested, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of selection procedure will be adjusted and similarly.
So do you consider the approval of this law rather a benefit, or another burden of the burden of the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that can happen here is that she's going to "crowd" rules and will not be able to follow them.
For the functioning of the previous rules, the controlled persons are committed by the provider (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to ensure that each non-compliance of the Public Procurement Act means breach of the budgetary penalty.
Does the law be worth reinforcing this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse him, not punish those who make formal doubts that do not affect decisions.
Such a system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do you get out of it?
Let's see where the road doesn't lead.
Recently, Mr. Prime Minister said that the ODS would not disturb the businessman by controlling the so-called "shvarcsystem" - and what does that mean?
Is the Schwartzsystem forbidden or allowed?
The law must be somehow set up, and if it prohibits anything, the government's president can not prevent the activity of the office that is required to go to control and do the duties.
He can say, "We change the law and let it happen," but he can't say we're doing nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, there are relatively strict rules as to how to be formally implemented - which is right to protect the public competition.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when an interesting with the best offer is excluded only for formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application of its application - that's what I think we miss.
The roads are freezing places, mostly but climbing
In several places of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowy.
But mostly, the tickets are off the road, somewhere with increased caution.
Karlovar County
In the Karlovar district this morning, roads were swimming, but places were frozen and snowy.
The temperature dropped between five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day it was to be slightly warm.
The snowing in the region stopped and there are only weak layers in the lowers.
But there is about 30 inches of snow on the Hills of the Mountains.
Places were also lower visibility due to the fog, resulting from the dispatch of district roads.
Speedway R6 and first-class communications are now unlimited in the region.
However, caution is in place, for example, in some places where the surface can be frozen and slipful.
All roads of the second and third class, including mountain roads, are also departured.
But in some parts, the remains of the ice cream and the places of snow.
In particular, in higher positions, more attention should be paid to the ride.
Pardubic and Royal Castle
Some roads in the eastern Czech are threatened by hatred, in higher locations and mountains, there may be a snow layer on the communications, he informs on his pages of road management and roadways.
The passengers warn drivers from the hatred, especially in the higher locations of the Pardubian region.
The hope may be in the area of Lanschroun, Orlic Oste, Police, Swetav or High Myth, especially on the roads of the other and third classes.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 in Switav.
The snow is especially on roads in Krkonos and the Orlic Mountains.
The captured snow layer is in the highest locations of roads in Rychnov districts over Priest and Trutnov.
In eastern Czech Republic, today the most commonly is clear to half-displayed without collapse.
Temperatures are usually moving between minus three and plus one degree Celsia, a weak wind.
Plazina Region
The roads in the Plazin district are off the road this morning, places, but with increased caution and ride, weather needs to be adjusted.
It's freezing after the morning, temperatures move between three to nine degrees under the freezing point.
After the previous snow and subsequent cooling, some communications may be frozen.
Places must also count on the mist, but visibility will be progressively improved.
It comes from information about the district dispatch of roads.
The D5 district is almost unlimited, but more caution is recommended by the communication managers between 80 and 131 miles.
Most of the first class roads have a surface dry and frozen.
But in South Plazinsk and Tachov, there may be frozen segments.
The communications of the second and third class are wet and in this case also apply to the frozen sections.
The drivers should be careful mainly on less frequent roads in the area of šumava.
Olomouch County
With snow coughs on the road today, drivers headed to the highest location of the Olomouck district.
After the chemical syringe, she stayed on the Red Gore seat and on her way to the Vile Cross.
The passengers were expelled to the ground at night of snow, in Schumper, according to road managers, they snowed about three centimeters.
In other parts of the region, carriages are mostly unlimited.
"Shumper is in the highest places of the rest of the snow.
With snow casualties on the Red Gore Seat, drivers must count in the direction of the Jesenik," the CTK dispatchman of the road traffic management said today.
Their colleagues on Jesenicka also traveled to the territories at night, and the highest positions are now according to them after chemical treatments, naked and wet.
In Olomouck, however, roads are unlimited, but in Sternberg drivers should be careful in the forest sections where the vehicles remain wet.
Average Country, Liberian County
A few hard-sized seats report today after morning to the northern Czech roadmen.
Besides several places with an attacked snow or an ice cream is also closed by a mountain road from Telnica to Kninice in Usteck, it comes from the police database.
Temperatures are also held in lower positions below zero, so ice and snow are apparently enduring on roads.In the lowers, especially southeast of the Czech Central Mountain, there are no problems and roads are usually dry.
Operational complications are not reported yet.
The occurrence of the ice cream reports to passengers in particular from the area of Štécia.
According to the meteorologists, at night, the ideal conditions - over the day of rain and the snow, at night, were clear and freezing.
The main moves also report the adverse conditions on the road I/13 on the border of the Usteck and Liberian district.
The closure from Telnica to Kninice forced the branches of trees that snowed down to the cart.
Simon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy on concerts
What do you think about the end of the world in a few months?
It's just one of the other alarming news that we people like to catch.
Together with the Tap Tap band, we're making fun of it and we're saying that we're the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to give the end of the world away or prevent it.
In addition, in December, you will organize a totally unique project three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to the readers closer?
It's about the whole state beneficial action we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential for the end of Mayan calendar announced on 21 December at 11:10 p.m.
The day before 20 December from 21 hours, 3 concerts in Prague, Brna and Ostrava will be performed simultaneously.
They will end up nearly when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the time zone 12 hours before us.
Who came with this idea?
originally, it was probably my idea, and then we made things up with our artist Honzo Augusta.
In addition to the acquisition of sufficient positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to consider, together with the public, the state in which this world will convey to our children once.
At the time of the end of the Mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of shoes, shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world whose purchase on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other interpretations, also sang so-called Hymna against the end of the world, called "The End of the World Cancelled".
She's already very favorite on YouTube, will she also sound at these beneficial concerts?
Of course, in the complete conclusion, so if we do everything, and the end of the world doesn't...
All interpreters on all three concerts will sing it together.
Hymny will also be connected to the unique direct transfer to Czech TV.
He wrote the words to this song and the main role of Jesus played in the clip, Tomah Hanaak, also singing in it Xindl X...
How did you get to cooperate with them?
We also cooperate with other characteristics of the Czech cultural scene, given that we have a lot of beneficial action and concerts...
We're trying to engage them in these projects intensely.
It turns out that most of them are interested in working with us and having fun.
What's going on with a show from the concerts against the end of the world?
For the equipment of the Studeo without barrier education centre, which we have implemented with the Tap Civil Association in the Eudelic Institute for the sixth year.
For the school students, the Jadlic's Constitution regularly ends the physicians and devote them to activities that they enjoy and interest them.
The students themselves have no means to turn themselves into lecturers, so we are trying to allow them to do so.
A separate building in the future will be created by the Eudelic Constitution, which we will move with this project.
There are several musical groups and interpreters on each concert.
What did you choose them?
We tried to build a program that would address all generations, including children.
For example, China, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bartau, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiří Suchy will be presented in Prague.
For all details, see www.kpx.cz.
Are you planning a similar "bombastic action" to the future?
In May, we're going to play in Prague spring for the first time, so we're sure to prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
In the next year, we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we are in the U.S., I would like to connect this with the appearance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimistic, for example, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by disabled people.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organicly?
It's not as terrible as it seems at first.
We have five members on the electrical wheelchair, her wheelchairs must travel in the luggage space, and we, of course, pull with us a large amount of cargo and a bedroom with tools...
Nevertheless, by the time, it was always done without problems, the Czech Republic and the British Airways were greatly prepared to be surprised for a number of times.
Even in Moscow, from which we recently returned, that was no problem.
With travel to abroad, you can compare how individuals differ in barrierness, public access to disabled and similar things.
What have you met yet?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than us, we were just witnessed in Russia that in the east, everything is still in full beginnings.
Besides Prague, Moscow is very barrier, here is still unusual that a person on the electric wheelchair himself moves in the center of the city.
They don't even pay for certainty, like you might prefer the wheelchairs in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are civil associations that are trying to warn people of disabilities.
And what do we still need to reach more advanced countries?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
But it is important to mention that improvement and improvement are always dependent on the efforts of people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is totally common that people with severe handicap themselves move to the public, they can go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere...
But it's not too common that there would be a large number of people with disabilities actively involved in social life, in contrast, we are with The Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respect for public or barrierity is one thing, but only at the moment we will be important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things will start to change in reality.
So far, these are unique cases of people who have strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years ago, what made you build it in 1998?
I came as a raiser to the Constitution of Jedlic, where I had many young people around me who were interested in something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I'm playing saxophone, so I started an interesting music circle with my colleague.
Well, through time, as our moderator Lađa Angelovic says, we have a little slip out of our hand (Laughter).
But the popularity has come up in the past few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we began to connect with famous singers and also actively working on promoting the band.
We realized that the work that was not seen was basically as if it didn't exist.
In addition, thanks to the contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lectures, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to reach out with the Tap Tap this high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Showbusiness is filled with things where one imitates the other.
It's kind of logical, all news are taken carefully and it takes a long time.
Things that are unique are very little, but I'm trying to say Tap Tap are one of them.
The first impression of the first person who sees us is, of course, regret, it's natural...
But that regret is absolutely unnecessary, because people with handicap are not suffering from all the abandoned creatures we must regret.
They are people who can live a full - value life and develop, of course, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I'm telling you, if something happens to people with a handicap, it's not just a move for them, it's for the whole company.
It also helped that you're a strict boss, how many people mark you?
If we want to do quality work, we must be unpromissible in many matters and require certain discipline.
But that's totally normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and with a head in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to the test twice a week, go to the preparation and spend a lot of time on the journeys on the concerts, they will quickly leave them.
But that's how it works everywhere, every group who wants to work and who wants to achieve something.
Currently, the Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were at her beginnings in 1998?
Only the only Lađa Angelovic.
We're an open group, people leave and come, it's impossible to stop.
Who has will and taste, has always opened doors with us
The day will be done before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours
It will take place in Prague Incheba arena, Brne Fléda and Ostrava Plynoum for the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities at the end of the evening will be connected by telemost at the joint song of the band The Tap Tap "The End of the World Cancelled"
The goal of the concert is to gather funds for the equipment of the multi-functional non-barrier education centre STUDEO at the Eedlic Constitution in Prague in volume of 25 million Kč
Introduced to the concert is 400 Kč, children under 12 years have a free ticket in the Bohemiaticket pre-solder
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was adopted as the twentieth member of this European Space Agency, as the second country from the former Eastern bloc (in Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland launched close cooperation with the ESA in 1994, and during the next years participated in a number of projects of the Agency.
Of course, Poland’s journey to Space began a long time ago.
For years, the Polish enthusiasms were devoted to space before World War II; but they did not always meet understanding.
For example, the A. Sternfeld lecture in the Warsaw astronomical observer, who represented the ideas of his pioneer work on December 6, 1933.
The ideas of a young engineer (ar. 1905) left the listeners cold and after years, Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
Sternfeld won the price of Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirscha for entering a cosmonautic in France.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promotor of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a worldly known promotor of cosmonautics, and his benefit was also appreciated by the name of one of the crockers on the distracted side of the Moon.
In 1925, a railway drezina was built in Poland, which was to be handled by a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and not even known as the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether the rocket was to be used to disconnect the drezina or to prevent it.
The information on this dresin is known only by the era press.
Since 1933, the rocket shots began to be rounded by the Polish artillery.
The research was provided by the Armed Technical Cell in collaboration with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Professor Gustav Mokryckiegi.
It is obvious that research has come to the stage of practical trials.
However, research was discontinued by the arrival of German troops.
In 1937, a photo-electric missiles projected by Rogozinski engineer and the work of the Raketa – air torpedo and the airbomb of the Leli-Krivoblok aircraft.
Both projects were designed for military use of missile engines.
Just before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Scientific Technical Committee) has coordinated all the work he has coordinated.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after its two-year activity, it ceased the start of war.
Another work dedicated to astronautics is shown after a war in Polish press through Polish astronautical society (Poland Astronautic Society).
For the first time, it is mentioned in the November edition of the 1954 magazine Problems, which includes four larger articles of astronautics.
One of them, from Professor M. Subotovic, is designed to create a company that will deal with a cosmonautic.
At that time, artificial partner projects have already been underway and it was clear that space research is a perspective area.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish astronautical company (PTA) has been trying to enter the International Astronautical Federation (based in 1951) and has become a proper member on the fall.
In the next year, the first PTA President Kazimer Zarankiewic (1902 - 1959) became Vice-Chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
This function was placed until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has significantly participated in the development of a very successful meteorological missile RM (Meteorological missile), which became the first Polish missile that was conducting scientific research.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and the first launch was 10 October 1958.
The Raketa with 1800 meters access was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved RM-1A version was built and in the summer of 1959 it was launched in the Bledow Desert, the flight tests of RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and its weight was approximately 11.5 kg.
Another development type should have already been able to real scientific work - the RM-34 missile should have access to up to 14.5 km and its task was monitoring the high wind.
However, in 1962 further development was suspended.
The follower of the first RM rockets became the Meteor-1 missile developed in 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was concentrated as two degrees, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types have been developed (meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which were different from the size of the space for scientific devices.
The Meteor-1A missile was available with a volume of 0.4 litres, a Meteor-1B volume of 0.34 liters and a Meteor-1C volume of 0.62 litres.
Maximum access in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute held the development of the Meteor-2 missile, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 missile had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were then built.
The entry of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) should be mentioned in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR national committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research in Soviet art partners, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermashewski became the second intersmonaute after Vladimir Remk.
Abolition of the public practice law is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court abolished the public practice law.
The resolution has brought a live discussion to the public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this problem from a wider perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on more, unregulated competitions.
In its effect, this means that individual economic offices, national economic systems, stand in a permanent conflict between themselves.
The principle of free trade and free, unlimited movement of private capital, along with unreliable financial speculation, is the cause.
The impact of the significant differences in the labour price (measure) is attributable to price tension.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation where the manufacturer is trying to retain the price of the competition by "increasing" the competitive price in order to remove a larger market share and thus increase its own profits.
In a mass measure, this means either to translate production into a foreign country, or to shore cheaply, or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where work prices are compared to other high economies.
Because the private capital does not have any social responsibility and thus the responsibility for its produced unemployment, it is necessary to increase the social expenditure of the State.
The whole situation strengthens the total disagreement of the business masters to pay taxes and thus replace the economic and social injury that he has committed in pursuit of profits.
The situation is so commonly known that specific statistics are not required.
The unreasonable practices of private capital create a situation in individual economics where governments of individual countries are forced to enter mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
Otherwise, governments give their own population to the private capital, regardless of social disturbance.
This is mainly manifested in the changes in the laws.
The objective is to economically force its own population to adopt a Private Capital Price Dictate, in particular in the area of remuneration.
However, this is a system of economic impulsion in case of long-term unemployment, but by restricting the rights of employees in the field of work law.
The result is the growing poverty, along with the rising differences between poor and rich.
In the SRN, there have been a number of years of public food productivity for poor people who cannot be used by their own work.
The number of these people is already in millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is generally common to cases that properly employed people receive such a remuneration that they must be paid to an existing minimum.
Such a scandal has been published in the case of helpful workers of the Soviet Snow.
The savings of practically all Southern EU countries are undoubtedly leading to the same situation where people under the pressure of a catastrophic social failure are forced either to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to live for hungry wages on the edge of the company in hope that private investment capital may be emerged to the country once.
But where does it come from?
If this is from other EU countries, poverty will be moved from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, India, Brazilian, or Turk, or Moroccan, or Egyptian, or Africa are still working for a fraction of European remuneration.
That's all about Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim that the State cannot participate capitalally in its own economy, that the governed economy leads to economic disaster.
The private capital strongly insists on the opinion that the State must not interfere with the governing inflammation in the economy.
Then we need to ask if the private capital does not affect, in fact, now it is the policy and thus the whole State in its own selfish sense.
Here is a clear answer that yes.
The evidence of the existence is practically almighty and in all countries the lobby is available.
As a result, the desperate situation in the area of corruption, the provision of mutual benefits, the law where practically everything is criminal but nothing criminal.
The situation in SRN is that the Ministry of State for the lack of funds gives the drafting of laws to private legal companies that are often in connection with the industry.
These law proposals are subsequently agreed in Bundestag.
All powers do not come from the people as the West Type Constitutions report, but from financially strong groups prefering their own interests.
It is obvious that liberally oriented democracies are now rapidly arriving in the situation described by Appianos in its part of the Crisis of the Roman Republic at Caesar and Pompei's time: "The state has been in full deployment for a long time, and the authorities have been engaged in violence.
For bribes, illegal gaining favor and using stones or swords.
The subpayment and corruption were built without any barriers and people went to elections with the advanced vote" ... "The characteristics of people were not dealing with the office at all, so once, as a result of this divorce, he was standing for eight months without consulates.""The only drug in the bad situation was self-control and that it was necessary to choose an energy man." Appianos was thinking of Pompei, but became the Caesar, who turned into persistent democracy to self-government.
The conclusion, as in ancient times, is based on the unreasonable preference of its own benefit, regardless of the entire social interest.
The private capital is no longer capable of understanding and applying the Community benefits.
The result is now, like then, an undue decade to elite without any attempt to reform the deeper struggle.
The cause of fascist and communist regimes, therefore, we need to seek in the unreasonable liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.
The absence of these systems in the current state in favour of Liberal Democracy may be considered a certain break with the expectation of another circle.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that current elites completely ignore possible hundreds of lives, humanitarian and social disasters that we have already witnessed together with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
Abolition of the public practice law is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of competition, both international and internally European, the Czech Republic government will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is the objectives of political and social reforms that strengthen capital participation of the State in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in the company for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Lab of chaos.
"Nothing of violence will come out and never can" Sting in Fragile's song, whose main verse in the refren is "do not forget how fragile we are"
"If my sons didn't want war, there would be no" Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschell Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and Gaza's zone, as always, a lot of reactions have occurred.
One stands behind Israel, arguments his right to self-defense, and the Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, argument racism of the Israeli state, genocide committed in Palestinian Arabs and the state of Israel match the role of the terrorist state.
I don't want to think about who is in the periodically repeating waves of killing the guilty and who is the victims, in the end of today's people of Israel, including the self-appropriate territories, born to the current political situation and the beginning of violence has not experienced.
I am about offering a view to readers behind the tyre, the view of whom it is primarily served for 95 years of tension (based by Balfour’s Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of the Middle East country.
Some of my considerations are supported by the availability of historical facts, some of them are carried out on the basis of my own understanding of who resp. which group of people is the main movement of events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first of all the history of the fight of power.
We can search for Alexandr the Great or Napoleon at every time.
What is not so obvious is if they were always those individuals who were completely autonomically taking their steps, or whether someone who was behind their throne was directing their actions to the advanced goal.
We must admit that we live in a time where world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that the concentration of money and the power of them could not come to life for a generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families is one that could be considered head of the chobotnica (if anyone else stands above them, but I don't exclude it) - Rothschields.
It's not much about them.
Understood.
The first press agency (Reuters) has already been purchased in the 1990s to stop connecting their name with highly criminal acts in which the background was behind and which always meant for them strengthening power, multiplication of wealth or both.
They have major shares in almost all the central banks of the world and against countries where participants in the central bank do not lead or prepare wars (for the attack of Afghanistan, it was seven countries, after Iraq's attack, it was 5 countries, and only four remained after Cadafi was thrown away, while Russia was subject to the central bank of the Russian government).
Whoever tried to deny this family, he died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Central Bank of Rothschield Bank of America, began to issue his own (conscious government) money and was murdered in the theater in 1865.
JFK started spending his own money and wanted to cancel the FED, was killed in 1963, Ambassador Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for a major economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars by the highest, 33th degree of dedication by Albert Pick.
The first war was a task to remove the large monarchist states in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial government, especially the Great Britain, and the third was to reduce the world population somewhere to 0.5 - 1 billion people (this number of slaves for their comfort and luxury is sufficient and they do not need so many resources), to create one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing other than a pre-recognition for such solution) and to finalize absolute power.
The method that the wealthiest family group with Rothschieldy is working is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer of solutions (order ab chao - order of chaos).
However, these solutions are fake and are always leading to worsening the situation (see the establishment of the FED so that the crisis is not repeated as the one they called in 1907).
So after they managed to kill the Habsburg successor of the throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Imperial Russia by launching a Bolševic Revolution.
The first World War ended by suddenly, military and economically unreasonable, Germany's капitulation (not needed war for the destruction of Imperial Russia) and then a fraction of the Central European Power, Austria Uherska.
In order to facilitate the second world war, the politicians have let the bankers create a latently conflicting situation by putting a huge war reparation on Germany, creating a prediction of radicalization of the poor mass, and then they have only embarked the Germans enough strong, guilty and simple solutions to the Leader offering, and further by creating a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to play, and also played, the function of the fifth colony, in the launch of a warfire.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschield’s establishment of the Sionist Movement, whose one branch was trying to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea and Jerusalem as a capital city (back to the Sion).
The declaration of Balfour created an assumption for the mass immigration of the Jews to Palestine, which began to occur to the first conflicts with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The second world war has exploded if Hitler quit the chain where the international bankers held it at the beginning, or all he did was hard to estimate, however, the suffering of European Jews in concentrations created an assumption for the acceptance of the Jewish state of the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as the war reparations of Germany had been earned at World II, the State of Israel was announced by the fire of the third war.
If international bankers succeed, the Jewish nation, as in the second, will be victims in the first line of battles, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge lab, a source of quarrel and chaos not only within the country but also internationally. ( Let us consider how strictly people are divided into the favors and opponents of Israel.)
Who is the guilt and who is the victim in Palestine - Israeli conflict, where the wrongdoing produces violence in the infinite chain of violence when the greed of individuals and their desire for global power at the beginning of all?
Here it is necessary to distinguish simple inhabitants of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are emphasizing people to choose in elections exclusively their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Jeřáb Netanyahu, is a typical example of the fashiing, to international bankers of loyalty, a policy that is doing everything to pursue the war with Iran, which, in view of the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to increase in global conflict and in view of the control of Iran over the Hormusian flow, which travels 20% of all world oils (the sailing corridor is only 2 miles wide) and to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light now appears the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only thing we need is the universal crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world regulation in their imagination is the world of lords and slaves.
The world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a bunch of financial aristocracy.
The world where each newborn individual is implanted at the birth of a chip that makes it a totally controlled creature.
"And make all the small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves have on their right hand or on the head of the seats, so that they can not buy or sell, who is not marked on the name of that beast or by the number of her name.
That's what you need to understand: who's intelligent to compile the numbers of that monster.
This number represents a person and it's a number sixty-six."
Film Argo: When the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979 he acquired a crowd of demonstrating Islamic students to the American Embassy in Teheran and captured 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for the dumped shake of Mohamed Réz Pahlavi, who fled to the United States after the revolution, which was a patronate of his regime for decades.
For the American administration, it has not offered a positive exit - to throw a shake over the board, because it would be essentially threatening confidence in allies in other countries.
But the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution was established in the theocratic regime, could not be achieved.
It was a wound for the prestige of the United States, which was later deepened by the fiasco of attempts to free the hostage by force.
The diplomatic prisons were finally released after 444 days after the negotiations were intermediated by the Algerian government.
Their share at home caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
Debakl in Iran has significantly contributed to the loss of Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film of the directing actor Ben Afflecka Argo describes one episode of the history that brought America a small victory.
Just before the embassy was enrolled, six employees fled from her.
After complicated perceptions, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
In collaboration with Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran, helping an extravagant cover story - they went to the Canadian passports as members of the film office, who was looking at the locations for the sci-fi film.
Genre combination
The plan that an expert invented Tony Mendez's "exfiltation" required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order for the legend to be reliable, it was written about a film project in specialized magazines, a press conference held, a fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation have been secreted for a long time, the movie comes from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's movie is a special combination of more genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller, also called "caper movie", a story of an illustrated piece, an example can be a series of Danny's partners.
In the film, moods are settled - on one side of the documentary sequence from Teheran (in the title sequence are displayed iconic era photographs of events and the way the same situation was shown in the film - there are no big differences in it).
On the other hand, a distant passage from Hollywood, accommodated with irony and a mild excess.
And then the scenes from the ClA and other institutions - men in the clothing are discussing the situation at the workshops, the hallways of the office, the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
From a ridiculous actor he became a respected director, and his acting also stopped being the target of ironical notes.
Argo is his third full-night movie, after dark crimes Gone Baby Gone (2007) and Thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it's the first Affleck picture that doesn't happen in the director's home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was among the characteristics that the senior movies enlarged above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in Arg, where Teheran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film are happening in the streets, when reconstructing real events - the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its transparency, which also means emotions of confusion and insight that occur when history is somewhere clear.
Similar effects Affleck and his colleagues reach in the stages of thoughts (fake headquarters at the Teheran pool).
Too many stories in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story that was told doesn't actually offer much in the film sense of stressful scenes.
It's pretty successful with this, sometimes it's going to figure out something reality - it's not all that elegantly out there (the scene in which the threatening crisis in the territorial airport reverses the call in America and the rainway race works quite attracted to the hair).
The weakness of Arga, however, is the disturbance resulting from the need to show too many history in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in Hollywood’s colleagues, but their characters would earn more space and are not the only ones in this movie.
Affleck's film is kind of losing a dramatic move, it's a picture that can be monitored with a mild interest, to evaluate the realization of the retro style evolving thrillery in the 70s.
But it's just hard to take it off.
As a reminder of one way of living history and evidence of how excessive imaginations of almighty and awareness of secret services will be sufficient.
Rules for balloon pushing, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovniplates.com, who annually announces a survey of the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to declare a competition for "the most absurd regulations or ideas from the EU workshop".
"The EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the leadership of large European companies," said the Law organizer of Patrik Nacher's survey.
For example, among nominated absurds, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify the rates of insurance for men and women has already been made.
As far as women have been benefited at life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place by the end of February 2013," Nacher informed.
Among the EU controversial Regulation, it is necessary to mix biocommodities into engine materials, which is due to nature's damage, and the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury temperatures only because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, or the Directive on the size of the spinal cells which has significantly betrayed the egg this year.
Criticism was also facing the actual prohibition of the use of the expression of anointed butter or the elimination of classical lamps from the sales.
Quality bananas should have 14 inches
The Union apparatus often decides under the pressure of a business or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels are usually protected by a State or group of states (e.g., Czech Republic now, and the threat of veta proposes the requirements of its banks).
The interests of the lobby were also behind the fact that, for example, bananas of highest quality had to reach a length of at least 14 cm in the Union and should not show "anomal curve".
The European Commission, however, defended itself by only harmonizing the real ununity national standards that complicated trade.
The EU's fruit and vegetable standards, through the opposition of certain States, have already melted with instruction that existing directives lead to food waste.
The EU's last survey can also be a victory candidate, which requires the compulsory warning of the children under 8 years of age without supervision of adults.
The EU has responded here to American research, according to which the balloons between toys are leaders of the cause of the death of children to strangle.
Similar restrictions are now applicable for children under 14 years of age when blowing into leaflets.
Interesting ideas are born at home
Relatively absurd is then the rule concerning European officials themselves - anyone who has any official function in the EU, cannot use the topic of Greece and must speak instead of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with Liberal Economies, the Banking Payment Server Laissez Faire nominated in a survey, except for some of the above, the EU Regulation on the volume of foodstuffs in the territory of the Member State should be absurd.
The EU has established the maximum volumes of foodstuffs that could be located on the territory of the PRC on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, certain volumes in preserved mushrooms, which threatened him with a high penalty.
The survey organisations also took into account the idea of paying to some countries for the lack of sea, and the idea of granting funds on the request for subsidy.
However, these ideas were not in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We're hampered by no sea.
We will request the European Union to reimburse," the Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas, said on autumn 2004.
As a argument, he stated that a lot of grain was born in us, and as a result of the so-called intervention shopping, he had to make full stocks that he had to export.
For moving Czech Republic to the ports, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros according to the Palace.
The European Commission eventually went forward to the CRC by organizing a tend to buy cereals from countries that have no access to the sea.
The grants for acquisition of subsidies were offered to the local Ministry of Local Development, managed by Minister Paul Germany (US-DEU), specifically to go to the listing of a subsidy application from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre Regulations are exceptional
While the regulations in the Member States are easily targeted by criticism, EU efforts to regulate and at the same time more effective functioning and the development of the whole Union, according to a number of experts, deserve more recognition.
The more serious problem is, for example, experts to draw EU grants on projects that have no indication of any link to the promotion of European integration, but which Member States have forced themselves in the budgetary negotiations.
The emotions between the Czech Republic also encourage the fact that, as well as other Union countries, the CRC in Brussels must combat the right to specific labelling of its traditional products, while it does not always succeed in this fight.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and the Rackusans avoided the marking of olomous shapes, the rum of the country whose tradition is touched by the 19th century had to rename our manufacturers to the country.
The name of rum can only be carried out from a turkey destilate, not of sugar.
In the official list of EU registered products, feta and gorgonzole, marcipan of German Lübeck or parm shunkes, for example, carlovarian sugars, burning and trebonian capr and chapel.
The EU's protective mark may be proud of the pardubic pipe and the pipes.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm amateur, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man think he wants to run for the president?
I don't mean to be a senator or a president.
If this worked without trouble in our country, I'd never have to go anywhere.
But I can't see the last twenty years the country is stealing, the thieves running, the taxes and the age of retirement.
I shouldn't have been an ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to figure out how to change it.
And since I was 40 years old and I'm an independent non-party, I have no other way to influence things than to candidate a senator or president.
You've reached the Senate, but you've arrived at the castle.
Don't you turn your back to the people who chose you?
All the time I said I'd go to the castle fight according to the results of the Senate elections.
Later, I stated that if I was elected by the Senator, I'd be running for the president.
But my goal is not function, function is a tool that I can perform my visions.
That's why I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate.
But the trouble is not just that we're giving as a nation in the cafeteria and on TV, but that we're gonna screw everyone who wants to try to change.
The media are joined in this, which dehonests a person and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
I may have been claimed to pay for a journalist or I've been a consultant of Jirie Paroubk.
Let's go to your visions.
In the fight for the castle, you have gone with this wealthy and criminal responsibility of politicians and reimbursement confession over 20 million.
You have to change the law for that.
But as president, you don't have such authority, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to deal with it?
When I lobbed as a citizen to make the leadership free, it was able to make it possible.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good proposal on the left or on the right, the appreciation will reject, and it delays citizens.
As an independent non-party, I have a much greater potential to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My preference is that without a party bowl and dogmat I can take something that is best for our country, on every side and apply it.
Do you rather consider yourself the right person or the left?
From the Czech view, I feel like people are sorting me on the left.
It doesn't matter to me if it's a little left or a little right.
It's important for me to move forward.
I don't care if someone belongs to the left or right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any publicly good solution, even if it is proposed by KSCHM or ODS, and I will also be against the wrong thought.
You're kidding when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you make a business in the company, you also have some perfect goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get closer to.
Someone can call it Populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world, or important experts have spoken about them.
But without parliament's support, only your passwords will be left.
And you're not gonna be enough in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that if you go to visit people and talk to them that you can make a criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another option.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them to our own side to make it possible.
If I have been elected by the President, there is no problem organizing a direct television transfer where I will ask the Presidents of Parliament's parties to legalize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state representatives.
And they'd have to tell you why they don't want her.
When a strong person names the unhappy, it can be pressed on a political scene.
Take the president's direct choice, that was the credit for public pressure.
I'm just saying I'm an amateur that I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I just started in politics, and for my program, I'm trying to get most support.
I'm trying to move things on my own, so if it doesn't work, I'll end up in six years and return to the private sector.
Sounds like Okamura should save Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything in one person, so I've been rounding a number of famous people, whether they'd also run to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Janchuro, and he refused to work for the quantity of work.
So at least I supported an investigative journalist Jan Lorenz, who was covering fraud with light heat oils.
I candided that people were really unsatisfied, but now I'm on weight.
Sixty percent of people weren't in the elections, and those who went, mostly chose the representatives of the establishment.
We're only two independent in the Senate.
People chose the Senate so that changes will be difficult.
Still, I will fight for my visions, such as the direct choice of mayors or haytmans.
Are you considering the establishment of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the pure past of every potential stranger, and I don't even have money for it.
I don't have any money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20 grand on my transparency account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property confessions, what's yours?
I'm guessing a private property for about 60 million.
In Prague, I have an estate for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of artwork for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million, and Scotch Superb for a million, and then a couple of millions on the account.
By the way, Aston Martin, I have because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time struggled against badness and badness.
You're riding Aston Martin, you have a property for 60 million, and you don't have any money for a campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it too much.
That's not too convincing.
I don't have 15 million for a campaign.
Should I owe it?
I've hit two and a million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program is probably not so interested.
And I don't have a duty to pay the campaign from my own.
The costs of the campaign will essentially cover what the senator's salary is going to get.
But I wouldn't have survived from it, for example, I couldn't pay my son an English school worth 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't go anywhere.
So you're going to keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut these activities down?
But it doesn't relate to the highest salary.
As I promised, I partially choked my activities.
For example, the travel manager will become my representative during the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who will save the Republic.
But I also need to live from something.
How much have you been used to taking a month as an entrepreneur?
Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I'm going on.
And if I was a president, I'd end my business.
The whole conversation will be found in the Saturday edition of the Law.
The MVRDV architects are proof that real adventure is not only in the head - for example Spikenice and recently built Mountain of books - 2 photos
"The building seems to me cheerful, it looks futuristic. Finally, it's again to see something interesting," says Lisette Verhaig, walking around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technique in the nearby large business, says, "Of course, this house is nice."
But I wonder what else we need today.
Everyone has Internet, iPady and electronic books.
None of these books in old styles are voluntary today, are they?
Spikenisse, a headquarters close to Rotterdam without his own job opportunities, which are not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
This community with 80 000 inhabitants shows the lowest level of education throughout the Netherlands.
In order to solve this stupid situation, a few years ago the decision to contribute to universal education and to build seven beautifully painted iron miniatures of fictive bridges that are displayed on euro banknotes has fallen.
Success in educational techniques, but it wasn't a distraction.
So the city councils recognized that there is only one way to become masters of statistics: we need a library!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architectural athleterium MVRDV, master of madly brave column charts and a funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted the thing with ordinary calm and in 2003 a competitive meeting appeared with five books under his hand and a scratch on his face.
And while the committee was still impressively looking around and crushing her shoulders, the brave Maas put his gifts on himself according to the size and his actively reasonable speech ended with the words "Good City Municipalities!"
So this is my proposal for the Mountain of Books in Spikenice, so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, a mountain of 30 million euros was completed.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also belongs to underground parking, supermarket, mail and several suitable housing and series houses with 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Mountain of Books was appointed by the second place of "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
A small town grey that could not yet offer more than a post-modern walking zone and an unusual ugly coroner, for which you would rather expect a white fasada milk shop, is richer than a little judicial architecture.
But primarily now Spikenisse has the first public cultural building in history of its existence.
Long Way to Book
First impression: reader's eldorado under the ceiling for cheese.
While the elevator drives the elevator through the mass of the mountain, you will discover the real space and reader’s passion as long as the topography reaches.
From all sides, the glass interior is bright and transparent, the floor of the burned cab and elegant street lamps clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The town environment is perfect.
You see park cages, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Absolutely, books with books along the fasada and in the middle there is a large dark space, which is mostly uncomfortable and unpersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built a classic space configuration upstairs and we put the reader's space out.
Inside the Mountains of Books are excellently used: offices, Internet library, chess club, ecological center and central home technology are located on Wednesday.
A special comfort is the black police on books that are once a wall cover, one parapeth, and another the barrier of the stairs.
Appearance, structure and smell work abroad.
Even the architects and construction engineers will swear on the unknown construction material.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," said Joop Trouborst, head of the project at the city village of Spikenice, on the question of Standard magazine.
So in one fryz agricultural company, one day we ran into a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, it is used in glass and fields in the Netherlands as a foundation under the roots of a milimeter rouno of synthetic material.
It's cheap and time-effective.
The thin textile endures one, two seasons, and then it's mature to throw into huge waste.
For the library, the first time in such a quantity was rouno - the boards with a thickness of four centimeters.
The so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) will be painted in dark, homogenous and burdenable material that smells a little like a new car and a little like sports shoes.
After 105 stairs, you'll get to the top.
At the end of nearly 500 meters of long travel, you will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city but also by the Dutch croquets and figs in flowers.
They take care of the atmosphere, but especially about the right moisture of air in the mountain of literature.
Gifts for a new soul
"You may not believe that, but this house is a project for the ecology, despite many glass surfaces," says Trouborst.
It's drowning and cold with Earth's warmth.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass gate, the sun shines within a short time, even in the sunny day.
The widely sticked wooden trailers standing close to the glass fassage serves as shading and captures a large part of sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
He'll deal with the rest of it completely automatic rolls.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, has already visited a new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also a teacher of the traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls Boekenberg "the oldly expected soul" of Spikenice.
Reason: Every city inhabitant was invited to open a few weeks ago to devote one book from his personal fund.
So the optical spaces were to be filled first in not fully equipped library, which currently reads 70 000 pieces.
The concept has been successful.
The police are completely filled.
"There's nothing worse than a half-law library," the architect of Winy Maas said.
"I think that our invitation now makes each inhabitant a relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just a decoration.
This has resulted in a royal discipline, which is called the creation of identity in the expert chargone.
Spikenisse wrote the history of literature.
Anyway, he's young and unscientific.
It's finally the default point for identity.
Sabo: "The Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany has delayed the vote in the decision to adopt Palestine.
According to the expert on relations between the United States and Europe, Stephen Szaboa, Berlin is balancing on a narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first signaled that it would vote against the proposal for the observer status of the United Nations in the United Nations.
But then Berlin has delayed the vote.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
But now Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he'll support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, being too critical against Israel.
During the rebellion in Libya in March 2011, Germany also delayed the vote on the establishment of a flight zone.
That's where NATO finally planted.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position in serious international topics?
Yeah, that's right.
The reason is that it's just changing its foreign policy, and that's the direction of a policy that was so-called U.S., towards the German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult that the Europeans do not have coherent and united policies.
So the Germans are between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just living in their role, but they're on their way to "normaler" foreign policy.
For foreign policy they have in France or Britain.
What specifically means "normal" foreign policy from German perspective?
It shows the readiness to take part in the case of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the positions of the United States or European partners.
I think the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, export and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are different from the economic interests of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests affect the position in the near Eastern conflict and vote in the United Nations?
First of all, Germany has a large residence in the Middle East, especially in the countries around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to frighten the public, but not the elite in the Arab countries.
Anyway, it plays a role.
But I don't want to even associate too much, it's not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, it plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany’s relations with the United States been damaged when Germany, in the case of both important decisions, has delayed voting, for example, during the voting on Palestine?
I think in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding for the German attitude.
That's why I don't think it was such a dramatic breakdown as in Libya.
Hopefully, Germany will even eradicate some respect.
This indicates that it must be considered an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States made it clear for veto.
Is there a difference between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of US internal policy.
I think Obama's government may have a significant understanding for the European attitude.
But as a result of the political situation there, this attitude cannot be public.
I don't think the differences in opinions are really as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and the Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not much enthusiastic to Netanjahu's policy at all.
Is it not difficult for Germany to harmonize its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and with the position of the EU's most important partners on the other?
I think this is exactly what makes the Germans difficult.
It would, of course, be a little easier for Germany if there was a coherent and united European policy, which is currently not happening.
So they cannot be part of a wider line, and instead they must move things forward from their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the leading role in the future and will push Europe to a European position.
Of course, it is not easy for Germany because of the relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive subject.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player? Does he even want to take the main role?
Or is the leadership role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable, and for this country it is still difficult to play a greater role for obvious reasons.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, every time Germany takes a greater role, anti-Germany moods will rise.
It doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
In this regard, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable for different neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
The U.S. influence in European policy is constantly declined, but the EU is currently not filling this vacuum.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even though they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and it makes them much more unfavourable - c'est la vie!

"Protection of marks" in China: when Puma and Armania are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a worldly famous mark, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
What's Armani Polo?
This is behind the marking which is officially registered in China, but it has nothing to do with the original company.
However, he's taking protection as long as real owners of the mark are suing them.
And even then it's not clear whether the laws can come into place.
"For a stranger is increasingly difficult to protect its marks in China," said Thomas Patloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office, who specializes in violations of protective rights in the Remote East.
A new case is landed on my desk every week.
A few more letters are enough for the counterfeits to sign their marks.
For example, Gucci's mark will become Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, they will register Prada-Kny.
This is how German companies, such as the producer of the sports goods of Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens the folder with the mark office records in Peking.
On September 14, 2010, one Chinese company had to protect the trade mark of Zegna DF Puma. A artificial name that parazits even on the fashion house of Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that Chinese are world masters in copying and violating intelligence.
In large cities, there are several floors of business houses where fakes are sold almost exclusively.
But Pattloch's cases are different. From his mandate, he proceeds against getting the Chinese companies from the marking office completely officially right to use the labels that are already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associated mark.
This word focuses on Bang Dakuan.
This means women hunting rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It damages the business, we have to rub it," said Patloch.
"The tag is settled, the exclusive position disappears, the damage to image is enormous."
Finance losses and judicial costs of the infected industry go to millions, especially in expensive spectrum products.
According to the CLSA market research data, China with a volume of 15 billion euros per year is the third largest market in luxurious goods and markets, which grows fastest.
However, the erasing of doubtful records in the register of the marks can be achieved difficultly and it is worth something.
Driving can stretch up to nine years, with an uncertain result.
Pattloch tells about cases when the court rejected the complaints, because the name that was mentioned has become a long-term "market reality".
When the suspect has a failure, he has to pay the plagiator because he damaged his mark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there's a jungle law.
Knowledge cases also relate to graphical elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machines Sany, a company who recently took over the German producer pumped on the Patzmeister beton mixture.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use an emblem that is like the Mercedes star.
The company of Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW. The dispute was resolved, and Geely had to change the logo.
The manufacturer of fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the known crocodile to the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO is acknowledging that in 2010 there were shortcomings because of too small numbers of employees and space.
But last year, accordingly, "the progress of the work process returned from an emergency situation to normal".
For example, the number of unprocessed objection proceedings decreased by 22 per cent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 per cent more than in the previous year.
Still waiting for 81,500 complaints on the office.
Something against doing it is expensive.
As often in China, they are impressive numbers.
In the last year, CTMO has been delivered more than 1.4 million requests for the protection of the mark, which is almost a third of more than 2010.
It's a record, and that means that China, subscribed behind it, is taking a list of new applications throughout the world.
This also applies to the number of all valid protective marks - totally 5,5 million.
In 2011, 1,8 billion yüan were charged on fees.
Simplely, this means that each login in average costs 1280 yüans, or 160 euros.
The dispute stands several times, as indicates the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
This concern has been fighting Chinese plagiator for over seven years.
Although the Germans have reached annulment of his illegal production of imitated car works.
However, the counterfeiler has ensured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg mark ongoingly.
We would not mention it alone, because in Germany the name cannot be protected, says Hannah Wentzler, head of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Mnichov.
The CTMO's CTMO office also rejected the objection of the monk's company.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg has reached the rights, but the opponent in the fight continues to fight today.
You need to be so careful.
The matter is now discussed at the Supreme Court.
Wentzler trusts that this will lead to a good end and praise the professionality of courts.
But he also says, "The management is extremely expensive, and it cost us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could not be calculated. In the company's archive, even a hundred years old records had to be reviewed to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered an anti-party "a high six-second amount in euros" in order to compare the dispute.
"You see what it means to us," Wentzler says.
It is threatening that the Dale East will affect Europe.
And in case imitators get unprotected marks there.
For example, one Chinese producer wanted to report the Freudenberg label for shoes and skins in Germany.
This business area has long quit, yet it has been able to reverse the registration.
"You need to be very careful," Wentzler said.
He and the Attorney Pattloch advise German businesses to be very careful in trade with China.
It is not enough to rely on international marks rights. Foreigners would rather have "all things worth protecting in any way, login in in China," Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg in the last act of his drama falls under the mark, then he may have to pay the counterparty license fees for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we'll be pressed from the market in a controversial segment.
World Day Fighting AIDS: Kicking, Singing, Assistance
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi congregation is tested — and in Swaziland, orphans are rejoiced by parents who died of AIDS.
The story of a connection that exceeds much more than 8733 miles.
First, there's a dick: cowboy high shoes, basketball shoes, ladies boats and men's mocasins are looking for a tactical parket and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then slowly, the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and sopran - insist, mothers and each other.
The 29-year-old director Fiete Hopfa almost raises it from his textile shoes when he connects voices with his wildly wild gestures.
It's Monday night. In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi congregation is testing a new song.
Fifty singers and singers come between 23 and 69, from a researcher of human genetics to a householder.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, every congregation voice has a different text and also in a very foreign language - zulu speaking by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesoth, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help to help
Unaids, the United Nations Programme for AIDS Pollutants, estimates that around 34 million people who are infected by HIV throughout the world.
Of that, 23.5 million live in South Africa.
There are 245,000 orphans in Swaziland after parents who died of AIDS.
HIV is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after their parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esithen found a municipality of Voices for Africa’s municipalities in Germany.
70 of them attends second grade school.
In 15 or 20 euros, a patronate can be taken monthly.
He guarantees a child's school, school uniform and one warm food daily in Gogo-centre.
Imbongi means in Zulu's language "tongue storyteller" or "the one who commands."
No one can speak gas bantus in this space, just singing.
For almost ten years, the congregation has trained the songs in this foreign soft speech and sometimes brings them back to the south of Africa.
In the air distance of 8 733 miles from Heidelberg, there is a village of Esithen, which depends on the powers of the votes of the German congregation.
Forty percent is infected
There are about 2,000 people, some still in simple clayed or slammed houses, and a lot of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents anymore because they have subjected to HIV virus.
In Esithena, it is seen in a small stone of Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest expected lifelong throughout the world according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of the male predecession, which proofly reduces the risk of infection by half, the population does not accept.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland wear a weakened immunity virus in themselves. It is not rare that they die in less than 30 years.
This village was discovered by the congregation on a joint journey to Africa on spring 2005, but primarily the Imbongi members saw many children on the streets missing not only parental care, but clean everything: food, clothes, education.
Without finished school education, they have no chance in the poor country.
At first, it was a private place of individuals that allowed the child to go to school in a few euros a year and give him one warm food daily.
However, a year later, the congregation of the “Voices for Africa” was established, which since then cared for orphans after parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts of sexually transmitted infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPI belongs to sifilis, chlamydia and capavka (gonorea).
Common virus SPI are HIV, human papilomavires, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Munches and scrubs belong to the parasite SPI.
Who belongs to the most poor?
Syphilis and the cocktail appear primarily in men who have sex with men.
The Institute of Robert Kocha is based on the fact that at least four of the five cases of syphilide reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
Heterosexual adults are sexually transmitted diseases that often occur, chlamidial infections, trichomonades, candidosis (flip), capapelavka and human papilomavires.
HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults, but approximately 20 percent of the newly infected HIV is in this group.
Among youths, chlamydia infections are significantly frequently infected than in other population groups.
According to European research, three quarters of all infections concern young people from 15 to 25 years of age.
In addition, human papylomavires often occur among youths.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of sifilids infected from the Constitution Robert Kocha has increased from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infected persons has been reduced since 2007.
In 2011 there were approximately 2700 cases.
That's about a dozen less than a year ago.
What symptoms do they point to sexual illness?
Infectious diseases may cause genital disorders, urinary difficulties, wailing, pain in the syringe and beards or nipples.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore they will not be observed.
How can you protect yourself?
Dangers can reduce condoms, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because the originators of sexually transmitted diseases may also be partially transmitted with illness and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examination, in particular in the case of frequent intervention of sexual partners.
In case of early diagnostic, most of the SPI can be healed and prevented from later consequences.
Thanks to the patronate, the charity gifts, and not the last series of funds that the congregation earns through singing around Germany, some money will be gathered.
"We have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitheny," said the President of the General Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is managed in the village itself, Zodwa Promini, a self-conscious woman who can prosecute.
He also cares for an orphaned child to find a shelter, for example in some of his grandmothers.
Gogo, as it's called Zulu in the language of old women, are the resistance of the village.
Some of them also took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and they took care of their children to get into school uniforms every day.
Children who no longer have no one go to the shelter to Khanyisile, a lonely woman who pays the compound as well as two cookies who cook for more than 200 hungry children daily.
"Voices for Africa" also established a school of sewing, built two chickens, and together with the American Health Organization, PSI arranged that many people in the village had made an HIV test.
Even if the disease is so obvious in the entire country, everyone is silent about it.
King With 14 Wives
"AIDS is absolutely tabu," says Annette Lennartz, "because he has anything to do with sexuality."
In fact, it's pretty strange in the country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The latest absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known as his inconvenient lifestyle.
Polygamy's place of democracy.
This State approved lifestyle is also guilty of the spread of HIV in the past decades so quickly.
But also many migrant workers who broke the virus on the ground.
Annette Lennartz says the condoms are free on every corner, "but no one uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected contact."
To support at least a little cultural exchange, the Imbongi congregation travels once at two, three years after South Africa and sings songs full of grief, struggle, confidence in the future and self-conscious blacks, which many in the southern black continent know from the age of apartheid.
The bus full of white people who sing songs in the speech of black - such appreciation brings not only mood and joy, but has already tears from many wild border soldiers.
The road is always leading to Esithen, where the singers visit children who have a patronate.
Even if you barely find this village on maps, it's more than familiar in the Ezulveni Valley.
"Go to Esithen, there's a light," people say.
And if you go back to Heidelberg, which is the airline of 8733 kilometers from here, to the singers in the Bergheimer Straße test, you see the light shines here.
Messenger: NASA discovered on Mercury Ice
Sonda Messenger found evidence that there's ice on the Merkur planet.
The ice cover could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The American National Aviation and Cosmonautic Agency (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Merkur.
Even when the sun is nearest, there is also freezing water, as it comes from three studies published by the Science magazine on Thursday.
Sonda Messenger found evidence that there is an ice cover in the area of this planet, which lies in a permanent shadow.
It is allegedly at least 30 inches and may even 20 metres strong.
This water came from comets, or perhaps from the asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let us not find ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said the leaders of the scientists working on the Messenger Sonde, Sean Solomon.
The temperature at Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees of Celsia.
However, findings could help us explain how water and other basic elements of life came into other areas of the solar system.
Sondy, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix, unobserved landmen, are involved in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, images come out to Earth, a small window to infinite distances.
The photo comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists from Maxe Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, other than the Patch Planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which circles around the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not under the new definition of the International Astronomy Union of 2006 "planet".
This infrared image of Spitzer's telescope shows a "family portrait" of unbroken generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, worse identifiable are pinkly colored "new-dimensional" in the star's birth Hall.
This area where stars are formed - scientists unromanticly call it W5 - found the Spitzer telescope in the Cassiopei star at a distance of 6500 light years.
This alternate light of the dying star caught NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The ring is composed of the material that the star crushed during the die process.
In the giant mist of Trifid, a distance of 5400 light years from the Earth, the gas and dust of the new star are emerging.
The photograph of the galaxy colleague was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The star of the Playada, also called "Seven Six Sisters", is visible with just an eye at night.
But the telescope makes colors better.
Fog Helix can look like a red eye on this infrared image.
It is located at the distance of 700 light years from the co-stars of the Water.
Her similarity to the earthly world has brought out this fog named North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photo is the source of unusual coloring.
This "baby" between stars was able to snipe in full beauty until the infrared detectors of Spitzer's telescope.
Saturn and his rings: how they came up, is one of the greatest astronomical mystery.
Hopefully it's the remains of Saturn's month, which disappeared 4,5 billion years ago without a lead.
One of the biggest and most sharp pictures of Hubble's telescope: Faith galaxy
Spiral galaxies are, according to their colors, real artwork.
The recording published by the European South Observer shows a few thousand light years away from Trifid fog in the Shore Star.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (separated to three parts, triple), because the dark dust thresholds divide the burning heart of this star breeding into three parts.
In the constellation of Hadonos, astronomers photographed the prediction of a cosmic crash: at 400 million light years from the Earth, they have to collaborate with the core of two floating galaxies.
This birth of the star recorded Hubble's telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Who doesn't like technical shortcuts can call it a nickname of the South Wind.
The photograph of Hubble's space-wide video shows an extremity of Iris mist in the Céfea co-star.
These 1400 light years, the remote fog consists of dust grains, which are ten times to a hundred times smaller than the usual domestic dust.
This picture was composed of optical and rentgen images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring from black holes, which is far away from 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273, recorded the Hubble's space sight for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810 scientists.
In this star fog, there is the clearest group of young stars in our Milk Way.
The star wheel brings up to new increases.
Also, this star cloud connected with the mist of Rosette is still born by new young stars. They are away from the Earth for 5,000 light years.
In this clear glowing galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Scientists believe that it only came up shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly a hydrogen.
Our views for the universe: the most important telescope
He reportedly invented Hans Lipperhey in 1608. Before Galileo, he used it a year later to observe stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical remote views have continued to grow -- and the views that they intermediate are increasingly depth.
The greatest distant perspective in the world was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale’s telescope at the observatory of Palomar near San Diega.
The mirror on this picture had a diameter of five meters.
In American Arizona, Large Binocular Telescope stands.
It allows us to look into the universe immediately with two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 meters.
Interior Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only a mirror measures about 10.4 metres.
The mirror Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to reduce costs.
Still, his average reaches approximately 11 meters.
Efficiency of a cheap design method: the telescope is secured by a hack in a high angle, thus limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in a high angle.
His speciality is a high increase in the light flow.
Despite the relatively small average of the mirror, this is going to compare to the largest mirrors in the world.
A radio telescope in Arecib (Portorico) is searching for scientists in the universe by alien signals.
This radio telescope has an average of 305 meters.
At "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - searching for an alien intelligence - can help any computer owner that will provide its calculation performance.
The view of the observer of the European Southern Observer (ECO) in the Chilean Andes.
Very Large Telescope stands here and honors his name.
This remote view with a total of four mirrors can also enlighten the middle infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large disposal is also planned for the Chile Observers of the ESO.
His main mirror should be full of 42 metres and is to be composed of nearly 1,000 mirrors.
However, the images can be calculated first in 2018.
Two Kek's long-sights on the Hawaii soups of Mauna Kea were considered the biggest in the world by 2007.
They offer two mirrors right now, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Kek's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition to them, views into the universe and through the Subarus and IRTTF telescope.
A new giant telescope is also to be created on Mauna Kea - with a thirty-foot mirror diameter.
Here you can admire him on the picture.
However, the most important impressions from the universe are indicating the Hubble's space sight.
The images of remote worlds have been provided with us since 24 April 1990.
The Space Telescope of Kepler is searching from March 2009 to extrasolary planets - especially for those who are inhabitants.
2 February 2011 NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets have been identified since the beginning of the mission.
The last preparations are documented on the picture before launching a space telescope of Kepler.
The universe television of James Webb (JWST) will first be shot into the universe in 2018 on the Ariane board.5.
The primary mirror of the universe infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for the light of the first stars and the galaxy after the Big Shoke.
Scientists come from the fact that there's ice in the southern field of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, because the Messenger circles around this planet far closer to the northern field.
Radar measurement has shown that there is ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the Messenger sonda, which was sent in 2004 and is the first one rounding around Mercury, scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter daily and live 168 years
In the southern Azerbaijan, many will experience Bible age.
There's even a long-term museum.
Finding tracks in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In the southern Azerbaijan, many will experience Bible age.
There's even a long-term museum.
Finding tracks in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
We can call it a wild romantic ride.
The microbus rails along the road with many turns along the density of forest hills, wooden rivers and simple rural buildings.
Everything's green and juicy, almost seems to be in Schwarzwald.
But this is the latest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few miles away.
This is where the Kaucasian ethnic group of Talis, which is not known too much, except that he speaks perfectly Persian and Azerbaijan and experiences a very high age.
The final station is Leric.
This city is carried out with too monumental architecture from the Soviet times, which does not go into a picturesque mountain land.
Tourists from Europe are not coming here. The arrival from the Azerbaijan capital of Baku is too difficult.
It takes 8 hours for 323 miles, because the road is only one-way.
The fairy fortune for which the country owes oil in the Caspic Sea has not arrived in the village yet.
However, Pilate Fatulajeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the Great Price of Eurovise in May - and we will have the most oldest people in the world next year," Fatulajeva says.
She's the director of the Museum of Long Ages, probably the only one in the world.
This is the documented life of almost eight dozens of Talys from the neighborhood that are older than a hundred years old. Fatulajeva shows a black-white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
When he was 136 years old, he was still a child.
However, a disputed star of this museum was the sheep sheep’s pasturer Müslümov, who was reportedly 168 years old.
There is no birth sheet, of course.
And since the oldest man with documents was 122 years old, Müslüm's age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," explained Fatulajeva.
This man was allegedly married three times and had 23 children, and at 136 years he still had a daughter.
Did they not mistake Müslümov at his age for a few decades?
However, he also heard about the summer people in Central Asia, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist of the Constitution of Maxe Planck in Rostock.
"Assumably many high-aged people live in some areas of China, Japan or the valley of Hunza in Pakistan," Sholz says, "to Sardinia also lives extremely many very old men."
However, because of missing grounds, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially if matrix is missing.
Each day of dissolved butter
But the fact is that people around Leric often experience Bible age.
At present there are 20 people who are 100 years old.
So why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijan guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by the special genes of Talis.
The Director of the Fatulev Museum believes it's in food.
However, the fact that the caloric food of Talys, who love meat, bread, and primarily milk products, and many of which drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, it does not seem exactly reliable from bromatological terms.
Or is this the original way of life that maintains the young people? In the Cengemated, a small accommodation near the city of Lerik, the residence of Rubab Mirzaev.
In 97, she is relatively young on this geographical width.
Mirzaeva, who claims that she has 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the whole Kaucasian region.
He's sitting on the ground with a massage that he's intimately colliding.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of the sons of Mirzaev and the daughter, both of them are a long time ago grandparents.
Two little kids are jumping around.
In the kitchen the guests are preparing the tea that is given in typical stomach glasses "armadu".
The white teeth of Mirzaev forms a perfect series and hides a long dark blond copy that her son is proudly revealing before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so I didn't look like it, and they kept the color.
"I've never used a shampoo," said Mirzajeva.
Moon retirement for life is enough
She was always eating what was from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
I haven't bought food in the supermarket for my whole life.
Then he tells me about his man who was in the army.
It was the worst of the second world war.
But everything's been better when the "loved father" Gaidar Aliev took over the weslo.
The propaganda sounds weird from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is around the character of the father of the nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan is no limit.
He was in power by 2003, and then he took over his son Ilham.
The old people in Azerbaijan are at least not suffering the need.
Mirzaeva receives a pension of 230 manats every month (about the same amount in euros). This is for the ratio of which you can well survive.
And perhaps he's right, even a long-fashioned son of Mirzaev: "Old people live in our culture of great seriousness."
They live in the middle of a great family, they are loved, cared and happy.
If that's not the reason to stay alive as long as possible
The term "man rights" in the Constitution is missing
The revolution returned to Cahira.
The disgusted demonstration in Cairo revealed the deep diversity of the country.
A sharp discussion is discussed on the future constitution based on the law of the chariya.
Egyptian president did not save the patos.
We have to create a transition.
"And for doing this, I'm responsible for the people and God," he said in the public television.
His speech was appointed to the whole nation, especially to the Christian Kopts, Liberals, the glorious Muslims and the secular individuals.
All those, yet hopelessly disputes in confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the "God State" in Nile issued for mercy to the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi almost apologised that he restricted the competence of the Constitutional Court to expand his own to "save the revolution".
However, what a 61-year-old engineer who has the title of American University in southern California really wants to save, the Egyptians and the world are not clear.
Should the judiciary be removed from power?
234 Paragraphs, which the 100-headed Constitutional Meeting with the overwhelming of Islamists quickly approved in the 15-hour night marathon, partially raise anxiety.
As in the previous constitutions, it is said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic Law".
But what does it mean "the rule"?
It was and is a matter of interpretation and can be feared that Islamists will use this irrelevant formulation and the linked legal free space with it for a more strict interpretation of the charios.
At least this enlightens the newly added paragraph: In all matters relating to the scarrie, it is necessary to consult the university of al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic Institute in the country with great influence on the whole sunny Islam.
This must not be, but it may mean that the clerus will supervise the law enforcement, which would bring justice to real deprivation of its right.
In the Constitution's draft, there are many things of interpretation
The problem is also that civil competence of military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served for Mubarak's governments to oppress opposition.
After the dictation was fallen, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
As it stands in the proposal, it should also protect the "reality of the Egyptian family and support its morals and values".
This is formulated on the legal page so untoleratedly that, using this paragraph, the state institutions may even check the contents of film art and literature.
In a clear speech, it means nothing but censure.
In addition, no paragraph in writing describes explicit equality of men and women.
Hence, another parable prohibits shame or condemns the prophet Mohamed and his ambassador.
However, uncertainty remains what is shame and how it will be pursued.
Suspiciously, the formulation is prohibited by "offense of people".
Is the president's charication or a joke on the account of law experts enough in this case?
The matter of interpretation, as much more in this proposal, which Murcia will submit to the signature and, according to its words, "very soon" will present to the Egyptians in order to vote humanly.
"The revolution has come back"
For several weeks, opposition has been formed against the overwhelming of Islamists.
Thousands of people gathered on Friday night in Tahrir square in Cahira and pledged to destroy the constitutional paper before it began to pay.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahí, who was situated in the presidential elections in the third place.
The Nobel Price holder and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baraday, declared that the proposal of the Constitution belongs to "to the trash of history".
By means of the Short News Service, Twitter accused Mursi's advocate that they wanted to carry out a "papch against democracy".
"If the referendum announces, we go to his palace and throw it away," said Jasir Said opposition member.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not punished," the Egyptian media of the opposition policy of Chalid Ali.
Several judges announced that they did not want to supervise the referendum, which would become incorrect.
"The Quran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared a supernationality, however, not by caution at the Tahrir Square, but after a massive prayer on the other shore of Nile before the Cahir University.
She was attended by a number of sheathed women and fans of salaphists who cried: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
They called Mursay, "Clean the Land!" and assured, "The Quen is our constitution."
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic square of Tahrir, where everything began, would probably cause a state like a civil war.
Mursay's participants obviously didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that the opponents and the representatives of the proposal of the Constitution had expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now it's time for people to decide where the country should go.
Most of the Islamic proposals are considered certain.
"The word 'man rights' does not occur once"
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, is authorized by Hafize Abu Sa'du.
Eighty-five-year-old defender of human rights and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or were in court.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because human rights are inseparable to him.
He was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And in the new constitution there are no words 'man rights' now," she complains in the interview for "Welt am Sontag".
Mursay's expansion of power to all three power components in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandal blame against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil society, the president actually cancels it," Sa'da complains.
However, without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community that tracks the match of ideological fractions in Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could get him revenge.
The demonstrator on Tahrir Square warns, "You have created a monster you can't control anymore."
Norwegian Racfisk: The most smelling fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of country's success be linked to the local appetite for extremely smelling fish?
Pick up some vicious cheese.
Put them in the middle of a bunch of dirty and wet football equipment.
Let it lie for a week.
So you'll get the smell of racfis, one of the biggest Norwegian delicates.
I'm in a small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's a snow, a beautiful view - and in the air there's a smell everywhere.
Rakfisk is a salt spray wired in the water for up to one year - depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As the darkness and it starts to be cold, Normans are beginning to meet here in Fagernes at the festival dedicated to how to say it to the best, most deceptive food.
"You eat the cheese and then you drink it with a glass aquavit," says Howard Halvarsen, a local professional fireman, but also the so-called "Rakfisk General", which is responsible for the progress of the festival.
Everywhere around us people eat small fish cubes and drink them with a large amount of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit than a racfisk," says Howard.
The drink can overwhelm the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a piece of sushi that was on a long road by bus.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different period of poverty in Norway, and since there were no refrigerators, the fish was wearing in water and salt air vessels on the autumn.
Then, in the middle of the winter, when they were well chewed, pulled out and ate -- the senses of alcohol were undoubted.
One generation ago, thousands of Normas were forced to leave their land and look for jobs, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is rapidly growing - more than 13% of the immigrants are attracted to a large quantity of work, high earnings and a wide system of care.
The residents of Sweden, an old rival, who has recently been much richer than Norway, are flowing to the country at work.
The racfisk is seen as something important, independent, even though the relatively smelling part of the Norwegian past.
It belongs to more expensive food on the market.
Even though the expensive is all - a little glass of beer or sandwich you get to 9 pounds ($14) for a piece.
Norway often doesn't get into the world's news - and it seems most inhabitants like that.
The name of Anders Breivik, the right racist extremist, who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioning insensitive.
Instead, the shooting is called "personality of July 22th".
Norways can only hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Under the current wealth, Norway is the growth of one of the world’s biggest oil and gas industrys from the early 70s of the twentieth century.
"But the oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," says our waitress Anna, who, with her long blond hair and surprisingly blue eyes, represents the prototype of Nordic Welfare.
We're, as you call us, respectful people.
Her English, like English of most people here, is absolutely perfect.
We don't pretend, we don't like the appearance.
Norway is very careful with its oil wealth - except for a small percentage, most of the money in this sector is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When all the others in the years leading to the world’s financial collapse, they had no money, the Norwegians had the ropes on their bottle firmly covered.
"Where we can ski in winter and go to trips summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"And eating a racfisk," he adds with an unequivocated laughter.
I'm standing in a snow in the ring for something to eat. I'm done with the racfish.
Such a losy burger must be something else and it's beautifully juicy.
But tonight, the smelling fish is back here.
The hotel in which I live is one of the many places where the racfisk is given for dinner and where the guests choose the best, or rather for the smell of the biggest fish.
They've got a connection with a live television transmission in which a butterfly moderator is surrounded by plates with racphis.
It's like the Eurovision Singing Competition.
"What is your score for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?"
"There's our score, Howard."
It's an applause and laughing.
A man will fall from the chair, perhaps capable of aquavit.
Or maybe the gas from all those fish.
Enrique Pena Neto from Mexico has a difficult start
As the Mexican President Enrique Pena Neto is preparing to take over the office, Will Grant from BBC is looking at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his companions.
Transport to Mexico City is particularly bad at present.
In the city, which is inclusive in the best times, there were steel barriers that closed several key routes to the capital and caused chaos roads.
However, the goal was not to prevent those coming to get to work, but to prevent the protestant from access to Parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico Enrique Pena Neto will receive the presidential scarpe and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a difficult task.
Mexico has been well economically conducted during the resignation of Felipe Calderon, but the country is in a drug war that has already estimated to be the victim of 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to reducing violence against the people of Mexico," President Pena Neto said to the US President Barack Obama in Oval's workshop at the beginning of this week.
I'll propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before he shake his hand with the American President, President Pena Neta won political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
The views of the new leader are also different in his old homeland, the people and the extensive state surrounding the capital.
Direct man.
For example, in the village city of Valle del Bravo, they remember him in good.
Citizens assign to him to the development of tourism in the aircraft and construction of infrastructure.
Now you can go to the city on one of the new roads that he left Pena Neto to build. These roads are a huge improvement against the hollow and throat roads that have been here before.
The boards with his name are also hanging on the walls of the modern sports center and an imposing interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect it to bring a real and lasting change," said Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, State Ambassador for President Pen Net, the Institutionalized Revolution Party (PRI).
Especially, we hope in the interesting and real changes in the area of security and economy that our country needs so necessary.
After 81 years of power, the Pri Party was pressed by Vicent Fox.
Ambassador Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, the Party of Enriqua Pena Net expects many.
And he refuses to express opposition that characterizes the new president as a person without a substantial content.
He's a very direct man, very busy with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a great state, and he's mostly a person who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not the impression of his former governor.
In Nehualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, can't be contrast with valle del Bravo streets more apparent.
He is stuck under the road trips in a lot of reminders of the suburbs of the main city of Mexico.
And the problems in the self-appropriate community are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army was called to help manage drug gangs operating in the quarters, especially intense, is violence on women.
Only in the last two years, the body of dozens of murdered women were thrown in empty places next to the huge waste puzzle.
During the time Pena Neto governor, more than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico, which is much more than in the notorially violent city of Ciudad Juarez, a sinonym for the murder of innocent women.
In a better case, the critics of Pena Neta say he failed in his office in adequate treatment with the problem of women's murders.
And in worse cases, his leadership is accused of closing eyes.
In the concrete house, typical for the crying quarter, Irinea Buendia shows me photos of his dead daughter Mariana Luna and pushs cry.
According to the official version, Marian committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner killed her.
"When I arrived in her house, it seemed like her body washed," Mrs. Buendia recalls.
There were signs of hits on him, and after-death coldness has already begun.
As her mother tells a story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross where the only word is "justice".
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they were denied.
State authorities treated me as if I was an old talk, troubled one, and a knuckle.
They want you to just accept what they say and shut up.
"But it can't be right when there were so many mistakes and I remember," he says.
The sherpa which President Pena Neto receives on Saturday is accompanied by a great responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of families in Mexico were affected by a violent crime and the new president promised that during his work in the office they would be his priority.
"I hope that he will be the same president as the governor," said a Member of Olver in Valle del Bravo.
But that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about the wrong treatment, says the military prosecutor.
The military prosecutor is trying to distort Bradley Manning's claim regarding a gross treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in a military detention in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be rejected on the basis of a rough treatment with Manning in prison.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that the soldier Bradley Manning, who is accused of the greatest escape of secret material in the history of the United States, has missed many possibilities to complain about the rude treatment that he reportedly suffered in military detention.
The military prosecutor of May. Ashden Fein at the cross interrogation of soldier Manning at the preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede in Maryland claimed that the records of weekly visits that Manning had with officers during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not indicate any complaints on the wrong treatment.
The cross interrogation that occurred during the hearing carried out on a defense proposal to reject the case led against Manning due to a gross treatment during the time of detention, which was sufficient for himself, took place a day after Manning witnessed that he considered suicide in custody.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents in his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At the Friday hearing, a military prosecutor Fein and Manning had been held with the forms that officers met with Manning in the custody in Quantico, where he was held in the regime with increased security from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that the treatment of his guards was "excellent" and total treatment in the device was "very professional".
Forms do not show any complaints about the wrong treatment, even if officers of Manning directly asked how it was treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that the concerns regarding various problems expressed orally and that the officers who visited him had spoken about these concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not record these problems.
"They wrote "no problems" (after they discussed the concerns), and that did not necessarily mean that I did not mention them," said Manning.
Judge Colonel Denise Linda also asked why he did not complain about the treatment of his person in January 2011 when he met with a committee assessing the suicide thoughts that he expressed in the form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during this meeting, his intention was to achieve a reduction in the system of injury prevention.
The army stated that this restrictive regime (one degree under surveillance regime) used it for the protection and security of others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this system of injury prevention... so that I could enjoy an increased quality of life, as I saw," said Manning.
Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and transport to Kuwait on Thursday, where he was held nearly two months before he was transported to a marine prison base in Quantico in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait, and one of the warm ones went down there.
He stated that the fact that he was not allowed to know what would happen with him and what is happening in the surrounding world was very embarrassing.
"My world smashed only to the Arifjan base, to that cage," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cell.
Manning stated that after his arrival in Quantica spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was allowed to have only one mattress, covers, brands, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or just laying was against the day.
Manning said that he always slept with light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned on the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's legal representative filed a formal complaint on the treatment of soldier Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manninga also asked about the charges he filed in the fourth statement about that after he was forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked before the guard and other companions in the morning counting.
Manning told him he was not allowed to cover his cover when he counted.
At the Friday interrogation, Judge Manning stated that, on the order of his guards, he judged that he had a cover that he could hide, but confessed that no one gave him the order to defer it.
On Thursday Manning confessed that he was forced to sleep naked, because he tried to show the officer he wasn't dangerous.
Manning stated that he told the officer he could use his underwear belt or his slippers to hurt himself, but he didn't do it.
Manning confessed that that night his underwear was removed from his cell, his brands and glasses.
His legal representative hopes that the judge will take into account his experience in his imprisonment and that in the case of his conviction before the military court whose beginning is expected at the beginning of the next year, his punishment will significantly reduce him.
The defense indicated that Manning is planning to confess to blame in lower crimes and fight against other charges because they are too extreme.
The start of the hearing is scheduled for this week, the military prosecutor is expected to defend the war conditions as legitimate.
Pentagon stated that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions relating to all arrested persons held in custody with maximum security.
Among the charges filed against Manning include the help of the enemy, the illegal cause of the publication of the reporting documents on the Internet, the transfer of information concerning national security and theft of public property or records.
If he's accused at all points, he can be convicted for life.
My crisis of Mexico-American identity
He says that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the insufficient possibilities there.
Mexicans are inclined to blame those who have gone; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says the Mexican Americans are hacked between the two worlds.
At the last time I traveled to Mexico, I barely struck myself with a crowd and arrived in a space for an immigrant agency where I encountered a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" and the other for "Extranieros" ("Cizinci").
I stood there for a few seconds, and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California and I was called Mexican all my life.
It's an ethnic shortcut, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves "Iry" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italia".
So later, I ended up with the "Mexican American".
But this was Mexico.
And my grandfather's home didn't have to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don't have a word supply of a child speaker and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood in the queue for Extranieros.
I was thinking about the moment the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Neto visited the White House of President Obama this week.
The program had common issues that were discussed when the leaders of these two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Neto also wanted to discuss the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why the same probability of the Mexican remaining in Mexico as traveling to the United States.
He wants to connect to the United States and Canada and create a trade block similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Neto promised to continue the Mexican war against drug cartels, even though he didn't give any details.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are complicated and full of enemy feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States attacked Mexico and forced his leader under the threat of weapons to overwrite half of the Mexican territory in the United States.
But for Mexicans who think in the range of centuries, not minutes, the comments are everywhere available.
So a minute after the United States representative says something a little bit critical about Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and between the elite complaint about how the Americans interfere with their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma will go to the war path.
Yet, Mexico is a real challenge for more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about enemy feelings?
There's a lot of them.
There are winners and defeats in Mexico, people whom the country offers options, and others who don't.
The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that in some point of our family tree, there was a person, perhaps a parent or grandfather who was denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more frequently than it seemed, this person responded to the profile - dark skin, weak education, origin from the poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and are loyal to them.
Not about Mexico.
And even though we live an American dream now, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live an American dream, not Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
Besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and view us as a subsequent race that is not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico are never strong enough.
Our existence is, according to their views, only of failure.
If our families weren't failing in Mexico, they would never leave him.
And now we would not be trapped behind a silk coat, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and in her childhood, has legally traveled to the United States, reminds me that there is tension between the Mexicans and the Mexican Americans, because the Mexicans understand more who they are, and the Mexican Americans do not like it.
Although she's a United States citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel like a part of any.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You'll get the best from both countries, but you don't have any roots in one.
In Mexico, they look at us as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And to make relations even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and part of intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect to the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provisory Ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American companions how great it is to visit this country and push on political leaders to consolidate relations with Mexico.
No, no.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many enemy feelings.
And thanks to the inequality of income and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that this is a great country.
I feel like it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the way they deal with Mexico a half a century ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel distressed about how they deal with their family members in a significantly closer past.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The closing of the fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be a permanent peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another circle of bloodshed suggests that each such unthink is vain.
Among the usual unnecessary arguments about who started it, many buildings were changed into ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most civilians, and six Israelis. And the first time the missiles from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the sacred city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelis and the Palestinians seemed to be stuck in their ancient conflict, the Middle East changes around them.
The Arab spring changed the old orders and the Palestinians and the Israelites, whether they like it or not, are captured in a mess in the region.
Maybe it'll make their fight even more bloody than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that this could interrupt their fatal situation.
A war that is not even winned or lost.
At first, it seems that there are no many reasons for optimism at present.
Even if the stopping of the fire closed on 21 November, the fighting of this week would be strengthened on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic Movement that has ruled in Gaza since 2007, will claim that they have forced the Israelites to retreat, even though Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closing of 1.7 million Gaza’s population in one of the most sad and most poor corners of the planet, Hamas could not destroy Israel.
And indeed, Hamas gains an impact on the Western shore, another piece of Palestine, which is currently managed by his rivals from Fatah, a modest Palestinian fraction.
Furthermore, the leaders of Hamas can very well decide that time is on their side.
Islamists have gained greater influence throughout the Arab world, so Hamas has gained powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, the resurrected regional power, which once was the closest Muslim Alliance of Israel, joined Hamas, as well as Katar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Bay.
The people from Hamas say that the Islamic half-month is encompassed around Israel, north of Lebanon, where the party/military Hizballah is ruled over Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly devoted to Islamism, can plant Basar Asada until Jordan, where the allies of Hamas threaten kings.
And primarily, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, from far the most poor and difficult Arab country, the balance in the region.
Mubarak, a secular despot, who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas, and his leaders are more influenced by the public opinion.
In the future diplomacy, Hamas can appear as a player who cannot be excluded either by Israel or from America.
On the contrary, the Israeli advocates of the hard line will come to the opposite conclusions.
In the military terminology, Hamas was put back in the box.
The Israeli anti-rake system The Iron Couple has proved its price, and many missiles of Hamas were destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as intimate as always. Many European countries have also blamed Hamas for the beginning of the last round of violence.
And mainly - Israel has been prospering, especially under Benjamin Netanjahua, the president of the government, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although the Gaza missiles had killed about 30 Israeli men since 2004, there was relatively peace from suicide bombers in Israel, part of the wall that interferes with the West Coast, the main part of what the Palestinian State might once be, and protected the Jewish settlements, which continue to grow even in spite of its illegality against international law.
Prime Minister Netanjah, whose party Likud at the beginning of the campaign held on 22 January, has connected with a more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, in a good position.
Why blur the Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled on the West Bank, wouldn't they fire missiles like their countrymen in Gaza?
It's better if we keep them behind the wall and hit them when they push their heads out.
Perhaps the residents of the hard line will win, but the Arab spring can change their calculations.
Although islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not have too much love for Israel, their primary priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel’s costs for defence are higher than the costs of all its four Arab neighbours together.
Starting a new war with local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to recover their economy.
The fact that President Mursi cooperated with President Barack Obama to achieve the ceasefire is a good sign and can mean the beginning of something new.
The Israelites should also view the situation in a long term.
At the time the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, it creates the vampire of the rights of Palestinians to self-determinate a vessel with a fire dust, which one day must explode in the areas of Israel occupied -- just as the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
The democracy has already been weakened in the Jewish state, and demographic is making the situation worse as the Arab population grows.
Bloody gases against Gaza that take place every few years in order to push Hamas will continue to select diplomatic taxes.
Both parties need incentives from outside.
The answer is what reasonable people say on both sides, most of the outside world and these newspapers: two states where Israel will move to the territory for security.
In a short-term view, there is a little hope that the ceasefire will provide pressures from outside at least a little bigger impact on this matter.
Egypt, who has to plant with Turkey and Qatar to stop the delivery of weapons to Gaza, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the borders of 1967 with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs of the outside must also push the match between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more than a direct offer of virtual state sovereignty in the United Nations to create the Palestinian State.
President Obama also has his work on how to get Israel to the work table.
In his first election period, he forgot the presentation of his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, it seems equally coward in its entry into the process.
That's sadly short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in the stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful comparison between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, laws on ugly cigarettes have entered into force
The inexpected green boxes that are the same for all tobacco marks are displayed warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body.
The Australian laws on the ugly packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of their species in the world, and the log and colors of the marks replaced the general olive green boxes with disgusting images of the sick parts of the body and the view of children and newborns who have suffered from smoking their parents.
In addition to various health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the boxes is the names of marks printed by the same small letter.
It's the most strict regime in the world about the pack of tobacco.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to prevent young people from smoking by eliminating this habit of attraction.
It is based on studies that show that if people do not start smoking at age 26, 99% is the chance that they will never start smoking.
"I in very small children you can see that he understands the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell together with their product," says the Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies, which, for example, showed that children are connecting the crown in logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and changes will only have a small impact on the profits of overnational companies, other countries consider the introduction of similar steps.
The tobacco industry was hardly lobbying against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies argued that this law would increase black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and more available cigarettes.
"With this legislation, there will be serious uninterested consequences," said Scott McIntyre from British American Tobacco Australia.
The counterfeits from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products to be sold on the streets of Australia.
Others say the laws have increased their trades.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarette packages from silicone served for covering disgusting boxes two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeals on the laws to the highest court in Australia, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha indicated that Zico sold nearly 6,000 pieces to large-marketing sellers and expects new supplies.
It's a good business for us.
As possible, experts indicate the popularity of social media in the demographic group on which the plan is focused.
During a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsoring sports events and demanding that most sellers hide cigarettes from direct view, tobacco marketing moves on-line.
Australia has prohibited the Internet advertising by local companies and websites, but it cannot limit foreign sites.
"If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you have only this small space for promoting your products, the online space is an invincible place in which you want to be," says Becky Freeman, research worker at the University of Sydney.
Mrs. Freeman observed an increase in the assessment of marks on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by "Medium Honzo".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has made this job and created this video, or is that the marketing company involved?
The British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how it lays new rules rather than on marketing.
The branch went so far that it paid Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacking new legislation - the countries within the World Trade Organization declare that trade is unfairly limited, despite none of the countries with Australia has been dealing significantly.
The decision of the SOO is expected in the middle of 2013.
The Minister Plibersek says the government has interviewed other governments that consider similar laws concerning packaging.
Canada was the first country that introduced mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
It has now spread into more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Stricter laws are considered by the United Kingdom, New Zealand, the South African Republic and India.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
Pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"Only pull a cigarette and put the box back," says Victor El Hage when you buy a box with a tumor photograph in your mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason to stop smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in the centre of Sydney, claims that the unity boxes are harder for him to compare to the regáls.
"I took one hour to put my cargo on, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we would say, "Okay, that's over, we close the store," he said and shake it with his hands.
In the world of constant connection, it's not so bad to be bored
The last Thanksgiving Day I spent five hours unexpectedly at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So we had a lot of time thinking about boring.
I won't lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty boring, despite the distraction of books, magazines and iPhone (not talking about duty-free trades).
But some scientists and experts on child development are increasingly coming with praise of boring themselves.
They say that for us (and our children) it is good to be bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go into interesting directions, which can support creativity.
And since most of us are constantly attached to a screen today, we don't have a chance to enjoy boring.
So should we support the boring?
Yes.
Oh, no.
But I'll go back to that.
First of all, as many people, I assumed that boring is a relatively new phenomenon that happened with the arrival of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University in Calgary, who is the author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (History of Nudy) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, it has bored long history," he said.
On the walls in Pompeii, a Latin sign about boring originating in the first century of our year's number was found.
And then the question is how we define boringness.
The problem is that it was defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After seeing research literature and showing the idea to the target group about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boring as a experience "I wanted to do something that would please me, but I wasn't capable of it."
The boring is different from the apathy by not being involved in anything, but she would want to be.
He says there's no need for an apathy to do anything.
He says the core of boredom is "a disturbance of the process of attention connected with the bad mood and the feeling of slowly running time."
Nurse can remind you of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a relationship with each other, boring people have a tendency to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we have only trouble focusing.
In its study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to the previous experiment where participants listened to the tape on which a person read the article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated TV program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group didn't hear it at all.
Those who heard the television program quietly announced more boring than the other two groups - had problems with focus, but were not sure why and had these troubles boring.
When you try to focus on a difficult or bound task, disturbance can lead to boring, Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "as looking for bad parts on the factory line, distractioning music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he said, we now know that screwing and screwing, often viewed as a sign of boring, can actually help with boring fighting and keep people physically more careful.
"The study shows that children who are allowed to rotate will learn more and maintain more information than those who are forced to sit calmly," Professor Fenski said.
We've all experienced boring - my flight's delay, the sounding reproductor, especially a long-term movie.
But some individuals have more chance to bore themselves than others.
To help measuring boring, scientists developed the "Boredom Proneness Scale" in the 1980s.
The column includes questions like, "Mnoge things I have to do, repeat and are monotonous," and "I have so much interests that I don't have time to do them all."
With these degrees, scientists found that boys have a tendency to bore themselves more frequently than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially with regard to the need to have more and different external stimulations.
However, teenagers are generally irregular.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor for human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment, in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of the teenagers indicated that they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, three percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn't know if the percentage of boring would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said that he knows that "adoing is a top time for boring", which is much caused by children and youths, not much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, is boring for you?
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme shape, it can lead people to the absurd physical risks, to play gambling games or to abuse habits as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the relationship between boring and creative, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem over two decades.
"It's a way of brain to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing you should do.
If you bore and use this energy to play guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a moment, not for a long time.
So if your child is bored and you give him iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn how to entertain or drive himself, Professor Fenski said.
And "this separate procedure is transferred from one situation to the other," professor said.
Your child can not only learn how to entertain itself, but get more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boring.
But we should not be too critical against her.
Our goal should rather be to feel comfortable when we are from the reach of the continuous drilling of activities and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of the need to bore herself even more, but boring is painful, uncomfortable desire to be connected to something meaningful," he said.
What people actually look for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy a free time.
"In the environment we're constantly overstimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain when noise turns off."
There is no manual in Colorado concerning the new marijuana law
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a student at high school and footballist from southeastern Colorada, faces charges of crimes for something that will soon be legal in the entire state - for holding a few grams of marijuana and the chimney he used for smoking.
Mr. Orozco said that one brilliant day he went with several friends in Lamar, on the plans near the borders with Kansas when he was stopped.
After the policeman found in the car of marihuana, Mr. Orozco was issued an invitation to hold drugs and equipment for drug use - minor offences for each penalty of 100 USD - and he was given a court date.
"They treated us as criminals," Mr. Orozco said.
But he's a criminal?
In uncertain weeks after the Colorad vote on the legalization of a small quantity of marijuana for recreation is dependent on the answers of hundreds of smaller drug cases rather in place than on law.
Thousands of cases of marijuana offences have already been here and in Washington, who approved similar measures, have been cancelled.
The police department stopped blaming adults aged 21 years and elders for holding a small quantity that will be legally permitted after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But the plaintiffs in the more conservative districts of Colorada declared that they would continue with existing cases relating to marijuana, and still accuse people of holding.
At the same time, several towns from Denver's suburb to the West Mountains vote to prevent the opening of new, licensed marihuana trades in their municipalities.
"This matter is developing so quickly that I don't know what's going to happen," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
The heads are screwed by the regulators in the state of Washington.
They are looking for instructions about how to set up a system of licenses for growing, production, distribution and sale - all to December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether in good or bad, is first in front of most countries in marijuana regulation, first for medical use and now even for recreation.
"Colorado has a more regulatory market, so he will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, speaker of the Council for Selling License for Alcohol of Washington State.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what could work.
"There is no real precedens we can follow," he said.
The Washington Law, called I-502, is efficiency on December 6th, which also leaves the annual vacuum, during which there will be no national license system yet, but legal holding yes.
And there are helled mechanical issues that must be resolved during this period, for example, how to balance the directive of the State concerning the "suitable approach" to the licensed marijuana with its ban on the rope trade up to 330 meters from schools, parks, children's fields or child centres.
"Nowhere more difficult to establish a licensed rope trade than in urban areas, especially in Seattlu's metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, speaker of the Legal Canop Centre, recently established research groups.
On November 21, the Chief of Oates sent Oates from the city of Aurora to his officers, in which he announced that the city prosecutor will no longer pursue offences for holding a small quantity of marijuana in every 21-year-old citizen and that the police will "with immediate validity" stop accusing people of these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police would prosecute urban laws governing marijuana farmers and continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In the area of Weld in northern Colorado, the district prosecutor Ken Buck presents a stricter view.
After the vote, he declared that his office would continue to pursue marijuana cases, mostly as a way to push the users to look for treatment.
At present, they face the charges of holding 56 grams or less marijuana of 119 people, even though many of them face further charges.
"Our authority is obliged to pursue criminal offences that were criminal offences at the time of the event," said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The reaction was also complicated in places such as the village district of Mesa, where the voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The Grand Junction Police, the largest city of the district, no longer blame adults for holding a small quantity.
The District Prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided not to deny all the ongoing holding cases.
"I don't think I waste my time by continuing promoting law until he changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the Colorad voters have supported, bringing marijuana to the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And the opposite reactions across the state have revealed a deep diversity between local officials in view of this large state green experiment.
For the county prosecutors, it is "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the defendant of the marijuana holding, and the local speaker of the National Organization for the Reform of Laws relating to marijuana.
"They spent so much of their lives pursuing people that they still can't really accept that it is legal," he said.
As the first countries that are putting on a small quantity of marijuana as a alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best way to become national test cases for drug legalization.
Protectors and state authorities are planning new borders for legitimate sale, and at the same time they are anxiously looking for the instructions from the federal government, which is still in the plan to consider sale and growing marijuana as federal crimes.
The marijuana legalists hope that the Ministry of Justice will be subject.
In spite of several arrests of marijuana sellers for medical purposes and patients who use it, who have drawn attention, the federal government left most of the trades with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and other 16 states in operation.
While the drug agents are probably not going to blow the door to catch a small bag with drugs, it is likely that they will resist the permit of regulated marijuana trades permitted by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, former advisor in the field of the Narcotic policy of President Obama.
Several Colorad cities are not waiting for the procedure of the federal authorities.
Before the election day, some local governments approved the moratorium for any new marijuana trades, even if it will take about a year before any trade can be opened.
Last week, the Montrose city in the western state proposed a semi-year ban and it is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation when we issue a license to someone and then we will have a major federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this supplement.
We're looking at what the community voted for, against what he voted for the state.
There's really a lot of questions here.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a conservative."
Only today's university students are attacked in their opinions.
I don't remember that I would never have ever been talking about college at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the university, which I thought was the biggest world's village of knowledge, a modern-occupied Greek symposium motivating two pilliers of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
And at the end of the 80s of the 20th century, in two weeks after I came to Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed my bags, and I arrived in the first scandal of my life.
My father crashed and cried.
My friends were confused.
Day Evening Standard claimed that I gave up because I had objections to the love of students in the next room.
Written by A.N. Wilson pronounced that I left because I was forced to drink from disconnected loops.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran because I was the subject of systematic scattering and scaring.
Not because of my bizarre name or the fact that I came from private school.
I was persecuted for the only reason, and in this enlightenment colleague, it was both bigotine and barbaric: my father, the dead Woodrow Wyatt, was a highly constructed advisor to Margaret Thatcher, and I was an advocate of the Conservative Party.
You can ask why I'm pulling it out right now.
Just because the latest news suggests that the new generation of students right from the center suffers by similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred against conservative students in Oxford is so large that last week, the group of these students has been able to protect equal rights as gays, health disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Younger Years Association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that because of their political views, they are "from actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and are given to them that they are not welcomed".
They require a position in the university Committee for Equal Opportunities that ensures that they can communicate their views freely.
Their situation did not help a recent documentary television show of BBC Two with the name Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (Praise country: youth, intelligent and right) on a student political act, which the conservative emphasized as strangers and non-nazis.
The show was represented by a graduate Joe Cooke, former president of Oxford University Conservative Association (conservative Association of the Oxford University - OUCA), who was riding Rolls-Roycem, was dressed in silver suit and had a stick with a silver head.
In other high schools, conservative students say that because of the introduction of a higher school, it is treated as "familiar lambs".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President Nottingham University Conservative Association (conservative Association of the Nottingham University), told the Sunday newspaper that "left influence in universities is growing.
People think we're like a Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
An 11-year-old history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who stands behind the move for greater protection, says that such climate is "nepleasant", while the nineteenth-year-old President of OUCA Stephanie Cherill said that access to JCR members to people on the right of the center had a deterioration.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of an intellectual discussion, as well as for the good living conditions of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I came in September 1986, 18 - year - old and disgusting way of shame.
Hate against the Conservative Party was the bitterest.
A year earlier, the university voted for the rejection of the honourable title of the former student Margaret Thatcher, for the reason of the screws in the financing of high school.
From the atmosphere, stalinists would be afraid.
During the first few days of the opening week, when the new students intervened between themselves and the teachers, I got to taste the peleon that was supposed to come.
I realized that not only professors of silence approve of the pushing of conservative students, but also take part in it.
The policy of the mining strike, privatization and opposition of the government against the apartheid sanctions in the South Africa has been brought to the trees.
My first lecture was about the translation of the French text from the 18th century to English, and I was not ready for what was next.
"Ms. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt, "Please translate the first paragraph."
I've done it pretty hard.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like a cake cake, was very yellow.
"Thatcher's people refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
Other students were hiking.
I've had tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that in your free time you take some basic lessons of French, so unless you are too busy with social matters," said Professor Pitt.
I went back to my room.
At dinner at school, I was sitting alone when I felt easy knocking on my shoulder.
He was a second year student named James who represented himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said politely.
Unfortunately, it is.
Everyone suspected of conservation is a target.
It's pretty bad for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be worse for you.
Most conservative champions pretend to be labourists.
Later, I tried to pretend to be a coward in the local house.
I insisted that I disagree with everything that Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be unsuccessful.
A student of the first year's philosophy, politics and economy, who (as irony) went to Eton, said, "You're a daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
Other students recorded him.
I was freaked, dirty.
"How do the conservatives love?" one asked.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before Liberal Legislative from the '60s.
Can I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet with similar people just after darkness?
Would I have to change into a labourist and push my natural inclinations?
Three years before me, they developed as a cleaner of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who was sitting at my college.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was Margaret Thatcher's advisor for foreign policy and one of those who wrote talks to her.
He wasn't nearly there.
This place he hated for his province and minority and for his tendency to marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he entered a professor at the University of Bilkent in Turkish Ankara.
"You're not gonna be happy here," he told me.
I began to travel from Oxford to my parents in London, looking for a shelter with my uncontrolled metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies in Oxford, all political views were adopted in the 40s.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dream mood.
Even my communist friends always had perfect ways.
His moisture eyes were screwed up.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
I'd have broken my heart if you left.
My emotional resistance has been worsened by frequent trips to London.
My friend, as well as the Conservative Party's favorite, was under pressure and gave up his conviction.
The next week during the study, when another professor of history fully seriously declared that I was "the enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even when I was red inside of shame, I confessed that my "fathers washed my brain" and I called them "old fools".
The relief was just short-term.
My father's been beaten in my oxford career's canvas.
At that time, he wrote two columns every week to Murdoch's newspaper.
My door was locked.
I screwed inside and after five minutes my persecutors gave it up.
When they left, I packed my baggage and caught the first train to London.
I've never come back.
You can call me a screwed weak.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be in the educational institute subject of such fear and poisonity.
Still more tragic is that it was Oxford, not only from which 14 conservative prime ministers came from, but also hiding by today behind an undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thinking.
"Valentino prefers elegance than glory"
At the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of fashion creation", which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemish and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, ancient residence of Isabella I. English, is the only place in the British capital is a good host of the exhibition of Valentin Garavanio.
The designer confirmed it at the beginning of the celebrated retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which represents more than 130 high-mode models created by his atelier in the past 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unchanging Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of the story in which "or signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who would not be written without his honored clients.
Valentino always felt charmed by a rare and remote world of aristocracy.
The first exhibition room, which lasts until 3 March, transmits private correspondence and photos with signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salimy Aga Chan over the Greek princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino presents these personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from a simple craiser from the city of Vogher in northern Italy to an idol of international "bohemic garbage".
The love of the royal family is nothing wrong.
"They're at least screwing your cigarette into a great carpet, like some beautiful pop-music celebrity," says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemish.
In the 1960s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests have a lot of fun with elegance.
"All of us were very pleased when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife "Heini" Thyssen and a close friend of the forgotten beauty like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always preferred elegance than glory.
And yet it's a star."
Valeria Mazz shows Valentina
The charisma designer doesn't even forget the Argentine model Valeria Mazz.
"It's been a lot of years since we went to him for dinner after one show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There was 20 of us and Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger between us.
In every smallness of his apartment, decoration, food, music, he grew in everything and felt his spirit.
All the invitations made it possible to feel important and loved," recalls the top model that started working with him during the Paris week of the top fashion in 1995.
"He never comes out of fashion because his proposals are artwork," he ends.
Birthday show
Gravani's life is not a story of obsession, but really renewed love.
He loves people with good behavior and better titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries was transferred to a special seventy-foot passage that offers a exchange of role: the visitor changes into a model and walks to observe the "orientation" of dreams that Valentine's master works as dresses, which Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotel Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti had on her in "Noc" or a coat from the wave and the skin that belonged to the Emperor Farah Dibaov.
In the audience of models, names like Sibilla Lucemburska, Gloria from Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norway, Rosario Bulgarian or Sophie Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and Designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is the first love, "you can't forget it."
"I remember perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, vests "gillette" and a jacket with a collection of autumn-winter from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," said Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I give him the advantage of his female and his great love for women because he undermines our beauty," the former Duchess of Feria adds.
"I like the colors he's using, they make it clear and give "iscre" to the face.
The proportion is perfect."
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampalla d'Arenberg can't forget how you first dressed Valentina.
When she grew up and lived in Italy, she wanted to be full of age and had an opportunity to dress one of his evening dresses...
Finally, she came to the end of the 1990s.
"I've bought my first dress from Valentine to celebrate at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a dress of calls, a bunch of animals and a top without arms.
It was a dream that became reality," says the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is easy to fashion, his passion is overtime," explains the Italian aristocrat, whose life takes place between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has the designer's clothing "very carefully... because dresses are not just dresses, it's also a file of memories they have in them."
"King of Fashion"
The golden storm of the exhibition in Somerset House are the wedding dresses of Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding with Paul Greek in 1995.
To create these silk clothing elephant color with all pearls, twelve types of different pearls and a long four-and-half-four-four-four-meter trains needed four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his swadles).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest authority of the specialized press, represents these dresses a boundaries of high-mode mode at the end of the 20th century, "the return of clients from high society".
Valentino, lighted during the years of elitar's "savoir-eter" is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest celebration in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and awarded by the Order of Honest Legion accumulates as much honour as any of his client's husbands.
"My attention was always attracted to his choice, calmness, a fixed and perfect appearance," Princess d'Arenberg admits.
"I've seen him last month on a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my big girlfriend.
It was great, time didn't leave any lead on it."
When the princess says that...
The hardest work in the world: cheese carriers in the area of soupcase Kawah Ijen
For four euros they gambling carriers in the area of the Indian soup with their life and health when they carry 70 pounds of cheese down the rough stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and they are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wjayi, one of 400 miners who earn for life by gaining raw from Kawah Ijen's soup in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It is therefore necessary to flour every day to the bottom of the crotter where cheese gases from within the Earth are avoided and, in contact with the air, move into a solid condition.
After he cuts out large blocks of raw materials that weigh up to 70 pounds together, he puts them on his shoulder in two bambus baskets along the rough stone paths.
To the top of the soup, which is about 2 386 metres, it only takes 250 metres, but it takes 40 minutes to exhausted carpets before they come up, because they keep their balance and consider their steps carefully to avoid slipping and breaking into the ruin.
They know that any confusion could cost them life, as it happened by a French tourist who had crashed from Kawah Ijen rock years ago.
The miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for each pound of raw materials
When they are upstairs, they go around tourists who photograph them like monkeys in the circus, and tiredly carry heavy baskets to the weight that the mine company placed a little below, at an oversea height of 1850 meters.
It's a PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been weighing since 1960 and never paid its employees more than 662 Indian rupees (five cents) for a pound of cheese.
He then sells it for 10,000 rupies (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this nursery has its place in everyday life and is used to produce spinals, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to white sugar.
"Because it usually wears 70 pounds, we will earn about 46,000 rupies (3,8 euros) for every trip," Anto explains to us, which usually graduates three ways a day.
One way takes three hours and at the end is destroyed, but he can make 138,000 rupies (11.5 euros) a day.
Even though it appears to be a negligible amount for so non-human efforts, it's a triple of what he would make in the field.
"The day's remuneration of miners is very high here. For example, 15,000 rupies (1,2 euros) per day and the payment for 14 days is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the messenger who used to work on the Bali Tourist island as a messenger.
There was his pay of 75,000 rupies (6,2 euros) for the day and work, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwanga, the village near the soup, for a serious reason that in Indonesia is as convincing as a cheese: "I married a young girl from Bali, who is hinduist, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has astma, he breathes badly, he coughs and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At age 27, Anto tri times daily risks life in the soup of Kawah Ijen, whose cheese has already started to choose its tax, although his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
My asthma, he breathes badly, he coughs, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases that escape from the soup.
That's the price he has to pay for to achieve his dream.
"I will work for another two years, because I want to open a business or study Spanish or French," he promises more than a persistent English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man in fate may be a tourist guide, waiter or reception in the hotel, and instead does the work of the carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden chat with other carriers and every day he gets up at 2:00 a.m., because the cheese doesn't stop crawling at night, and its characteristic yellow color changes into blue and September darkness.
In spite of the surrounding darkness, Anto flys into a crotter and lights his way with a little light that he has attached to his helmet and himself bought it for his money.
Approximately 400 carriers carry on the shoulder of the cart with raw from the bottom of the crotter
Although the company has high revenues, it did not distort or provide no supplies for the saving of the costs, with such efforts.
In fact, they don't even get a share of 30,000 rupies (2.5 euros) from a photo supplement, which together with a ticket of 15,000 rupies (1.2 euros) select the guards of the natural park from tourists who come to photograph the soap and its human mules.
"This work is for cattle, not for people," suggests Madrusin, a permanent 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left schools.
He can rise up to 110 pounds and assures us that he can endure to work, "as long as possible," because he needs the money to educate his three sons between 18 and 10 years of age.
I'm not retiring, I'm going to die here because the vulture was my whole life.
Although the cheese burns his throat and squeezes in the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and catches the miners in the dense sprays that come out of the soap, the miners say that none of them complains that they suffer from serious diseases... it is obvious of their frequent respiratory difficulties, arthrosis, knee pain and wounds on the shoulder caused by the weight of the basket.
Unainik, who considers his basket on his back, can only load 50 pounds in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his colleagues embarrass 15 tonnes of cheese in the soup, which then three trucks ride a strict road between the guests to the storage in Tamansari, 18 miles away.
"I'm not retiring, I'm going to die here because the vulture was my whole life," Unainik declares, opening a wide mouth, which lacks a few teeth.
Of his five sons the oldest, thirty-year-old, he also earns with raw materials.
Time passs, but the stopping poor of one of the hardest artists in the world remains from a generation to a generation - a craft that performs human mules in Kawah Ilen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
Singapurs are denied that they have no children, no career, stress and cost of living and education.
"The Citizenship of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm married and I'm a patriarch, you're my wife and you're a patriot.
It may seem unbelievable that this slogan is part of the advertisement on mentol candy, but yet -- or perhaps that is why -- with a video in the beginning of this year in Singapore, the mass spread on YouTube.
These sentences are part of the rape that uses local stamps of type "we'll put a buchtu in the tube" as a laugh of the fertility rate in Singapore.
The BBH advertising agency, which created a video, hopes that this advertisement will be able to mention the problem in a funny way.
The artist director of the agency Douglas Hamilton said he wanted to use the influence of music to fulfil his "civilian obligation".
"One is exclusively about the Internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
It's the greatest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the reproduction of our population in the world, so we had a feeling that this is the theme we have to touch.
We knew that the government was trying a lot of things like spreading perfumes with feromony or organizing listing partys.
Many of these ideas could have been creative, but not completely functional.
So we figured out why not do the most creative possible thing, such as the composition of the rape, so that we can solve this problem."
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it too much to light is the Singapore government.
He will make $1,300 annually to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternal vacation and grants financial doses.
All these measures, however, had a small effect.
Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technologies in the south-east Asia, also known as its representatives and strict social controls.
The rate of birth in Singapore with regard to the population classification is at the moment 1.2 child per woman.
The last time, the fertility rate of 2, which was considered a peace of renewal, in 1976.
Why do Singapurs have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the committee of marriage and family of the National Office for Population, says it is because of "better education" and "wide scale of career opportunities".
"So people have a wider scale of options in terms of life objectives and priorities, it is not just wedding and family," he explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to increasing the number of free people and to the postponement of marriage and birth of children.
While in immigration policy, there were attempts to drastically increase the immigration flow as a measure against the decline in the population, it caused disagreement among local inhabitants.
On some Singapore websites, there is an unholded xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese who are criticised for maintaining low wages and a small effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the Government of Singapore last year recorded its worst election result since the beginning of independence.
After the elections, an attempt to solve the problem has occurred through quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in birth rates have a famous impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, health expenditure and immigration policy, certain unexpected consequences have also occurred in Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so small homes.
For example, she began to influence property trade.
The City Development Office began to regulate the number of small apartments known as "shoes boxes", which can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have a area of 46 square meters and have a great success in sales.
However, the fear that these apartments can support youth lifestyle and reflect developers to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the Developing Company EL Developers, claims that their "shoes boxes" are selling far faster than larger houses.
"They're more popular, and they're selling for days to weeks faster than houses with a larger range.
That's why they're much better for our cash flow."
However, he admits that new standards lay clearer rules to developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too embarrassed
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could go towards an increase in the fertility of the nation, interviews with Singapurs working in the financial quarter in the centre of the city suggest that they will not have a great effect.
"People are still in stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, so many people are delaying it," the young official says.
"Let the rest have children.
But it's important for me to rely on my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old, young man.
Men and women mention career, stress and cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So whatever the government is trying to force citizens to have children, they are at the end of the Singapurs who have the last word about the establishment of the family.
What's private offline is private and online
Private.
According to the dictionary issued by the King's Spanish Academy, it is something that has personal nature or "the area of private life that every one has the right to protect against any violations".
What's privacy for a 16-year-old man?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the danger he is exposed to when he publishes matters on the Internet that he would certainly tell anyone when he was in common communication?
The elPeriodico journalists confessed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years of age who are common Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy as "nething completely own" in the personal level and "user name and password" if it was social networks.
"My greatest secret I would not have published," says a decade-year-old Jorge in trying to explain the importance of privacy in places such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"They are a very secret secret, my mother may know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"I'm putting nice photos or photos on the FB, we're playing.
I'm talking to my friends there too.
I wouldn't have shared a picture that would not be mine, or a picture that would ridicule someone," she says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish naked photographs, photographs of naked persons or photos of crimes, or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he's got on the FBI and his nine fans on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
There's a mother who has a name and a password of one of the accounts.
"I found a account on Twitter so that I can express my views and write interesting contributions.
I don't know if anyone answers me, I just put them there," he adds.
"Social networks are funny, I can talk to relatives who are far or fast to communicate with friends," he says.
Without hesitation he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended someone stranger to him.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager owns accounts on the Hotmail networks, Facebook, My Space and Ask and in the last mentioned network admits that he doesn't know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them ever put him on anything, neither wanted his address or phone number after him.
"If they insist on me or require it from me, I will simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José signed up to Ask after he read the Twitter recommendations.
This boy is not a foreign experience with what is called cyberbullying today.
"A famous friend on the social network was blackmailed.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who it was," he confirmed.
The victim didn't sign up on the account according to José.
"Just activated a private regime."
Then explains the series of steps how to set the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would have published photos known in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would have done it if someone was disturbing me or just wishing.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and a graduate in the field of education and teaching, thinks that children and teenagers in social networks should be correctly oriented, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform them.
He states: "The Internet has emerged as a means of searching for information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game have changed."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic worker Marc Prensky, a pedagogic graduate at Yale University and a writer of the article Digital Natives and digital immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born during this technology.
We are digital immigrants who need to teach them, and we only teach ourselves," he says.
It explains that it's a complex theme, "because we ask them to know what's appropriate to spread, publicize and say, and what not, at the age they're not mature."
Also, to be - as far as the area concerns - reasonable, when what they want most is to be favorite, to have thousands of friends and not to think of consequences," he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what is privacy, asking questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do anything, it doesn't work," he adds.
Marrielos Porasová further states some of the options: There are things you don't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or: Would you like if someone published your picture as you published a friend?
Do you know what the others say about you?
When you mark people on the photos of celebrations, did you ask these people for permission?
And one more: do everyone always need to know what you're doing?
The next point is to realize that they must behave in the Internet as outside.
They're the same rules.
"It should be the same on social networks," he says.
Oversight
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, teacher at the first level and education counselor explains that it is necessary that children are carefully read the rules of social networks.
"If he understands every injustice, they have a good basis to talk to children about the consequences he can have on the Internet.
For example, as regards age or what is allowed to share or publicize," he says.
Guardia's opinion is that it is crucial to remind children of a traditional rule "do not talk to strangers."
The South America Summit ends and the Lima Declaration has not been published
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today, without being issued the Declaration from Lima, which was revised and which was reportedly signed by seven present presidents.
The Agency of the Efe has repeatedly tried to obtain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Governments of Unasur, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidential Office, who at the beginning decided that the document will be published after the summit, indicated that it would be published later on the websites of the Peruan Government.
They further stated that the content was published by Peruanian President Ollanta Humala in several short press statements.
The press had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the press room, a video was transmitted from the presidential meeting without a sound message with a "confidential meeting, no sound transfer".
A small amount of information available to the journalists was provided by press speakers of some governments who were present, but not with peruanian speakers.
The only document published during the negotiation was the list of the presidents, which caused the urge of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media that asked for more information.
Later, the Peruanian presidential office sent the media e-mail with the "conclusive statement" from the summit, but it is only the expression of President Humala, not the official document he concluded.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of the South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Paises Arabes, ASPA), and neither at this occasion the originally promised Declaration from Lima was published, although the press was zealously required.
On the official pages of ASPA, the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruanian authorities sought to ensure the broadcast for all journalists, but completely avoided the information.
The summit ended, inter alia, the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept the judgment of the Hague Court, which deals with the dispute on the border between the two countries.
President Peru Ollant Humala and Chairman of Chile Sebastian Piñera met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in Hague, which will begin in Monday by hearing the defence speech of both parties to discuss a dispute that Lima initiated against Santiago.
"We will be understood and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing in this international court today," said President Humala and his chile protee.
"Chile was, it is and will be a country respecting international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts," he supplemented Piñer and welcomed President Humala by hand-sharing with the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both Presidents that the decision of the International Court of Justice was made public after Columbia adopted the Bogotic Covenant this week, expressing her subjection to the international court's judgments, which decided on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered this decision completely mistaken.
The summit was held without the participation of Presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuely (Hugo Chavez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Christina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur organisation in 2011 after the appeal of President Fernand Lug, and the meeting was not attended.
The host president Ollanta Humala was authorised to start early talks and end the summit in Lima shortly afternoon.
The President read the final document in which he informed that 16 agreements were adopted and were planned on 31 projects between South America, with $117 billion investments.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Member States of the UNASUR will make "value steps towards a target in the form of South America's citizenship, for which the residence agreements are extended".
He informed that action was supported to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organized crime, to improve the availability of medicines and cheap internet in all corners of South America and to joint and effective measures against natural disaster risks".
When Europe is in the crisis, "he must not have economic consolidation (Latin America) a victory, but should serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to prefer a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport link of different locations of South America, especially rural and foreign areas... to make our countries more connected and created new economic bonds," the Peruan president said in the read speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects relate to Peru and its axis from the coast to Brazil, and the other two relate to a better connection with Ecuador, but did not provide more details.
The final document also touched the political situation in Paraguaya.
"We hope that the election process in this country will serve for its return to the Union of South America", which is currently excluded.
Another issue that the summit raised was that Latin America remains a prosperous and peaceful area that is integral and has good neighbourhood relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped that he would meet his Nikaraguan Daniel Orteg, on Saturday, with respect to the judgment of the International Court of Justice on the maritime border which was questioned by Godote.
"It is possible that I meet President Daniel Ortego tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will discuss all solutions, none are excluded, nor a deal with Nikaragua that requires negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope I will be able to tell President Orteg to lead the negotiations as civilized as possible as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they are to participate in the inauguration of the President of Enrique Peñi Neta.
In the framework of the summit, the EU Defence Ministers first met to endorse the Action Plan for 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in the field defence.
Members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay, although the last mentioned country is currently excluded.
Peru is a temporary chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn how to integrate Europe
The Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which the "South America, in this case, must really teach from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, declared in the state TV Peru that the Europeans "have been killed for World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now practically one country".
In this regard, the South American Citizenship project was protected by the Member States of the Unasur organisation.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country that is already in the Andean Community must be aimed at, however, there are still reverse areas that want to return us to the past," he noted.
The Ecuadorian President, inter alia, expressed that he agrees to redeploy the Organization of American States (OAS), provided that the influence of the English states will be reduced and will be taken into consideration by those who signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
"They who are in the heads are never obliged to anything, and we are the South Americans, on the contrary, signing everything.
It is unusual that the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights is financed in Washington by the United States," the Political Asylum invoked by the Ecuador founder WikiLeaks Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he had not betrayed his principles and respected his "democratic values and human rights".
He supplemented that at that time, "there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be issued to the third country, regardless of the current process."
Furthermore, he criticised the Swedish justice that asked him to interrogate in the Swedish territory for the alleged sexual delicate, while "the own Swedish legislation allows the interrogation by a video conference call that could be made from the Ecuador Embassy in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange will have a deterioration of physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since we were on our embassy, but the Ambassador informed me that he had minor lung problems but nothing serious," the Ecuador head of the State said.
"But it threatens his physical and mental condition to be worse, because he's closed in a small space without the possibility of moving in fresh air.
That would mark everyone's health," he complemented.
The President Correa noted that the solution to asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuador Embassy in London on the basis of the permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that the talks with London were made to resolve the prisoner WikiLeaks.
"We do not negotiate on human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but interviews have been continuously.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón is running a series of management in various European instances," he said.
He said, "If Great Britain's exemption tomorrow, it's all over."
And if Sweden hears Mr. Assange at the Ecuador Embassy in London or through Skype, as it allows therein laws and as it has already been done in other cases, the problem will be done tomorrow."
Correa used this situation to represent himself as a defender of freedom of press, and explained that he definitely does not tolerate "the sub-dimensionality, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
The greatest enemy of free press is not us, creepy and disgusting politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profits, pressures and extortion," he said.
From this perspective, he expressed joy to the fact that neither such journalists, nor bankers nor hegemon countries nor nor burgoazia control the Ecuador, and said that if he is re-elected, "he will continue to change the right way and the right direction."
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain the veto expressed Paraguaya on membership in the Unasur Union at least in its next elections and argumented that the total "needs to be firm and tolerate oportunism and pucism covered in legality" because he actually "destructed the legitimacy of paraguay democracy".
The Ecuador President also stated that he considers the "perfect" wish of his columbian entrepreneur Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nikaragua on marine borders between the two countries now, at the time of the International Court of Justice in Hague, which decided in favour of Nikaragua.
The judgment is currently not accepted.
"It's a problem between South America and the Mediterranean country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by willingness to walk together.
They must be judged wide to be overcome and be able to go forward."
He also expressed his hope in comparison with the maritime boundaries dealing with in the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is appropriate for Latin America to seek an international instance, if both countries are obliged to accept a judgment, whatever hard it is".
With regard to the possibility that he will run in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to be held in order for the third mandate, he noted that he considers this option "with great optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa declared that if he loses in February 2013, he will leave public life.
"I was never personally interested in much but in a unfair situation such as social economic poverty in Ecuador, only political powers can be corrected.
My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this probably victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I won, it would be my last presidential period and then I would leave politics.
If we lose, I'm waiting for the same thing.
I have already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new health treatment of Venezuela President Huga Chaveza in Cuba.
"I have just spoken to Venezuel Vice-President Nicolas Madur, who says that President Chavez went to a planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
It's not a recycling in the president's health status," he explained.
The head of the Ecuador State today participated in the sixth summit of the Heads of the State and Governments of the Union of South America (Unasur), which was completed by the challenges for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
The victims of AIDS are the result of late diagnosis today
Fabrizi was 21 when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was like a lightning hit me," he says at the memories of the truth moment that the doctor tried to "slow down a little," but obviously without success.
The boy kept it secret from his family.
He decided to take his illness himself on his bedrooms, and he started informing himself about it, with such a embarrassment that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the most recent HIV units in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), in which he arrived in 1994 after several disease fights.
Fabrizio lives with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since 22 years, which was something unpresensitive in the beginning of the 1990s, where there were many doubts, few possibilities of treatment and greater stigma.
At that time, the director of the Mexican Institute for Social Security (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him, "because he had a cutting shot."
Then having AIDS was a synonym of death.
Now you can survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are many people who don't know and lose their disease until the virus caused the destruction of the organism and strengthened the immune system, and then become victims of random infections.
31 years since AIDS disease has occurred in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "referred to a great success that the length of life of a patient who begins with treatment in a timely and proper manner is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, with the confirmation of this information in April this year in prestigious scientific publication.
Infector and specialist for HIV/AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death judgment, but that the length of survival and full life depends on the degree of the immune system of patients who are diagnosed with the disease, and that people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 to 50 years.
Simplely speaking, this means that the person who is diagnosed with HIV at 25 years of age can, according to these knowledge, "will live without problems until 75 years old," the doctor explained in the interview.
To emphasize this progress, it is appropriate to recall that the mexican average length of life is 76 years now.
Although the mortality has been significantly reduced in recent years and in Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS decreased, from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (the United Nations Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS-UNAIDS), is also true that 60 per cent of patients have died from the discovery of AIDS according to national statistics.
Only in Jalisco died in 2011 255 people and until this May 187. However, since 2005, universal access to antiretrovirotics is provided.
Why are people still dying for the consequences of disease?
- "I don't think the problem is in the way you can get to therapy.
That's how I see it. This is how it happens in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have not exhausted medicinal products; the problem is that patients are coming in a very advanced stage because they do not know the condition of disease, or later stage of disease."
He adds a convincing figure: "The nine of ten patients are coming when any associated infection is already shown. The only thing we need to do is to influence the total mortality is to diagnose the disease earlier, and therefore we need to offer highly tests to identify the disease to all those who ask for them."
In his proposal, specialists and officials from the State Council for AIDS prevention in Jalisco and directly with patients such as Fabrizio, who came to make tests in the private lab only because he did it because his friend and despite his low age, he had already suffered AIDS disease and also suffered Kaposi's sarkom, a tumor sickness, which is one of the common complications.
"All will change when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather take three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for better, healthy eating, practicing, taking medication."
Still today his parents know only that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sexual life, but responsiblely, I look after myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who accepted the challenge to share his experience with MILENIO JALISCO, to motivate those who fear.
"Let them do their tests, if they're risking, whatever they know as soon as possible, if HIV's positive, it's better, and if they've been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else when they're responsible."
This message summarizes the password of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the pulp
Among health and ordinary citizens is a huge problem, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalayar journalist who finds information about HIV virus.
And the biggest spaces are in prevention.
In places that are devoted to this task, "really increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, we are given a hundred condoms today, which is very good, but there are still people who have no access to condoms," he said.
Adolescents are among the most inclined to new diseases.
"What do you want?" is the common question of irony and assessment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacists and health personnel that teenagers want to avoid, says the reporter.
He proposed this ineffective division to change, so that the condoms are not just behind the pulses, but that hundreds are in public toilets, places where young people often go.
"It's not the support of promiscuity.
It's not even about "paying beer and motel", as Governor Emilio Gonzalez responded to the question whether he would agree to divide condoms in his district.
It's not such sexuality. It's best to access condoms to those who have already led sex life," he noted.
Key numbers in Jalisco
13 435 cases were recorded (12 158 cases of AIDS and 1 317 HIV cases).
This state means a fourth place in Mexico in new and detected cases of AIDS and 13th place in connection with HIV.
92% of the infection is conducted by sexual path, 6% in the blood path of 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV because there are four to five people who do not know about the disease.
The judgment approved by the United States Court of Appeal, which does not recognise the restructuring of the debt of the Group Vitro established by competition in Mexico, calls for a mild precedent for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
Therefore, the restructuring procedures that allow mexican laws do not seem to apply in the country of strips and stars despite international agreements.
The approval of the judgment issued last June 15th by Judge Harlin Halem at the North Texas Auditorship Court leaves the Mexican company in practice without defence against the possibility of confiscating their property on the second coast of the el Bravo river.
However, the judgment opens the main Mexican manufacturer the door to the United States Supreme Court with appeals against three incompatibilities.
The introduction should be said that while the judge of this cause claims that the creditors are to follow the United States insolvency law, the Court of Justice of the Fifth District with the New Orleans states that the main procedure is to establish a procurement procedure in Mexico.
First, this would indicate the ignorance of international process cooperation in cases of insolvency of supernational enterprises.
In fact, for this purpose, a model law of the United Nations has been established for the unification of international trade law, which determines the American Law Institute by the arbitration of the American Institute.
Secondly, the judgment determines that without votes in the branches of the internal business structure, when the debt of Vitro is recognised against the branches, the majority of the restructuring approval would not be achieved.
However, this option is accepted by the Mexican laws.
The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first time in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples such as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose internal debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Agremex.
Furthermore, it is true that even after the recruitment of branch votes, the believers - who were against Vitro in the United States, i.e. the funds of "sups" such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited - did not reach most.
In the vote, they would have reached about 45 percent to 37.
This indictment is not questioned by the Court.
From another point of view, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation she has faced since 2008 - on the background of a serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
Meanwhile, the family company of Gonzaleze Sady will appeal to a new assessment directly at the Court of Appeal in order to carry out the assessment in full participation, that is, for the participation of five judges, because they originally voted only three.
If he fails here, he will require as a corrective means to revise the process of higher instances, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
In the case, it is important that the Court referred to the document sent by the Mexican Government as an office of amicus curiae, which detailed the procedure of Vitro under the Competitive Law, and in which it indicates that the company has relied on its commitment to agreements signed by the two countries to confront the law with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Act.
Furthermore, it points out that the country was subject to the principles of the Commission of the United Nations for International Trade, which is the rules for international insolvency cases which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Strike on both parties: penalty for Vitro and State.
Total evaluation
Without prejudice, the criminal notification of the mexican aircraft committees against the former owner of Gaston Azcarrag Andrade, who was charged with a deception, has already been exploited by a committee of pilots.
The instance led by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morineau just filed a complaint on the National Banking Commission and the Commission for Price Papers accused of obstructions in reaching justice.
According to it, the Authority systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor of the Republic on the transaction carried out by this entrepreneur, where IXE from the Fideicomis F/589 has chosen on behalf of the Mexican Airport 198 million pesos.
Professional hotel management (Administrator Professional de Hoteles) were most likely directed to buy stocks.
As we know, Azzarraga Andrade is the major shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Obsading Dragon Martu
In the universidad de Caribbe area, a group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, businesses and ordinary citizens who approved the creation of the association to prevent the opening of Chinese Dragon Martu in Cankún.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge business and distribution centre with products from "ground with large walls" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a living zone for 150 employees in the bottom.
The Organization of Canacintra (Camara National de la Industria de Transformationion) has previously managed to unify the governors of the southeastern zone to stand against the monumental area that would partly devastate the protected areas and represent the origin of all resistance against the industry.
End of the ACTA document
The request of the Senate that the Government has not taken into question and which requires an explanation under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador of the Trade Anti-False Agreement, known under the English shortcut of ACTA, was deprived from the Mexican Institute of Industries (Institution Mexico de la Propiedad Industrial).
As we know, although the Senate itself has excluded the possibility to view it as a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in long-term horizon
In an effort to pay long-term debts and not to influence these short-terms, the Homex developer's company markets investment certificates for 500 million pesos.
This series is the first of the four identical ones that offer interest payments every 28 days.
Born Competival
The connection of the front companies in information technology such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet has brought up a communion with a commercial name Competival, aimed at the market of software services in Central and South America.
Investment in business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The basketball world driver Hector "Hetin" Reyes was connected with this hall for more than 60 years and processed the whole world through it.
Not a lot of people in Portorik have such many memories about the history of the local basketball, like Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was before he was caught by a brain injury on a wheel chair, burned into this sport for over 60 years, whether as a player of younger categories, a national basketball league of BSN, owner and trainer of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the national basketball league, or the President of the Portory Basketball Federation.
"I took a lot of roles during my life in basketball, including several at the same time as when I was president of the National League of BSN in the 1990s, a general director of the National Team and the President of the Federation," Reyes recalled when he visited the newspaper journalists Primera Hora at his home in Bayamon, where he lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't overcome his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated by photos and reminders from his long career, testify.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest motion from all guards, those who remind him of his activities in Los Vaqueros since half the 50s, where he was a player until 1982, where he also celebrated 15 years as a companion or owner of the team.
"It was my best years, that I enjoyed most because I had an opportunity to participate with the team of Los Vaqueros since 1967 to attend eight championships, whether as owner, companion, or coach.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championate -- in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted in BSN.
Then the team took over the "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," said Reyes.
"I remember that Gene Bartow, who used to be a coach at the Alabam University in Birmingham, said to me, "I have a grown two-foot player for you.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended me to play Raymond Gaussey, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy brings Bayamon a victory at the championship, then Gausse will contribute to another."
The championship for the team of Los Vaqueros played Gausse, he enjoyed, but only on a distance, because in 1988 he had already served as Chairman of the Basketball Federation.
At that time, he wanted to be fully committed to his functions and enjoy Mincy's position at the national team.
"I remember the first time we defeated the United States in the qualification Olympic Fight in Mexico in 1989.
Then the world's championship came in 1990, where we ended the quarter, but we should have bronze not to be the Canadian Judge who let us repeat the final bulleting," Reyes said.
Is the man from the world's championship in 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
It's among the best, just like the one who defeated the Dream Team at the Olympiada in 2004.
But my favorite was the national team in the Panameric Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and exploded the United States Manship, which was quite similar to the bronze in the world's championship.
This man had not only Mincy, Gaussey, Ramona Rivase, Fica Lopeze and "Pyculina" (Ortiz), but there were also young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers of Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quiote" Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 for the injury of the knee.
A man who may not have had a perfect composition but was able to win a gold medal and bring great joy to us was a man from the Olympic Qualification in 1995 in Argentine Neuquen.
With players on the account, such as "Canito" Neves, Pablo Alice and the junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced players exclusive because of the fight in the Panameric games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all the predictions.
What was the best Puerto Rico player?
It was no doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved such results as Piculin at this level.
Not to mention his actions in different leagues where he played.
Who was the best Portoric coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation that belonged to Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What is your success in the Federation?
That I was part of the most famous era of national men in 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s, the national League of BSN had up to 17 men in one season.
What didn't you get to prove?
There were things I wanted to do, like the distribution of youth categories according to regions.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in national play-off.
Now the kids travel a lot and play too much games, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefits in the mandatory certificates and coaches for coaches, assistants of judges and judges.
That's nice to meet you.
What are you dedicating now?
I listen to music mostly, watching YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoying my grandchildren, and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And of course I enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, who was always on my side.
The actress Larry Hagman died
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth in Texas, celebrated the world's main role of John Ross Ewing, more known as "J.R." in the Dallas TV series, in which he fled a man who acted unreasonably and was incredible and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role of the D.R. Ewinga drained oil Magnat at Dallas TV show became a symbol of hunger in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. in the new Dallas series this year, died according to the official family notification provided by the Agencies of Associated Press by Dallas Warner Bros. on Friday afternoon for cancer complications.
"Larry returned to his loved hometown Dallas, where he played the iconic role he preferred," his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas on Thanksgiving Day.
"Linda Gray, who was a representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman at the moment he died in the Dallas hospital," her agent Jeffrey Lane announced.
He made joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, nice, kind and talented, and I'll miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life full," Linda Gray said in the notice.
Hagman’s diagnosed liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he himself admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, he was found in liver tumor, and Hagman used the transplantation.
Years before the Dallas series, Hagman celebrated on TV as a decent guy in a disadvantaged comedy I Dream of Jeannie emitted by NBC station from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the figure of Captain Tony Nelson, astronaut whose life will change when he meets a attractive girl (gina), played by Barbara Eden, and took her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedies, which were only emitted shortly, the Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His impact in films included the roles that were well accepted by critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was until Hangman's mastership in the form of an incredibly disgusting J.R., which led him to the star top.
The dramatic series of CBS station on the clan of Ewings and other individuals around them was transmitted from April 1978 to May 1991.
The propaganda slogan "Who shot Jayar?", which was supposed to cause expectations about the work of full emotions, when Hangman's character was almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of speculations of the viewers around the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in stake offices.
This also helped to achieve the record in monitoring.
The November 1980 part, in which the answer was discovered, watched about 41 million television viewers. Dallas became the second most fun series of history after the end of the MASH series in 1983, which watched 50 million viewers.
In J.R., his swagger Christin (which Mary Crosby played).
Christine and J.R. were pregnant and then he threatened her to be a prostitute if she didn't leave the city. But there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an unsaturated chamtizer with charismatic smile: a true entrepreneur and a faithful husband who tried to make his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was a alcoholic woman, locked up in the hospital.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the grave stone," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be, "There's a honest citizen of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing he didn't do.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on the platoon and outside of him".
He is unforgettable and unreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who were lucky to meet him and love him.
Ten parts of the Dallas new series sent the TNT station a few months ago with great success.
"The film of five parts of the second row has already been completed, and the sixth has just turned," the television station informed.
Right after Hangman's death, there were no statements from Warner or from the TNT station on how the series would continue.
The family from Fort Worth in Texas was the son of the actress and the singing Mary Martin, who brightened in classical works such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when in 1931 she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, Ben Hagman's lawyer.
In the early 50 ’ s, Larry experienced happiness in the theater scenes in New York, and then served in England at aircraft in 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and had a long time living in Malibu, California, where there were many celebrities.
In 2001, he published a autobiographic book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't give there anything that I knew could hurt someone or harm him," the agency of Prensa Asociada said then.
After liver transplantation, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital where he helped competitive patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense of "Do not worry, it'll be a little bit uncomfortable, but you'll be healthy."
He was also activeist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starts a course that explores "the end of the world"
Each week students are studying apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When Stuart Charmé's professor of religion decided that this semester would make a course on the end of the world, he knew that it was an inconsistent attraction: the end of the "long number" of the Mayan calendar, which was to come on December 21st, many people were caught as evidence that the end of the world was coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what he was waiting for in a few months: The catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the budgetary failing, which some call “Long Armageddon”, and the growing conflict in which Israel is entailed, a place in which theoretical Christians say the end of the world begins the Apocalypsa.
"I didn't realize that this would be a non-japocalyptical semester that he was ever," said Charmé to the College of Rutgers in Camden in New Jersey this week.
When a person considers what's happening today in the world, as if we have 30 days left, it's a really good time.
And remember that bad means to the apocalyptic sense of good.
And it's not the only professor who offers courses about the end of the world in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At the Temple University, a professional assistant Barry Vacker is conducting a course "Mediums, culture and the end of the world".
Each week students are studying apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We understand why these thoughts are spreading with time," he says, and how hypothetical scenarios are offered, which runs certain human behavior.
For example, if the nuclear material gets in the hands of terrorists, war can explode.
This month, students are analyzing films with apocalyptic topics and exploring how different they are from examples of real life.
"I tried to inform students about what is possible, probably, convincing and impossible," Vacker said.
In the main campus, the State University in Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solariová, a professional assistant in the history of art and antropology to organize a course with a simple name the End of the World.
"We don't attach "2012", because we always count on the possibility to redeploy the course again in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
In spite of "threatening destruction" students must study, create projects and make final tests.
In Penn State, the final test will take place at the evening of the Apocalypse, which gives students no other option than to work "up to the evening of the predictable end of the world," Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
"He stretched out in two hours," said Restall about his course for students with a high average, who signed up for 35.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we were getting an e-mail question if there was still a place.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I think it's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said at the University of Rutgers in Camden, 23, Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield in New Jersey.
And so the apocalyptic, worldly or religious thinking is just a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old student of psychology and care, said he saw all the apocalyptic movies.
"I have never heard of an hour in which it could be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no confessed student, then professor, said he believed at the end of December 21st.
"Our first project was discussing the Mayan prophecy and in a way we'll throw it out," said Julie Zeglenova, 21-year-old student at the Temple University of West Chester.
"Mays never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar," said Restall.
But he complemented that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which touches a few centuries back, which people react to the change of their environment by prophecies about the end of the world.
The flower of these speculations caused the Internet.
"The otherwhere people don't think about it," he said.
It happens in an absolute majority in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who presents this year in the Philippines, asked if he knows about a course about the end of the world, answered quickly.
"The Philippines are not participating in the end of the world," he wrote and appointed an exception to the highest office.
We have mercy from the Pope.
Restall noted that during the years, many days of the last court were spoken, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "the people will begin to think immediately about the next date" or to philosophy that 21 December is the beginning of the seven-year period at which the world will disappear.
The date takes a light weight of students and professors.
Several of them said they were intending to go to "the end of the world".
"I may call a few friends to laugh together," explained the 20-year-old Samira Ford communication student.
