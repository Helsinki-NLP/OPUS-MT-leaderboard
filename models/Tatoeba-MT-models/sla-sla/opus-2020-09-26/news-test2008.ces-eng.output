Inflation in Europe jumped for food
The accelerated inflation targeted in the euro area is mainly caused by continuous growth in food prices.
The November price growth in 13 euro area was higher than the expected, after 2.6 per cent in October, the annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was reported by the Luxembourg Statistics Authority of the Union.
The official prognose was only 3 percent, the Bloomberg Agency said.
Unlike the US, the British and Canadian Emission Bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not reduce the basic interest rate by reducing raw material prices and decreasing unemployment would result in inflation spirals.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below two percent, however close to them.
According to one of the analysts, the ECB is in an absurd situation: the inflation must "restrain" in order to make no business in this matter later.
In Germany, November inflation represents 3.3 per cent of the 15-year-old record; in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the euro area has struck up because of the rapidly rising food and energy prices.
The term rates of wheat increased by 88 per cent, and the soy course has also reached the highest value since 1973.
It was also necessary to pay significantly more for eating oil and milk products in 2007.
The oil price on world markets this year increased by 52 percent, and the past month there was a barrel of black gold nearly 100 dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will drop from 2.1 per cent to 2.5 in 2008, but in 2009 it will already fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, 12-month inflation remains at approximately 3 per cent in the next 3-4 months, but its average annual rate is 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees government crisis
The Fidesh movement range has increased significantly after a long-term stagnation to the beginning of December, so now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of socialists, the Gallup Institute has never measured 13 per cent.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference -- because of the greater determination of opposition voters -- would be more than two-third (71 per cent) support against the fifth support of the IFRS.
The MDF and SZDSS are two per cent of their support within the entire population under the threshold for access to Parliament.
Among certain party voters, both camps are one percent more.
The view of the public to the economy has also been worsened, even given the previous minimum - has never been the ratio of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be very bad, so high - 41 per cent, while according to the further 46 per cent, the situation is quite bad.
Families evaluate the change in their material situation after spring and summer hopes now more pessimistic.
As regards the next year, the majority of the population counts with further deterioration and only a dozen improvements.
In December, 71 percent of the questioned, which is most of all the Gallup Institute's experience that the Prime Minister is doing his work rather bad than well.
Ference Gyurcsane believes or very trusts 13 percent of the questioned, while Victor Orban shares 38 percent.
The Prime Minister doesn't trust 54 percent at all, the President of the Fidesh Movement 27 percent.
One of the indicators for political development is how much the public believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be resolved without a change of government.
While the government and the Prime Minister have considered last October’s disturbances as demanding 35 per cent, this share is now only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) is seen only in the release of new elections.
For the interest of the referendum, 60 per cent of the questionnaires responded to the question of their possible participation that there would certainly be a referendum and another 20 per cent reported that it would likely come.
For comparison, "parlamental elections organised this Sunday" would have only attended 55 percent and another 15% considers its participation as likely. The success of the referendum would be uncertain on the basis of the current intentions.
The school would have said not 74, 79 fees and 84 per cent of hospital fees.
If we look at the same shares only in the circle of people who promise their participation, then the introduction of school, medical fees and hospital fees would reject 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost five impressed Tesco
The Hypermarkets in the Budaörs Trade Triangle maintained a last year, an average of 16 per cent increase in price levels, with the difference that this year there was no increase in VAT.
Article Napi Gazdasag
The usual Christmas consumption basket of Napi Gazdaság in the Budaörs Trade Triangle this year increased by 16 per cent, but in all the hypermarkets the price increased notably over a thousand forints.
Since the prices in food supermarkets have already exploded in December, there has not been drastic irritation since the previous high base.
However, it is unhappy for consumers that what they could buy at a price of nine thousand forints will not be charged now for ten thousand.
The daily economy consumption basket in explored hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10 573 forents.
(In 2003, the consumption basket was 6,800 forints.)
The Unica price and the living fish remained at last level, however, very irritated by cruel breasts, nuts, and also the mack.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistics Office, although we found a kilogram bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
The competition didn't go with the price of the product under 200 forensics.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of Coca Cola in the neck bottle was under 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints.
Nevertheless, this year it appeared according to the consumption basket of Napi Gazdaság Auchan as the most expensive, while Cora as the cheapest.
According to our calculations, she has raised prices in the consumption cart of Napi Gazdaság in view of the prices of Christmas Cora at 15, while Tesco and Auchan approximately 18 percent.
In comparison with last year's highest and lowest consumption basket, the difference was 12 per cent, while the increase between last year's lowest and highest is 21 per cent.
In the forensics there was an increase in the average of 1480.
The average increase in elevator prices has risen to 1,206 forints with the impact of prices on Christmas.
This trade process has just been distorted, the business houses were obviously unable to decide how much price rates should be determined in individual products, as they could not predict the impact of the price change on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of the circulation of the product wrong, due to the price rate adjusted intensity of circulation, he may lose a significant profit.)
Because of the VAT, the price of the consumption basket of Napi Gazdaság has been increased so extremely that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while price differences were made in the cheapest of 844 forints all over the world.
This year the extreme difference did not occur, the expensive basket was now more than 1,630 forints and the cheapest of 1,284 forints.
In comparison with the two Christmas seasons, prices were exhibited by catastrophic growth, and in less than 20 months the daily consumption in hypermarkets by more than 30 per cent.
(It, inter alia, does not fully confirm the data of the Central Statistics Authority: it was intended for several basic foods to increase prices exceeding 30 per cent within 12 months.
Except for the flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
However, in the last case, the consumption of the Daily Economy does not seem possible, since the price level of the product, which has been rather expensive in the last year, has proved to be based on the basis and in the worst case, price growth is barely above 10 per cent.
The flour suppliers are increasingly stronger than egg suppliers, the drastical increase in prices has also been made in international chains.
Hypermarkets in a golden triangle don't complain, they're still referring to a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in three visited trades are no longer interested in prices.
They're buying all quantums, they're taking permanent foods on payments.
Wednesday morning, all three supermarkets formed long fronts on treasures, since the number of visitors grew rapidly.
However, as we know, the rural turn is lower, several international chains complain to research companies that markets remain for their plans, not only in the case of food but also the lasting consumption goods.
In many places, it is preserved on disinfective means
More than a thousand cases of infection were reported in hospitals this year, mainly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Hygiene conditions of hospitals, bed transfusions, surgery to stop personnel do not help, states the Prime Minister of the National Epidemiological Centre.
In many places, they are also preserved in disinfective means.
Recently, the MRSA infection was diagnosed at the traumatic department of St. John's hospital.
Bacteria resistant to antibiotics were discovered in a man who got into the hospital after a serious car accident.
The patient was isolated.
Similar infection occurred in the same place at the beginning of the year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but shortly afterwards, he had to return with the MRSA infection and because of the bacteria in his body could not have been performed an important operation.
By 10 December, the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance reported 1 094 hospital infections caused by multiresistant disease sources, Carolina Böröczová, Prime Minister of the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multiresistant disease sources were safely registered in hospitals, others are not known.
Almost two thirds (683) the infection was caused by MRSA, or methicilin-oxacilin with resistant gold stafilokock.
Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bears a third of the people in their nose without having caused disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. neck inflammation, mandle inflammation, skin infection, early infection) react well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered overwhelmed or inappropriate, the bacteria will develop well-responsible to the antibiotics of bacteria that is very resistant against antibiotics and which is rapidly spreading in unsuitable hospital conditions.
Especially in the case of transitional or persistent impairment of the immune system in patients with a weak body, low body weight or in patients aged may cause serious hospital infection, such as early infection or blood poisoning - sepssis.
According to the highest doctor of St. Jan, there is nothing special on MRSA infection, similar infection belongs to daily practices in hospitals.
"The infection must not be replaced with the epidemic, the MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the originator of disease is not investigated."
Resistance to antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, the treatment personnel treats them in rubber gloves and mask and we have antibiotics needed to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients accepted to the hospital are first tested whether the MRSA is present in their body, however, cannot always avoid infection.
Sample selection is not in mode
Most of the hospital infections caused by MRSA would be possible to avoid, however, the current conditions and conditions in home hospitals are not for preventing and disseminating multiresistant originators of the diseases favourable, states Carolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs apparently in hospitals and homes for seniors, patients receiving patients should be monitored and MRSA carriers should immediately isolate.
However, the collection of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not in fashion.
It also plays the role that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance this investigation.
Most cases have been discovered that if the patient is suffering from the infection of the MRSA, the primary of the epidemiological center said.
The European Union has strict recommendations for appropriate treatment of antibiotics in human health and there are also domestic directives for treatment of individual infections, diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, or microbiological examination should be carried out in order to avoid resistance against medicinal products, however, either hospitals should be observed in all cases.
Microbiological sample collections are even more rare in the primary, respect for the ambulance treatment of patients, Carolina Böröcz reported.
Conservation on disinfective means
According to scientific evidence, the MRSA is widespread among patients most frequently through healthcare personnel.
Therefore, it plays a very important role in washing hands and use of gloves and masks, but also in hospitals there are serious shortcomings.
MRSA is transmitted by copendicular infection and touch, but in the conditions of domestic hospitals, infected patients are not always able to be isolated.
Rooms are often overcrowded, beds are often very close to each other, although from the epidemiological perspective patients should be at least 1,5 m away.
As Karolina Böröcz noted, we may also meet that in the hospitals in the unlikely material situation, she preserves disinfective means, the physicians are few, and the patients are very few, so the chances of infections are still increasing.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where necessary protective measures are maintained, similar infections are less proofly infected or further spread of the originator of the disease can be stopped.
Government programme v. MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents enormous expenditure for health insurance, so it fights everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has drafted an MRSA prevention program, respect for reducing its appearance.
Apparently, the programme is successful, according to the public data, the MRSA infections in England are declined.
The European Centre for Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC) has a variety of prevention of multi-resistant disease sources (including MRSA), respect for hospital infections caused by these sources of diseases, among their priorities.
The police captain who caused a death accident was not drunk.
The official expert assessment in the case of a police captain of the XXII area that caused a fatal accident is over.
It is possible to exclude that the police captain of the XXII region, who killed a walker on Tuesday and who resigned from his function, would drive under the influence of alcohol or deceptive substances, informed the speaker of the High State Representativeship of the capital of Attila Morvai on Friday after the completion of the expert judgment of this case.
The expert assessment confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which has already stated that the former police captain had no alcohol before he sat behind a volunteer.
On Tuesday in Lajose Kossutha, the director of the Police Directorate of the XXII District struggled on the street of Lajose Kossutha in the 21th circuit by his own car in turning the fifty-fifty-year-old man who entered before him when crossing a car outside the marked transition.
(The last designated fact that the walker passed outside zebra is not a relevance of the traffic rules, the turning car must also prefer.)
After the carriage to the hospital, the walker died.
For these events, the circuit police director resigned and asked for transfer to service, according to the police's communication, because he was so shocked.
In the case, it is conducting an investigation by the Budapest State Investigation Agency.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain has been cooperating with the State Investigators since the beginning.
Other 400 million euros for infrastructure
The Agreement on the three credit frameworks of €400 million for the support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as energy, has been signed on Friday in Budapest by the Minister of Finance, Janos Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects implemented by the Cohesion Fund support, a framework of EUR 300 million, while the parties have already concluded a loan agreement of 100 million, the signed agreement now applies to the use of the remaining 200 million euros.
Also, a loan agreement of EUR 150 million is served for the budgetary financing of projects associated with education.
The EIB approved for Hungary for these purposes totally 300 million euros, for the use of the remaining 150 million euros may occur later, with an extension of the credit contract.
Innovation parties signed the Treaty on 50 million euros, which the budget is primarily used for the research and development project of the Debrecine University.
There was also a talk about the fourth track of the metro.
The parties agreed that, after Hungary agrees with the EU on metro financing details, it will return to whether and how the original contract should be modified.
According to Janos Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has funded a total of 113 projects in Hungary since 1990.
The interest of the loans provided by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a commitment fee shall be binding on EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is the reality paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is impressive - the attention of the entire Europe is being drawn to a slightly limited Balkan country.
What, where and who are buying for ever the cheapest, but quickly with the EU's irritating market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Division of Re/Max.
The eastern eastern European property shopping goal is now no doubt Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea coast.
From the mountains are the most in the course of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosha, on the sea coast, Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Coast, ancient towns of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more people are also looking for property in the area of Cavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, the interest of investors and the central part of the country sooner or later - for example Big Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and increasingly more interested in the area of the cheap town of Russia.
Also, the main city of Sofia is a promise of flattering options, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best way to change in one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, and thus become next to the summer and winter seasons searched for road targets even in the next two years.
The predictable investors are already shopping in a large area, for example in the area of Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are trying to change their life and lifestyle at the same time.
Most customers come from England, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain, and more often from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors, Black Sea, and ski paradise, there are traditionally many Russian customers.
Foreign league buyer split into three groups, says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Accommodating people buy either renewed property worth 50-100 thousand euros or old houses for 5-15 thousand euros that they then renovate.
They require good availability and communication options, important for them is the closestness of the large city, trades and generally local doctor.
The second categories are chat buyers (Bulgaria has been incorporated between the first 10 German recreational goals in December).
The third group forms commercial investors who buy in hope of an increase in the medium or long term.
Reproduction of property in the capital is continuous, because demand is increasingly strong.
While the lowest realities prices in Bulgaria are in the European Union, they have increased by 21 per cent annually in the past five years.
Increasing property prices significantly exceeds salaries growth.
Fodor and Hungarian 6%
According to the information of the Minister for Environment and Water Economy, Gabor Fodor will be completed on Tuesday and, after the medium official start, the international conference on the climate regime will continue with the talks of ministers after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world are referring to the Bali Travel Map, which deals with efforts after the period of reducing emissions specified by the Kyoto Protocol applicable until 2012.
At this point, there is a violent debate between developing and advanced countries.
The United States also announced that they do not now want to deal with accurate numbers, although they are attached to the agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 25-40 per cent in view of the status of 1990.
Another major issue of the conference is whether the growing countries will be accessing other than emission reductions to provide both material and technological assistance to countries that are denied to it.
The Agreement was also born on grants for developing countries.
The subsidy fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by the 16-member Governing Council, probably within the World Environmental Protection Programme (GEF) at the United Nations - we can read in the Piac és Profit magazine.
Hungarian 6%
The Minister for Environment and Water Economy, Gabor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain the leadership of the global climate protection efforts and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is obliged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 20 per cent against the 1990 level, regardless of the success of the adoption of "contracts after 2012", and is ready to commit to up to 30 per cent reductions if other developed areas of the world, respective countries will be willing to accept their responsibilities and obligations.
Gabor Fodor pointed out that the countries which joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had aimed at reducing 5.2 per cent, with those 15 EU Member States committed to 8 per cent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent against the years 1985-87, which will fulfil our country. - It is recalled in the press report of the Ministry of Environment.
It is a lot, because within two years, an international agreement on long-term climate change agreement should be accepted, otherwise its entry into force would have been confidently moved until 2012. In such a case, the commitments to reduce the Kyotic Protocol would not immediately link the new system of emission reductions, which the need in its latest report also indicated by the UN International Scientific Assembly on Climate Changes - IPCC, which is the Nobel Price Holder.
This would delay the reduction of emissions and an immediate increase in the average temperature on the Earth by more than 2 degrees of Celsia, which, according to scientists, should have extremely serious and unreverse consequences.
British Army performs a tape on YouTube
British military units announce on the server to share video recordings from action in Iraq and Afghanistan, by which they are popularized themselves.
First, YouTube loved British Air Force (RAF): Special Operators in Afghanistan have recorded videos from Taliban since March 2006, BBC announced.
The records taken by a miniature camera attached to the helmet are controlled by the command of air forces controlling the fight operations in the area of Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are transferred to the Internet.
Political message is inevitable
This form has already reached 139 recordings of British air force soldiers and their "canal" has already looked at more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered on spring 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and announces records of action in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and international peace units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Accommodation in Afghanistan
Air forces have published videos according to their original intention to acquire and, according to the Ministry of Defence, they are also good to acknowledge the broad public with the real objective of the presence of the army in abroad.
"The promotion published by this form against traditional television advertising is almost worth nothing," the BBC expert told Gordon Mackenzie's defence issues, "but there is also a certain political message, as a special form confirms the power of military action decided by the government."
The Americans have done a game.
The Army is concerned that, alongside carefully modified, censured records, amateur videos are also received on the server, including the death of soldiers: in some hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, because the officers speak most about losses, but there is no bloody form of battle.
On the Internet, there have been many videos from the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, which came up during a sharp post, but the British army has come to them until now.
The Americans perform a little different - using the shooting game named America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can get through a multimedialy loyal simulation directly into the skin of soldiers.
The ministries will have Christmas with thisbola and pagans.
The Ministry of Work, Monica Lamperth, apparently, is not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will arrange for her colleagues a final working meeting, at which she will say good-bye to her cupcakes and coffee in 2007.
In some ministries, a celebration with live music, somewhere will enchant the officials the Christmas atmosphere with thisbol and toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and Swedish table - so they enjoy powerful.
The governments are also preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive ministerial Christmas party this year will organize the Ministry of Defence, but he does not expect his employees to be at it.
On Christmas orphans, children of falling soldiers will receive gifts at the Mission's Christmas hospices of family members of soldiers serving at the moment at foreign missions, but they will also arrange a reception for journalists.
The resort is devoted to the atmosphere of the end of the year 25 million.
The National Development Agency (NFÖ) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (GKM) will expel against other resorts.
The GKM party is held in the centre of Jöv› Gaza, with a total of 4,320 000 forensics and about 3,50 guests are expected from six hundred employees of the Ministry.
The resort will hold Christmas traditions at its celebration, but it will also occur to a variety of performances and will also lose the tombola.
The NF& cost 4,700 000 forints and were held on Wednesday in the State Justice Council (OIT) - concerts and dinner on the program.
The rental of the hall cost a million forints, the rest was made up for more than four hundred invitations.
It appears that one NF& department is invited to another Christmas party: that will be organized by the company providing the progress of the tenders, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from the EU's money.
To this end, they rented a building of Wigszinhaz theatre.
MAG and. s. has not confirmed this information because we have failed to reach the person concerned.
No suit is required
The OIT building was not only NF& but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which was organized by St. Lucia on December 7th.
However, OIT did not want money from him using its halls.
Five hundred people attended the dance.
The party began the health minister, and after dinner, it was possible to dance for a live music escort.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the bal, there were no mandatory evening dresses or suits at all.
The Puritan party is preparing health, work and local self-sufficience resorts.
The Ministry of Health organizes a programme and celebration for employees for 400 000 forensics in its own building.
The Ministry of Work, Monica Lamperth, does not even officially call on the Christmas party, but at the final workshop.
A hundred and eighty guests are counted, who, according to the press department, only get coffee and pags, will be enough for the party only 350 000 forints.
The Minister for Local Self-Agencies Gordon Bajani will simply drink with his colleagues in the aula of the Ministry of Local Self-Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas meeting waiting for 436 workers in its own large hall.
The Christmas party devotes 2.500 forints to guests - the total amount includes reception with Swedish tables and toasts.
Since the minister of Janos Veres, they celebrate PM workers in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be missing, officiality strengthens not only ministerial speech but also the afternoon time of conduct.
Agricultural resort organizes a new-year recess on January 20th, the Ministerial Christmas is not accommodated.
The reception will be carried out in the castle of Vajdahunyadware in the City Gardens and, according to the Ministry's message, 1,000 forints per person are assigned to a hundred guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception to which only relevant foreign diplomats are invited to be accredited in Hungary.
These annual reception begins with a short health of the minister and ends with a small hospitable.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Cultural Party are not even organized, the portal [origo] the relevant press department has been communicated.
The price of Christmas celebration of the environment resort in the press department was not possible to communicate.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to a party organized in the Artcopy Museum.
Declines to the giant strike
The Association of the League Communities, the Respect of the Company of Works Councils (MOSZ) will create its strike committee on Friday to coordinate the Monday unlimited strike.
On Saturday, a protesting public meeting will be held on Monday - on the final vote on the Health Insurance Law - will be suspended.
The action will certainly cause a serious interruption of transport, as railway transport is almost completely stopped and in 13 hours the Staff of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV).
On Friday afternoon, the League Association meets the Total Union of Workshops with the details of the organized Monday strike.
There will also be a strike committee of LIGA - MOSZ, which will coordinate Monday's action.
On Saturday, a protesting public meeting is held, and since Monday, the commissions joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite time unless there is an agreement with the government.
This means that there was no deadline for the end of the strike that begins on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament does not eventually accept the health insurance law, the commissions will immediately withdraw the call for the strike.
However, if the legislation is voted, the Stamp Commission shall meet and decide on another procedure.
According to the Monday meeting of the Parliament, it is also possible that the health insurance law will be voted until late evening, if possible, night hours.
Because of the starting strike on Monday, it is possible to count on serious transport interruptions: the railway will stop the work for an uncertain period, the part of the Budapest mass transport and more than half of the Volan companies will be stopped in the morning.
At the same time, in many places of the country, half the road will be closed.
Many committees and civil organisations, whose list is constantly updated on the websites of the League Associations, have joined the strike.
Some organizations analyzed the strike for an indefinite period, others announced a temporary stop of work.
By the Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Road (MAV) and the Independent Union of Railroad Staffers (WDSW) could not agree on sufficient services, while the early Christmas feasts are traveling through the railway as many more people.
According to the communications from the start of operation, up to 13 hours will be stopped in BKV, from 7 to 9 hours in Budapest Airport, a four-hour stamp will be arranged by the Committees of Workers in the Energy Industries of LIGA, to 2-, respect for the 2-8-hour cease of work, the Committee Union of Pedagogs and the Democratic Administrative Association of Pedagogs.
The Hungarian physicians will strike all over the country, the Democratic Communities of Health Workers and Social Affairs (EDDS) belonging to the Cooperative Forum of Co-operational Unions (SCEF) shall hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the Association of the League is that the government revokes the proposal for the reform of health insurance and submit a new concept to the public.
The second requirement is that a new method of retirement calculation be gradually introduced since the next year.
Thirdly, for the early retirement for the relevant workshops, the possibility of incorporating into the system has been provided before 2010.
The fourth reason for action is that the Independent Union of Railway Staffers (VDSZ) falling under the League Communities does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport relating to railway branches and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased the country's risk
The work of the Hungarian Guard, based on the support of the movement of Jobbik Magyarorshagert in August this year, according to the Division of Risk Analysing Division of the Institute of Political Capital, increased immediately in several respects the political risk of Hungary and the whole area.
The "related risk notice" of the company says: in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, it is the greatest political risk that "I will see no longer the ethnic tension between the Romanian and the non-Roman population of Hungary can occur in a short time even to violent ethnic conflicts".
The main reason is that the Political Strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely going to provoke such an action -- the research institute adds.
It says that all of this can be explained by one of the greatest negligences of Hungarian political leaders: "The public discussion on the Roma issue left the representatives of public life to the radical and extremistic political consolidation that could have constructed political strategy in the Romano-Hungarian conflict."
This enlarges, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the probability of violence conflicts - the Institute judges.
Furthermore, Hungarian Guard's activities under the research institute influenced the great attention of domestic and foreign media "to a significant extent the image of Hungary in abroad, particularly as regards faith in the stability of the country and its democratic success".
The Institute recalls: part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which are increasingly public and veemence since autumn 2006, is that several organisations called "national domains" were created in Hungary since the summer 2007.
"The social feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while they speak openly - and armed - the readiness of their members to carry out defensive tasks (in the case of food disasters, attacks of the government, infringements of order), in addition with instructions on the inability of police, army, or state," he adds.
He further notes: this is all happening in a way that he's trying to pack the various political efforts confronted by society against politics and parties into a civil cluster.
Therefore, emphasizing civility and the form of the community in these consolidations does not only serve to avoid legally scattered judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a factor of increasing the risk of neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, they pointed to Hungarian Guard immediately in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, Ultranationalist political representatives of some neighbouring countries to apologize for their own anti-Hungarian policy by appealing to the creation of Hungarian Guard.
This all can affect the political stability of the area," he adds.
According to the Research Institute, the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a single phenomenon, so political risks for the region have increased as a whole.
As it states, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are similar to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, announced in August 2007 by the Ultra-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The background of the Bulgarian Guard is the mass Roman disturbance that exploded in one of the Sofia's neighborhoods (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used it to establish a guard with the aim of the organization is "national domain".
In the past 17 years, it said that there was a "cyccan terror" in Bulgaria, but the state remained inactive and indifferent, recalling the Political Capital Institute.
It adds that the initiative has caused a violent discussion of the Bulgarian public.
It further states that an increase in the risk of ethnic conflict signals the notification of some Bulgarian Roman organizations that it will create its own garde to the sign of resistance.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard are currently similar to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that Hungarian Romas will react to the threat in a similar way, by setting up their own domain, we can note in the attention of the risks developed by the Political Capital Institute.
Attila Juhas, research director of the Institute of Political Capital: risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
As he said, the risk analysis is issued every year and if something that could affect the change in the risk, they inform the public opinions, as in this case by issueing a warning of the risk.
Holidays aren't free everywhere
In Hungary, the days of free are precisely laid down by law, and it has become a general practice that work days are moving around the holidays, which is less likely for us next year.
In the European Union or in America, holidays are not united.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and days of peace.
The working days of peace are most important to church holidays or to significant historical events.
We also celebrate New Year: the last day of the old and first day of the new year is a work free - for the New Year, so that people can rest after Silvester.
In the course of the year, we have a total of 11 free holidays.
The National Holiday is 15 March the celebrating revolution of 1848 and 23 October, the Memorial Day of Revolution of 1956.
August 20, we celebrate the establishment of a state, May 1st, 1 and 2 November, we remember the dead relatives and friends.
Besides, we have two days of Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays, according to the calendar, rarely fall for the weekend, it has become a practice of moving a working day in case we are working only one day before or after it.
The price for the prolonged weekends is, of course, that the previous Saturdays we stay at workplace and at school.
When the day that precedes or follows the holiday, we work for years, the Minister of Labour has adjusted in a special declaration.
The legal regulation applies to all employees and employees, public employees and public service personnel.
However, it does not concern companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or, in view of their purposes, work on the working days of peace.
This year, there will be a change in the working order only around the holidays at the end of the year: from 24 December, life in the country will thus stop, because, according to experiences, most people have a day between Christmas and Silvestr before "work" or use the spared vacation.
In the next year, a few of our holidays will fall in the middle, respect for the end of the week, so the moves of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar changes around the holiday of work so that workers can stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday, 26 April, will be a working day so that Friday, on 2 May, can be a rest day.
The following move relates to the holiday of 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be worked instead of Friday 24.
But at the end of the year next year, it will be able to be fully held in the sign of holidays, because since 24 December they will have almost every stop of vacation, even though Silvester is in the Wednesday.
Six scary little things you can piss off your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we will never receive, innocent lies that we will not notice: it will all "professional" days in the workplace.
The question is, if you get used to these little troubles, or put your gloves on, and the unjasted situations that others can piss off, you will deliberately avoid.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department," a colleague will tell you.
That you've missed the matching for that?
In a better case, he regrets and trys to fix it, calls to the marketing department and says that the message has forgotten to be passed (this is less common solution).
The most common thing is solved by one apology.
Before a embarrassing excuse, it is good to think about what you can prepare to your colleagues for unpleasant moments, and consciously try to avoid it.
Are you borrowing something that's not yours?
There's nothing more unpleasant than if you're dragged for writing, office needs or for your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember putting your sewing table on the table yesterday, but he's gone by morning?
Or have you discovered your pen on the table of some of your colleagues that you considered lost?
Without your permission, don't take anything from your colleagues, otherwise they'll be right to be mad at you that you're ragging in their things.
Do not take the envelope or sticky papers from your office, because it may be uncomfortable when you end up early, and you will need them immediately.
Talking about a private life of colleagues?
There's no good solution how to stop spreading knocks.
Who, who did he do?
Where and why?
Don't tell everyone your messages on the nose about the private life of your colleagues!
If one of them shares with you their inner secrets, do not abuse his trust!
Lock up what you heard, and in his absence do not talk about it with your colleagues, even when others know about his things.
Are you reporting your absence without reason?
If you call to the office and call for a strong headache, you will report your absence, because you are not well, or you say that you'd rather rest today, think about your work, your immediate tasks and work that they have a certain term, someone else will have to do for you.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know ahead that you don't go to work the next day, or that something that will have to make you stay at home, tell your colleagues and managers not to be confronted with your absence until the next day.
Smoothing, hygiene, phone
Did you go into a job that a colleague's hygiene is going to get you out of?
Did you not want to be a witness of a telephone conversation that would be better not be heard at all?
Don't interrupt your colleagues by singing, with a sound call (including over your head), or with punching, continuous knees, sound dissatisfaction.
All of this may be disturbing even when they are not just prevented from a project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you blaming the mistakes of the second?
If something is not in time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or a message, do not blame your forgetty of others!
Don't renounce any chaos in the office and noise colleagues!
Recognize if you were mistaken and someone paid for it, and fix the injury!
Ask you how you could fix this thing, fix the negligence!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Temperatures and papouches: comfortable house clothes, however, aren't available in the office!
Don't take your clothes for free time, even if it allows your profession!
Don't be neglected, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to your office in common dresses - and if your profession requires it, nice and elegantly!
When a person wants to respond, he stops being interesting
Driving in the usual morning trap.
A special melody will be called from the radio: the sound of violins to which electronic effects are attached.
I'm adding noise.
The music changes the pace and the bass is added to previous tonne coloring, then the female congregation is joined as a real jewelry.
At the station Mr2, the Zagar group plays named Wings of Love.
The homemade musical life has not scattered us with a quality electronic pope for a long time.
But suddenly, the trap looks quite different because you're just listening to Zagaru's new album.
The discovery of Yonderboy, a couple of new and interesting productions originating from a digital subground, the total image slowly changes, and although it is again in fashion of the garage rock with its beating into the guitar, even the domestic electropope proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balazs Zsager started in Fifth and he also played in Yonderboi's band until he finally - perhaps because two dudas don't get into one - he gave his own way.
With its project (Zagar) and music, which connects the elements of jazz, electronic dancing styles and popu, however, began to show until he was called to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
film Ference Töröka "Sezon").
His formation, playing in the beginnings of smaller clubs, recognized a wider audience after the magazine wan2 set up their first album from 2002 between 50 most important homeboards and declared Zagar in Yonderboie as well the only domestic subjects defining development that could be selling even in the West.
Zagar and his band are no doubt "in course", although of course no one asked them if they were satisfied with this sticker.
The band responded as it belongs: she made a new, better album.
Now published album named Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths to them, although the name itself is trying to create a relationship with the starting years in Fifth.
This is a verse from the song of the old band of Balazsager.
The reference to the ethnic, flying would be in place, but next to the ethical breath of this music now appeared - in line with the spirit, the trend of time - more guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, a singer of György Ligeti, currently working in England with the Puzzle Group, presented at the premiere of the park Millenaris.
Album also produced a real radio hit, thanks to the station Mr2 Petõfi, playing a popular music from the morning to evening, we began to screw up the whistle music of Wings of Love, recorded with six domestic singers ("Innderground Divas").
So everything's all right (?)
The Hvg.hu portal confessed Balazsa Zasagera.
hvg.hu: With regard to this new hit, the question is, how much remains what you play, border music?
Balazs Zsager: Definition border music means nothing to me.
I think there are two different casts of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternate, subground music can be flat, nothing to say, and that's the only way it can be created for sale, which makes it commercial.
Of course, even a good pop song can come from the sincere internal need.
In this spirit, there is also a position in which it is accepted, regardless of language and public borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience against your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, especially from us to the west, the lighter music has more tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people after 20, but also elders.
Many more are watching the changes of light music around them because they also consider it part of the judicial culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Do you care who, where and how much does your music listen?
B. Zs.: Of course, it is a good feeling that more people go on our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
The music is not born for a purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be seen more on concerts where mutual influence already works, but it is hiding only in unfavourable changing moments.
Nevertheless, I noticed that if a person wants to meet the audience, he has no longer been interesting since that time.
hvg.hu: How long are you going to follow Yonderboie's example?
He works solo, and he built his career rather than us to the west.
B. Zs.: We don't actually go his way, regardless of how our music is sometimes trying to explain.
We're rather team players who rely on the musical presence of the other person and let her develop.
Of course, at first, our work could not be avoided to compare Yonderboy's songs, since some of us separated from his band and went another way.
hvg.hu: The Wings of Love played first in the top of the station.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
You've been able to open yourself with a wider layer?
B.Z.: We weren't planning to write a hit to sell the board.
It's more about that song.
We meant it as a final album that we tried to release the previous sound orgy and the more complicated themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose those six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The present was to create such a Gospel congregation.
Then the idea came to build this congregation from the solists of the home music scene with a good voice.
So this six-distance congregation - that is Sena, Edin Kutzor, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikø Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeeth - which we then baptized at Underground Divas.
Hvg.hu: That's exactly how you've been planning on the song, or did girls make something on it?
B.Zs.: The composition has been in the instrumental version for a long time, when the material came together on the board, we thought that something else would be necessary for this song.
The track of the chords led to joining a singing part.
That day the night I sang on him the music that the girls later taught.
It worked for almost the first and awfully spontaneous time.
I remember how it recovered, but of course the Diva needed it.
With my voice, it wouldn't work so energyly.
hvg.hu: As on the board and on the concert, it seemed like girls in the background.
They don't have solo (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own role, they sing totally together and are not more loud than music, so music just does not perform their song.
They also stood back at the stage.
Is that deliberate?
B.Zs.: The fact that they stood behind was only due to technical problems.
The fact that we didn't want to share salt roles is deliberate.
And the song is to forget a little of our ego, where it belongs, and to just let the wings, the wings of love rise.
I wish that this euforic state that we felt when the song was born, others felt.
hvg.hu: What was the most work?
B.Z.: During the composition of music, not even with one, the harder pieces appeared more in mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work for a long time, then everything was slowly found his place as in some puzzle.
hvg.hu: What new board song is your favorite?
B.Z.S.: It's still changing by concerting, even if I've already released the board.
Now it's Prophet is a fool, Escape from the Earth and Never the same.
Traitor risked billions of minority
It's a handsome defraudant.
This is what he names his excellent employee, Jerome Kerviel, French bank giant Sociéte Géneral, owner of the foreign Commercial Bank.
She lost about five billion euros because of it.
But it seems rather that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to compare his colleagues and also certainly not incapable.
Unlike all the large banking houses, he recognized the crisis at the American mortgage market.
"It's mentally weaker," the mouth of his supervisors, who sent the police on him.
However, as Kerviel’s statement made by the French media, such as Le Monde’s journal, it was a man who had a profit from 1,6 billion euros at the end of the year.
Crisis Not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," says the statement.
In summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros in the American crisis.
Because he felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to appear that so-called subprime hypotheses provided to low-prime clients or those who had problems with payments in the past will have problems.
But this crisis should not have an impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet it was right.
And at the end of the year, his profit went up to 1.6 billion euros.
"If I earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits and adds that he definitely didn't leave anything for himself.
In the entire interrogation, he admits that he fakes his records so that he can't find it.
He even screwed up his bosses, even when his stores began to be interested in the Eurex storm.
The risk was a profit.
Was he afraid he'd come up with him?
I don't think so.
"I thought the simple fact that I earned $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he take the will to risk so much?
He must have gradually developed himself at his position.
He entered Sociéta Géneral in 2000 just after he received the university in Lyon.
His annual salary was moving around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a assistant of a minister and in 2005 he became a separate makler with a yearly fee of $90,000.
Still, he knew he would never make as much money as others.
"I knew they were looking at me in my first interview in 2005.
For my education and for professional and personal development," Kerviel described the investigators.
But shortly after the entrance, the first great success came.
With allianz's shares he earned, and at the bomb attacks on London, he betted on the decline of this title half a billion euros.
And that was the launch mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you make money, we'll leave you
"It's like a snowball," he told the cops.
But the bosses said they knew about it or were they rather aware of it.
"Where I earned money, they closed my eyes."
But then the wound came at the beginning of this year.
He lost a billion euros in the only day.
After the weekend, half January, he wanted to collapse it.
When he got to work Monday, he didn't work at the bank anymore.
And the bank reported a few days later that he lost five billion euros.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect for his vacation.
"I only picked four days in the last year.
The Machler who has no vacation is a merchant who doesn't want anyone to look at his records," Kerviel closed up.
Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
The Czech government ministers signed yesterday with the representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes, from which the Czech Republic can gain 14 billion euros in the next years (about 365 billion crowns).
It is approximately half of the total amount that Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns will go from seven operational programmes to regions.
The Czech companies will be able to get about 100 billion crowns from the Innovation and Innovation Programme.
Most money, up to 150 billion, will go to transport.
The Transport Programme is the biggest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the funds the CRC can receive from the funds.
These money will increase the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will be holding the amount of 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Innovation and Innovation Programme should serve businesses and companies to gain funds for innovation business.
Companies should gain funding for new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
The EU funds have been drawn from the EU funds to date within the newly adopted countries among the least successful.
The 20-year penalty for Nicaragui has confirmed the court
The Court of Auditors in Nikaragua confirmed on Thursday the twenty-year penalty for the former President of the country, Arnold Aleman, who was convicted in 2003 for financial frauds reaching $100 million (no less than 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in a home prison at his hatienda near a nikaragua metropolis.
If the former head of this Mediterranean State from 1997 to 2002 returns back to the network, it is not clear at this point.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Peresa will now be dependent on prisoners, whether Aleman will be allowed to serve his punishment at home or in jail.
The court proved to Alemann four years ago that he regularly transferred government money to foreign business accounts in Panama.
These companies were fictional and accounts belonged in fact to his relatives and closest collaborators.
Some of these money then ended in the fund that Aleman was founded to finance his election campaign in 2001.
That's how our budget was approved.
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
What is this budget unique?
It is the first budget made by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of opposition.
This one went through with the support of the CHSSD for this year, because he was prepared by the Minister of Sobotka and the ČSSD couldn't afford his disadvantagment.
Unlike the rushing debate before voting about the government's unreliance this time, there was nothing dramatic Sunday.
The messenger of this traditionally overlooked, although the most influenced, the law approved peacefully.
It's a certain paradox.
Each government begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether they like or not.
The budget is an important part of the policy, but it is hidden behind the mighty competition of the government with opposition.
This is more grateful in the media, and he is given much more attention to the media.
Politicians' guessing is much more interesting for the public than strict numbers.
The state budgets in the previous socially democratic governments suffered three shortcomings that the year 2008 was unable to solve at once:
The first of them is the high share of the mandatory law, the so-called mandatory expenditure, which are not only pensions, but also the social doses approved by the silent "coalition" of ČSSD and KSCHM last year before the elections.
The second of them is deficit economy as a result of the necessity of the first.
The third limit is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the deficit of the budgets of cities and municipalities.
However, the largest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
He's public and relatively under control.
However, the temporary bomb is the deficit of the budgets of cities and municipalities.
Many mayers, in addition to tax, taxes and loans from banks, have obtained additional investment resources, often unheadedly exempting bonds with which their towns are unduely owed.
In the past years, they were able to repay these debts by selling the mass shares of energy and other divorce networks that they received from the State in privatisation.
Now they don't have this source anymore.
If we only stick to official and verifying facts, we find that:
Our economy has been going through for years, just like the rest of the world, a growth phase, which keeps praising the ČSSD.
It was a unique opportunity for its governments to make public finances fine.
Instead, the State owed more.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have done much more reasonable than our Republic.
It's a huge shame that falls mainly upon the past governments.
We belong among the countries that are at least threatened by poor.
Therefore, there are no need for massive social programmes that, unfortunately, just in recent years have been completely unnecessary in the giant dimensions.
Although it has been able to cancel part of the nonsensitive populistic expenditure approved this year before the elections, if there is no retirement boundaries in the nearby time, and retirement reform, it will actually end any policy in this country, and no one will rule it simply.
With a small excess, it can be said that government politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing the majority of taxed money to retirement and social dosages.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolutionary budget, but it can only stop the pressure of normal expenditure by mandatory.
The planned deficit of 70 billion per year 2008 would be absolutely useless if the past governments did not earn what they could in the past ten years.
If we don't really want the government's politicians to become just officials, then we need to be patient and support this very strong coalition government that realizes that the State can only spend as much as it can get taxes and taxes, peace to prepare other reform laws.
Only these will allow the progressive achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than $100 billion on the monetary markets will be made through auctions.
In these auctions, the banks expend the interest rate for which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send $40 billion to the auction, and another fourty-fifth will be accessible to the European and Swiss central bank.
This is the first time after the 11th September attacks of the central banks of each State have agreed on this coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step is to deal with the biggest problems of the economy, that is the growing lack of free capital that banks could borrow," Bernard Baumohl wrote in his report to the clients from the Economic Outlook Group of Consultants.
"The coordinated action of central banks reduced the probability of recession in the United States from 65 per cent to 50 per cent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion for unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect another billion losses.
"Central banks must really be afraid of what else can follow when they have decided for this procedure," ABN Amro Kieran Davies said.
"The situation seems to be really bad," he added.
The central banks are concerned that if banks have the most difficult access to loans, they will be more costly to borrow their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to a recession with possible impacts on the economic growth of the world.
The central banks have so decided after it was unsuccessful to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used to borrow money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still worried about the mutual loaning of money, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada, and Britain have reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another decline in interest rates," said the Reuters Greg Salvaggio from Temmus Consulting.
Some analysts do not think that the steps of the central banks will contribute to the elaboration of the crisis because they do not solve the fundamental problem, which is the fall of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: Environmental debates are incredible
Global climate change is the most harmful for developing countries.
President Vaclav Klaus reiterated the problem of global warming.
The criticism has now taken place at the ending international conference of the United Nations on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not green planet, he stated that the ecological debates were incredible.
According to Klause, it is not only an acceptable structure of the conference formed by a strange mixture of representatives of government and non-governmental organizations, but also a fundamental difference between the rhetoric that is carrying out, and the reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it is only a fire of words that are a substitute for addressing the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President emphasized that the subject was very important to him, so it was so engaged for them.
He also expressed satisfaction with the fact that the book is also appeared in the German translation, because, as he said, "I meet only with the chariots of my opinions."
So now the students can read his infinite attitude.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climateologist, but in his opinion, he had enough assumptions to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and assess professional negotiations, has experience with statistics and is also a national economy.
In the main conclusions of the book, he pointed out that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal that there is no matching view of all scientists that the consequences of these changes are not too large and serious and therefore are not a threat and that the efforts to influence climate development are useless, ineffective and unacceptable.
Furthermore, as a person with totality experiences, he considers it unacceptable to impose unprovided opinions to others, which feels as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained the questions of the presents that it was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their use".
On the same subject, Klaus in Vienna spoke two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver has failed to exchange 600,000 people
Six hundred thousand drivers have missed the period and have failed to exchange an old driver's license expired by the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for exchange to make a new list by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year they would go to the road of hundreds of thousands of drivers without the right permission.
According to the authorities, the license has not changed mostly those who don't want to drive anymore.
While the municipality reports a rapid decline in the interest of the exchange of drivers, the authorities in the metropoli are incorporated by requests and the interest in exchange of documents this week has increased.
The magistrate takes about 2,000 clients a day.
There's approximately half an hour in front.
In Prague, the driver's license has not changed about 140,000 drivers.
Exhibition of a new certificate takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to be requested to be issued in a short term of five days.
But in that case, the driver will add five hundred crowns.
The engineers who do not reach the exchange of the record by the end of the year and go on a road without a valid driver will be threatened with penalties since January.
The guilty will pay at least two thousand crowns.
But a police officer can deal with the crime by dealing.
In the case of the administrative offence, the penalty shall be applied to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, he could have received a penalty from the city and a man who would not go anywhere.
He could also pay for 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has earlier called upon the authorities to be mild and retain the highest thousand crown penalty.
According to the Ministry of Transport, Karl Hanzelka, the ten thousand penalties are not threatening to anyone.
The driver's license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not a civil record that every person has to have valid.
People who don't want to drive should give up the driver's license.
It is sufficient to be taken or sent recommended by email to the competent General Authority.
Since the end of the year, they will cease to pay the documents issued between 1964 and 1993.
However, motorists must gradually exchange other types of driver’s licenses.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have another three years of time to exchange.
The validity of the documents issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are approximately 2.6 million other documents.
The court has reduced the punishment to the detectives associated with Berdich.
Former police officers Joseph Opava and Peter Konjarik, who are accused of criminal association with David Berdych, will go to prison for 13 and 10 years.
With definitive validity, the Prague Supreme Court decided, which thus reduced their penalties, one year and two years.
He originally threatened the detectives of the Prague Committee to combat organised crime for 14 and 12 years.
There is no way to appeal against today's decision; only a call to the Supreme Court can be possible.
Although Berdich is also accused of this cause, he is waiting for a first-minute verdict.
In other processes, however, he has already received penalties in the sum of more than 16 years.
He can't get more.
In January, the District Court recognized in particular the participation of 19 guilty robbery, the Supreme Court today dealt with the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused have refused to do so since the beginning of the investigation.
According to the Mediterranean Senate, police officers after the agreement with Berdich, transmitted information to criminals from police sources, covered individual robbery and helped the gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang gave up 30 percent for Opava and Konjarik.
It is in the case of criminal activity of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
Especially about robbery whose victims have suffered serious health injury, but also abuse of the power of the public producer and illegal weapons.
In the home surveys, the police discovered illegally held guns, steel bullets, laser focuser or self - pal.
The gang was accused of robbing tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to almost 20 men in this process, the courts have already competed with the guilt of other robbery of Berdich and a number of other people.
Other men in Berdich's surroundings have been confessed in another process, some causes have not yet come before the court.
The main treatment has yet been avoided by Tomas Pot and Marosha Schulei, who are in an Irish detention, where they are waiting for definitive decisions on their release to the Czech Republic to pursue.
Account for child replacement: 12 million
In exchange for children in the family, the lawyer of damaged families, Igor Veleba, wants to compensate 12 million crowns, plus the judicial exhibition.
For every mother after three million, for a father after two million and for children per million.
The hospital offers at least 200 000 for every parent.
The Legal Representative of the Hospital Ondrej has therefore disagreed with the Veleba proposal.
"We reject such a requirement, it is very high," he said after today's negotiation.
"But to make an opinion on the anti-proposal, we need a expert assessment that the anti-party has made.
We'll find out if he's at all a confession value.
But we are in the opinion that it will be in hundreds of thousands for all," he stressed.
The part should be moved between 100,000 and 200,000 CZK for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the cause, the family from Jablońov wanted in every month when she did not raise her biological daughter, a million crowns.
He served Veleb as a basis for negotiations on a compensable expert assessment that the Faculty Hospitals in Prague-Motole for him.
Children’s parents according to psychology and psychiatric experts suffered mental injury and stress in different degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even though they were confronted with regrets that they did not stop the replacement of newborns.
Women are regaining the reality of the experienced trauma and what is happening right now, summarizing the contents of Veleb.
Veronica and Nikola have been exchanged by health sisters in the Tribian family last December 9th.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nicolas to Črmakov to Pribislavic and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslavi Trojanovi in Jablońov.
Haytman Highscores Milos Stressed passed each of the families at the end of October 100 000 crowns to their expenses, which resulted in the error of the Tribune hospital that the country is creating.
All hospitals in Czech Republic are secured from the law to account for damage.
In the case of doubts, they must reach the reserve fund, and they may unusually request the help of the organizer.
The courts have already awarded relatively low compensation, the sums were counted according to the tables in hundreds of thousands, especially millions of crowns.
Soup lost Valash Kingdom
Soup pain lost a dispute about the Valash Kingdom mark.
According to the judge of the island district court, the King of Valash was first used, but the project built a long-term work team around Tomáš Harabis, who cooperated with the actor.
The soup has not participated today.
According to his lawyer, the cause is probably not over, and the client calls off.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabish and his team are parasited at the popularity of the Soup pain," the lawyer of Pouvka said after the process.
According to him, everyone in the words of the Valash Kingdom will just relieve actor and a comic.
Harabish has the same view.
"There's almost ten years of work behind us.
Search for money and invention of action," he said.
He thinks it's caused to dispute money.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and could have something out of it.
They want to parasite our work," he added.
Lucrative business
According to the court, the Valash King used the Soup for the first time in his television show.
In 1993, he was crowned by the Actor Radoslav Quick Fortune.
But then it was not related to the intention of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came out with the idea of the issue of valish passports.
The original recessory action has evolved from the trade and lucrative business activities to which Harabish then initiated the establishment of the Valash Kingdom.
In 1997, Souvka agreed to specify his name and signature in passports and even offered their discount holders to visit his farm and theatre show.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the Judge also stated that Harabish only used the naked idea that Soupka published in the manage for his business intention.
"The Popularity of Boleslav Polyce of the Valash Kingdom project certainly helped," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabish and his team, who was intensely committed to him.
The collaboration of today dissolved parties continued by 2000, when Harabis organized official coronation in the Continent.
Since then, however, between Soup and Harabis began to accumulate disputes that have summarized the session of "King Boleslav I. elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken by the singing Jarmila Schulak as the queen of the mother.
In 2002, he filed Supa on Harabis and his company, which the court rejected today.
It could clearly bring Harabis to a dispute about the throne and half of the princess.
The new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to tell the details and the term yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be like driving kings to Slovakia.
The King should be elected for a certain time.
Even Mr. Soup can log in," Harabish added.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: missing prejudices
Truthfully, I've never funded too much to Peugeot 206.
His driving characteristics were not much, the quality of sorting, management, and the production could be labeled as sub-mediate.
But on the market, Peugeot 207, and he's much better.
And the van called SW is about a little further, and I'm not left to think better.
When I tested the classic hatchback of Peugeot 207, I complained for example about the head space on the back seats.
It's over here by complaining, because the caroserie van means there's not going to be any long in this direction.
A World Flight
I'm going through the interior very fast so I can't repeat myself too much.
It's a very successful design, where I have the only line to the poor central tunnel.
I'd appreciate a little more design invention here when the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and there are times when we could complain about short seats or seats.
Side leadership also improved significantly against model 206.
As in space, there is a sense of growth in the dimensions of the caroserium.
In the van, the already mentioned lack of space over the head.
Boot bags
So the main thing on this car is his trunk.
I have to assess this as very well-accessible (including through the interpretation of the back window) and as fairly consistent.
Deaf places are equipped with restrained rubbers that are a perfect compromise.
It doesn't interfere, it can be stretched and maintain harder objects.
But let's stop together over the hug.
It is based on tables in the basic arrangement 428 l, which is more than a mean value against competition.
However, not against the Czechest sales car of this class - the damage of Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with a new generation of the youth of the product, then we find that Peugeot remains with many famous 52 liters.
For a vacation to abroad or when loading a cart, this value is critical.
But if I had to raise the positive, I still have to mention the completely straight floor after closing the other row or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four lines
Our tested car was equipped with a four-wall flamming engine volume of 1.6 l with 88 kW performance.
And to tell the truth, that's what a 16-year-old girl should look like, starting a family hatchback.
She's silent, she has little consumption, and she's mainly dragging.
If I compare her to the harmful time that leckdy works like she's got a screwed-up dress, I can only be excited of it.
The price will comment
Car price is not human.
However, we must remember that we tested the goodly equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 14-inflammation for 329 900 CZK will still go away.
Our aggregate stands from 410 900 Kč, which is quite enough.
Tested equipment Premium then fits equipment for another 80 000 Kč above.
But we still had airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic discharge, electrical control of the back windows...
It's just a car worth 531 900 Kč everywhere.
It's a lot, but count the supplementary equipment at Fabie and you'll get a very similar number.
So there's nothing left to decide for the mark.
Integration of Slovenian students in British schools is unsuccessful
In the British schools, children from Eastern Europe are acquired, which causes concerns for the further development of local education.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans is yet encountering a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and children of the original inhabitants grow into violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools illustrates a case in northern Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovenian immigrants begin to be degreeed.
The quarrels, the quarrels and the fights between the students have moved into the relationship between parents.
The situation went so far that the police detained a Slovak woman in Chatham, who beat a ten - year - old student with a iron stick.
The guilty is against the boy being insulted by racist dangers.
The police had to interfere even after the two 15-year-old girls attacked a Slovenian immigrant.
The girls reportedly admired racist notes and cast stones on him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started swimming at us.
When I told him to stop it, the apples and gruss went on us, and then he revealed his ass," she described another unpleasant event for the Times mother of the Slovak students.
The complaints are on both sides.
One of the local residents even marked disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe for the fight for survival.
The above cases indicate that the atmosphere in British schools between local and immigrants is getting tense.
In Britain, 70,000 Slovakians have been registered here to work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovenian students then attend British schools.
Cuba the most beautiful island of Caribbean
For visitors, it is indeed a island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can happen to you if you choose correctly.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or sea, calm as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and drinking cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and rulet.
On the islands in the Caribbean, you will find it in a full and even richer calculation.
Only on one island, but you will find much more and that island is Cuba, the greatest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
For the Spanish, Cuba used to be the garden of their conquests in America.
Colombius called it the most beautiful place that the human eye ever saw.
Hawana became a warehouse and translation of treasures that the Spanish in America broke and transported to Europe.
And then the American era arrived.
The National Hotel grew up at the end of the 20s.
He was let by one of the chiefs of the American Mafia Lucky Luciano because everything in the USA was a crime (e.g. for prohibition) was welcomed and supported by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests, they were mine.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
The high houses grew up in Hawana, after the broad bullshits, cars that belonged to the cultivation symbols of the past 50th century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a seat in San Francisco de Paula, a piece of Hawana, and he had his yacht in Coymar.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio, they left their signs of the showbusiness star and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls in the Havana Bodeguita, you can leave your autogram.
In the expensive hotel bar, the National will mix you a cocktail according to your wish.
And those 50-year-old cultivation cars are riding Hawana so far because the once imported bullets and fiats in this salt and wet air have been rotten long ago.
Being Hawana, especially her oldest part, is much scattered, yet there are no such beautiful colonial memories as there.
Other places also turn into beauty, like Trinidad.
Since the travel move brings so much necessary money, its development is green.
In the past 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Hawana, but especially on Varader, on the coast of Holguin, and on islands like Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another libost, which is unique in the world and is especially appreciated by the trainers.
Third of the extensive plants were tied to diabetes along the narrow rails of pairs and motor trains.
Their car park has not been renewed for many decades, so there are working machines whose classrooms are only in the museums.
Where do you want to go?
The most famous places most Cuba visitors will not pass.
So, Varader or Hawana don't have to be described too much.
I hope to remind you that in the already mentioned Hemingway village is a museum and who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
Vinyales Valley One of Cuba's most painted corners is the valley of Vinyales in the west of the island.
Bull vegetation grows from the vaccine floor.
Mogots, calcium homoles and rocks rise from the bottom of the valley, and in their dusts the fertility land was caught, which also made the wind rocks covered by thick growth.
The valley is the place where the most quality Cuban tobacco is growing.
With his final form, you can meet if you visit any of the Hawanese factories to produce cigarettes.
Maybe someone's going to be curious about the chile part of Major Zeman.
Trinidad
An ancient city, which was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Fame and riches brought him a slave trade and sugar.
Richness has become a beautiful and exhibition of a small city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, expressedly affected by later French settlers, almost changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the mountain of Escambray, is so far away that in the 1950s, there was no road that would connect the country with the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay away.
Nothing happened there, and that's why nothing also broke down, everyone was happy to have a roof over his head.
If a person in Trinidad has more time than one afternoon, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the nearby area, such as Playa Ancona Beach, or the valley of Cukrovars.
In the evening, it belongs to go to Casa de la Musica, who lives after darkness, and the music in it is silent over the wound.
Baracoa
The city in the same East of Cuba, some call it the most beautiful in the island.
Indeed, such an opinion has already affected the road itself.
Both roads that lead from Guantana must overcome the high and partished mountains and pass through the nature that human activity has almost not seen.
The Eastern island of Cuba has written UNESCO through the unbreaked nature to the list of world heritage.
They do the best chocolate in the church, they have the Columbus Cross (in fact, it originated about a hundred years after Columbus Flood) and from the hill where the former castle stands and today's El Castillo Hotel, is seen by several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About coffee, rum, cigars, mountains of Sierra Maestra, the Bay of pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Cabaret of Tropicana, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, the santeria, the African religions that recognize the descendants of the former slaves, could all be described.
But as it's right, it's better to see once.
Ambassadors in Afghanistan are passive, hard Americans
A few soldiers and lack of necessary equipment affect the progress of the mission in Afghanistan according to the United States.
NATO's defence minister Robert Gates should plan a specific plan for the next summer.
The mission in Afghanistan does not take place according to the imagination, the representatives of the countries in Scotland Edinburgh who have units in the southern part of the country agreed.
In addition to the increasing resistance by the Taliban movement, there are also eight participating States today discussing other plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week, through the Defence Minister Robert Gates, the NATO units called for greater activity, the United Kingdom has seen the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and strengthening development assistance.
"The vision in Afghanistan is massive, but the military force can only be one part of the solution.
This further is to allow the populations to start further economic and security development themselves," the British Defence Minister Des Browne said to the BBC station.
90 per cent
The activities of the Afghan rebels are the highest in the last five years.
The number of violent acts increased against the last year by 27 per cent, even 60 per cent in the Southern Helmand Province.
NATO countries have approximately 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
However, according to the United States, allies have reached the same limit in the organisation and equipment of units.
In particular, they ask for further helicopters, soldiers and experts for training in the Afghan units.
"We must seriously consider specific goals for the next time and ways to achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar sense today, the Secretary-General of NATO Jaap de Hoop also spoke.
"I am not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment that we need, and that's not enough," said the Reuters De Hoop Agency at the conclusion of class interviews with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive
Among the countries participating in the past months, disputes are also ruled on whether all all the alliances are taking the maximum in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticised as a passive.
"The Germans have relatively numerous representations in Afghanistan.
However, they are placed in areas where the minimum violence and combat rights are not as high as we are in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The British Sun bullwar list has marked German soldiers as lazy soldiers this week.
"Afghan's folks are discovered: Germans are playing while our boys fight," Sun wrote in a material, supplemented by the images of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild went into an attack and printed a picture of the British unit at the football game in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The state debt will be declined on a billion in 2009
Each Czech Republic has a national debt over 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to the end of September 842.7 billion crowns.
The government planned to borrow 159,2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry has reduced the plan to 152,8 billion crowns due to the better development of state budget economy.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose to the end of September 842.7 billion crowns.
In nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
Since June, however, it decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance has thus confirmed its state debt data from the beginning of October.
Each Czech Republic owes over 84,000 crowns.
Over the year, more than 111 billion crowns owed the state.
"Well, it seems that the lower deficit for the next year could be overwhelmed by the line of billions of crowns until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be moved between 900 billion and a billion crown," said the iHNed.cz analyst Patria Finance David Marek for the server.
Similarly, analyst Next Finance Vladimir Pikora says: "To cross a billion, we could get to the end of 2009.
When exactly it depends on the next budget we don't know yet.
If it turns out that the situation in the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move to 2010.
But I do not suppose that change," he said.
The debts are growing
The state debt constitutes the debts of the central government and is mainly accumulation of State budget deficits.
The state debt is financed by treasury instructions, state debts, direct loans or loans from the European Investment Bank.
The State's internal debt increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
Foreign debt of the State this year has increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123,3 billion crowns.
The so-called state debt trade at the end of September reached 803,3 billion crowns and dropped by 13.7 billion crowns since June.
The average state debt payment has increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt for the first to third quarter has increased by 13 percent, which is really a lot of how the economy works.
Interestingly, growth is generated mainly in bonds where 20 percent increases.
It is bad that debt grows, but on the other hand, it shows that it will deal with something when retirement reform is here," Picora's data commented.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and government debt management for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow 159,2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry has reduced the plan to 152,8 billion crowns due to the better development of state budget economy.
The part is primarily the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of assuming 91.3 billion crowns.
This is also the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency 13.3 billion crowns, a 10-million reservation for retirement, the financing of state debts for 43 billion crowns and the payment of loans from the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion crowns.
A woman is to be brought to court today in Chartum for giving her name to the belly bear.
The British teacher, condemned in Sudan for an insult of Islam, was sentenced to a 15-day jail on Thursday night by the Chartum Tribunal and expelled, as stated her attorney.
Britain was accused of letting six to seven-year-old students give a bear bear name Mohamed, despite the prohibition of any demonstration of the prophet of Islam.
She was subjected to the punishment of wounds by the bee.
This British 40-year-old teacher, who acted at the Unity High School in the Sudan Chart, was arrested at her home on Sunday and accused of the injury of Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Judanese Criminal Law, after the parents of several students filed a complaint with the Ministry of Education in Judaaa.
Our story begins in fact in September, in September, when the interviewer asks his six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for a class-flash bear.
"From the mouth of children, there are eight names, including Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed," says Robert Boulos, director of school.
After a vote in class, 20 of 23 children finally choose Mohamed as the favorite name.
Of course, Mohamed is the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially in Sudan it is a very widespread baptism name.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by a description: "My name is Mohamed."
The bear himself had no tag with that name, but it was in the presentation of the prophet who was considered an insult of Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues, Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, stated that she knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be offensive for any religious faith: "I regret only that she asked her children to vote for a name," he said only about "innocent doubt."
This view also shares many teacher students who describe it as "very careful to their students" and adds that" never speaks of religion in the class."
Recall that the baptism name Mohamed is also the second most commonly given baptism name in Great Britain, in English it is written in fourteen different ways.
This baptism name often chosen by the Muslim families represents a way to worship the prophet (the firstborn is often made).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this baptism name?
Can it, for example, be given to a toy?
Of course, it's a matter of interpretation.
During the last round of the negotiations of this Wednesday in Vienna, they did not reach a future province status agreement.
Finally, it's a failure.
Serbian and Kosovo Albanians ended on Wednesday morning in Austrian Baden the sixth and at the same time the last round of conversations without having been able to overcome different views of the future status of this separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both parties were unable to reach the status agreement," said the European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger during the press conference in Vienna.
His American restraint, Frank Wisner, emphasized that peace in the area is "in a bet" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristina to keep their commitments peaceful and even after the conclusion of the negotiations are ready for dialogue.
"We do not expect violence in the nearest time, but we enter into a difficult period," he added, "it is obvious that the situation is tense."
The negotiation ends on 10 December
The negotiators of the Trinity, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last talk to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent form Albanian speaking population, could be shown in a clearer light on 10 December when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexandr Bocan-Charčenko are to give their report to the UN Security Council.
The interviews in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and at the same time the last round of negotiations since the United Nations, in August this year, the Troy had been assigned to new negotiations.
The Americans and the Europeans are counting that the interviews will be completed on December 10th.
The Russians who have already blocked Kosovo's independence in the United Nations Security Council, however, insist that the negotiations continue after the most established term.
"Russia was and remains inclined to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Bocan-Charčenko.
Unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of management of the international community, the West considers Kosovo's independence under the EU's supervision as the only consecutive solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is ready to declare its independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on expanded autonomy.
"We are unfortunately failing to make a deal," said President of the Kosovo self-authorized President Fatmir Sejdiu in the research hotel, where this "reaction of the last chance since Monday."
Hashim Thaçi, former rebel commander of Kosovo Albanians and the future Prime Minister of the Province, expressed regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan submitted by Belgrade "is the past that led to murders and deportations."
"Domain Effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic believes that the compromise is still taking into account and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of possible unilateral independence of the province.
Belgrade is particularly afraid of the "dominous effect" in the area which is still unstable as a result of wars for independence in the 1990s.
"That does not mean Serbia," he said, "the compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions belong only to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has the right to veta.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"For Serbia, only solutions from the Security Council are acceptable," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica said.
"This meeting took two years.
It must end as it began: on the ground of the Security Council."
The reporters Fatmir Sedjiu replied that "the last word of status will have the Kosovo Parliament" and added that if a unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian speaking inhabitants would take place "on the agreement" with the West.
Bush made an agreement on the Israelis and Palestinians
At the beginning of an international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, called from his popuda, US President George Bush announced that the Israelis and the Palestinians finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas agreed at the immediate beginning of the negotiation with a purpose once and for all to solve the 60-year debate between the two nations.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised he would do everything to help them close the peace treaty before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the "terrorism infrastructure" and Israel must end with colonial activities, Bush declared and recalled the obligations that come from the "travel map" to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The Chief of the White House emphasized that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian self-government of Abbas are aimed at "closing a peace treaty that would solve all unresolved issues without exception, including central issues".
This declaration includes three issues in the core of the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians: future borders of Palestine, Jerusalem status and the fate of Arab refugees expelled in the 1948 conflict of their homes in the territory of today's state Israel.
Abbas emphasized the words after the US President and pointed out that the subsequent negotiations were "a total and thorough" and that it touched all aspects of the solution, by mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, inter alia."
Then the tribunal appeared to the Olmert, who expressed the opinion that the subsequent negotiation should be "direct and continuous" and that it should be "seated to be concluded during 2008."
Bush defined the end of 2008 as the term of the realization of his "vision of two states", the Palestinian and Israeli, existing by itself.
Saudi Arabia stated that Bush had accepted the commitment in this sense before she decided to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated the proposal adopted by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for leaving all Arab territories taken for war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "crossing in the Middle East History, especially because he fights the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," the Prince Saud judges in an interview which he provided to an Arabic speaking journal protected by the Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened Sunday?
As always happens in such small news from black chronicles, the official versions do not conform to what is spoken between people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation, the General Inspection of the French State Police (Inspection general de la police nationale, IGPN), the police car was driving on Sunday shortly after the 17th hour of Louise-Michel Street in the village of Villiers-le-Bel.
"The vehicle was not in the intervention regime, but it was on the patrol and it was traveling by speed of 40 to 50 km/h, with no side lights activated," the police source explains.
The Green Motorcycle of Kawasaki mark, "not registered, and therefore without permission to ride in public communications" (read below), managed by two young men without a helmet, traveled "with a high speed".
"The motorcycle hit the left into the police car after he didn't prefer the right," a police officer stated.
The test of alcohol mile in the blood carried out on the vehicle crew appeared negative.
The condition of the car (breaked ancestor, broken front glass, broken punchers) testifies the speed of the hit.
Marie-Therès de Givry responded very quickly by the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (Republique de Pontoise) and announced yesterday morning that IGPN had committed an investigation by "the acts of uninterested murder and not to help persons in danger", whose direction is also taken by departementale de la sérete publicity du Val-d'Oise (the ruling of the district police department Val d'Oise).
At the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation led by IGPN excludes, in this stage, the responsibility of police officers for the accident.
Three witnesses who were subjected to the interrogation on Sunday night, according to the Office, confirmed "the versions of the police, because the minimotor approached them rather quickly from the left."
Some kind of ring, without doubt caused by the trespass of the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained scattered until the police car was able to stop.
Vehicles were secured and they're going through technical expertise.
There was an autopsy on both victims on the bodies yesterday.
What happened, right after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, people were rapidly spreading talks about the police to leave the crime scene quickly without providing the first aid to two young men.
IGPN should, in all caution, also exclude " any serious offence" in this point.
"It is a more difficult aspect of the investigation which requires more search and with which you need to be very careful," police source stressed.
The Libération journal met with the eyewitness of those moments that followed after the accident.
One of his windows leads right where the accident happened.
"We and my cousin, who is a healthy sister in the hospital, have come down to try to resurrect them," the Witness says.
We couldn't do anything."
Then he saw a "cleaking, totally frightened cop.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young men and the fourth spoke on the phone."
It faces a rapidly growing tension and surely the situation of youths is hopeless, the police were taken away by the colleagues who arrived at the same time.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "at about 20 minutes after the police left."
They also made the heart massage, but in vain.
"Let no one claim that the police authorities do not hurry to help young people.
The first aid was granted to these young men.
The firefighters are here immediately.
For their saving, everything was done," the prosecutor stressed.
The tension in Pakistan grows
The Pakistanian police in Monday suppressed the first demonstration from the announcement of special status by General Musharaf, two days earlier.
In the city of Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken within the exceptional condition, were injured by granates with tear gas, which, according to the Witnesses, used regular forces.
The last names were answered by stones, so several police officers were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were called.
Similar scenarios like Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several of them should have been called.
In Islamabad, the Attorneys of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, due to the wave of about 500 arrests of opponents, warriors for human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
The accessible streets to the Supreme Court were overplayed on Monday morning, in order to prevent the meetings.
Other demonstrations were to take place in Multan (medium) and Peshavar (Northwest).
On Monday, the movement of lawyers has been acquired by supporting religious parties in the politically strong alliance of Muttahid Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "consulted the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the exceptional state and waste to those who made an oath before Musarafe".
Musharaf's promise doesn't apply.
The Pakistan Supreme Court is the direct target of an extraordinary measure announced on Saturday night.
In the next days, he was to express the legality of the re-election of President Musharaf in an immediate presidential election, which took place on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry was removed and replaced.
"All we have witnessed is illegal, constitutional and against the judgments of the Supreme Court," the official said in the Journal of The News.
The promise of Parviz Musharaf to surrender the military leadership and become a civil president, "does not apply" after the introduction of an exceptional condition, the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeam announced on Monday.
It was expected to give up military uniforms by October 15th, when his first presidential mandate ended.
The Minister of Information also confirmed that January elections could be delayed.
The Pakistan government has also reversed the lasting speculation in the country, according to which the head of the army was to order President Musharaf's home prison.
More than a third of pregnancy still forms pregnancy unexpected
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %), as well as misplanted or unexpected.
More than one pregnancy from three (36%) is today unexpected, the study conducted by the French Institute National d'études demographiques (Ined)- State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the law of Neuwirt, which has legalized the contraception in France.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %), as well as misplanted or unexpected.
Different methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or steroid, still show 5% to 6% of the failure rate, IED estimates.
The imprisonment of the contraception has only enabled a better "fertile control", the Constitution claims and notes that the level of use of hormonal contraception in women between 20 and 44 years has reached 60% today from 5% in 1970.
Finally, eight of the ten births are well planned today.
One couple of five has even the birth calculated for a month and, if possible, at spring, which is considered the most pleasant annual period for the birth of the child.
Extraordinary repair of the space station
More than seven hours of work in the universe needed astronaut Scott Parazynski and members of his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) for a remarkable repair of a broken solar panel necessary for further scientific activity of the station.
It was about a risky output to the universe, which collected records for the length of duration, the distance from the housing modules, the speed with which it was planned and the measure of "custom", which the astronauts have equipped to repair.
The difficulties occurred on Tuesday, while the astronauts from the Discovery exposed the Harmony module, a large war office designed to install a European and Japanese scientific laboratory (see frame).
This module is some kind of landing mole for the modules-labators.
However, they need power to supply electricity.
The second mission of the crew was to move the 17-yaptonic power-producing module with the solar panels that were already located on ISS so that it would collapse in its final position.
After it was moved, the crew began to unload the 7 m solar panels of the module.
And in that, one of the panels that were stretching as a stretching harmonic, resulting in the cable scratch, was damaged on the surface of a meter of less than one meter.
The deployment was suspended to prevent another damage to the panel.
The astronauts who were originally supposed to perform the control output on the Discovery ship and then go to fix another solar panel whose rotation system had a disorder were forced to devote to the damaged panel.
And it was just Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic arm of the ship added to the station's shoulder, and made a repair.
It's one of the best "spacewalkers" (space walker) of the American Aviation and Space Office (NASA).
High, solid, very contrary, has very developed breasts and long arms.
When he was 46 years old, the physician was authorized to "operate" a "correct" solar panel.
After he explored the damage detailedly, he cut off the defective cable and fixed the damaged places of some kind of "drogs".
He was helping him with the second "spacewalker", which remained near the compensation chamber, and also from inside, other astronauts, including Peggy Witson, commander of the crew.
The tools he used, the miniocay with the isolation means, to prevent electrical shock on solar panels produced by several hundred volts, they invented, and the astronauts made up on the station.
After the operation was finished, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully distributed and then invented his tools and returned to the inside station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts returned to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday, as planned.
EADS actions weaken
The EADS actions are sensitively losing the Paris Bureau, after this aircraft and defence industry announced that it would have to spend 1,2 to 1,4 billion euros to face the delay of A400M aircraft.
EADS lost 4% and now is on the Paris Bureau at 21,96 euros.
The financial group was forced to re-evaluate its predicted production results for 2007, as a result of delays resulting from slow progress towards the development of the A400M engine, which is the condition of the starting flight.
The price for delaying in military cargo supplies, announced in October, was calculated "to 1,2 to 1,4 billion euros, more than a billion for Airbus", said the European EADS Material Constructor.
For these costs, the EADS, the next Thursday, when presenting its quarterly results, will be forced to announce a new vision of profit before deduction of interests and taxes (EBIT).
The group also stated that the new cost assessment corresponds to a six-month delay.
Recall that the production results of the EADS in 2006 fell by 86 % in particular due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the giant A380 aircraft.
The initial group assumed that the first delivery of A400M of the French army would be granted to the French army in October 2009.
Decision for status quo
Sunday elections will take place without tense expectations: the Russians mostly choose President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming that, after the end of a very little free electoral campaign, its pursuit of stability, and its authority.
Today, three days before the elections to the Parliamentary Assembly, Russian President Vladimir Putin communicates voters at public law stations a predefined television message whose content is kept secretly.
This is the position of the leader of the United Russia, the procremelic party, which is likely to celebrate the victory.
When the Ambassador of Foreign States accepted yesterday, the president did not let anything out of it and satisfied with another attack on the West charged with interference -- his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the value of true democracy and we wish to be honest, as possible the most transparent and most open choices, choices without the least disadvantaged of beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, it's not that way.
They condemn the campaign noted by various pressures.
The Leader of Communists Gennadius Zjuganov says "without such dirty elections, nor for Jelcin."
After repressing demonstrations from the last weekend, the former world's champion in Gary Kasparov's chess, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, he continues to be prohibited from visiting his attorney.
"The Russians have left the mentality of the Homo Soviets"
Two more open questions are profiled in the background of these parliamentary elections:
- "Who will become Putin's successor at the presidential office?
The Official Journal published yesterday the date of the first round of presidential election, 2 March 2008; public candidates may be represented by 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, selected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third mandate in order.
However, no follower appears.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
He'll be the prime minister?
Or by the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powered parties of the United Russia, who chooses the government and the president?
Anyway, the departing ruling power wins all lines in parliamentary elections, as well as in presidential elections.
It's tradition.
"The Russians have left the mentality of homo Sovietics, they do not feel the master of their fate," the sociologist Lev Gudkov, the Director of the Independent Centre of Levad, believes.
The historian Nikolaj Koposov of the State University in Sankt Petersburg notes the time-related connections: the civil society has gained, five centuries after Europe, late in this country; the famous common spirit has delayed the creation of individualism.
After the Liberal Reforms of the 1990s, "Putin has embarked on the paternist model of the State, perfectly accepted by the population, rather than that this new paternism had not carried terror but some economic welfare," Maria Lipman of Carnegie Fund.
Today, the Russians "will give up their personal responsibilities", which they proved shortly after the SSSR breakdown.
"Why to think?"
This phenomenon concerns all social species, including the business world.
The official elite also intends to preserve status quo: 65 governors (the total number of 85 Russian heads) run local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, like in the 1990s, a synonym of chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also, in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote extremists.
Conclusion Tamary Cheredninko, 40-year-old Professor: "Why to think?
Those who are in power are not so bad, so why change them?"
Loaded Memory
After more than sixty years in a confidential regime, Nazi archives from Bad Arolsen, which compare the fate of 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, open to the public.
47 million archive documents stored within 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were accessible only for the "human" purpose, which means individually and namely, on request of the former victim or its authorized persons.
Eleven States authorised by the archive management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed to open them to scientists and historians in May.
Since the ratification process of this Agreement is over by all States, opening yesterday has efficiency.
Sensitive information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable them to examine "specifically the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the health of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comite international de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently there were several countries, including Germany, against the accession of these famous public documents, due to a sensitive nature of some information.
What are predictable homosexuality or mental infections of certain victims of deportation.
Registers of concentration camps or arresters made by Gestape have been gathered after the war for practical purposes to find deported or forced work by civilians, to bring them evidence of their interaction in order to open their way of compensation.
Today, over 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are dealing with tens of individual applications.
However, for part of the Scientific Community, access to Bad Arolsen is only a limited benefit.
"The following documents cannot be expected of anything significantly new," said in 2006 Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Centre for Study of Anti-Semitism of Berlin Technische Universität.
EU and India want to appoint free trade contracts in 2008
The bilateral trade between Europe and India is now reaching almost 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is the first business partner in India and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect the signing of a free trade contract in 2008, announced by the European Commissioner for Trade, Peter Mandelson, and his Indian skills Kamal Nath.
In April last year, EU Foreign Ministers gave a green European Commission to launch negotiations in order to sign free trade agreements (accords de libre échange, ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asia (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India has already reached 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is the first business partner in India and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, to the ninth EU business partner.
"The Free Trade Agreement is a great deal in both economics" and "India gets better access to the market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, specifically the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giant will change "47 billion euros in goods" and "10 billion euros in services", Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission in New Dillia, regretted that the bilateral trade "not yet achieved its entire potential." The EU and India meet on Friday at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Dillia, for the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durao Barrosa.

The English bank took awareness of the concerns and offered 10 billion pounds in auction of five weeks
The English Bank showed on Thursday that it intends to mitigate the current concerns that the conditions on the loan market will be rehabed and announced the offer of 10 billion pounds in the five-week auction for a basic interest rate of 5,75 %, the offer applicable in an unusual long term.
"In order to facilitate the concerns under which the conditions on the financial markets will be very inadmissible at the end of the year and to give banks greater security in the way to ensure its cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period that begins on 6 December in the form of a five-week operation on the open market," she announced in the communication.
The Bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12,15 GMT until 10 January, at a basic interest rate.
It seems to be the first time BOE pumps cash on the financial market in the five-week operation on the open market.
It usually takes a week.
The BOE adds in its communication that "he is ready to take further measures to maintain interest rates for the inter-bank loans at the same level with its basic rate.
The inter-agency interest rate was 5.829 % on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate was 6.6%, which is the highest number of 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the financial market were linked to the Bank's tax rates that dismissed banks from the use of this offer.
According to certain speculations strengthened by the development of a libra course against the euro, many have preferred to decide for the amounts placed on the financial market of the European Central Bank with lower rates and more discreetness guaranteed.
UMP (Union pour un movement populaire, Union for People's Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to deal with the proposals of Socialists (PS) on purchase capacity
The UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss on Thursday each paragraph of the socialist proposal of the Communities Act, which is equal to the rejection of the text.
On the agenda of the draft law, the text of the draft law was received under the so-called socialist "nest" (the meeting initiated by the individual messenger club) and contained a ten of measures adopted in Tuesday by the PS Presidency, including the increase in employment premium by 50%, the renewal of TIPPs, the transport check or the rental regulation.
Since UMP and NC voted against the negotiation of individual paragraphs (180 votes v. 115), the meeting was terminated after the general debate, which became an opportunity to exchange views, sometimes more alive, between most and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television show on purchase.
The Chief of Members of PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club will re-item these proposals in their fullity as supplements to the amendment proposal of the Finance Act, which will be discussed by the Charter next week.
New festival is born
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presents in Filadelphia forms a new festival, this promotor/producer Vineland Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival of the Republic of the British Order Melvin Benna.
"For our company, it is honour to work with a man who inspired the current Festival movement in America without an exaggeration," said Charlie Jones from the C3 server Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland in New Jersey is a summer camp station.
The festival should take place from 8 August to 10th on a private farm of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Festival of the Republic, earlier known as Mean Fiddler, one of the world's most famous festival directors.
In 1989, the Reading Festival Cormidal in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80 000 people every year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added to his portfolio Leeds Festival, then in 2006 the Festival of the Republic established Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn is also in charge of production, licenses and organizational tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which has a capacity of up to 177 500 people today.
Charlie Jones of C3 calls Glastonbury "the most inspirative event" that he ever experienced and says that his company and Melvin Benna work together to give the region a festival event of European style.
"Originally, we chose Philadelphia as a market and together with the Fairmount Parks Commission we worked hard to establish a festival in the centre of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We have been together with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by the project.
Unfortunately, however, because of the current city’s leadership, we have taken place in politics, Charlie Jones adds.
"Fortunately, we had an opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we're about to set up a great festival in a unique place that will serve the people of Philadelphia as a result."
C3 Presents resurrected Lollapalooza in the Chicago Grant Park in 2005, after they arrived at the festival scene by organizing the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The gross sales of both events for 2007 amounted to $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals are taking place in the city environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benna Festival is on the village, while our festivals are on more green spaces in cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to collapse both concepts in a certain way in order to create both the impression of the rural festival after the European and urban post-American."
Vineland is located nearly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland Municipality, including the Mayor, is excited to support the implementation of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The last appointed refuses to provide the terms of the agreement, however, says, "they are sufficiently useful to allow them to invest in such an event and welcome the festival that they will have, hopefully, long-term".
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which captures 80 000 people.
He says that the invitations have already been dispatched to groups, but nothing can still be confirmed when the program is only given to the press.
"Although Vineland is going to have a rock breath, music is there, but it'll be hard to attract a wide spectrum of viewers if possible," Carlie Jones says.
Company partners C3, who received the Price Top Independent Promoter in the last year of Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood's film studio to Montreal when the Terminator himself...
This convincing mission is one of the missions of the delegate.
However, his mandate is "politically difficult" because Governor California Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to get the Guverner into the woods?
"You need to be careful, it's a industry who decides where he goes.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal are favourable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer those that they will consider as the best," he said.
Honba for festivals
For this moment, however, Denise Turcotte is the priority of promoting local film.
There's already been hunting for Oscars.
At all West Coast festivals, whether there are festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattlu, or San Francisco, it will be, present québec movies, alert them and ensure that directors provide interviews.
The age of darkness had a good publicity a few weeks ago at the 30th year of Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January, he will be presented at Palm Springs International Festival.
Shake hands with the Devil is offered in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th year of Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month also Québec presented four short-term and four full-night movies at American Film Institute of the Fest.
Will it happen at the end of the year on the maraton bure? Experty divided the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remains until the end of the administrative year, and the investors have hands on me expecting that there will be a traditional maraton at the end of the year.
However, this year the experts are not so sure that it will happen.
The Bank of Banif believes that "the month of December on the Bureau has a positive progress" in statistical terms.
However, it is not appropriate to create predictions exclusively on the basis of statistics, especially because markets are looking for, at least short-term, certain doubts."
These experts do not assume that the bureau of the last few weeks has been deployed, and they say that "the burden market is maintaining the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest in view of the missing alternatives with guarantees, especially the strong income affected by the impact of the turning effect on qualitative securities, both in long and short segments".
Therefore, they believe that the bureau will have a more calm progress, not without volatility, "e.g. because it is not known for the impact of the probably falling rates of the FED (Federal reserve system), given the high level of oil prices and the risk of inflation pressures".
Javier Barrio, head of the BPI bank in Spain, agrees that it is not the right time for a courageous statement that it will happen to a maraton.
"There are no reasons for joy," this expert assures.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the maximum values recorded on 8 November when the index closed at 15 945.7 points.
Still, all experts don't have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could end a year closer to 16,000 points by transcoupling portfolios and traditional pension deposits that happen annually at this time.
However, this expert suggests that this year everything will be a little different because he believes that the marathon will happen early in the second December week after the prolonged weekend on the occasion of the Constitution Day.
The mentioned analyst does not seem to have an impact on the market direction.
Federico Olucha, an analyst of Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching the technical level and "for this we can observe the reflection of the index caused by US reports on the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
The analysts are consistent with the selection of titles that make sure that Ibex brings to the new maximum cats.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that this year's row on strong titles.
This expert would include both large banks and some construction firms in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive".
The Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, in contrast, assures that growth will go hand-handed with banking and industrial sectors.
Building companies will also be able to enrich on this marathon if it happens.
"ACS has regained its position for several months and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will go the same way," explains the expert.
The cycle consumption will be in advance in the last part of the year by increasing sales during the Christmas selling period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that technologies will also be very good, even though they are not too represented in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the past seven years, December was only in two cases of crash.
The real marathon took place at the end of the year 2003, when the burzing markets ended the crisis caused by the flashing of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 regained 28.17%, the December recorded increase by 6.68%.
We'll see if the year 2007 will be the fifth profit year (before Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and will he be able to have its maraton at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular bank will be opened 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Bank Popular has decided to modernise most of its branches.
A total of two hundred placed in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under Popular Max, are a major change for the bank.
Also for other Spanish entities, because it is the first group that decided to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening time of its branches until 20:30 hours and open on Saturday from 10 to 20:30 hours.
BBVA, another group who also several times assured that he wanted to extend the opening time of his branches, has not yet decided to this step.
Meanwhile, she will conclude an agreement with the Committees to repeal the opening period 75% of its branch offices on Saturday in exchange for the extension of the opening period by one afternoon, even though not for the public.
The results of this experience of the Popular Bank will be crucial for other entities to be attached to this initiative, which supports the opening time of trade, or not.
That's exactly the goal of the project that the Popular Bank has found.
To acquire individual customers who go to these places for their shopping, smaller and medium-sized companies, pets and shops from the chosen streets where branches are opened.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain for about 18 months, because it is not about opening new branches, but just adjusting the existing ones.
For this reason, the bank modernizes the branches that it already has in business zones by adapting them to the customers' profile in individual streets.
This supplements the extension of the opening time by another concept of the branch space and the new, more current design in lighter colors.
The Business Director of the Bank, Angel Rivera, assures that this restructuring is not a big investment, but a larger burden of staff, as it moves from six employees to the branch office to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped for small and medium-sized meetings and will sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
Bank Popular has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Angel Rivera explains.
The branches were selected in the Madrid streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Via and according to River, it seemed to be a happy choice.
Bank Popular currently has 2500 branches.
And another 60 specialized for immigrants operated under the Mundocredit mark also has a very long opening time and opened even on Sunday and on holidays.
PopularMax branches will not monitor BBVA model when a number of its branches offers a large scale of non-financial products.
"We don't want to compete with our clients," says Rivera.
They just agreed with Telephonica to sell cell phones through an external personnel.
Telecinco first doubled the value of its rival Antena 3
We did it.
This sentence was expressed yesterday by Paolo Vasile, the executive President Telecinco, his satisfaction in the conclusion of the trade, when he concluded that the television that he was running, doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one thing ruined his joy: 'What I am sorry is that it didn't happen because we could grow more, but because we fell less,' he said.
And he emphasized that, thanks to the weak market, we've fallen less.
Telecinco terminated the trade by moving by 2,54% yesterday.
This profit moved their loss for the last part of the year to 15.66%.
The burzing value of this company controlled by the Mediastom (with 52% capital) with the participation of Vocent (only 13%) is to be achieved by Bloomberg's data of 4,488,88 million euros.
Her contestant Antena 3, who fell by 1,52% yesterday and totally dropped by 40.5% since January, has a half value of 2 193,46 million.
The value of other telecommunications companies which have been evaluated is 3.571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2 518.53 million Prisa (executor Cinco Días) and 1.779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile comparison with Antena 3, we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is, how much we can do on the same market, at what price and how we estimate it in tracking."
Telecinco announced last week that this year she counts on overcoming a billion gross revenues from the advertisement become the first TV channel, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, the executive President Telecinco and Publiespaña, a branch that ensures the advertisement of the group.
If the predicted data were really targeted, this television channel would have recorded an increase in advertising by 3.6% in 2006, compared to 965.4 million.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net rotation of Antena 3 increased by 1,6% (and reached 734,4 million), while the net revenues of this television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors on which the analysts focus, for the best relative development of Telecinco on the Bureau is the increase in the salary that has already been saved: in 2006 this company, President Alejandro Echevarría, shared 100% of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that even though it is soon to decide, this coefficient could change after buying 33% of Endemol along with his mother's Mediaset company.
'We have to give an official commitment at least 50%, although we have always announced a lot more.
I hope this year we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, which we have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market in these moments shows certain tiredness.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced his estimates of Telecinco profits in 2008 4% and 7% in 2009.
This is caused by, they explain that the expected growth of revenues from 0.5 % to 8.4 % in 2008 and from 5.5 % to 5.1 % in 2009.
The same company reduced the estimated profit of Antena 3, which was 4,5 % in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.
3 opinions
Article 1 is replaced by the following:
Ibersecurities: Recommends to buy both titles primarily on the basis of increased benefits for dividend and a long-term sustainable potential.
‘Article 1
Caja Madrid: it evaluates better Telecinco (group) than Antenna 3 (continue) because of its 'relevant advantage' and market growth.
‘Article 1
JPMorgan: In both cases, it recommends that they do not evaluate them because they face "like threats" (present market and the worsened economic environment).
Congress approved the transposition of the MiFID from 1 November
In collaboration with parliamentary negotiations, which were concluded today by the vote of the Congress on the novels of the Senate in the draft law, the Government has subscribed the public hearing of a regulation that develops a new law in order to enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the individual parties have similarly raised the efforts of the Members and Senators to negotiate and agree the best standard to guarantee the protection of investors and detailed regulations of the activities of the entities necessary for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Treasury Act, provides for the modernisation of the financial markets and also strengthens the protection of the investor, improves the supervisory competence of the State Commission for the Market of Securities (CNMV) and supports cooperation between individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation allows the provision of financial advice services to both specialised companies, both physical or legal persons, and creates a new type of companies providing financial services (ESIS), financial advice (AFI), which are attached to valuable papers, intermediate offices with securities and portfolio management companies.
Furthermore, the number of systems for operational operations with financial instruments is expanded by connecting multilateral trading systems and internalization systems to compete with current burzing markets.
The Act further obligates companies providing investment services to disseminate information on key aspects of their commercial profile, risk exposure and risk management and requires a report of all performed operations to simplify the supervision by the CNMV.
During the negotiation in the Commercial Commission of the Congress, several amendments have been introduced, including that securitised claims should be considered "complicated" financial instrument in view of the high danger for the investor, which has been demonstrated by what happened in the United States with highly risky mortgage debts (subprime).
In addition, the transfer of the Directive was used to legally exploit functions that can be placed in the economic and business sector for 30 years after the Royal Decree was approved in 1977, which entails the professional functions protected for economies.
At the same time, the Senate set up new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary who will work out externally, will not require a CNMV authorisation and will be able to provide services for trade with products and customers for various investment companies at the same time.
The ISC harmonised increased by five tens in November to 4.1 %
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the European Union Inflation Index, provides preliminary information on how prices were developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to the Eurostat policy and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator is calculated by using the same process that is used for the Harmonized Consumer Prices Index, but using various statistical methods for estimates of information that are not yet available during the publication.
The Spanish INE (State Statistics Institute) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only oriental, and therefore it must not be necessary to comply with the final data incorporated on 14 December this year.
"ISC will continue to be maintained at relatively high level"
The second vice-president of the government and the Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, said that the November increase in ISC by 4,1% is a " temporary number", but also predicted that the price index will continue to be relatively high in the next months.
In any case, Solbes in Congress's balloons stated that "although it is not a favourable number", the inflation diferencial of Spain against the monetary union has been still "more or less" in the past two years.
He also explained that November was " less surprising" than the previous month when the government did not count on such a high increase.
"We expected approximately 4% value," the Minister of Economy said to the present data.
Virgin plans to earn with Northern Rock 42 billion euros in three years
Since the Northern Rock bank arrived in the crisis in the mid-September and had to rely on an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its contributions have fallen by more than 50% to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros).
The Bank then managed records of more than 25 billion pounds, which gradually declined by the uncertainty of customers in the course of two and a half months, even though the government offered a 100 per cent guarantee for the money and extended it until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin company, which repays the name of the entity with its commercial financial mark Virgin Money, needs to obtain about a quarter of the revenues invested in the British banks in the next three years, so that it can gain the remaining 18 billion pounds and achieve 30 billion targets.
The Magnate Group of Richard Branson, known in the United Kingdom by its famous advertising campaigns, plans to spend 50 million pounds (approximately 70 million euros) annually for advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
The Northern Rock Bank marked this week the Consortion of Virgin, which forms three other companies, such as the one that prefers to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor Totany arrested for alleged corrupt practices in construction
Today, the civilian guard detained the current city of Totan (of the People’s Party) in early early hours for its alleged involvement in corrupt practices that were discovered this week.
A secretary of the city and the chief of the local police was arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales in May this year, the current human messenger and the mayor of the municipality, which, according to the research sources of Cadena SER, could be the “head of the entire company.”
The police continue to monitor the buildings of the city and the construction committee and not to exclude further arrests in the next hours.
Furthermore, the lawyer Juan Morales, the chief suspect of corrupt practices in the construction that were discovered at the beginning of this week, was accused.
As Caden SER was informed yesterday, the human's lawyer, Juan Morales, who was verified, arrested at the exit of Morales' residue with important documents related to corruption.
In addition, according to the research sources, Morales' alleged selection is subject to the purpose of its signing of the construction agreement with a galician construction company which has been prequalified by 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently detained.
Bono accepted the offer of a State headed by the Toledian candidate of the PSOE and, if they win, to chair the Congress
Former Minister of Defence, José Bono, accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of Socialists José Luise Rodriguez Zapater to stand in the next general elections in the head of the PSOE candidate paper (Spain Workshop Socialist Party) in Toledo and, if socialists win general elections, he became President of the Congress.
So the PSOE Secretary for the organization of José Blanco and Bono on the press conference announced it, after the meeting with Zapater, which took place on the afternoon in the federal headquarters of the party.
The executive chief has reasoned the former minister's offer by considering the best and Bono 'is among the best' in political life.
He further noted that "yes, it seems" that this policy from La Mancha will be a candidate of the Socialist Party to the President of the Congress, if socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marin as President of the Congress, who published his decision to non-case in the next general elections and leave his active political career so that he can combat climate change in university education on 15 November.
Former Minister admitted that the president of the government insisted on him to return to the top policy that he left two years ago.
He further stated that, as citizens know who will be the Deputy Minister of Economy, if the PSOE wins elections, his party wanted to inform the "transparent form" who will be chairman of the Congress.
If Bono wins this function, he hopes that the House of Respect will convert to "the House of Respect and not a scream" and aims to "will be more like citizens".
"Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid, where there is no peace and peace to speak, was Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate, at one occasion, interrupted 26 times."
He also said commendable words to the address of the current President Manuel Marin and his "her good work" and he didn't want to imagine himself in his place so that he did not slide down to what his opponents might consider as "majestice".
Climate Propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to miserable persecution, both those who view skeptically his predictions, and those who prefer other political and social combats must demonstrate solid cohesion.
Furthermore, the leader of the movement, who is the chairman of the government like Zapatero, believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and is even going to sign the "new treaty with the planet".
This proposal forces him to explain why the activities or inaccessibility of his government have contributed significantly to the failure of Spain to comply with the Kyoto Protocol in the European Union.
Who is responsible for this non-compliance, in which sectors this is happening and why his government, the government of the contract, did not stop it.
Furthermore, it makes him clearly explain to the Spanish what measures he planned to take to reduce climate change.
Which companies will be damaged, which people's habits will have to change, what energy savings, individual and collective savings, we will have to accept and what economic consequences it will have.
In other words, who sacrifices himself and who pays for saving the planet.
But we've never waited for such explanations, we can't wait.
It's just because you have to sacrifice and pay.
Action against climate change, real measures are unacceptable.
Dear, uncomfortable and threatening businesses and private accounts.
Even one cent of the gasoline price proposed by the PSOE (Spain Workshop Socialist Party), it seemed to Zapater so risky in terms of elections that he hurried to reject it.
In other words, it is to save the planet so that nothing stands for, pure propaganda, passwords missing any real meaning.
Impact phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And contracts with the planet; this gentleman is so useful for the election campaigns that he doesn't even speak, he does not blame, he requires nothing, but is a decoration of possessions and awakes him.
If it is limited to being a virtual contractual party and does not ask us to ride the bike and cold with the barbecue.
Mayor and local police chief Totany are detained for suspicion of corrupt practices in construction
As the research sources have been informed, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the city of Totan, the "human" of José Martinez Andreo, the chief of the local police, the secretary of the city and one businessman in hospitality, for suspicion of committing crimes in construction.
The mayor was arrested in his accommodation and transferred to the city, in which the premises are now located together with a number of police officers who also delivered to the Commission for the construction and the City Company for the economy with industrial lands and apartments.
These three arrests reached six last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, during the requalification operation of Vice over 2 million agricultural hectares on the ground suitable for the establishment that the Galician company Nuaria, after paying illegal fees during the last election period, could build 4,000 homes.
Furthermore, two other persons were not arrested but are accused of the shortened proceedings in the court of the first instance of the city of Totan.
Six first arrested were transferred to the court today.
According to information sources, the former mayor of Totany is investigated and today a member of the autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, the owner of the real estate office, registered today in Totan and his current friend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous area.
Manuel N.A., director and owner of the Nouaria Group, a lawyer and an entrepreneur from Viga, was arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra Province), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to that group and despite the payments were transferred.
The investigation is carried out by a group for criminal offences in the construction of the Civil Guard Operations Unit, whose members, except for arrest, also conducted an 11 reviews, mostly in companies related to arrested, with a seat in Madrid, Vigu, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid Province) and Totana.
There was only one person in Totana that was trapped in the area of a very famous company owner for the products of poultry meat that could serve as a mediator.
The Nuaria group was assigned to the position of the largest residential complex of the city of Totana, which would represent building more than 5,000 homes, golf fields and two hotels with "spa".
The company gained 2,2 million square meters of soil that were requalified and its project had to double the settlement of a community with 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group forms companies like Autes and Inomonuar, which are devoted to support the market of property, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Corunj, Venezuela and Fernando el Catolico square in Vigo, Hogartel, which is focused on promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.
And that happens.
Article 1 is replaced by the following:
If you don't mind, we'll leave the Book of the month, and we may be attacked by other appreciation and competition in the meantime.
I've got something in my head already.
Guys, life is a change.
Of course you can come with ideas.
‘Article 1
Our Finnish writer sends us this comment from yesterday's most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (in addition at the beginning of the PISA report on the education level in the world), which refers to what the newspaper printed on November 18th, the same day when the Blackburn book's criticist appeared there by the circumstances:
"The contents of the subject of philosophy broke into public discussions in connection with the tragedy in school in Jokela.
The victim killer, a high school student, quoted in his texts of Platon and Netzsche.
Peckka Elo, a philosophy council for education, requested the Helsingin Sanomat journal to take a critical view to Platon and claimed that it was not necessary to discuss Netzsche in the mandatory basic course of philosophy in high schools."
‘Article 1
One colleague informs the introduction of a crime of download from the Internet to the criminal law:
A. Downloading one song would be a criminal act with a rate of six months to one year.
On the contrary, when you disintegrate in the shop of boards in prices below 400 euros, it is considered just an offence (art. 623.1).
B. If you leave up to 1,000 euros in the store, stealing is already a criminal offence, but the penalty rate is lower than for downloading (art. 234 of the Criminal Law).
C. If you steal the car and return it after 40 hours, the criminal rate is still lower than the download (§ 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in the fights than the exchange of compacts.
Participating in excess is a rate from three months to one year (art. 154 of the Criminal Law) and would be a rate from six months to two years for exchange of compacts.
(art. 270 of the Criminal Act).
E. Sexual disturbance in employment is considered under § 184.2 of the Criminal Law as less serious than downloading a DVD film.
F. The unauthorized distribution of films protected by copyright is punished in vice penalty than the provision of pornographic materials by youth (§ 186).
So if my colleague's not wrong, someone's got a hand.
‘Article 1
My physician is stabbing me one of his articles on strange research called "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
Or the feelings caused by the monthly payments of employees depend on how much colleagues make.
The study was conducted at the Bonny University using magnetic resonance on the tomographic and results are published in the last number of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and the leader of the Group of Views of the Neuropean Constitution of Life&Brain in Germany: "The biggest activation was happening when the researcher responded correctly and his colleague was wrong."
The research workers observed that if both successful, they received the same payment, the activation was mild, but when one got a double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion requires so much science.
Prosecutors of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been prosecuted by the State Prosecutor of the Court of Justice in Hague for eight years of the Balkan War.
Her mandate expires by the end of the year and Carla will walk away with mixed feelings, because the main guilty of the massacre in Srebrenica, where 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died, former General Ratko Mladic and former leader of Bosnian Serbs Radovan Karadzic are still free.
Their names are on the list from which the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach "Carlin List" (2006, Spain, is not listed), which by the tempo of the detective thriller is watching from Belgrade to New York the work of the Swiss Prosecutor in pursuing the refugee criminals and pressure on the relevant States to drag the network.
What insurance is suitable for me?
Insurance of the car protected by the driver in the event of an accident. It is a significant cost that depends on various factors such as age, status, sex, length of the driver's license, type of vehicle to be secured or used, etc.
To have a car is just a start.
Selecting the appropriate car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to understand what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between insurance and insurance.
This commitment takes into account the form of a insurance contract which provides that the insurance undertaking will receive an agreed insurance amount at a certain level for taking account of the injury payments in case of a insurance event.
Insurance is the insurance price determined in view of different factors such as age, status, sex, length of driving licence, type of vehicle which is provided or used, etc.
Insurance companies lay down their prices on the basis of statistics, so the more likely there is a crash, the higher the insurance rate is.
For this reason, both those aged 25 and women must pay lower insurance, as statistics show that they have lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, the insurance company concluded that those living in marriage had less crashes than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of rides, thus the probability of accidents.
The increasing frequency of rides increases the probability.
There are many variables that insurers consider when they set the insurance price.
Therefore, the driver must examine the situation well to choose such insurance as the best matching his insurance profile.
We will show here the most important variables for the choice of the type of insurance, which, in addition to the insurance type, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of fifty and fifteen years face different disadvantages such as lack of experience with governance and short hold of the driver's license when they want to arrange insurance at the available price.
Although ideal for good coverage is insurance against all risks, there are even cheaper options.
The most careful drivers can choose insurance against all risks with discount to obtain insurance coverage of all risks, but at a more acceptable price.
This type of contract would assume the client's co-operation with the remuneration of the insurance event.
"The part of the insurance event provided by the client will be set forth in advance when setting the insurance price, which will be higher and less participating," Luis Noguera, head of First Europe in Spain, explains.
Another option is to extend insurance to other operating participants by ensuring the client against the damage caused by other persons, but not against the damages on his own car.
Furthermore, it would be secured against stealing, fire and vehicle loss.
Recommendation.
If you are aged twenty-five, try to be careful and avoid a crash as possible, because it will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce insurance in the future.
The bonus is the reduction of the basic rate of the insurance company.
On the contrary, Malas is an increase in the basic rates mentioned.
"Bonus and little will depend on the insurance and its profits.
If the insurance company had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus," Noguera explains.
After the border exceeding twenty-five years, the drivers have easier when they go to contract insurance, since the client's risk index is reduced, thanks to the experience that they have gained.
For this reason, it is most recommended to agree on insurance against all risks of discount.
"Young people usually can't use the experiences gained in advance at the time of the crash and even in the management," the Director of the European Company in Spain assures and adds that most of the crashes occur in the second year of the procedure when the "new fear has already been overcome."
However, if the client is married but still has no children, it is better to arrange insurance against all risks if his economic situation allows.
Insurance families are considered to be a client with the lowest risk index and thus their inputs will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be the insurance against all risks of the insurance discount (which could be 300 euros) or at a high bonus, the insurance extended to other operating participants, starting in the third year of the purchase of a vehicle.
"Their governance is more calm and their purchase is higher, so they can afford to acquire the highest discount," says Luis Noguera.
Insurance is recommended for pensioners against all risks with insurance discount (which constitutes 150 euros) or insurance extended to other operating participants if a high bonus has been achieved.
It is necessary to say that car insurance is important not only because it protects drivers in the case of a crash, but also because it represents considerable expenses, which is the right reason for proper exploration of insurance options that would be most suitable to us in view of our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get on AC Milan point that means 8-final
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their powers this Tuesday at San Siro stadium in order to obtain a point that they lack to achieve their respective objectives in the conclusion of the Champions League, as it would mean for Italy to be the first one and it would decide to be placed in Scots.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured the procedure in the fifth game in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but needs one more to make sure that the Shachtior will not get before him with six points that will play with Benfika, which is four.
These two games of group D will play a week before the sixth round ends, since AC Milan has to play in the Intercontinental cup in Japan, where the first time he comes in the semifinal, trying to move to the final that plays the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed before the others and the indecisive result on the Giuseppe Meazzy stadium seems to be the most likely, even if both men try to fight for victory, because the Italians won't want to tactate on homeland and Celtic knows that after win, he would be the first and ensure a better place in the eight-final.
The man Gordon Strachan could have enough for the process even if the Shachtior does not win, but cannot rely on it, because at the same number of nine points Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow last week (2:1) but won in the first direct fight (2:0).
So the AC Milan players will try to ruin the evening to Scots who believe that the second time they get into the semifinal in the reorganized Champions League just as they beat them in the same fight in the last competition with the goal of Kaka in prolongation (1:0) after state 0:0 in the basic playing time.
Hope to win "rossoneri" will be the Shachtior for whom it is worth winning only if Celtic loses, both for the process to the 8-final and for the EUFA.
Benfica, although it's the last one and there's no possibility to continue the highest European competition, she could win a third place by one victory, so she would play in EUFA.
The first concert in the Spice Girls tour attended 20,000 people in Vancouver
The Spice Girls group started in Vancouver (Kanada) before 20,000 viewers of their first tour since she broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sports Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver, declared that the reconnection of their groups was "crash".
About 20,000 people bought tickets so that they could be present to a concert that also included a video that lies to the history of this group that caused the sensation at the end of the 1990s.
Return and world tours are played at the same time as the new album that they are released by EMI in Spain and which brings to the choice of their main successful songs, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Vudoo".
Fifth Spice Girls appeared at the stage of decoration bracelets given to them by Posh Spice husband, British footballist David Beckham.
This sportsman was in the audience flooded by GM Place, although nervous Victoria forbidden a few days ago.
Before the start of the presentation, Victoria Beckham said about the British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous of what she thinks of the presentation."
"Sports Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "for the disputes between us" caused two years later the dissolution of the five-party group, also showed its nervousness in meeting with journalists two hours before the start of the show.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw the world's public opinion changed, the view of Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made my decision," she said to Chisholm about the reconnection of the group that she had dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that through time, "the things have come together and we all love each other very much."
But many things have changed since Spice Girls had last come out together in 1998.
So at the beginning, according to the TV, the group flew to Vancouver by Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived, the army of the babysitters expected them at the airport.
Fifth has seven kids in total.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will be presented in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
It's going to be in Madrid on December 23th.
The concerns of a new gas arguing between Russia and Ukraine
There is a dispute between Russia and Ukraine about gas prices, thus increasing the risk that Russian supply of this fuel can be affected in Western Europe.
Most Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) are conducted through Ukraine through pipes and any dispute between these two countries is closely monitored.
Kyev warned that if Moscow raises the gas prices to Ukraine, Russia will charge higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between these two last year has reduced deliveries to the EU States.
The latest dispute between Kyev and Moscow comes when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state owned the gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says that Ukraine will have to account for more, because he agreed to pay up to 50% more for gas gas that he gains from the neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its gazpro supplies.
"It is important to us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit States during the negotiations," said the Ukrainian Minister of Economy, Anatolij Kinach, to the Agency Reuters.
"The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments relating to the amount of transit fees (to Western Europe) across Ukraine."
The last larger dispute between Moscow and Kyev caused a reduction in supply from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a sharp drop in exports to Western Europe, which rapidly increased prices.
The Russian gas represents one quarter of the delivery to the European Union.
Russia has the biggest gas supplies in the world, but most of them remain insufficiently used.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supply with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian Republics.
NHS "must control foreign employees"
The supervisor said that the Scottish NHS compartment must improve the criminal records in extra-European employees.
The recommendation from the President of the Supreme Control Office Robert Black arrived after a foreign doctor acting in Scotland was connected to June attacks on the Glasgow airport.
Mr. Black is also afraid that the Scotland NHS has no idea of the quantity of the foreign staff he employs.
But his report emphasized that the other key checks took place on the sample of five health officials.
The President of the Supreme Control Office was concerned directly after the June attacks on the Glasgow Airport on personnel acquired from countries outside the European Economic Area.
The 18-year-old Bill Abdullah, Iraqi doctor in Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone hired Jeep at the main terminal door.
He was one of the three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court with a video bridge accused of connections to attempting bomb attacks in Great Britain.
The NHS Chamber is expected to verify foreign staff in terms of qualification, experience and authorization for work in Great Britain before its employment.
Although the Scotland Health Commission uses Disclosure Scotland to check the criminal registries, this agency has no power to obtain such information outside of Britain.
The report of the President of the Supreme Control Authority states, in addition to other recommendations that the Commission should lead the directives of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employees with control in several countries.
"Although we have discovered that part of the staff records contained evidence of these checks, they are not conducted regularly," the report noted.
Mr. Black said that the Scotland NHS is in many conformity with its own policy of pre-employment checks, but also added: "Our report points attention to areas where the system could be improved in order to ensure the availability of accurate information on the quantity of foreign personnel."
The President of BMA, Dr. Peter Terry, said that "very unlikely" would identify the potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-working checks in the Scotland NHS are working well and is not clear what further value these comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities announced that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, of whom the majority are doctors and sisters.
However, the President of the Supreme Control Authority noted that these numbers would also be higher because the Commission had a problem identifying personnel with a permit to stay.
The study also found that the introduced control procedures for NHS in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely implemented.
They included passport controls, work permits and qualifications.
The Switzerland Government is currently processing the policy and directive of pre-employment controls for foreign workers of NHS.
The Ministry of Health, Nicola Sturgeon, said, "I wanted to do this job immediately after the terrorist attack on the Glasgow airport."
She also added that the Scottish Government, in accordance with the health commissions, considers the recommendations of this report and ensures that the best procedures appear in the updated pre-employment control directives of all personnel - including the foreign - planned to issue the next month.
Joy Division controlled film prices
Control, a film about a dead singer Joy Division Ian Curtis, collected five prices on British Independent Film Awards, including prices for the best film.
Prices were also obtained by the Star Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse, director Anton Corbijn and the side role of Toby Kebell until the role of Curtis.
Lady Judi Dench was appointed the best actress for the Thriller Scandal Notes.
And a bond star Daniel Craig got Variety award for getting a British movie on the world scene.
Prices were feasted in London Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis's way to glory with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at 23 years of age.
This black-white film - soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was only 3 million pounds.
But he won the Dutch photographer Corbiin, known earlier by an iconic package of U2 Joshua Tree, two prices - for the best director and for the best debuting director.
Rock music was focusing on another estimated - because Julien Temple's film on a singer Clash Joe Strummer got a prize for the best document.
Viggo Mortensen won the best actress of the Russian mafian boss driver in the London Thriller David Cronenberg East Promise.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation built on the roles of hard men, won Richard Harris's price for an unusual benefit from the British movie.
This fiftieth, among whom films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another part of Indiana Jones - Kingdom crystal skull.
Winstone said he was proud of this price, named after the star of Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me," he added.
"I've had enough luck to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, the great actor of my time, I'm very honored."
Independent film prices known as Bify are granted by a jury in which filmmates, actors and festival organizers are situated.
Between the residence and bullets of Bif are Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people for terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that she arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing direct attack on oil devices, as well as spiritual and security facilities.
The state television of the biggest oil exporter reported that one of the cells wanted to put missiles into the country.
Al-Kaida sympathetics have led a campaign against monarchy, United States allies, since 2003, from invasion to Iraq.
The television report announced that an eight-militant cell led by a foreigner was planning an attack on oil equipment in the Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is building a rapid reaction unit of 35,000 members to defense the device from an unsuccessful attack of al-Kaida to the largest world factory for the processing of oil in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted the Ministry's internal statement: 18 arrests belonged to the cell led by the "expert for missiles" that slipped into the country.
She further stated that the militants planned to pass eight shots into the kingdom.
22 detainees were to prepare murders of spiritual and security workers.
The government urged spiritually to prevent Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Kaidian militants fighting alliance armies and the Shiit government supported by the United States, which the conservative Sunnity Saudis consider to be a Caesar.
Al-Kayad militants believe that the authorities have cooperated many spiritual in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
Militanti - supported by leaders of Al-Kaida Saudia Osama bin Ladina to focus on the Western Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war was a huge effort in security forces in the past... five months," state television speaker of the Ministry state said.
The 16-media cell was also arrested in Medina, which aimed at promoting "takfiry thoughts" - the ideology of the Sunnith Muslim radicals, which supports violence against Muslims referred to as unbelievers and apostasy.
Among the arrested were also 32 persons accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate in Venus may be a view to the future of the Earth
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus could once be a pleasant place for life.
Data from the circuit European station show that the planet is even more similar to its own twin of the Earth than it was thought before.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbour of the Earth.
These two worlds are approximately as large and are circulated by similar roads, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, the conditions of Venus were similar to the earth and could have been resident.
But the frightened glass effect caused by carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and lower rotation speed sent Venus to a completely different way of development.
Today, the planet is without water, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt leads and is desolated by storms and winds of hurricane power.
The findings from the European Space Agency, Venus Express, who studied the planet for one year, offer medium view of how the Earth could develop in the event of disaster climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor from the cathedral of physics of Oxford University and one of the heads of Venus Express mission said: "It's more clear why the climate on Venus is so different than on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
"Our new data allow us to build a scenario in which Venus began as well as the Earth, perhaps with the population, billions of years ago."
The police's got "booth uranium"
A pound of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was detained by the Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
The police speaker said three people were arrested and the material was investigated.
He did not confirm that it was a wealthy uranium, but he said that the substance could be sold for a million dollars (480 000 pounds).
Still incorporated
Mitt Romney said for presidential candidates, it's not worthy to answer questions from a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican presidential candidates subsequently agreed with the YouTube debate, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on the video and handed them over to the candidates.
None of the questions sent on Wednesday, November 28, was as comic as a snowman who asked democrats to warm globally in the debate of the other party on YouTube.
However, the questions and answers reflected many on the status of the Republican Party towards elections next year.
It is not clear exactly how CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, chose clips that were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour debate, the longest time devoted to one topic, was focused on immigration.
This theme is one of the strongest Republicans topics.
CNN requested a panel of undecided voters to turn around the corner when they heard something comforting: the voter noted the top of the consent when the candidates talked about hard access on the borders.
The hardest and longest exchange of views occurred between the Rudy Giuliani, the main state candidate, and Mr. Romney, who flew forward in key rapid votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to strike the reputation of a man who was like a prime minister of New York soft on an illegal immigrant.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts for hiring illegal immigrants to work at his house.
Those two struggled particularly properly when the questionnaires asked if one of the candidates would support "amnestia" (to give illegal immigrants the normal position and the possibility of citizens).
Direct candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, the California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorada, have been able to put their mill into this topic.
None of these two have a chance to be nominated, but they both remain in the game, perhaps for starting to be on the alarm for immigrants earlier and stronger than the others.
At least for immigration candidates have the same view: greater strictness on borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, along with the toys of poison from China and other concerns with the environment, helps the Republicans forget or minimise the dispute between libertines and Christian conservatives.
But the debate began to be very uncomfortable when there were other subjects.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he used to support the holding of guns in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the technique of simulated heating should be considered torture.
A questionnaire asked whether candidates believe in each word of the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani made the view that even though the Bible is his favorite book, he probably doesn’t believe literally the story of Jonah and the Whale.
Another questionnaire asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all the predictions in the recent research in Iowa due to his long-term Christian conservation - said that death penalty is uncomfortable but necessary.
Under the pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to candidate, making himself laugh.
The fight remains unusually open.
The growth of Mr. Huckabee in Iowa is covered with recent successes in gaining money and the loud joy of Ron Paul at the central debate.
These two have struck from the bottom, because both sides still cannot agree on more famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very soon and persuasively with a winning American size report on the lips, screaming on both wings of the side.
This time the side is settled and the result is far from clear.
Labourists’ pains
Gordon Brown again found a trap he could fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it is a custom in British political scandals, it is not particularly piquent.
It doesn't seem to be selling some orders, no accounts in the Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid, no extra-wife fingers have been scratched.
But a barricaded Gordon Brown would have been able to find out that a wealthy entrepreneur masked the contributions of the Labourist Party of 650 000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) under the names of other people, and that the party did not announce it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided elections and insulted British intelligence by claiming that this decision was not affected by research, there was a hope that he would ensure a resistant and effective government.
Instead of the way Mr. Brown formulated this, the more funny representative of the Liberal Democrats, the feared Mr. Brown once changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unsaved rescue of the Northern Rock problem bank showed weaknesses in management and blank judgment under fire.
Badly contemplated proposals to change the tax law linked companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people has revealed unpresenting administrative branches.
Three Generals retired the rebellion in the House of Lords; they protested against the scratches in military expenses, because they claimed that being the commander of armed forces was a partial job.
Now there are multisecond gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of Labourists (and their former guardian of internal discipline), has already resigned.
Nothing of this means Mr. Brown would go unreasonably to his end.
Despite this, governments can reach the point of closing, which they seem to be ruling difficult.
The people don't trust politicians and they don't like them, but mostly, they'll dismiss their uncertainty if the new team takes over.
When it seems clear that some prime minister is probably not going to improve anything and doesn't even have to be long in the office, this is a departure: the government's administration becomes a hole, the ministers start to do briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government becomes unconcentrated and defensive.
In one direction, Mr. Brown's position is particularly complicated, because he can't take the position of a new cough against other political leaders.
As long as he wants to get away from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and financial records are related to the decisions made by Mr Brown as Minister of Finance.
And even though he wasn't directly involved in Blair's troubles, such as a long investigation of the financing of political parties caused by "value for money", the voters can easily judge that he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's hardships are not as bad as they look.
They're not as horrible as conservatives do.
As for Mr. Bean, no one died or exposedly deceived.
And the treatment, as painful as it can be, is to provide what Mr. Brown always promised: reliable, firm and lightly brutal government.
The latest disturbance around political gifts is a good example.
Mr. Garboid Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says he did not wish for his charity any publicity.
It may be true, but it wasn't his decision.
The laws against the anonymity of great political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those who rule in the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abrahams' procedure, but he did not know that he was illegal, will certainly be questioned thoroughly; as well as Jon Mendlesohn, the main labourist searcher of money that he learned about the wretched gifts in October.
But yet Mr. Brown has not been involved; there is nothing that suggests that he knew about these tiles, even though the main part of the payments took place until his entry in June.
The Prime Minister has done half of his job for now.
He quickly condemned this violation of laws by his own party, but he decided to reach his decision by reaching an equitable instrument, the Commission for the examination of this matter, which was further led by the bishop in retirement and the judge.
In this case, lessons are not complicated.
If the law was broken, it's about the police.
Furthermore, there are other things that Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding a standing President of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has none for six months, and making a real reform of the financing of political parties.
This would require labourists who are close to cooperating with conservatives and perhaps give up their special financial relationship with commissions - bitter pills for a dedicated stranger, such as Mr. Brown.
But he should face several simple facts.
Conservatives now have a proper impact in research; he has two years to get the voters back; and the only way to win is unattachable integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Does the underlying hypothecles affect the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, naturally around them starts excited to mix backs.
Now that the American real estate market is changing, the predators focused on the credit card market there.
The Goldman Sachs analysts say that the losses on credit cards, if other options of consumer loans were infected from underline hypotheses, could reach $99 billion.
The tension signs are clear.
The number of non-payment cases (for more than 30 days delayed payment) and the cancelled accounts (the accounts that the provider considers inexpensive).
The HSBC Bank announced last month that the US consumer credit market lost $1.4 billion - also because of non-solvent loans on credit cards.
But it's too soon to panic.
The cancelled accounts and the inability to pay is still not enough.
According to Moody's evaluation agency, 3.89% of the payment failure rate in the third quarter was almost a percentage point below the average.
The deterioration rates can be partially explained by technical reasons.
The amendment to the American Privacy Bankrote Acts of 2005 resulted in a rapid reduction in the number of reported bankruptces that have made a large part of the losses on credit cards; the number of reports (and thus the number of subscriptions) would therefore increase, regardless of whether the general conditions for the borrowers had been worsened.
The branch also shows a good rate of payment, which shows how much consumers will pay monthly from their debts.
And trust in securities of secured credit cards is solid, even in spite of paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup research company predicts that the volumes of their emissions in 2007 will be 25% larger than the loans.
Direct paths to spread infections between the crisis of underlying mortgage and the credit card market are definitely available: when rental loans are drying in property, consumers are rather owed through credit cards.
However, credit cards providers rather look at cash flows than on the value of the receiving items, so the prices of household falling must not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of the borrowers.
They may even be useful for loans providers.
Consumers' motivation to pay mortgage falls when the value of their property falls below the loan value; resulting from this, the debt on cards is moved up on the list of priorities to pay.
Card issuers can also react faster and flexibly to more violent conditions than hypothecles providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid price change.
"There will not be a beautiful morning just to re-evaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, the financial manager of Capital One.
Although the risk of explosion in the style of under-line hypotheses is low, the risk of gradual weakness is far more real.
If lower house prices and debt reductions push America to the recession, the credit card sector will stand before the darkest future.
Watch the backs.
British bankers admitted guilt in the Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be judged for their roles in a fraud related to the former financial leader Enron Andrew Fastov, changed their statement on Wednesday and confessed guilt.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally guilty of seven fraud charges, when Fastov and I had to participate in the financial fraud in 2000 -- to enrich the account of their employees -- were denying.
They were supposed to stand before the court in January.
However, during the judicial proceedings before an American district judge Ewing Werlein Jr. confessed to one fraud.
The case of these three former heads of Greenwich NatWest, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, has been drawn on the front pages for the whole two years, which lasted the execution proceedings.
In the United States, their case is one of the unlocked parts of the investigation started after Enron crash in 2001.
The charges raised against them in 2002 warned Mr Fastow that it was aimed at a government investigation on Enron's crash.
The lawsuit against bankers -- who deserved the nickname "NatWest Trinity" -- claims that they came to Houstone in 2000 to establish a fraud with Fastov and his former chief director Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron's partnerial branch controlled by Fastov, which was an architect of many enrone frauds that stuck Enron after the spiral towards the release of bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank evaluated its share in this branch of zero, but our three British knew that it really was worth.
The company under Copper's control bought the bank's share in this branch for $1 million.
Incriminated bankers paid Kopper's share in this company $250,000.
According to the charge, Fastow fakely informed Enron that the energy company would pay for its share in this Greenwich NatWest branch.
Of course, 20 million of them actually went through British bankers, Fastow, and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million in charge and Fastow, Kopper and others improved about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed his guilt in two cases of conspiracy for his role in the destruction of Enron.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently in the execution of a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Copper's been executed for three years and one month in the Texarcan facility.
All three British were moving on bail on $1 million, which ordered them to stay in the United States for the coming court.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, went into bankruptcy in December 2001 after the years of accounting tricks were no longer able to hide billions of debts or to demonstrate failure speculation as profits.
The decline has cancelled thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion market value and more than $2 billion in retirement insurance.
The founder of Enron Kenneth Lay and former chief manager Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in the fall of society.
Skilling is in the performance of more than 40-year-old punishment.
The judgments on Lay for confession, fraud and other charges were deleted after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow non-powerlessness
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped by Rolls-Royce and with sufficient volume of fuel for non-stop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, begins at $54 million.
For some of the Russian wealthy, it is, of course, tiny for return.
"He can carry up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, Deputy Gulfstream.
"But none of them are interested in so many places because it's for a narrow family or a business president."
Mr. Firer was sitting at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Million Exhibition, which is a four-day orgy of show consumption in the Mummut exhibition center on the periphery of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, they built up more than 200 other luxury suppliers who hoped that the freshly rich Russians would drag on everything from the mahagon of exhaust yachts after diamonds decorated to cars that would not be ashamed of even 50 Cents.
Mr. Firer carefully looked around the clear orange Porsche in the side station.
"That's a nice car, but it's five and ten," he said.
"In the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
On the waves of oil, money is gathered in the Russian capital, just like when Dallas had his days.
"We went through the same stadium in the 1980s when some Americans grew rich and dragged to Europe, where they viewed them as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a listener of the fourth year in Davis' Center of Russian and Euro-Asian Studies in Harvard.
Like the Saudi dischargers from the 70s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians become the most prominent worldly waste.
The most exclusive luxury marks are looking for their part on this Klondike.
In other places in Moscow this week, the Luxury Industries Conference of Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the President of the LVMH Group, attracted the Conference of the Luxury Industries of the Donatella Versace, the President of the LVMH Group to exchange ideas about how to sell dear goods on the markets such as the Russian.
(The International Herald Tribune is organized by the Conference, owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has a total of $282 billion magazine of Forbes 53 billion, according to the list of the richest people.
The local main Institute for Economic and Financial Research also issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 "druge" millioners in Russia, whose property is $670 billion.
(The World Bank states that 15.8% of the Russians lived under the existing minimum in 2005.)
"There are hundreds of millionaries in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of London's jewelry David Morris.
She was in the first place, along with the Russian distributor of this mark, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfectly modified and men are all for all the sakes."
When they walked in the evening dress on Sunday night in halls, Evgenia Yumatov, and five years older Svjetlana Turovcová, and their clients were a millionaire.
"I looked at those cars, and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatov, who was screwing into a brand dress as a veteran of red carpets, next to which Joan Rivers looks like a home trip.
The Veletrh seemed to be focused primarily on fresh riches, marked Russian buyers who are willing to sit down for a few hours in road traffic so that they could walk through a warehouse that screams Cadillacy Escalade, platin fish, ice cream Mövenpick, bullet tables in peace, apartments in Dubai, screams of Gund and proof.
Members of the simple public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in what mark is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patrioticly occupied the Dutch producer of the Royal Delft porcelain before the reproduction of Rembrandt's image from manually painted blue tiles in overlife size.
"Certainly the Russians are more cute."
And indeed, these sellers say that the Russians with old money (by Russian standards they are 10 to 15 years old) have moved to a few famous marks of limited editions that would never appear in the shopping industry.
Even a few thousand people, whether millionaires, ambassadors of millions or simple tourists, swimmed a day after day.
And some of them were shopping.
The first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, stated Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil's bed, that he sold two mattress of silk, kashmir and cotton, cut by gold threads, after $70,000.
Also the first day said Mikhail Lyubimov, a sales manager of A1 Moto, which equipped high-end cars with high-end alarms that his company sold a clear orange Porsche for the Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, President of the L.A. Connection, who would like to edit the luxury cars, that he sold three nets into cars in the style of connected bracelets for Rolls-Royce Phantomy after $55,000.
He showed to the reporter the car bike designed for the Russian owner of the casino, which had an extortion of the Swarovian crystals so that it looked like rulet.
Price: $22,000 for four like that.
"That Russian millionaire who wants wheels from the stinging skin or a portrait of his wife from a cubic zircony, he still doesn't have to ride on those wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"She'll put them in his garage about 30 to 40 cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian Millioner" currently means nothing very exclusive, given a great increase in the prices of this property.
"If you bought three or four years ago in Moscow's apartment, you're probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not cash," he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend for the wealth at the stand operated by the Russian Alliance Continental, which deals with assets management.
The company raised four red phone buddys of the British style ripped columns of false banknotes worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, a marketing manager, said that his team printed 500,000 false banknotes for Veletrh millioners.
The colleagues stopped to throw around a bunch of money, or to let their friends take pictures on their mobile phones, as they rest in the middle of their replacement wealth, or just get some millions of pockets.
"You know, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey may be caused by a corrupt operation
It was a day before Thanksgiving, when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of this restaurant About something healthier and watched the ambulance that came to the white new English house of two houses below West Scott Avenue.
Soon the police patrol's car connected.
And then another.
"Then I saw the judicial doctor's van arrived," said Mr Livingston, a restaurant controller.
"In that moment I knew someone died."
The authorities found out that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, an executive assistant of the Newariian police department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether she died because of the procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide in the house of 212 on West Scott Avenue.
The officials have not yet found out what caused Miss Arroy's death, and they hope that the toxicological tests, whose results are not known, will help solve the mysterious death that, by the leadership of the Newariah police, sent a wave of sadness.
Ms. Arroy was the assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"It was loyal, embarrassed and hard worked," Mr. McCarthy said about Ms. Arroy in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She'd protect me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Ms. Arroy was a wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newarian cop who worked for the Commission to control alcoholic drinks, and that she left two sons at age 14 and 11 and her own daughter.
Eileen Walsh, speaker of the state representative of the Union, Theodora J. Romankova, said that the detectives were trying to find out if Ms. Arroy died from the consequences of an unlicensed surgery.
"It's one of the possibilities," said Miss Walsh.
"Investigation continues."
The authorities stated that they arrived home at about three o'clock after 21 p.m.
November, and they found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was declared dead at the site.
More than a week later, the authorities continued to say little about their investigation or their owner of the house, which is allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh didn't tell me if the authorities heard Ms. Caster.
The investigators are trying to determine whether the part of the house was used as office.
In Wednesday in Ms. Caster's house, with a ruined rose cream in the garden and a Dalmatin screaming back, no one answered.
By the doors that led to the basement, he troned in an open garage a blue barrel with the label "Ethyl Vanillin" - which is a substance used as a replacement of vanilla in food and cosmetic.
There were two mountain wheels on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that the first time he arrived in the New York Police Department in Newark after 25 years, Ms. Arroy offered him an invaluable help in the trial of an untolerable and severe political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'To this or this you should be careful," he said.
"She was here every time I came, and she was there every time I was leaving.
It was embarrassing."
The hope that the Fed will reduce interest rates leads to strengthening world storms
The stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday jumped after the market's hope that the Federal Bank will try to relieve the loan conditions by further reducing interest rates, were strengthened by the calming statements of the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
The storms jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the second in line behind Ben Bernank, President of the Fed, said that in response to the continuing pressure on financial markets, the managers must be "flexible and pragmatic".
In an obvious effort to calm the irritated markets in the middle of the signs of receiving credit effort, Mr. Kohn said that recent rebellions "fromally reversed some improvements in the functioning of the markets at the end of September and October".
He further stated that, if increased instability continues, the possibility that the financial conditions of household and companies will continue to be worsened.
Investors consider these statements as a signal that the Fed is ready to add to the US markets other fresh capital doses and perhaps further reductions in interest rates to stabilize credit conditions.
These notes also helped to calm Wall Street in the middle of other bad news about American economy, when the sales of apartments in October showed recorded low numbers.
The consequences of the financial verification were underlined by the notification of the Bear Stearns investment bank that it would cancel 650 jobs, which are 4% of its world labour force, in the context of reducing costs for compensation for severe losses caused by unrequired bets to provide underlying loans for residence in America.
Only 20 of these places are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the Industrial Index of Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or 2,55 per cent, and closed to 13 289,40, while the more used S&P 500 increased by 2.65 per cent.
London index FTSE 100 increased by 165,5 points, or 2.7 per cent, and closed to 6 306,2, while the value of British blue-chips increased by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6 per cent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 per cent.
Before some time, the credit tension on the markets showed full power after the auction of the three-month monetary packages of the European Central Bank was lending these funds to the European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, most since April 2001.
The pressure on the English Bank to follow the Fed and the ECB and release overstanding money on the London Money Markets has increased with the rates of three-month British inter-bank loans "Libor" from 12 November to their maximum from the end of September - 6.59 per cent.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas here, one almost as hard as the other.
Who's going to be number six on the board for England this weekend in Canda, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And in the broader context of nothing less relevant than the first test against Sri Lance, who's going to make this decision?
The second question is that David Graveney, chairman of the electoral committee, who is held on this post at least in the lending time, has Peter Moores, the chief coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with a decision to help and because the table of Hugh Morris, the chief English team manager, is starting to be filled with applications on the post of the national selector, not necessarily on full duty.
The one who will not be built in the sixth place on the tower will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sports at all.
It's not easy to find what one gets to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets over the lower level, sometimes because of the lack of happiness rather than the ability.
Not only in the cricket is the choice difficult and requires an assessment that must always be subjective.
Is it the right time to move Bopara up?
Is it fair about Shah, if so?
We could ask the same questions in other areas, let's say that here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young managers with good education and review in the field, should be promoted in the committee - the place is only for one.
Who should say what level is right for the cricketers if he can't drop or swim on the next one?
Of course, numbers have a great impact on decisions, but they have opportunities as well.
In the team, the cricketer needs to catch the captain's view at the right time, if he takes wicket, and the patch needs a regular chance at the starting positions, if he ever makes an impression as a single cricketer.
Appreciation of the electoral view is more complicated.
For example, in the last season, there were many better people, James Anderson, whose place in the first test seemed certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and thrown as a gunfire.
Anderson took 32 wickets in first grade at 33 times each.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same secret average, but they both had their moments at the highest level and hoped for the next.
If he's playing at the Asgiriya Shah stadium, or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can interrupt or end the career both, or it must not have a great impact.
Four years ago, in Sri Lance, Gareth Batty played in every Test and in the first class, he gave good performances, five wickets and 40 vacation races, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was at the same time fighting for his place, who finally became a stable Test Criquetter, which is further, although in Australia against Australia recorded twice a hundred points, perhaps still underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another debate about today's training clean on the Assyrgyya stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's more experience in front of Bopar's youth bull.
There are arguments for both of them.
For Shaha speaks his bright and valuable debut test shifts at 88 points in Bombai and 32 hundred in the first grade against the six Boparov, who, at the age of twenty-twenty years, is seven years younger and has excellent statistics against the spins.
However, Shah made two shifts in May against the Caribbean in the Test on Lord's, his homecase in Middlesex, just ten races, and that, along with the immediate refusal of the voters, when Vaughan wanted to take him back to another match, his burning seemed to have removed something from the elan that was so obvious in Bombai.
Furthermore, the esex universal has joie de vivre in bones.
At the cricket field, he has nothing to heal, and his behaviour outside the field symbolizes a recently converted car with a motion to four wheels at the exhibition day of an English team car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He exported light wounds and apparently shock, but as the first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cooke, his colleague, who watched it slowly to ask him excitedly, "Have you seen it?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, its medium-speed rapid bullets on these fields that seem to him suitable, efficiently distributing and burning self-consciously and manually.
Selecting the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is different.
Maybe it's the real art of choosing.
I'm personally standing for Bopara to get his chance now, which I don't want to say Shah won't excellent, unless, as the Seylon tea tickets suggest, it's the one who's gonna play here next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qada
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began to come to Baghdad yesterday and to blow out the fugitives with money or expired visas, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the weapons who expelled them from their homes.
Mansour's bus station was before 800 people came from Damascus in the official government convoy about a dozen buses full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors killed in Baghdad," Sabah al-Kubaisi, a sunnet doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers because of what was happening in Bagdad and how safe he is now.
"They say that Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he said, he meant the Shiitian milition of the Military Spiritual Muktada al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to stop the fight.
Casim al-Atwani, an eighty-year-old Shiit teacher from the most sunny area of Amaria, returned with his two children, because he couldn't renew Syrian visa and because the regime there did not allow Iraqi to work.
His Shiit neighbours in Amaria called him to help the local dominant with the support of the US army to push al-Qaeda from its positions in the west of the capital, and insisted on him to return.
One of the newly arrived from Jordan is the leader of the Sunny and Shiit tribe, whose home in Sleikh in northern Bagdad expelled a granate attack after he insisted on his fellow citizens to rise against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"At last night, a few friends called me and told me that they were traveling in Sleikh's milicy against al-Qada and that he needed me and my boys' support.
That's why I came back today," Sabaah, 20, Alu Obeidi.
Many talked about the attraction of calming in the capital after strengthening the US military presence and the growth of local "groups of enslaved citizens", which defend their quarters by arms.
But more talks about returning the visas and loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1,3 million Iraqi have escaped in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, an 11-year-old father of three children, expressed a loud suspicion shared among refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shiit Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to reduce the visa limits to refugees and forced them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people fled from Iraqi sectarian killers.
"All was fine before Al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving the Iraqi visas to return to Iraq," the sunnity pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
The partial reason for weakening violence is that the sunshine were expelled from the Shiit regions and on the contrary, which in many places reduces tension.
There are concerns that the sudden influx of refugees regains the sectary tension and leads to another fight.
Little Sara, good education
The smallest common country of Germany plays the leadership in professional education, even excels international focusing on its high schools.
Only in one educational area, Sara is concerned about the same lack as the rest of Germany.
"The man who doesn't come from Saraya, I explained yesterday after 50th that we were not French" -- this self-ironical password in Saraya appears at the posters at the 50th anniversary's birthday of this smallest common country.
However, France and Luxembourg play in the Sara's education system, which is a great role in monitoring the education of the Colin Institute for Economic Research (IW) in the fifth place.
High schools have already traditionally cooperated closely with surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 in France.
To date, students can end the study with a double or even three - degree diploma.
Which corresponds to the properly high share of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
In fact, the high school of Sara’s children is accepted by the over-proportionate number - many of them even without a high school.
"Axel Plünnecke, educational expert IW, is used in Sarask.
By having more than every fifth youth has the right to study at a professional school, Sara is more than 7% above the German average.
In comparison with the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Saraya to combine practical and academic education.
The possibility of studying two barriers, given the number of inhabitants of the second is the best in Germany.
Despite practically oriented education and rising demands, the number of graduates of a third-third engineering graduates declined in the past years.
Therefore, Sara's Ministry of Education has now commanded high schools to create a campaign for promoting engineering.
"After the first study of Pis we conducted several reforms in universal educational schools," the speaker of the Ministry of Education said.
The government therefore conducted comparison tests throughout Germany.
In order to begin learning as soon as possible, the last year of mother school is free - a model that takes over other common countries.
If the results of the students are significantly improved, they will show until the future comparison study.
During the 2003 study, the risk students decreased from 29 to 20 %.
However, Sara has not improved as much as other common countries.
Bavori can count better.
And to disappoint Sara, the studies of Pisa do not compare the knowledge of foreign languages -- otherwise, Sara could score in this area.
The language of the neighbours is obliged in high schools - even though the inhabitants of Saraja are not French.
The trailing moves the hours
Whatever they see will go to Venezuela lessons differently than in the rest of the world.
December 9th will let President Hugo Chavez move the hours in this South America country half an hour ago.
In Spain, in the meantime, Chaveza becomes a funny figure.
The Official Journal of Venezuely informed that the hours, according to the new law against the world’s time, would move about four and a half hours.
The South America state will be this step in the time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
The barrier, the enemy of the United States, has reasoned his decision, inter alia, by the fact that the United States of the world has forced the time zones to be divided over hours.
In the middle of the local time, Chavez also announced that the hostage cause is interrupting relations with neighbouring Colombia.
This left nationalist stated that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe is President of Colombia, he will not have any relations with him or the Colombian government.
"I can't do it because of my self-respect," said Chavez, promoting the reform of the constitution, which citizens of this oil country must vote in the Sunday referendum.
With this reform, Chavez would greatly strengthen his power in the country.
A quarrel was caused by Uribe's decision to withdraw Chavez's commission to negotiate in Colombia with marxist rebels on the release of hostages.
Uribe, by his decision, Venezuela "spit in his face", criticised Uribe Chavez on Sunday.
In Spain, everyone also talks about Chavez.
The new mobile call here has caused a disturbance: "Por qué no te callas" (Why aren't you quiet?) - that sounds like a sentence that has been downloaded from the Internet for more than half a million people.
It was expressed by the Spanish King Juan Carlos, who was so angry at the recent ibero-American summit of the loud notes of this left populist.
The Germans are threatened by lower payments in 2007
According to the prognosis, German employees are threatened to reduce real remuneration even through a strong conjuncture.
The experts have reasoned their pessimistic forecasts for a number of reasons.
According to the estimates of Hans Böckler's Fundation, employees can rely on a lower remuneration than last year.
"The guilt is a small increase in payments, increase in tax from added value and increase in food and energy prices," said Billd Gustav Horn from the research institute IMK (Institution für Makroökonomia und Konjunkturforschung).
The new burdens for employees may also wait in the field of unemployment insurance.
The Minister of Finance, Peer Steinbrück, told Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung, said that the new year planned reduction of insurance contributions to unemployment to 3.3% is proper and reasonable.
However, the Social Employment Agency should no longer be able to fall into such difficulties in order to require loans or contributions from the common youth, quote the newspapers of this socially democratic policy.
On Tuesday, it was published that the price explosion of food and oil products has expelled inflation on its highest condition in the last 13 years.
In the annual comparison, the prices totally increased by three per cent.
Venus is a hell's twin of the Earth
Despite its life's enemy atmosphere, Venus Earth is more similar than it was ever expected. The European cosmic sonda Venus Express on Venus has recorded phenomenons that also appear on Earth in the winter: lightnings in the atmosphere and wind faiths on the fields.
Almost three decades of scientists have known that Venus is shining.
Now the European Venus Express sonda has brought evidence - captured electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus flying lightnings from cloud to cloud at approximately 56 miles [56 km], he wrote in a scientific magazine of Nature Christopher Russell from California University in Los Angeles.
According to the famous theory of the origin of original material, the world could have produced life by lightnings. The storms reportedly caused reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, basic stones of life.
There was no way on Venus, "If there was ever life there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, atmosphera is approximately a hundred times thicker than on Earth and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 °C.
"Although the venus may be the hell twin of the Earth, but it's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so much like the Earth and the size, began to develop completely differently, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
Since no sonda has been sent exclusively for Venus's study since the beginning of the 1990s, the launch of Venus Express in November 2005 was a million in the research of this planet.
According to scientists, the latest results of research that approached several articles of Nature did not emphasize only the uniqueness of Venus in the sun system.
"They also showed that our neighbouring planet is more like the Earth than it was expected before," said Esa.
In addition to the already known windwires in the northern field, scientists found a dark faith in the southern field, which turns significantly faster.
This phenomenon reminds the air streams of the Earth's northern hemisphere, says the research team under the leadership of Guiseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute Di Astrophisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second inner planet of our solar system forms almost the same material as the Earth and with the average of 12,100 km is almost the same size.
This planet is called Jutrenka or Summer will surround the sun in almost 225 days.
But it turns much slower around its own axis. One day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus’s surface temperature of 460 °C and the pressure of 92 bars of the Earth is not reminded, scientists come from both planets in a very similar condition.
The water was accumulated, but the earth remained in the oceans, while Venus had emerged into the universe.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is tied in carbonates on Earth, Venus forms most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalaylam
The Communist President Köhler requests the closure of side disputes for the adoption of the Dalaylam at the Office of the Office.
He did not directly criticize the SPD for her attacks on the Chancellor after a meeting in September.
Communist President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and calls on a great coalition to end the arguing about the adoption of the Dalailama.
"We shouldn't be presented outside as a nation that is not united in this matter," said Köhler to the economic papers Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed understanding for the decision of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to accept the Dalaylam in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me," said Köhler.
The Social President stressed that everyone knew that Germany had to maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but it did not prevent the Merkels from stopping when she was qualified to create a new policy against China.
"The Joint Officer did not release the traditional policy of united China.
China also knows that," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) made an indiscretion of his disagreement with the acceptance of the Dalaylama, and he was attacked by a series of coalitions.
Steinmeier complained, inter alia, about the "present" foreign coalition policy.
Following the adoption, the German-Chinese relations have worsened.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to the SPIEGEL magazine also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of Foreign Ministers of the Both Countries.
The Chinese President of the government, Wen Jiabao, invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that the adoption of the Dalaylam was a mistake.
China disagrees when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan Spiritual Leader, the Wen Jiabao emphasized the position of China.
The words and acts of the Dalaylame showed that Tibet and other Tibet regions, which are also located in China, are trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns about similar anxieties that have emerged in France
The street battles with the police, the shootings, the burned cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns about similar anxieties that exploded in France.
We have to do everything to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not grow in violence on the street, calls the General Minister of Interior.
The barricades burned, the bullets fired in the police. After serious youth disturbances in France, the General Minister of Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar development in Germany.
"We must ensure that we also do not create such social tension that will break in violence.
We must take this seriously," said Neue Press in the Hannover newspaper.
Not every young man has been able to deal with the rapid change of social fact.
The public government, the country and the community are already working hard on removal of problems, said Schäuble.
Which does not mean only integration of migrants.
"From the summit on integration after the Islam Conference, we record the first success."
However, security is still in place.
Schäuble pointed at the same time that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable with those French.
In the past night, youths with police in the northern suburbs of Paris had a hard street fight.
Even in Toulouse, cars and public buildings burned.
The greater integration efforts of the German government demanded the Turkish municipality chair in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Given the anxiety in France, he warned Kolat from the "imitation effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, it should be done.
The colat pointed out that among people under 25 years of age, migrants' families, the unemployment rate is "uppermost high".
In particular, it is necessary to ensure greater number of study opportunities.
The wheel emphasized, "We must give youth hope."
However, the President of the Turkish Municipality added that in Germany, unlike France, there is greater social control of families.
Furthermore, many migrant youth families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
He said, "But we have to be careful."
We need to "swiftly allow the youths to work and learn."
Meanwhile, the night remained in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, mostly calm.
There were hundreds of cops in the position and the helicopter flyed over the area with lights.
The authorized authorities reported three arrests and several burned waste baskets and cars.
Since yesterday, some 1,000 regular forces have taken care of peace.
The police will interfere as long as it takes, announced after the suburb visit to the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie.
There were some 80 cops in the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel injured on Tuesday.
The next night, the troubles of Toulouse.
The mess caused a Sunday car accident in which two youths lost their life.
According to the initial findings of State representation, the police are not guilty of the deaths of the youths.
In Angela's Empire "Clouds"
The Chancellor's reality's remote output documents that the coalition is programming at the end and that we cannot expect anything more from it.
In what country does this candidate live?
After her uncomfortable, indiscibly sounding and contently poor appearance on the General Discussion of the General Federation, we must establish: not here - not in this country that it should finally manage.
To regret being too focused on foreign policy, Angela Merkel once answered a very arrogant sentence.
It's provincial, she said, showing that she didn't want to understand what the critics were about.
In the Communities, she obviously showed how much she deserves to be pity.
From Merkel, it was not even a real interest, but the feeling of problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Cloud" was presented: a politics that emerges over the others, running into foreign policy, and there is only a misty expression.
For example, climate protection: without delay praise for the conclusions of the summit in Heiligendam, but it does not say how the climate goals to be achieved in Germany.
And at all, such an appreciation - so much insomnia would have forgiven the President of the CDU two years ago.
Now it is limited to a plane phrase that could increase her love among people.
With this approach, it damages its image of pragmatic, which does not need lying because the problems are solved.
But in Angela's empire, "Clouds"'s internal political problems are a border matter.
Children's poverty and concerns of people with low remuneration?
She's got a few side sentences to these subjects.
It is noted how often Merkels are talking about children's additives.
The Merkel must start from the beginning three times to make it possible to say at least partly the right sentence.
As soon as things start to be very concrete, it's as confused as in a completely foreign territory.
Division of Attack
The debate of the Republican presidential candidates on Youtube has been deployed in a rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney's favorite discussion -- and both must now be afraid of an outside candidate.
The tension of both candidates is already on the first subject.
Mitt Romney puts his rival, Rudy Guiliani, into a "host for illegal immigrants" from New York.
Giuliani quickly responds to the sharp regrets: "I believe that his own house was just one of these shelters," he answers and prelies to the former governor Massachusetts that he had privately employed immigrants without evidence.
The candidates are attacked. Since the Republican base has no clear favor, eight presidential candidates use these debates on CNN mainly to discredit their rivals.
Half-minute, online users filmed and through Youtube, sent videos serve only as such helps for a key theme.
"We have just made Hitler take power from this isolation policy," John McCain forsakes his rival, Ron Paul, who is the only one who initiates the immediate withdrawal of armies from Iraq.
The Vietnamese veteran McCain does not save his regrets or Romney for refusing to condemn the torture method of interrogation called "Waterboarding", in which heating is simulated.
The reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg show that neither war in Iraq nor the method of torture belongs to the important themes of the campaign.
The population is accompanied by an applause whenever conservative values are approved and rejected by future tax increases.
So it turns out where weaknesses are both of the favorites.
"I was wrong at that time," she explained frankly to Romney and asked the website base and the television audience to forgive for being a constituent for the abortion in 1994.
Giuliani is disappointed when it expresses its literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharaf rules in civilian for the first time
The day after he resigned from the position of the Chief Commander of the Army, the Pakistanian ruler Musharaf made a presidential oath.
It ends with eight years of military government in Pakistan.
President of Pakistan, Parvis Musharaf, made a presidential oath on Thursday and remained in the presidential office for another five years.
The Pakistan TV transmitted a live ceremony held in the presidential palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharaf swore that he would honor the constitution and strive for the welfare of the nation.
In the middle, he handed over his top commander's office to his trustee, Ashfaq, Kiyani, by using international pressure, especially by the United States.
Eight years after he took power in an unblooded military turn, the former general rules for the first time as a civil head of the state.
By withdrawing from the position of the top commander of armed forces, Musharaf fulfilled one of the main requirements of opposition and West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the exceptional status that Musharaf announced on 3 November.
According to the Supreme State Representative Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharaf will cancel the exceptional status soon after its oath, and will fulfil the requirements of the West.
The Supreme Court of the County, which Musharaf, after announcement of the exceptional status at the beginning of November, accompanied his convicted lawyers, rejected all objections of the controversial re-election of the head of the State of October 6th.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed during the attack on the military convoy in the tribe area of North Vaziristan and four others were injured.
The speaker of the army said the bomb exploded on the road near the border with Afghanistan.
Father's Krautrock is returning
The famous German group of the 1970s plays again. Three members of the Harmonia Group regained their electronic synthesizers at the concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live 1974, a cut from the most successful band period.
They've already been much more familiar in abroad.
The announced sensation is then in the appearance of three settled gentlemen who appear at the beginning as if they were just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables, and mostly buttons.
Thirty-sixteen-year-old Dieter Moebius sits in a snow-white shirt in the middle.
There's a seventeenth-year-old Michael Rother who has a laptop and a guitar before him.
Thirty-seventeen-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who is focused on synthesizers, is from the view of the viewers on the right.
Everyone contributes to sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, unexpectedly, there is a traditional song.
Looks like the musicians don't mind too much.
Among the lovers of Krautrock, the revial of the Harmonia band has caused a significant disturbance.
One thing here is worth noting, the repeated questions showed that this name is part of the collective awareness of the pope, but it is definitely not enough to miss this band for twenty-three years.
But why could the German not celebrate his still alive legends from the 1970s?
And especially when the musical style, the wrongly called Krautrock, in England and in America, is more valuable than in their own country.
When in 2003 the musical business gave the rest of the Colin group the price of Echo for life work, the hall was full of questionable views of German pop fans.
In addition, when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu for their speech, the surprise of the viewers had no longer known the borders.
Michael Rother later sat with them at the Red Hot Chili Peppers as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worship in abroad is one thing.
Reminding Harmonia's band, we overcome the memory, this trio existed only for two years, and even at that time there was no influence that others later had.
Moebius and Roedelius played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promised name Cluster before.
They played at the basement of the Berlín theatre Schaubuhne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for the gramophone company led by the church.
Rother shortly helped with the Kraftwerk group, but his reputation was even as guitarist in the Neu band!, who may have been the most radical German group at that time.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of the Cluster band to exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Old Weserhoff, the 16th century ruin, they lived as members of the community who fled the city.
They didn't live here as ideologically as in the community I, where Roedelius was still allowed to be a nanny.
It was rather life in such a spitewego artistic being.
The name for the art is reportedly derived from the name of the Harmonia Ottenstein Singing Assembly, whose badge was reportedly found in the trash.
She kept many of that Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music from Harmonia" and the next "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so quiet and modest, the band suffered from financial difficulties.
Collecting rash was not just a self-recognition.
The CD "Live 1974" now said at the Griesem concert was cut before a recorded little, barely fifty-dimensional round.
Rothera then expressed his wish for members of Harmonia to exert and exercise occasionally.
For Roedlio and Moebia, it was an absolutely inappropriate requirement.
In 1975, the band announced its breakdown.
Rother ended up in an esoterical sphere and secured his future with an album "Free Heart".
The band of Cluster relived in the '80s and has been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
For the live album from Griessemer, we can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His recording company Grönland took a goal of Krautrock to guard as the original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was considered Roedeli's salt work at that time.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia will take place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The performance within the Voldtronics festival will be publicly sponsored.
The British, Julian Cope, the old pancake, and the author of the Crautrock Sampler manual.
The founder of Love Parade will also attend, Dr. Motte.
This planned a total broadcast of the Krautrock impact on the future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group is filled with Harmonia.
Bryan Ene's branches accompanied by the most amazing sounds are raised in the room: "Single real music, it belongs to the future."
There are pictures on which the manufacturer with Harmonia is in the agricultural session.
The creation of legend also contributes to demonstrating other black-white photographs, on which a set of devices are wildly connected cables.
Before that, the three veterans were re-employed with improvization.
Not by sticking microphones to the bargains and drums, so that the tools can get out of those unheardly self-producated tones.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the technique of disturbance to the dottich.
There's no change in the congregation of the House of World Cultures.
Under the leadership of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under sound clouds and in a beautiful place she sings emphaticly "Aaaaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock was always a very English concept.
It's never been about rock.
We would find roots rather than in blues in musical high schools (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in escape from art and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who screams "'68!" is not that far from the truth, but Harmonia won't even let her out of peace now.
Even the most apparently, the scene is carefully reflected.
Where does music start and when end?
This question of a person will either lose his nerves or he will experience the mitigating moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough.
With the films The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films of war on the Balkans appeared immediately.
But none of them are convincing.
The film proposal either puts too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too touching.
The Hunting Party won't stop that one of the actors like Richard Gere.
Good news first: War criminals Karadzid and Youthic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but right there, in the dark territory of the Bosnian War, the actress Richard Gere is octed.
Lately, we lost this most beautiful man in the 1980s, not only because he played in many loving, unacceptable roles in comfortable women's movies, but in connection with his press conferences forever on the subject of Buddhism, they taste the next movie with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for seeing the Hunting Party - Where the hunter becomes a bounty (Why must film names have been so long and embarrassed today?).
Gere gives a magic performance. His war reporter Simon Hunt is essentially what Gere could be if fate and film businesses were not so mercyful: a man who has his best years behind him, but as a troske like a monument still keeps a certain remarkable reward.
But in spite of this trumpf, the Hunting Party is along with the German Mörderischer Frieden film, who also enters the movies this week, just by continuing an infinite series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
With Mörderischer Frieden film, we can do a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who will save the Serbian girl from the Kosovo shooter, and one of them will fall in love with it.
Although it is praiseful that the Serbs are not represented here as the cause of all evil, this television tiles film is changed too soon in shooting and action.
From the movie, there's something like Cobru 11, even without a road, but for the war.
In the The Hunting Party film, you can exposedly examine why the Balkan War has not yet been able to film a really good movie.
The story of three American war reporters who appear to be a "liss", Serbian top war criminal, would, at the other time and under the leadership of another director and scenario (here is Richard Shepard) perhaps become a new "Apocalypse".
For both stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go to the woods to do something that the army is unable to do, but their way becomes a way to madness.
One of the reasons for failure in the The Hunting Party's film is that Simon Hunt isn't the one who's failing and sentimental cynic presented at the beginning.
On the contrary, his proposal will prescribe a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The The Hunting Party's film can be finalized after the reporters in the last five accelerate minutes of the film will lead to what NATO, the ClA and all the hunters of the world's criminals have failed in the past five years: to catch the criminals and leave him a fair vengeance of the Bosnian Muslims.
It's so against the logic of film creation that it would be worth turning to the International Court in Hague.
This film has a deep human message.
It condemns that Karadzić and Mladić are still free, and suspects Americans and French (here are extremely united) that, based on secret political agreements, the persecution is not committed intensely.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, the woman attacks the famous poem of Brecht.
It's about the wooden mask of the Asian demon on the writer's desk, "I look with sympathy on my head, noting: how hard it is to be evil."
In movies like the The Hunting Party, they perform exactly the kind of boiled heads that suggest how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not only limited to the theme of the Balkans war.
Recently in these newspapers, all Hollywood movies about Iraq were great failures.
It can be added only: No good film on South Africa has ever been filmed.
It's almost always true: When the star sweeps in the crisis area or walks through the mine field, there will be a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, the Border of breaking with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCapri.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
Finally, the Hollywood film about the Holocaust - Schindler's list must have run for decades of years.
Many films must obviously grow up - films that today are considered to be classic Vietnamese works - "The hunter of deers", "Apocalypse" or "Fiel vest" - were not celebrated at any time as championships.
But perhaps today, when every mass killing at home immediately appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
The scriptists then have no ability to tell good stories.
"Bying or not" or "The Great Dictator" have become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin have not known how a terrible way the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you can't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe he has to create a sarkasticly measured artistic view as a romantic writer Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was asked for a parallel between his historic romance "Lemprirus dictionary" and "Balcan war", he said, "Slike only is that some things are never changed.
The greatests will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way and will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust criticizes the renouncement of the Olympiade
The withdrawal of Mayor from the summer Olympic Games in Hamburg has encountered a strong criticism of politics and economics.
Many want to continue fighting for the layout of games on the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the estimate of chances.
The head of the business chamber in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday referred to this decision as "in terms of business as unhappy".
No other project has recently awakened in the city such a great motivation as the Olympic thought.
"With this goal, this sportsly political excitement would not be possible to keep it so high."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury this project, but created a new long-term concept for him, "which comes from a modified time plan."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with his previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambition of Hamburg is at least unrealistic until 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Alliance will decide on the Olympic candidacy," von Beust told WELT ONLINE newspapers.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December the Sports Union would decide on Mnichov's candidature for winter games in 2018.
"This preference for us means that with the 2028 time plan, we have no realistic chance."
Still, this dream is not over, said von Beust.
The Hamburg sports union (HSB) marked von Beust's statements as regrettable.
It is impressive that Hamburk does not want to leave the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
"It's too soon to ruin the chance by considering plans already in this early stage as buried," President HSB, Günter Ploss, said on Wednesday.
Renouncement would be in contrast with the statement of the head of the Senate, which he made at the valuable crowd of the General German High School sports union.
Von Beust here candidate Hamburg for the University in 2015 as a replacement for the conduct of Olympic Games.
The Hamburk High School sports union has only been nominated for a candidate city in the last week.
The SPD fraction in the Hamburg Parliament stated that it was wasting a valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"Klein Grasbrook's execution was hampered for years because he betted on the management of the Olympiade and the building of apartments," SPD Carol Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the area of Klein Grasbrook was still planning the olympics with the whole area to be used later for housing purposes, the CDU was unanimously putting on "olympical factor".
Caring for the summer Olympic Game in 2012 has excited his time in Hamburg.
But Hamburg lost in Libya.
It's not Warhol's boxes.
The one who connects the expressions of Sweden and wooden boxes doesn't think of Andy Warhol, but Ikea.
Or did you?
The wooden boxes currently made in Sweden are thrown into the list of Warhol's works of dark shadows.
Most of his on the list of those ninety-four "Brillo boxes" type Stockholm are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" several months ago expressed doubts about the rightness of Warhol's "Brillo boxes" of 1968, the internal research of the Museum of Moderna Museet in Stockholm came with the result of disappointment; six "Brillo boxes", which in 1995, the Museum of Moderna Museet devoted to the gift of his former Director Pontus Hulten, are copies - as most of the other "Brillo boxes" types of Stockholm, which are on the international art market in the circulation.
Preceding events are a embarrassing chain of artistic and curatorial actions.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painted wooden boxes that were based on red-blue paper boxes of powder Brillo.
The exhibition of his works in Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes from the carton. These did not come from Warhol for financial reasons, but were supplied directly from the Brillo factory.
It wasn't about artwork, it was their proposals, just exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently gave in 1968 a permit to produce a few wooden Brillo beden in Sweden, but they were not exhibited in Moderna Museet.
The Witness is now talking about 15 boxes that were rightly entering the art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warholy Brillo Boxy" with the label Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for over $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary Director of the Pontus Hulten Museum later falsely claimed that in 1968, in Sweden, it was made and exposed to approximately 100 beaches that Warhol then left him.
In fact, 105 Hulten beddings were made in Malmö for the exhibition in Petrohrad just in 1990.
At that time Warhol was three years after death.
Lars Byström, the top conservator of Moderna Museet, examined in addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their slipperboards were ripped with the basic color and scratched, they were brushed with a brush of oil white color.
On the contrary, the 1990 copies showed that the color was put on a painting role directly on the slideboard - and not on acryle and not on oil.
"Those boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official papers of Brillo boxes," said director Modern Museet, Lars Nitwa: "If Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to classify six bedens of its exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copy".
In July, the Authentication Board has announced that these "free charges" which have been raised in the case of a sauce-powder box will be dealt with.
But the organization is still being silent.
Rebel soldiers in Manile give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who embarked at a hotel in Manile and demanded resignation from President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The leader of the rebels, Antonio Trillanes, who called for the president's manipulation and corruption at elections, told the reporters in the hotel that he refused to be responsible for bloodshed.
The soldiers of devotion to the government attacked earlier with tear gas at the hotel.
A few hours ago, about two dozen soldiers have ripped up in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were standing before the court due to a ruined attempt to turn in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used his action to escape with his 30 sympathy.
The military police who were supposed to watch him, obviously ran into his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The governments of loyal units have closed the area around the chosen hotel.
The president called for an emergency session of the security office.
The National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned soldiers' acts.
"The people have had enough of it," said Triallnes.
"We invite people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite unit Scout Rangers, said that other military units will join the march in a short time.
The government's critics called for a great demonstration against the president on Friday.
Her government has been corrupted for months.
In 2003, the Manil Finance Area has become the main scene of the rebellion of about 200 soldiers against Arroy.
Because the army refused to join the rebels, the rebellion was lost in less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, at least seven times in the Philippines, they have tried to dismiss democraticly chosen government.
United Internet becomes the majority shareholder of Versatel
The United Internet provided more than 20 per cent of its share in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The subject on Wednesday announced that the average price for the stock is EUR 14.46.
It is said that the company now owns 20.05 % of the basic share capital.
There was speculation about taking over before.
The company is still counting on the possibility of a further increase in its share in Versatel.
The United Internet announced that this step is trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.

In order to take over the Competitive Competition company Freenet, the companies established a joint SME company together.
The United Internet announced on Thursday that both companies in Freenet are currently satisfied with a share of more than 10% and will not benefit from their right to take over another 18,49 % of the company.
It is considered that companies are still keeping open every option, especially the possibility to further increase their share in Freenet AG.
The interviews between the United Internet and Freenet on strategic partnership were closed in mid- November.
This lasting and difficult transparency game on Freenet has been part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
