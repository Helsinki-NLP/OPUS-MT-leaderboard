The social map of the inhabitant of the Ivanov area is recognized as an electronic payment.
Changes provide for the preservation of benefits for travel in public passenger transport.
Since 24 September, the order of civilians has changed with the use of the social map of the inhabitant of the Ivanov area.
According to the press service, the Government of the Russian Government on the Ivanov area, changes provide for the relief of travel in public passenger transport and provide a scheme of social map intercounts in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 of the FZ “O the National Payment System”.
The social map of the inhabitant of the Ivanov area is recognized as an electronic payment.
Consequently, the conditions of its application are changing.
Thus, the completion limit is now set not in travels as before, but in the amount of money, with winter and summer periods - not more than 400 rubles, not more than 800 rubles per month in the summer period.
The social cards issued in the transport will now need to be monitored not the number of other travels, but the remainder of the money.
The value of an ease travel for the citizens will be 1/2 of the carrier's tariff.
The remaining half of the cost of the travel is compensated for the area budget.
The timetable of the social card is remaining in the previous period from 24 numbers of previous month to 23 current month.
The new order for the social map will have a number of advantages.
Thus, a detailed account of the expense of money on the social map is available with precise precision to the coin.
Furthermore, the possibility of reimbursement of the calculated but unencumbered monetary funds is available.
In addition, a transparency scheme with carriers has become transparent, as the citizen is now paying half the cost of the travel, and the same amount reimburses the budgeting carrier.
No commission will be taken on the map of money.
Instead, Vasili Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Road and Transport, reported that more than 33 million travels in the region had been carried out in 2015, nearly 25 million travels in the region.
Over 470 million rubbers are provided for the area budget for the facilitation of civilians with the use of the social map.
As at 1 September, the reimbursement amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During the 911 call, the teacher is admitted to the murder of a friend
During the 911 call, almost without trembling, Shannon Lamb told the police that he shot his friend and that he needed employees to come home.
Lamb emphasized that there was a dog in the house who was alive but probably upset, and said that the contacts of the dead family could be found in her phone.
Inside the house, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note notably written from hand on a white leather paper: "I wish I could bring it back, I loved Amy, and she was the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, according to the representatives of the bodies signed by Lamb.
Nothing pointed out that Lamb, who had two online courses at the Delta University of Cleveland, Mississippi, had been able to travel 300 miles away at the university campus, where he believed he shot all the respected teacher of history of Ethan Schmidt at the threshold of his office.
The Chief of Police of the University of Delta Linn Buford reported that the university staff had learned about the shooting at 10:18 p.m.
He reported that Lamb made that real call at 911 shortly after that.
At the end of the day of the victims, Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The next day, after the shooting in the school office forced students and teachers to hide behind the locked doors, the organ staff were still trying to put the Lamba motives in one picture.
Information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him helped draw up a talented portrait, but perhaps an concerned teacher.
Students told them they were looking forward to his work.
Police in Gothia, where Prentiss died, reported that he had no charges for violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in his written book, in which he expressed appreciation for the “beautiful people” with whom he intersected in his teaching life.
They both taught at the Social Sciences and History Faculty of 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for the arising of problems.
One student who spoke well about Lamba, Brandon Bivers, said that he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, told him that Lamb told him how he fought stress at the end of the year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta University to give him a sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
This year he had only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university rules for employment mean that the degree of a doctor who was so urged to receive Lamb would not guarantee him the automatic receipt of the teacher's post.
The President of the University William Laforge told him that he had nothing to know about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course Mr. Lamb had something in mind."
These are questions Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
The police attacked Lamb after his escape from campus when he was going back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb was shot from a rear-loaded gun 38 calibers at the back of the house, a mile south of his parents' house in Greenville, Mississippi, reported the coroner of the Washington County, Metel Johnson.
His engine car was still on the roadway.
Immediately, Lamb came to this house, although according to Johnson, she believed that he knew the people living in it.
Lamb grew up in those lands.
Lamb began to work at a university with 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and education.
He received a doctor of the educational science in the spring of the same year.
One of the old friends of Lamba described him as a smart, charismatic and joyful man.
Carla Heirston told her she was 15, and Lambu was 20 when they met through common friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool older guy who's been trying to teach her to play a guitar for years.
In those years, he had a success in women.
All the girls were sneaking when he was around," says Heirston, who is now 40 and lives in Jackson, the Brendon City.
Lamb and Prentiss were probably meeting for a while.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the record of the registration of their marriage is not available.
The couple had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in Gothia in a circuit house, a reverse side of which went to the channel.
According to the police, the dog is fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Sean O'Stin, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends, and they had a daughter now 19 years old.
"She's completely depressed," said O'Stin about the daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't see Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played bluz.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were both at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at the concerts.
O'Stin told me his daughter was writing music and singing.
Prentis was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Schaffer, bartender, and jointly coordinator of entertainment programs in the The Julep Room in the suburb of Gottie, said that the last time he saw Lamba and Prentiss on 5 September, when Lamb ended playing guitar and lipshot for a few visitors.
Nothing suspicious was seen.
"It's just a happy couple," he said.
We had fun and joking each other.
I mean, they were both very clever.
Schmidt, a deceased teacher, had workshops for first-class and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial America," said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher in the same educational establishment.
He was married and he had three little children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of the student brotherhood and the student self-government.
At the University of Delta in Cleveland on Tuesday, about 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and members of the community, participated in the memorial ceremony of candle firing.
Schmidt Liz's wife and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a ceremony during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The classes will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to bring back our students," said Laforge.
Crisis passed.
It's the day of healing.
Amy and Rohelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped the authors of Associated Press Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with the police ' s statement that Lamba's call had entered 911 after Schmidt's murder and that, although Lamb had spoken of Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire less staff for the holiday season
Toys R Us reports that it will not hire as many staff for the holiday season as last year, while the toys and goods for children are assured that it will give the staff and temporary staff more than hours to work.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40,000 people for work in shops and on public bases across the country, that less than 45,000 were hired for the holiday season 2014.
Most jobs will be partially employed.
The company reported that it would start interviews with the claimants this month and increase staff from October to December.
Although until the holidays, the buying season is closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff in order to have enough states in shops and on sales, shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about meeting with Princess Diana.
The Prime Minister of the "Return to the Future" was a great event for Michael J. Fox.
It was also noted for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the movie and waiting for the arrivals of the royal family, and I noticed that the place near me was free, and I was in the fall - next to me, Princess Diana is going to sit next to me," he said in the trailer for the soon-oriented documentary film "Return in time."
The movie starts, and I think I'm literally on the distance of my hand and in one false bunch of a date with Princess of Welsh.
"Return in Time" -- a documentary film on "Return to the Future" includes an interview with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zekes and executive producer Steven Spilberg.
The Prime Minister of the "Return to the Future" film was held 30 years ago.
"For me," said Spielberg, "that is, certainly, the greatest movie of travel in time that has ever been taken off."
Back in Time will be available on VOD, DVD and in some movies in October.
UN head states that there is no military decision in Syria
The Secretary-General Pan Gi Moon reiterates the support of the Russian military support of Syria that there is no " military solution" for almost five years, and the increase in arms will only reduce violence and suffering for millions of people.
The head of the United Nations again called upon all participants, including the divided Security Council, to join and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Mr. Gi Moon stated at the press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with the Foreign Ministers of the Five Permanent Members of the United States Council, Russia, China, Great Britain and France during the ministerial session of the General Assembly in this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the disagreements in the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, had " made the situation unsolved".
Mr. Gi Moon called on five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they demonstrated when dealing with the nuclear programme on Iran and in the consideration of the Syrian crisis.
8 results of the survey showing that Donald Tramp is not kidding.
Some tried to put the provocation mark on it.
Others got away from him, seeing it as a joke.
And some need scandal.
However, as some republicans are trying to disturb the high position of Donald Tramp as a result of surveys, they have failed (bye).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have demonstrated the advantage of Donald Tramp in bi-digits, and some begin to ask seriously what this means for a real estate magnet from the perspective of getting nomination.
Of course, it's just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Tramp has a chance to be nominated by the Republican Party.
The experts pointed out that in 2011, Rick Perry declined his advantage to the popularity of Germany Kane, none of which conquered one State in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in universal elections.
However, external groups, such as "Supercommittee of Political Activity" of Jeb Bush and the Economic Conservative Group of the Growth Club, recognise the unslaughtering force of Tramp and start delivering their dollars to distort it.
Here are some numbers of surveys that say that the real estate magnet is not just a intermediate phase:
Tramp's sympathy ratings turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Tramp announced his candidacy in the middle of June, the Monmouth University survey showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive view of this magnet in real estate.
By the middle of July, it was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 per cent.
Six of the 10 Republicans are now positively referring to Donald Tramp.
Approximately three of the 10 say they have a negative view.
And all of these indicators are above the initial stages.
The Quinnipiac survey in Iowa last week revealed that 60 per cent of the Republicans were in favour of Tramp.
Two thirds of the voters for the GOP would have arranged Tramp as a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans said they either treated " excitement " or " satisfaction" if Tramp had become a candidate.
Only two of the 10 say they'd be upset if he had become a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Tramp (43 per cent say they would be treated "attached" against 40 per cent of those who say the same about Trampee).
Next at the level of delight?
Marco Rubio, who only has 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicans say that they would be "not satisfied" or "but upset" if Jeb Bush's favorite would become a candidate.
Most Republicans do not view Trampa's temperament as a problem.
While Trampa is massively criticised for its praise and insult, 52 per cent of the voters in the Republic of the country believe that the magnet has a proper temperament to be president, as shown in the ABC News/Washington post survey, held on Monday.
The same figure is represented in the first closed congregation in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of the Republicans think that he has the same person that can be the chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent believe that he is not the person who can be effective at post, and almost six of the 10 independent voters say that his temperament is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post reports.
The Republicans are used to this.
When they wear their brand hats, the Republicans' voters think Tramp is serious.
On the question, who was the most likely winner in the GOP nomination, four of the 10 said Tramp was a favorite, according to the CNN/ORC survey last week.
That's not when four of the 10 were put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full explanation: GOP voters had no proper magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while 28 per cent supported the possible candidate of Mitta Romney.
Nevertheless, this indicates that many GOP voters consider Tramp's campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans were united around another candidate, Tramp remains ahead of all others.
Some experts indicate that such disadvantages are likely to play the advantage of Trampa, while non-supporting Tramps are equally distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
However, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth at the beginning of September shows that in the hypothetical competition, “one per one” between Tramp and most other Republicans candidates, Tramp almost always receives support for most.
He's running Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Mark Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Cassic and Chris Christ at 33 points.
He's got nothing to do with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate that's around him?
Ben Carson chased a businessman at 19 points in the hypothetical competition "one per one".
A little more than half of Donald Tramp's supporters say they've changed their minds.
The new CBS/NYT survey, held on Tuesday, shows that only more than half of the voters support Trampo say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one really can say that he will never change his mind.
46 per cent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, the most tense competition in Tramp at this point is with an offsassinate colleague, Ben Carson, but the voters who say they've changed their minds will probably choose Tramp.
Six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Tramp about immigration.
Since Donald Tramp called the immigrants from Mexico “violents” in his campaign opening, the theme of immigration has become the most relevant in the talks in 2016.
Some are concerned that the Pozer Tramp will distract the key voters of Latin American origin from the Republican Party and prevent rebranding.
However, in accordance with the ABC/Post survey held on Monday, six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Tramp on immigration.
So as long as immigration attracts general attention, Donald Tramp seems to remain in the same position.
The disappointment of the Government is a new turnover.
Donald Tramp and Ben Carson are now relying on support from approximately half the Republicans' voters, primarily due to their outside status.
Six of the 10 Republicans on Monday's new ABC/Post survey claimed that they would rather want a political outsider than a person with a government experience.
And they are also insulted at Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey, held two weeks ago in Iowa, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were disappointed by the activities of the Republicans in the Congress, with 54 per cent "not satisfied" and 21 per cent "in anger".
The Government will decide the fate of pension indexing in October.
The Vice-Prime Minister of RF Olga Gladec stated that the Government is now looking for options for the implementation of the Pension Indexing Act in 2016, transmitted by the RG.
She noted that the decision should be found by 8 October, at the time of the draft budget for the next year in the Government.
Furthermore, the cabin discusses the option of prolonging the decision on the freezing of Russian acquisition pension.
The hunger noted that the amount of retirement accumulation was 350 billion rubber.
Approximately the same amount of pension indexing for the next year.
According to the Vice-Prime Minister, there is no final decision on who should pay contributions for unemployed citizens.
The hunger believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not, the socially unprotected categories of citizens are not fair to be paid by society.
The media had previously reported that the cabin had considered two options for the balance of the gossip.
Why are the ages frequently irritated and red?
Answers the physician-oftalmologist Tatiana Levashov:
Our centuries are widths protecting the eye apple from a number of small particles that sit on them.
Forgeting the regular cleaning of the century, we often contribute to the development of blopharit.
Simple exit:
Do not shake your eyes with dirty hands, wear with you a special wet salt for a century;
No less than 1-2 times per day, clean up the end of the centuries that have been accumulated in them for the day of harmful substances.
Cleaning procedures are not only supplemented by warm compressions with the healing grass (chalfey, romashes), fostering the thick secret of salt irons and then the massage of the edges of the century, which should be carried out by circular movements of the finger pillows;
By washing the makeup, do not use alcoholic means.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to a further density of the secret of salt iron.
Phenyan claims that Korean nuclear nukes have created a nuclear warhead.
North Korea's authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country, the nuclear complex in Yonben, worked "for full power".
This was reported on the web site of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
It is noted that the UNDR is ready at any time to respond to “aggression and nuclear threat” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons, both by quantity and quality.
The latest nuclear weapon test was conducted by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
The plans for resuming the full work of the reactor have not been reported since.
Phenyan claims he was able to create a nuclear warhead.
Furthermore, the UNDR has performed a medium and small-level test of missiles, says polit.ru.
The Gerinovsky demanded to remove from the Russian hymn the mention of the brotherly peoples.
The leader of LDPR, Vladimir Girinovski, believes that a reference to the alliance of brothers should be removed from the national hymn.
He stated this during the meeting of the State, reports the Russian News Service.
Who are these people now?
Fascists and killers!
" Very long hymn, the longest in the world, even the sportsmen can't stand," said Girinovski.
The Deputy believes that all the fourths in which the line is contained should be removed:
In the summer of 2014, Girinovski stated that the current hymn should be replaced with “God, King of Conservation”, and the Russian tricolor to replace the Imperial flag, wrote polit.ru.
Assad called upon all the forces to join in the fight against terrorism.
The President of Syria Bashar Assad called upon all the forces to join in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is sure that if Europe wants to deal with refugees, they should stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but that the primary causes of the problem need to be addressed.
If the Europeans are concerned about the destiny of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
That's our opinion on this problem.
"It is the point of the question of refugees," he said in the RT interview.
We must continue dialogue on behalf of the achievement of the consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are impossible as long as people die, as the bloodshed continues, and as long as people feel completely safe.
"So we can reach consensus, but we cannot realize anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Asad stressed.
Recall, about 500,000 migrants have arrived to the European Union this year, including from Syria.
The European Commission stated that the current migration crisis in the world was the biggest since World War II.
There is no exception that thousands of extremist groups of the Islamic State can be among migrants arriving in Europe.
Members of the terrorist organization prohibited in Russia can use the situation to create their cells in the EU for terrorist activities.
The German city’s inhabitants had a refugee holiday.
During the last month, Germany became the leader of refugee reception, although recently it strengthened border control to sustain the inflammation.
According to the authorities, about 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts call it significantly large.
More than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country since September.
The correspondent of BBC Jenny Hill visited the city of Darmstadt, whose inhabitants have been given a very warm reception to migrants.
Jeremy Corbin debutes at the session of the Prime Minister
Following Mr. Corbin ' s elections, his debate at the session of the Premier-Minister ' s questions was awaited with great awaitment
The new leader of the Leiborist Party, Jeremy Corbin, will soon speak to the Prime Minister for the first time, measureing forces with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will speak with the first of six questions raised on the second half of the day; the press and members of the Parliament from the Layborist Party will probably be monitored.
He called on " less theatre and more facts" on a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could miss some meetings by leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbin as the leader; it will take place after the appointment of a shadow office and its speech at the Thred Junion's annual convention on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the leader of the Laborists to remain silent during the national technique at the service on Tuesday, during the 75th year of the Battle for Britain, criticised by a number of conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several best articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing a state hymn attracted attention
Mr. Corbin's press secretary stated that he “stayed in respectful silence” and recognized the "heroism of the Royal BBC in the battle for Britain".
However, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith, member of the Shadow Office, informed Mr. Newsnight to BBC 2, that he would advise the leader of layborists to sing a national hymn " independent of his belief in the need to cancel the monarchy.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to play in Mr. Corbin's team, indicating economic, defence and international policy disagreements, while less than one six members of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
Political correspondent of BBC, Robin Brant, said that political disagreements were also " copied" in a party of layborists after the appointment of Mr. Corbin for a post in the European Union and the restriction of compensatory payments by the Government.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Conference of Tred Junions that the Layborist Party had made amendments to abolish the concept of constraints in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the Shadow Minister for Labour and Pension Payments said that there was " full clearance" in the party ' s opposition to the Government ' s plans to reduce the upper limit from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the layborators with whom David Cameron will meet at the courier box in the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
Leader of Leiborists, who promised a different policy approach, stated that he had " attracted collective resources " to raise Mr. Cameron's ideas and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Member of the Parliament from the district Aylington North stated that the issues of the Prime Minister had excessive confrontation, and that he would abstain from clever replies and exchange of quality, instead of promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and problems that arise against youth.
Mr. Corbin said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Economy in the Shadow Chamber, would replace him on the issues of the Prime Minister when he was absent -- for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also gave the idea to allow other colleagues to take the floor as soon as possible, saying that he addressed the speaker of the House of Communities to John Bercou to discuss the matter.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to leave the political style of the " mermary balagan " often associated with the procedure of the Prime Minister, but acknowledged a few years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister ' s issues became a key indicator of the leader ' s views, their ability to manage the House of Communities and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although the criticism claims that this has become a criticture and requires large reforms.

The sterling pound grows as the salary increases in Britain
The fund increased in Britain, while the FTSE 100 increased by the SABMiller proposal.
Since May to June, the earnings in Britain, based on bonuss, increased by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate has been highest since 2009 and has been met as an early-ranging projection for possible rise.
The sterling pound increased by more than 1% in respect of the dollar and amounted to $1.5505, and 0.84 per cent per cent per euro by $1.3730.
FTSE 100 increased to 6229.21 per 1.49 per cent.
In general, the SABMiller shares were allocated by 20 per cent by the proposal for a purchase from the AB InBev competitors.
The deal would bring together two biggest cooking companies in the world by gathering brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The Burberry shares have increased by 0.9 per cent in the context of the encouraging news from the competitive group of producers of the Lux Richemont class.
The recent sales data of Richemont exceeded all the expectations and showed that sales in China -- on the key market for Burberry -- began to grow again.
The Glencore shares increased by 5 per cent after a mining giant stated that it was able to receive $2.5 billion by posting shares, which was made under the debt reduction strategy.
The Mondi Paper and Packaging Unit Actions were leaders of the fall in the index - by 4.3 per cent - after Goldman Sachs lowered the group's rating before "selling".
The JD Sports shares grew up after the company - the sports supplier reported 83 per cent increases to the taxation of up to 46.6 million pounds in the period of six months.
Chief JD Sports says that higher wages can prevent expansion
The Executive Director of JD Sports Peter Kaugil said that an increase in the minimum salary for British workers means “great purchase capacity in pockets of potential consumers”.
But it is unlikely that such a buying capacity will exceed the cost of work, he said.
The costs could have influenced JD Sports ' expanding plans, he added, which could mean a reduction in additional vacancies.
Metcash launches a campaign from the bottom to combat Aldi pressure
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA shops from Aldi pressure in South Australia and Western Australia.
The general food supplier on the initiative below launched an IGA market share in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the influenza of Aldi 700 million dollars.
While Aldi is preparing to open two opposite warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of the next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and promote IGA brand by marketing in leading media and social networks and activities such as Adelaide Show.
The campaign is accompanied by IGA rhylers and suppliers, such as the manufacturer of ice cream Simmo's from Dansboro, who offers degustation in IGA shops and owners of shops selling tickets to the South Australia Football League.
Metcash is expected to disclose more details of its protective strategy on 29 September, the day that this optional supplier of food, alcoholic drinks and household products will take place on its annual investors' strategies.
There is a lot to go, since in South Australia and Western Australia, IGA shops are nearly 30 per cent of all Metcash shops and show higher rentability than the Metcash IGA network in eastern states.
The buyers in South and West Australia are known as customers of common routes, so the market is more favourable to IGA rhylers than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 per cent in the UA and 24 per cent in WA compared to about 14 per cent in eastern states.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi would take 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months after the opening of its first shops, taking stock from all players present, but primarily with independent rhylers.
In the report published this week, Tom Kirat, analyst Morgan Stanley, believes that the IGA reilers could lose $360 million per year and Metcash $ 250 million by the end of 2016.
The project is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in SA next year and 30 in WA by selling 500 million and 600 million dollars on these markets accordingly.
The loss of delivery and sales of food products at high-level cost of Metcash could cost around 13 million revenues until the payment of interest and taxes, believes Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash loses the market share in eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this is that the recent research of Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley believes that the sales of Metcash foods will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4,1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 by reducing the market share of the company from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, observed at the melbourne business dinner that Metcash " could " disappear for a decade.
The Metcash company refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas' comments.
However, a member of the Metcash Board of Directors was expected to contact Mr. Douglas last week.
The IGA market share has decreased from 18 to 14 per cent since 2010, and Metcash's income from the food-producing company, which is approximately 1200 IGA rhytals, has fallen by 43 per cent compared to 2012 as a result of an operational deverage and due to the sales and rentability pressure.
Nevertheless, the company does not surrender, spend more than 150 million dollars a year to equate prices with prices at Coles and Woolworths at a thousand positions a week and to help IGA re-establish the trade markets, as well as propose a rapidly expanding adjustment of fresh products and a broader choice of business foods.
The Director-General Metcash Ian Morris said that price equation and re-equivalence of trade areas would be a turnover, and he hoped that the company would gain an increase in the net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Cokkinakisa supports President Tennis Australia Steve Hilly
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves honour, not criticize for his behaviour.
Tanasi Kokkinakis has been indirectly in the recent scandal around his friend Nick Kiríos and deserves more respect than the criticism, said President Tennis Australia Steve Hilly.
Cokkinakis, the youngest in a talented duet and often called “Special Ks”, was disadvantaged in the centre of attention because of the shameful shift of Kiríos and Stan Vaurinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly after that, during a hot qualification match at Cincinatti, the judge on the hill had to take Cokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, and Harrison said, "The Bauer was supposed to put on the shovel of Kiryos, and I had to put on the shovels of this guy."
Since Cokkinakisa was last seen by a broken missile after Rishar Gaske was rescued from possible defeat at the US Open, Hilly has loyally protected Cokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgo, competing with Sam Grott for the right to be the second after Bernard Tomich in a lonely class in the semi-final of the Davis Cube against Great Britain.
"I'm very concerned about one thing, namely that Tanasi had been involved in a conflict," said Hilly.
He really broke the missile when he got his leg on the U.S. Open, but he's not the first player who broke the missile when hopes were broken, and I know Tanasi enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he was very good in quite provocative situations in the U.S., with Harrison, and I'm sure he deserves trust.
He's surrounded by an excellent team, he's got a lovely family, and I just think he's done a little unfair.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he's working very well, he's good in the team, he's never had problems with other players, he's respected outside the court, he's intensely trained, he's in great shape, he's a very targeted and developed young man, and I think he should be evaluated by dignity.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kirios for the important match starting on Friday, assuming the "multimate consent" is the right way for everyone, but counting that the guy from Canberra will return to the team as a long-term player.
"Or first, we want the team to focus fully on the match, not the disputes around [Kiros]," said Hilly.
And I think that Nick has gained power very quickly, as evidenced by people like Federer and Marray, he grows in the eyes of the public, has made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and I think it's necessary to take him out of the center of attention for a while to think about them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
The migration crisis in Europe: Hungary announces an emergency, closes the border, delays migrants
Having announced an emergency, Hungary closed the border with Serbia on the south border on Tuesday and detains those who are trying to enter the country illegally to sustain the flow of migrants.
At the border, hundreds of migrants have been copied in the border territory, which the Serbian authorities had severely responded.
By staying indefinitely on the road between the two countries' control stations, people who fled armed violence in their family broke tents and founded themselves in this area.
However, dissatisfaction increased.
When the police helicopter circled over them, migrants screamed "Open the Border!" and cried offences to the Hungarian police of special appointment.
Some denied food and water as a protest.
Serbian Foreign Minister declared "unacceptable" expulsion of migrants back from Hungary, when they were increasingly arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wishes to be part of the solution to the problem, not the comparable damage.
It is necessary to negotiate with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dačić in Prague.
The concerns at the Hungarian Serbian border began the next day after a 28-country block could not develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to bear a common responsibility for 40,000 persons looking for asylum in over-filled Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that the future (in the next month or at the end of the year) would be reached by a agreement that the European Union Member States would adopt another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
The Chancellor of Germany, Angel Merkel and Austria, were required to gather an emergency summit for the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis covered by the continent.
Hungary, however, is not hoping for an emergency action by Brussels or the neighbours.
The emergency situation announced on Tuesday in two southern regions gave powers to the authorities to act on the crisis, allowing them to cease roads and accelerate asylum proceedings.
Meanwhile, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Sierto, said that his country also planned to build a fence from the thick band on the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants across the country, now that it had completed the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent Charlie Dougata reported that even prisoners were connected to the urgent work on the closing of the fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past few months, Hungary has become the main " narrow" and the cross-border of the European Union border for migrants, many of which are refugees of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
Nevertheless, the Prime Minister of the State, Victor Orban, insisted that most people who arrived in the country are economic migrants looking for a better life rather than refugees victims of military action that have the right to protect, and that view was sharply disparaging with the views of other EU countries, in Germany.
The new laws entering Hungary on midnight now consider the offence of crossing or damage to a 4-foot (13-foot) fence fence from the thickens of the woods built by the Government along the south border with Serbia and include a longer prison term for the accused of trafficking in persons.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares an emergency situation," the representative of the Government Zoltan Kovac said to journalists in the southern town of Seged.
We clearly understand that the illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
The formally parliament should still authorize the establishment of military forces, which is expected next week, but the Associated Press reporters, who are on the border, have already observed the presence of armed to the teeth of soldiers with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Deerd Bacondi, a national security adviser, reported that 45 persons were captured by the authorities who tried to cross the border, at the border itself, and 15 others were within the country.
They crossed the border by breaking the fence, are now detained by the police and accused of committing administrative violations on new laws.
The authorities quickly rebuilt the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passages on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning, forced to block one of the passages of a rail wagon covered by the thickle.
The disorders exploded at the main passage across the border near the city of Röske, Hungary, since the Hungary had placed the office room to pass people within the metal container, and the crowds forced each other to break in.
The invasion has been achieved by about 20 people, with thousands of people left outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main road leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced the refusal of food and water until they were released to Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage on Bernard Sanders was doubled in the national survey
Former Secretary Hillary Clinton continues to hold a billful advantage in the nomination of democrats all over the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is chasing it.
Clinton is now supported by 47 per cent of the primary democrats (of 58 per cent) and Sanders is second with 27 per cent (upper from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Byden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, receives support from 15 per cent of the primary democrats.
More than five months before the first election competence, most democratic voters say that it was too early to say that they had been determined with the candidate to be supported.
Clinton's participants are more confident in their choice than in support of other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton lost support for some demographic groups, and Sanders received some bonuss.
Clinton maintains a great advantage among women and moderates, but that advantage has been reduced.
Her support for men was significantly declined, and Sanders was restrained by only 5 points.
The preferred Clinton democratic voters up to 50 years of age disappeared, and they and Sanders are now equal.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among senior voters.
Last month, Clinton chased Sanders for a bill-time number among Liberals, but Sanders now has the advantage of 5 items in that group.
Almost half the primary democratic voters across the country say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if it had become a candidate from the party.
Four would support it with some reservations and 15 per cent would only support it because she was a candidate.
Six per cent would not support it.
It may not be surprising that Clinton's current supporters will probably show more enthusiasm to her.
Among those who currently do not support Clinton, views are more contrary - only about a quarter of enthusiasm would support it.
While 48 per cent of the primary democratic voters say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm, the smaller number of Republicans are talking the same about their leader Donald Trampe (35 per cent).
When an open question is raised to Clinton's stakeholders, why they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the necessary experience (16 per cent), and that she is now the time of the president (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for this post (10 per cent).
Furthermore, Clinton's participants are talking about the association linking it to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is also called agreement on issues and chances of election.
As the Vice-President considers potential participation in elections, 57 per cent of the primary democrats would like him to join the race, although the third believes that he should not.
When they were asked who they wished to see secondly among the candidates from the party, primary democrats called Bayden in most cases.
Among the Clinton members, more than half says they would have chosen Bayden second, that's more than Sanders.
If Baiden decides not to make his candidacy from the Democratic Party, the benefit of Hillary Clinton over Sanders will be increased from 20 items with Bayden among the race participants to 30 without it.
Fifty-five per cent of the democratic voters have seen a candidate in Clinton with the best chances of winning in universal elections; but the number has decreased by 78 per cent last month.
According to this indicator, Baiden, with a large retention in the second place, but the percentage of those who believe it as the most likely candidate has increased.
Nevertheless, answering the question that most important in the candidate, democratic voters choose other options than the chances of being elected.
Similarly, in the past month, no candidates from democrats or potential candidates are an unacceptable nomination for these primary voters.
The candidates from democrats, or potential candidates, have shown good results on some key characteristics among primary voters from their party.
Most view Clinton, Sanders and Bayden as honest and trusted people with good leadership.
Byden of all three leads in honesty, and the strong side of Clinton in its leadership.
Thirty per cent of the primary democrats are not considered to be honest and trusted, twice as those who say the same about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent have no opinion on it.
The original democratic voters are also generally viewed as similar ideas of Clinton, Sanders and Bayden.
For all these measures, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
Although the issues relating to the personal mail and server of Hillary Clinton continue to exist, most of the primary democratic voters are satisfied with its explanation on that account and believe that this did not have a negative impact on their general view.
But it's a completely different story of the American public in general.
Half of the Americans today are not satisfied with its explanation, but only about a third.
The public's views were divided in March, shortly after the history became known.
Most Americans say that the e-mail debate had no effect on their general opinion on Clinton, although 36 per cent said that their views were worsened.
Mostly, these are the Republicans, more than six of every 10, who claim that their opinion on Clinton has been worsened.
Even though Clinton is considered to be honest and reliable by the voters from its party, it continues to be a problem among registered voters as a whole: only 32 per cent are considered to be honest and trustworthy, eight points below in comparison with last month and 15 in comparison with May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it fair and reliable.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not view Tramp honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Tramp, however, are both receiving good leadership marks.
Six protested candidates of Baiden, Carson and Bush show the best results of honesty.
Most people see a more honest man in Sanders than not, but, as Carson, many have no opinion on him.
The sampling area of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 per cent.
As a result of the national survey, Ben Carson closely approached Donald Tramp
Ben Carson approached Donald Tramp in the last CBS/New York Times survey
Two of these candidates took half the voters in a new survey, leaving all others in search of support under their legs
Republic electorals throughout the country continue to support Trampa, which increased from 23 per cent in the recent CBS debate in Fox News last month to 27 per cent in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson flyed from 6% to 23% for the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson was using support in all demographic groups, collapsing Trampa in the Republican election group with higher education.
Other candidates, except Karla Fiorina and Governor Ohio John Cassic, went back with Governor Wisconsin Scott Walker, who had dropped from 10 per cent last month to 2 per cent now.
Former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Hakabi and Florida senator Marko Rubio, are in a third seat from 6 per cent.
The sample area of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey was 6% plus minus, the survey was conducted in September.
The recent CNN/ORC survey published last week showed Carson's growth in the surveys, showing support to 19 per cent among the Republicans, with 32 per cent of support for Trampo.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed that Tramp was significantly in advance of Carson.
As Carson's support increased last week, Tramp made several critical events to the former neuro surgeon, even when Carson apologized for the question of Tramp's faith.
"We need energy," said Tramp last Saturday during the closure of the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the brotherhood are accused of the death of the first-class of Baruch University
Approximately two years after the death of a college student during the ritual of dedication to Pocono in the Mountains in Pennsylvania, the charge of murder was brought against five people.
"Pe Delta Psi members of the New York University of Baruch attacked Chan " Michael" Deng during the September 2013 ceremony of dedication and did not bring him to the hospital in time, which led to his death," the police reported.
Officials say that a student with tied eyes and a 30-pound sand bag had been pushed several times behind his back while he was trying to achieve the goal through the slide surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
The P Delta Psi Brothers didn't call 911 when Deng lost consciousness and waited an hour before he was delivered to the hospital, they spoke to the police.
They, however, have found time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google and contact Andy Mang, the National Brothership President, to ask the council, as he told at the press conference, the Chief of Police Chris Wagner.
"In that moment, the brothers began to hide personal property, essentially by putting the welfare of the brotherhood above Michael Deng's health," said Chief Wagner.
He couldn't be saved, and he was dead for the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng had received a number of stupid head traumas, towels and beads.
"Too many families have suffered from the rituals of dedication to the brotherhood, since at least one student dies each year, starting from 1970," said Douglas Fajerberg, a lawyer representing the Dang family.
Brotherhoods and their members must bear responsibility, and this step of the authorities is very important.
The jury counties of Monroe were accused of the murder of the third degree for the first five members.
Twenty other two members, including Mr. Meng, will be accused of violence against the new and criminal treaty.
"We want to draw responsibility not only on individual participants but, if there is a organization that has authorized all this officially or informally, then it is also," said Wagner at the press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College prohibited the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood excluded the local office from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
Increasing the rates, the bull market will fall down, the bond income will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's going to be before the attack, and how long it's going to continue.
Specifically for the economy, history does not explain much about time.
The recession came only 11 months after the first increase in the rates and for 86 months.
The frequent, although not always, the feasibility of the Federal Reserve in the rising rates defines the response of the economy and financial assets.
The U.S. Central Bank administration therefore urged that the investors should not focus on when it starts to raise the rates and how much adaptation would take.
In fact, there are many variables in the game.
Eventually, market participants can find that all the vain around the increase in the rates is overwhelmed.
"The first increase in the federal reserve with the global financial crisis will be inevitable to interpret some as the end of the era of " cheap money," said Julian Jessop, chief international economy expert in Capital Economics, in his commentary for clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of the interest rates to the US to a more normal but still low level will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here is the view of how some economic areas could be reacted depending on historical trends:
As the market has already seen in the last month or around that, the expectation to increase the rates may lead to unsustainability for a while.
However, with the increase in the rate, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
"It does not seem to delay the share income for 12 to 24 months after the first jump, which is likely to reflect the delay in monetary policy again," said the Deutsche Bank analysts in recent study of the featuring rates by the Federal Reserve.
If more specifically, the market for the past about 35 years is more rapidly changing - about 14 per cent - to increase the rates, remains sufficient for 250 days after that (average growth of 2.6 per cent), then, after 500 days, returns to normal income of 14.4 per cent in the last six cycles, according to the recent analysis carried out by Bob Doll, the main Trade Strategy Trade Strategy in Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
The Deutsche said that the result of valuable papers has a tendency not to become more expressed at the stage of increases in the rates, and the share revenues are starting to decrease.
Recessions are the fact of economic life, but increases in rates often contribute.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is set under conditions that have not existed before and may accelerate the recession.
Mostly, the gross domestic product will be located nearly in its lowest point during the existence of a higher rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, only two times the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 per cent in 118 cases since 1950.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 per cent, few believe that it was for long, while it was only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
Increasing the rates on such an unstable economic background may be risky and raises the question " Whether this time will be different," reported Deutsche.
The market participants are preparing to increase the Federal Reserve System all year, and their views are attached to the meeting of the Federal Committee of the Open Market, which ends on Thursday.
While many experts on strategies and economies believe that the FOMC could approve the increase in the rates at the meeting, the trade in future is only a 25 per cent probability.
"In our research since 1950, all the increases in rates have been in the supercycle of increasing financial rise at GDP, covering the recession, very quickly after the start of recovery," the report states.
In contrast, it was extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle is the longest the Federal Reserve System had waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, it was all 74 months long and has not yet ended.
The fixed income has also become unstable while the market expects a higher rate, and the scenario is somehow similar to the one implemented for action.
The principle difference is that the effect for bonds will come faster than for action when the Federal System is changing the strategic course.
In the case of bonds, income changes the vector immediately after the first increase/minimization of the rates in the cycle.
At the end of the rate cycle, the income of bonds is immediately declined," Deutsche reports.
The Charles Schwab strategy experts believe that the increase in the rates will lead to the long-term and short-term income rates of bonding, making the curve more flat.
High-income bonds often act better in such a climate, although "we are still afraid of income hesitation," says Cathy Jones, analyst of fixed income in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expected results of the federal system's policies.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the fall of inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has developed a stronger monetary policy perspective," she wrote.
The interest rates on short-term loans increased, income curve was more flat, credit frontes increased, volatility increased -- all market characteristics in the reinforcing of the Federal System's policy.
In general, companies leading their primary business in the United States will win from the increase in interest rates, and the local product will become more attractive.
International debt companies will be in a worst situation, since the growing dollar makes their production more expensive in the world market space and their debt is more expensive in the financial.
"History shows that the "quality" shares show the efficiency of the market in three months after the initial increase of the rates," the Goldman Sachs analysts said in the client's report.
Companies with a stable financial condition have surrounded companies with unstable states as a result of each increase in the rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 per cent.
Companies with high capital income, as well as low volatility, have also shown better efficiency than low-quality shares, in the average of 4 (percentage items) and 3 (percentages) respectively.
The debt will be a big question.
Companies with a high percentage of debt with a swimming rate will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to clean market deals, consumers will benefit from a growing dollar.
Investors could also see profits because of higher income, although experts distinguish how quickly this would happen.
"BBC Radio 3 - copie of Classic FM," acknowledged by a member of the parliament from Conservators Andrew Bingham
Member of the Parliament of Conservators, Andrew Bingham, criticised the Station for " Reduction of Standards"
It proves that it becomes less different from a commercial competitor
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, saying that the prize was just screwed with Brits.
The parliamentary colleague, Damien Collins, who had fallen down at The Voice with the same criticism, was not original
"BBC Radio 3 is transformed into Classic FM," said the leader of the parliamentary members, inciting the television company to prove that it is doing anything that commercial companies do not do.
Member of the parliament from Conservators Andrew Bingham also stated to the BBC leadership that the public radio seemed " stupid" and became less different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems -- I don't like to use the word "simplification" -- but it seems to be a classic FM," he said.
It also aimed at the BBC Music Awards Prize, launched last December.
BBC Music Awards, which was launched last year, looked like the British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- here are two examples that first came to my mind, in which you're actually copying what you already have on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of BBC rejected the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitor when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I'm learning from Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anymore.
And his loyalty to live speeches and to the creation of music will not really be compared to anyone else.
"And it is also very important, I think Radio 3's interest in finding new music and in promoting new works," he said.
Earlier this year, the BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey claimed that the radio stations had to work much more to attract the audience than the past, because the British were less educated in classic music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only child of BBC that had been attacked for five commercial competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Culture, Mass Information and Sports.
Member of the parliament from Tori Damien Collins attacked the Voice musical show of talents that BBC bought from the Dutch Talpa Media for the orientation price of 22 million pounds.
See why is this programme often discussed in the absence of originality and distinct characteristics?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC show 1, which is part of Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was done in the "type BBC" style.
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "seek a hit in its own home stable" next time it would launch a entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to interfere with the order of the new seasons of the Voice in the future or using the money of those who pay the licence to other entertainment formats.
The growing internet sales has been maximumly slow in August, and it may be Black Friday.
The first three months of 2015 increased online sales by seven per cent
Last month, the slowest growth has been observed since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales have been intensified three years ago using mobile shopping devices
Experts are convinced that the November Black Friday could contribute to restraining the waste
For about ten years, virtual shopping experienced a boom, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of online sales equipped after the latest data showed only seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total online shopping costs in August showed a minimal growth since they began to be fixed in 2000 by only five per cent.
Experts say there are now signs of online sales equipped after the latest data showed only seven per cent increase during the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates in previous years and return back to 2000, they have always found a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Malkehi, the IMRG sales editor.
He explained that the online sales were intensified three years ago when the buyers began using their mobile phones to buy.
This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they could do it under any circumstances, for example, by sitting on the couch.
But now it comes to the plate, and you can see the decrease.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is referred to as one of the reasons for delaying sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying before the event that was happening last Friday November.
Last year, the buyers in five times the average hurried to the computers to make use of the benefits offers by breaking down a number of seller's websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers join the real fight for the benefits of buying, could force people to refrain from shopping.
According to the study published by British Retail Consortium, about 1 pounds of sterlings are spent online every 5 years.
With regard to goods such as TV and washing machines, more than one third of them is sold through the Internet stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes on the Internet more eager than in fashion shops in central streets.
Muslims bury the dead when the crank falls in Macka, and the Ben Laden family are sanctioned
The Muslims are carrying the bodies of 29 dead on the streets, since the first funeral begins in Macka.
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially charged guilt for an accident on the construction giant of Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that 394 people were also injured after the cran disorder
Thousands of Muslims all over the streets have been stabbed to bury 29 of the victims killed by the cran disturbing the main matches of McKee.
Mostly, the white parts present at the funerals have captured the passing part in order to give respect to the first of the dead who have sent their last way to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad procession passed past the holy place, where only a few days earlier the construction clan broke the ceiling of the mosque and fell upon the inhabitants.
The bodies were issued for the funeral, and at the same time, the King of Saudits punished the construction company belonging to Ben Laden's family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 people who were killed in the main mosque when they were in the streets.
Among the dead were the father of four children, Kasim Akram from Bolton, the Great Manchester, who was in his first pilgrim journey when the cran crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Machete with his parents before the start of the annual hadge.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hadge in Macku will continue, since thousands of people continue to arrive in town.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the arrow of the tail raised with the unemployed tail.
In the Arab version of the decree published by the Saudi Press State Agency, the Binladin Group said that it was partially blamed.
The English News Agency's edition did not tell the details, but said that the leaders of the company had been prohibited from leaving outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the reason for the fall of the tail in the mattress court, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gained to go to the hadge this month.
The Binladin Group did not make any statements about the disturbance of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comments.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and inappropriate compliance with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes are surrounded by the Main Mountain of McKee, within the large construction work run by the Binladin Group.
Ben Laden's family for decades includes the nearest ruling family of Saudi Arabia and runs largest construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al-Qaida, Usama Ben Laden, was a son of change, whose family denied in the 1990s.
The accident occurred at strong winds and rain only a few days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in their life for every ability to work Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 people remained in the hospital.
The officials decided to pay one million rials (approximately 174,000 pounds) to the relatives of the dead, and the same amount was unduly damaged.
The rest of the victims will receive half of that amount.
Chapter B&Q claims that the trend is due to the existence of Eastern European masters working for small money
According to Veronica Lori, the British are increasingly hiring repair professionals
The number of qualified workers from Eastern Europe increased
Result - Opening more than 200 new Screwfix shops for professionals
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores throughout the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, Main City Correspondent Daily Mail
It is said that the British postpone hammers and malar wrists and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to work in the house.
If you know how to treat a hammer or paint the walls deliberately, it looks like you're in a minority today.
Because, according to the owner of B&Q, the British are increasingly hiring master experts to carry out the ultimate home work.
Veronic Lori, a new Director-General of Kingfisher, owning a house-building service network, reported that the trend was a substantial inflammation of qualified masters from Eastern Europe offering minimum price services.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix shops specialized for masters and close 60 B&Q stores at the same time.
Ms. Lori said that she would like to see more women in the B&Q shop staff, since eight of the ten shopping decisions were taken by representatives of a weak sex.
Most of the staff are men now.
She said that the recent demographic trends of households of single women, which are more engaged in their housing than in the past, could not be noted.
Ms. Lori said, "The men still work mostly in our shops.
It is necessary to take steps to achieve balance.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on the acquired goods are taken by women.
Women play a great role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of the five women running by the leading British companies, whose shares are taken into account in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top manager team by reaching among the directors of equal numbers of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which 50 per cent of women governors, including the Director-General and the Finance.
Ms. Lori said, "It was a conscious solution, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding appropriate women in the Board of Directors was not complicated.
Following the closure of shops, the Kingfisher company showed a decrease in income and sales in six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new shops
Time for decision on the interest rate of the Federal Reserve of the United States
The world observes the Federal Reserve Bank of the meetings that discussed the adoption of an important decision for two days to raise or not the interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters found that some half of those who believed that the Federal Reserve would go to that last week, now believe that it would still be temporary and maintain a rate at the current range of 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, since it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve has lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we approach the fact that the main bank could move with zero marking and start the process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Kide, head of the Institute of International Economy, Peterson.
The United States economy works effectively, the economic rise adds trillions of dollars to the balance report and the inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision would affect the world economy.
He warned the markets that it should be prepared for changes, but it was all that they were confident that all chances were against such a step.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
"Open!" - hundreds of refugees are scanned at the Horgosh control point at the Serbian-Wungarian border.
From Tuesday, Budapest crossed the border for the settlers.
The asylum seekers are already initiating other routes to the European Union.
One of them is lying across Romania to the closed border.
Another, through Croatia and Slovenia, to Austria.
According to some data, the buses that took refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now headed to the city of Shidu at the Croatian border.
The drivers received an order from the authorities to follow without delay.
The Serbian Minister for Interior, Nebojša Stepanovic, assures that his country is doing everything dependent on it to help refugees, but its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to ensure Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to provide humanity with them.
But this is a common European problem.
It is difficult to resolve, no country in Europe alone will be able to deal with it, and even more a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open a border for refugees who do not want to remain in Serbia.
But the Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban is inclined:
If someone is called a refugee, it must fill the necessary documents in Serbia.
And if he does not, he will not be released in our country, because in Serbia it is safe.
Hungary has already set up a 175-kilometer fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop at this: he plans to build the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meimarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Maymarakis has been involved in the right-centrist Governments, which, in the opinion of the left, had a country in financial crisis.
He now, as a temporary leader of the New Democracy Party, challenged Cypriot.
A few days before the elections, he met with journalist Euronius.
Mr. Maymarakis, welcome to Euronius!
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you for invitation.
Euronius: Nine months ago, your party had suffered a destructive defeat by withdrawing the SISIS coalition, but now, according to the surveys, "New Democracy" compared it to its popularity.
What changed in that time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and we have changed, too.
Mr. Cypras lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a profit in the budget and prospect of economic growth.
Now the country has a budgetary deficit and a high level of unemployment.
The investors have gone because Mr. Cypras has taken them away.
In the past nine months, Greeks had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr. Cypras.
And now they can easily compare what was promised to what really happened.
Daily life has become significantly worse compared to January, when the situation has improved, and most of the Greek citizens were affected.
Euronius: But you say that if you win the elections, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SISIS.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The fact is, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is not accidental that in all other countries where the rescue programmes have been operated or still operated, political forces and all ruling parties were gathered together to implement the programme that they had reached their agreement without deniing their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that only political and institutional cooperation will allow the country to move forward at the present stage.
Euronius: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Cypras and the country's creditors.
If you become a new prime minister on Monday, will you fulfil this agreement or try to change it at least partly?
Vangelis Meimarakis: We have actually voted for the movement of Greece on the European path, because we have a good idea of what destructive consequences would have resulted in the EU's exit.
Now Europe helps us to grant subsidies to our farmers for their production, we have solidarity funds, UNKER's package and banking assistance.
All of this would be lost if there was no agreement with Europe.
However, the current strict savings measures have resulted in the way Mr. Cypras negotiated.
I know Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government wishes to order during the first year, it is rational, and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure that all commitments that cannot be implemented because it leads to the recession can be the subject of negotiations, but only after a certain time.
It would be wrong to believe that in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors because they are expecting full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to restore their confidence, we must continue privatization, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed to continue to benefit from the EU funding and the great investment opportunities that we need to open for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Government of Cypriot has not presented any serious arguments on many key political issues that we have learned by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give an example of farmers' income.
We explained to our European partners that it is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the Ministers of Cypriot never talked about it.
I mean, the Greek ministers were not prepared and badly informed, and therefore had failed negotiations and concluded an unsuccessful agreement.
Euronius: If you win elections, you will soon be at one table with Mr. Junker, Olland, Ms. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras told them?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014, we have tried best to fulfil the 2012 agreement with the sharp corners in it.
We have advanced reforms.
Of course, we lacked the necessary resolution and speed, but we acted in emergency circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers ready to pay the price of the Greek Government.
At the time I was a parliamentary speaker, and I was able to harmonize the views of the three parliamentary groups that were then the government majority.
And despite their serious ideological disagreements on key laws, we had a working parliament in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as the mass demonstration of outside.
And we have managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the preliminary universal elections resulting from December's presidential elections.
Euronius: Recent weeks in Greece have been moving the mass flow of refugees.
What do you think of this situation, and the reactions of the European countries in which these people strive?
Vangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a bomb of slow action that we have to deal with after the election victory.
The reason is that the Government of SIRISA did not act in this situation as it was expected.
There should be a warning in such matters, because if the problem comes to you, only emergency measures remain.
And we're in this situation now.
Even the temporary Government, changing SISIS, did more in seven days than Mr. Cypras did in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the temporary Government, which are of valuable assistance to the President of the Republic that called for the EU summit, will be allowed to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country and notice that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of war in Syria, the victims of some emergency events that have happened to them.
This issue has a deep humanitarian aspect, and we will follow the position that European policies should take in this new situation.
The appropriate decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should also be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border control and refugee recruitment centres.
We should also effectively use the economic assistance that we receive from the EU in order to be able to deal with this crucial problem.
Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Thank you.

A man who opened the shooting at the University of Delta left an apology note
After the shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning -- and before he shot and killed his colleague later the same day -- Shannon Lamb wrote a note that he "regretted" the first murder and wished "everything to return", the authorized authorities reported on Tuesday.
Police in the city of Gottie, Mississippi, reported that a geographical and public science teacher at the Delta University called 911 approximately 10 hours in the morning.
On Monday, he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatchman that the police had to send people to his house.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there was a dog in the house, which "no one touches" but is probably upset.
The police were interested in the name of the caller, but he didn't call him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the shooting.
When the police arrived at the crime scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a letter written by Lamba, 45, which said, "I'm sorry to bring it back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
By writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta University where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday, when he was surrounded by the police, he killed himself.
College Rector William Laforge told him he had no knowledge of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb clearly had something in mind."
Despite the information received on Monday that Lamb suggested a romance between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services reported on Tuesday that " no information or evidence " of a loving triangle " .
Prentiss called Sean O'Stin, who said he was married for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Stin told him he and Prentiss had a daughter whose 19, and she was "uncomfortable."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Lindsay Knowles, whom San Gerald calls a close friend of Prentiss, the last one worked from the house on the Internet.
Nouls told me Prentiss had a hunter dog called Lightning, and she met with Lamb for about three years.
Nouls said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his relatives on Monday at some point to say, "He won't go to jail."
The same night, when the police caught him on the road 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself there.
According to the summary on the university site, Lamb received a physician at the University of Delta at the University of Education.
Stars Losting Happiness
Actor (left), with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his multi-year life partner, Farra Fosett, who died from cancer.
It was reported that the actress also suffered of drug addiction and was arrested for drug storage in 2008.
All of this has played its role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United has exploded for a few months due to a double breakdown
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the League of Championships, where Manchester United lost PSV in Endhoven.
While the defendant is concerned about this, which is not able to go to the field for at least six months, Louis van Gall hopes that Shaw will be able to play again in this season.
The trauma took place at the 15th minute of Hector Moreno's unreasonable submission, when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV penalty zone.
He was assisted in the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He's got a double breakdown, and he's in the hospital."
He will be transported to Manchester tomorrow or afternoon, and then operated.
This awful young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcome the great difficulties and started playing fantastic, and this happened.
There was a oxygen mask in his dressing room.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double breakdown, it's for six months, and the guy can't play a group stage.
I hope he can play again in this season.
The sea was lucky he didn't get the red card and no tools were assigned.
Arbiter Nikola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gal believes that the Italian judge made a mistake.
You judge yourself when I say it's worth tools and red cards.
It was a very bad twist on two feet.
In his Twitter, Shaw says, "Thank you all for your messages, not to describe how desolate I am, my path to reconstruction begins, I will come back even stronger than I was."
Furthermore: Manchester United has suffered an accident with Luke Shaw in the PSV game
The english defender will have an additional incentive to address the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Coku, coach of PSV, said, "It's a very serious injury."
When any player gets injured with this kind of injury, everyone is very upset with it.
This was never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
The Sea had broken his legs when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team under the leadership of Van Gail at the World Championship in 2014.
"He is very difficult now, because he has no intention of hurting a opponent, and when you hear that this is a very severe injury, you feel bad," said Coku.
I didn't have a chance to see the moment myself.
The only thing I could see was the ball flying in another direction, so it seemed like he (Moreno) touched him, but I didn't see the subpoena under Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6 Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to handle.
I'm very hard, and I'm so sorry.
Andres Guardado from PSV was also transported to the hospital after the conflict with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lorax?
Each parent adopts one thing very quickly: if your child likes a book, it will pass a little while before you know it almost in vain.
I guess unless you're David Cameron.
Answering the question of the representative of the company dealing with the organization of holiday holidays on his favorite child book, the Prime Minister chose " Lorax " - a story of environmental disposal written by Dr. Suz in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a comment published on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "This is a jolly, touching, unusual story with a strong message I like to read my children because it always reveals a picture or a message that we miss."
Anything would be good, except for the last paragraph in which Cameron was supposed to refer to the content of the book, but in fact, the story of the one-named film taken in 2012 with new characters and details added to diversify a rather short original report.
"In the surrounded high walls of the city of Muslimville, where there was no green or even air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girls of his dream, fulfilling her desire to see this tree," we read in the text of the description of the love story of Dr. Suzu (real name Theodore Sue Gazel), who died in 1991.
If this doesn't seem suspicious, Cameroon's text is read almost as a summary of the story of the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database: "In the surrounded high walls of the city of Muslimville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girls of his dream."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, as a generally active parent, is so stranger to the contents of the book that the boy's name will find out how he destroys the environment of the greedy trees and the Nanadkins ' muster, despite the protests of Lorax ( whose name is named) is a funny creature with the muscles that "speaks on behalf of trees".
Probably such an incomplete PR task was assigned to the executor, never read the book about Laurax 20 times in a sequence.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text was allegedly obtained from Cameron's office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was obtained from Cameroon headquarters, but no further comments were followed.
For Adam Lit, there was apparently a risk not to get into England's collection, but it was still a difficult issue.
Conquering Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a challenge, but if you see the collection that England has chosen for this tour, repeating the loss in the test series with the account of 3-0 last time, it seems unlikely to me.
I would also not exclude victory in my field.
The team of Alister Cook may be less experienced than the one that had been three years ago, but there are players who virtually take the balls and collective thinking; they will not bring scars from 2012 but only a youth positive.
With Moen Ali's ball, it turns into a bouler who gives the balls, and Adil Rashid, even if it's an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
Furthermore: Adam Litt came out of England's collection on the test cricket and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to exclude Adam Lit for me, his chief coach in Yorkshire, of course, is difficult to analyze.
His seven test matches had two good attacks in difficult circumstances, but obvious but violent reality was that cricket players were evaluated by judges as a result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, what led to this announcement, because (and I have already said that) the players are the best to choose themselves.
A couple of hundreds, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in the power of his own fate.
Hopefully, if he gets more wounds for the Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The chief coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, has spoken well about his mood even when he didn't show what he was able to do, and that doesn't surprise me; he's the team player, and then everything else.
The question is how long it's going to be before the Batsman of the test cricket leaves an impression of himself is a complicated question.
Lit played seven games like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton was nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and foreign field.
The only thing you could find is that England has chosen Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Prime League when Lith was in the best form, but this lost opportunity was already in the past.
Alex Heils is here, and he's a betsman I appreciate highly.
He's an unpredictable cricketist, which we saw at the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season, when he earned 236 in a game against us on the Trent Bridge square, which was already something.
It should at least be given the same opportunity as those before it, but it will certainly depend on the composition of the OAU team.
The thought of putting Moan next to Cooke as an opening betsman, which would give you an extra spinner by keeping four fast bowlers, thinking, and I don't mind it at all.
I can't see why the beating player can't take a ball there, and that leftman has already shown him a hell of a cricket.
Moan may not be exactly what it takes for her County Wooster, but became the third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old friend, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test games "third Batsman" before he was opening in 2001.
He won three hundred and didn't look around.
Zafar Ansari comes to a collector as a backpaper, and with my continuous communication with him, he seemed to be a very promising young man.
People can look at his example statistics -- in average 31 with a bit and 35 -- and think it's a risky rate, but among the spinners who vote "for" a little, and the chosen ones chose youth.
He'll learn a lot in this tour.
In addition to the compilation, England plans to make a few practical supplements to the training composition.
The appointment of Mahela Jayauordin, Sri Lankan Batsman, as a consultant for test matches, could be a master move.
He is one of the best guys for the game that will bring to it the richest experience gained under all possible conditions and attacks.
Paul Colingwood is included in the games where the white ball is used and will ensure both energy and unhappy pace in the setape.
I always felt that he was born to be involved in an international cricket, either game or training, and, like Mahela, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new votes in the dressing room, even if they say what they have already been told, can give new forces to the team.
Colleague College, Darem Ben Stokes, was left for one day, Ruth had a similar break in Australia, and I, for example, have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees with this, coaches and players do not define the schedule.
And you should remember as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easily taken.
The camp of British exiters from the European Union can win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's uneven policy on renewing the negotiations on the EU's preservation of British negotiations is increasingly complex every day, even without reviewing the choice of a genius Jeremy, "It is yes or not?"- Corbine by the leader of Leiborists or the Tuc of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbins and Nigel Farages.
The friendly European diplomat explained at the day that, with the situation in which the EU is now incurred by various crisiss, not all of them in its own production -- some participants of the British egocentrical agenda of sewing disturbances and undermining agreements that they mostly do not want to change.
When he gathered in Briton for a annual meeting, the TUC decided that he wouldn't want them in any case if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's Self Program.
The Prime Minister and the Finance Minister ride on summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves on the basis of a known local monument, in the local famous company or without it, then return home and say they attract allies to reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wishes to maintain external contacts to the British under the European Union, "Don't leave us with France," said Berlin, suggests that the inhabited ministers and officials in some capitals get to understand when they will be alive, we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a very cautious Chancellor of Germany, is an alliance, but she is in the power of 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation for her is worsened, as it has deteriorated for the seat of Tatcher (11 years), Mitterran (14) and Cola (16).
France head François Olland stands before the re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland may soon receive the nationalist Government of the right push, Spain to the left.
It is hard to see them climbing out of the skin to help the Selfy Brits, whose energy could be spent to prevent the exit of Scotland from Britain, which they do not want, because most of them have similar separatist trends.
So some such ministers can even plan to extradite intentionally useless removals in the SNP style during the United Kingdom referendum campaign in 2017 to elaborate the exit process of Great Britain from the EU, suggests my friend.
"Review was a fixed idea" and "Brittenia has not received anything valuable from the resumed negotiations."
The Europeans know what a predator Flit Street could be, and how skeptical on the EU are the media-magnates, in contrast with the time that Tony Benn had launched in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 by ratio 2:1.
They may shyly remember Boris Johnson, an enrolled Euro-opportunist, who was celebrated by his " direct EU bananas" of the Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his nonsense, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a crushing company from fearing taxes of cheaters, telephone hackers and non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had the same view about them, but he made a record that when you're in a cell with a big gorill, you have to give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Milliband was a bigger commitment to Blair than Blair himself in contrast with the idea of Cameron's referendum, since Blair received the principles for the abolished EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him a victory ticket.
The press didn't forgive him.
But the darling Jeremy Corbin, who friendly grabbed me on my back in Westminster on Monday -- I told him he had no more time to waste it on me -- he seems to risk repeating Neal Kinoc's "boycott Murdock" strategy from the '80s -- a mistake and then, and now.
This may take time, but it must develop a consistent strategy of interaction with the press, not with me, but definitely with Andrew Marra, whom he was sitting on the couch at the BBC on Sunday.
The official position of the Corbina on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He said he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditional trend of Ukip and the broader circle of small England's foreigners may probably say yes.
It's the same thing as Hillary Benn, but not Bennith," Benn said on the radio and TV this week, and his internal scouring score he refused to admit that the appointment of Corbin to the insufferable John McDonnell was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the '70s, when his old father was fighting on TV for being unloyal to colleagues in the Laborist office without getting too far and not losing his post in the office of ministers.
Hilari's battle was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain “in any circumstances” is Ben's phrase is not what, said McDonnell, and not what J.C. told the parliamentary peers and members at a private meeting on Monday night, in general.
Whatever he wanted to report to the democrat and his boyfriend Corbin -- remember, he even touched me -- the discipline of the messages remains important for the seven-day television ages a week, and especially in the surgery of social networks, paranoid and trait.
It is reasonable not to let Cameroon get away from Europe so easily, allowing him to accept as appropriate support for layborators during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But the main deception of McDonnell and Corbine in membership in the EU, within the Bennith economy of the convicted fortress, is no longer a question of esoterical discussion among the left dissidents, for which narcissism, which is a minor distinction, is a central principle in doctic disputes.
With regard to his deceptions on Nato Tom Watson, it is reliable that the J.K. will not agitate for the exit, the foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin waste political capital -- they also have suspicious voters -- to the offences of Britain, when all this could be meaningless?
The United States has already been very disappointed by the weak military action of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Government of Tours cuts out the costs, as I was reminded on Monday during lunch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the review of electronic cigarettes from the Public Health of England
The statements funded by the Government of the Agency that electronic cigarettes were 95 per cent less harmful than smoking, were sounded at the meeting of 12 people, some of which are related to tobacco industry, as the researchers reported.
The experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have criticized the evidence used by the Public Health Agency of England (PHE) in their electronic cigarettes report.
The PHE issued an important report - the " turnover" last month, called it "the comprehensive review of evidence".
However, some researchers questioned the credibility of data and indicated that some experts had a link with the tobacco industry.
In the editorial article in the Lancet medical journal last month, the “extremely sharp argument” was criticised on the basis of which PHE built its main conclusion.
In the article BMJ, two other researchers asked whether these statements were “tight or faint”.
Martin McKee, a teacher of the European Health Organization at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicals, and Simon Capewell, a teacher of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “Foundamental principle of health - rules should be based on proof of efficiency.”
They say that the public expects the PHE statements that the " current best assessment shows that electronic cigarettes are approximately 95 per cent less harm than tobaccocurement" were based on detailed examination of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this is the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multicryterial analysis model for decision-making to summarise their views on the damage related to various nicotinosing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capwell reported that one of the congregation's sponsors was a company called EuroSwiss Health, a Director-General, who reported that he had received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research earlier.
It also confirmed the BAT health certificates in the sustainable development report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes without mentioning the funding he reportedly received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
No reasonable explanation for the election of members of the Council was provided, but there were several known electronic cigarettes, some of which also claimed the financing of the industry in the publication.
It is unknown whether other participants have experience in the tobacco.
The meeting was also visited by the Tobacco Guide in PHE.
The scientific article, published by the group, “excellently agrees” that there is a lack of " severe evidence of harmful impact on most products on most criteria", wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, no of these links and restrictions have been affected in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the statements of PHE that " there are no evidence that electronic cigarettes are expensive, leading children or non-smoking" are too early.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of the PHE health and well-being direction, said that BMJ statements had already been answered.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than tobaccocure."
One of the two smokers died all their lives of their addiction.
All evidence implies that the health threats to electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the remote consequences.
PHE has a clear responsibility for public information on what they prove and what these evidence do not prove, especially where the public had doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people per year die from smoking diseases, and NHS costs 2 billion pounds per year.
Clearly pointing out that, although electronic cigarettes are not safe, they only cause part of the smoking injury, we do our tasks before the nation.
Former Head of Channel 4 believes that the BBC should cease the EastEnders series
The former chapter of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that the BBC should cease the release of programs such as EastEnders and The Voices, noting that their business competitors would have given a lot for such successful shows as the "Albert's sauce opera".
Johnson noted that licence collections should be used only to create such programmes that are not issued by other British radio companies.
He criticized the BBC for the company's transfers of public broadcasting, which is probably only a small part of the audience, for the picnic phenomenon when competitors have high rating show and on channels such as BBC4.
After the Director-General of BBC Tony Hall said that the corporation wished to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noticed that he had failed to cooperate with BBC during the work at Channel 4.
"I cannot separate myself from the idea that the BBC is preparing to launch and transmitting transfers that could show competitive companies without grants," Johnson told the members of the Committee on the Communications of the Lords Chamber in the context of finding the further fate of the BBC.
If you maintain a licence collection that I do not consider to be a good solution in the medium and long-term perspective, companies should only leave those programmes that are not issued and are not emerged by other companies.
The Voice show is emerging in the Prime Slot because the creators want to receive the maximum possible support for the future.
The idea that no one should show it again is ridiculous and apparently absurd.
Johnson: " I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to finance transfers that could be financed without grants.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; they are commonly known as their own production.
Other channels would certainly be given a lot for her.
I don't understand how this could be a public talk.
I don't think it would have humiliated BBC.
The serial entrepreneur Johnson, head of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of raising " due to the ambition of staff and their belief that this is the best way to receive support for a long term."
His comments on the most popular show at the BBC are revoked with the comments of the Executive Director of Sky Tony Bolla, who in his lecture of the McTaggart memory in Edinburgh, in 2003, invited BBC to sell series of types EastEnders.
Johnson noted that more low transfers of BBC public nature "continue to BBC4, where there is often no audience to be evaluated, but the function of the company has been performed, and that could be made as an argument in the Hangean proof of the income from a 4 billion pound licence: "Oh, of course, we are doing all these unreasonable transfers that no one is looking at."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
With regard to the licence collection, Johnson informed the Committee: " I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who will receive most of it.
Of course, you all think we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people for whom 150 pounds is big money, I'm wondering, they think so because they don't really look and listen to BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 Executive Director, David Elstein, who also spoke to the Committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should review the Rita mission for “information, education and entertainment”.
He noted that only a small portion of BBC materials is now formally classified as educational - he said it was 1% of the television content and 0.1 per cent on the radio - and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasting companies under the devision "intelligence, education and entertainment".
On the issues of Elstein partnership, the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as the " Variable Concerts " (only part of them is shown on TV), as well as entering alliances with commercial broadcasting companies to make them available for online review.
Sonogenetic allows brain cells to be managed by sound waves
The video shows how notodes change the direction of movement when they are affected by sound impulses.
Scientists led worms with a genetically modified nervous system to be managed using sound waves.
Little netodes change the direction of the movement at the time they are affected by sound impulses too high that human ears can hear them.
The impulses are affected by activeing the neurons, genetically modified to use membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
Furthermore, researchers control brain activity through light
Scientists reported that the worms demonstrated the possibilities of a new method called "sonogenetic", which is the main part of the use of ultrasound to induce certain brain, heart and muscle cells, and the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.
Shrikant Chalasani, a scientific officer at the Institute of Solk, La Hoya, California, told Guardian that this method could once replace a deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure that sends electric impulses to the brain and used to treat Parkinson's disease.
The worm-nematodes usually don't respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they were beginning to react when they were placed in the fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles strengthen ultrasonic waves that then enter the worm organism.
Strengthened ultrasound waves affect the structures called TRP-4 ion channels found in some worm cells.
UV waves force these ion channels to open and excite cells associated with them are reported in the report of Nature Communications.
Chalasani made genetic worm modifications for the creation of nettodes that can be managed through ultrazvuk, so their mobile neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the use of ultrazvuk to affect modified organisms, the sound waves increased by microscopic bubbles and incorporated in the worm organisms, activated modified motion neurons.
This methodology is similar to the one used in "optogenetic" - a new direction that allows scientists to include and disable neurons using light impulses.
Chalasani claims that, in comparison with this method, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike the light that is delivered to the proper phosphone brain, low frequency ultrazvuc waves go through the tissues of the organism, so they do not have to go in the skull box.
"We believe that for the treatment of certain neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of genetic therapy and therapeutic viruss can make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal," said Chalasani.
He added that, in addition, the methodology could be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Forbidden torture equipment is right on your threshold!
The advertising of the British arms trade
Look at the Amnesty International film with a protest against the exhibition of arms.
Excellent killer drones!
Destroying branches, iron candals!
Cassette Bombs!
Electrical light woods that cause unbearable pain, but not leave traces!
The aware voice and drawn animation do not doubt that this advertisement of the largest international arms exhibition is a parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the intention of the British Government to push the weapons to the repressive regimes by using the exCell centre in the Doclandz exhibition of defence technologies and security systems.
Furthermore: DSEI arms exhibition: authoritarian regimes are going to London
However, the special campaign also leads to a sudden appearance of a number of posters at bus stops and trains in the metros that need to look at them again.
"It is an important announcement to DLR from 15 to 18 September?" is written in one of them by the letters of the London metro with a DLR line that turns into a forcet tank.
In September this year, the crowd of arms traders will be incorporated on the DLR line. The passengers are asked to help prevent the exhibition of weapons.
300 posters are drawn by artists who exhibited their work in the Museum of Cruel Design in Banks Dismaland.
The “Special Patrol” Group has helped to distribute them across London using the “collapse of advertising sites”, a 6-pound set of gae keys, which is allegedly “administered to approximately a third of the advertising space at the bus stops of the planet”.
London's transporters are unhappy from such "wandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parodial announcements issued by the "Special Patrol".
According to Gavin Greendon, a courier for the exhibition of Cruel Designs and a teacher at the Essec University, artists are more demanding and strive to bring political art to the audience outside the galleries.
Many artists start working with protest activists, realizing that they have to go into a real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the exhibition of weapons welcomed passengers in the metro.
A video from Amnesty was viewed over 100,000 times in the Facebook 24 hours and created by the VCCP agency working for bono, with a graphical designer and a sound artist, also working freely.
The Creative Director of VCCP Matt Lever was affected by advertising silence around the exhibition of weapons -- with a passage in the ExCel calendar -- and thought, "Let's make them a campaign that they're trying to avoid."
They were thinking of creating a more realistic and smart corporate advertising, but "to fill it with bright colors and animation was more exciting."
"They have incredibly helped us to attract attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment on the exhibition," said Tom Davis from Amnesty.
We now need the Government of the Great Britain to take action and guarantee that this torture equipment will not be illegally sold right at our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art on the exhibition of weapons is from within the ExCeL, where participants trade fantastic eufemic products.
In the press release, Saab revealed information on the order of "AT4CS RS for armed shooting" from the United States Army.
It includes "no analogs of a commulative battery that brings unexcessive restraints within the target."
Whatever he does, it won't be nice.
Eight Golden Rules of Housing in Students
It's been 11 years since I moved to the student's room as a normal 19-year-old person who still believes in the brethts and moral relativeism, but only now I remember the smiles of those whom I irritated -- and many long-term complaints on others.
Mostly what I learned can be composed of eight simple rules.
Movement to the room may varies from a little nervous to completely scary.
He encourages people to talk: to tell people where you've been, whether you've taken academic leave and where you've spent it, whether you're supporting Corbin, and why you're "honest, or I hate Marmaites," because seriously, guys, it's just a HAHAHAA EXTRACT, I'll be with me."
Take a rest.
And help others rest too - ask questions and show interest.
This supports the conversation and helps you find people that you like, not those with whom you wouldn't even talk to, even if you were burning the cliffs, and they would give fireworks.
Give people space.
Human rooms are often converted into drinking facilities, midnight movies and places of common parties, but they are also the place where people dress and repair the underwear.
Furthermore: Don't even think about starting a university school in relations
Introverts in universities are unfair.
Your room must be asylum, but many communities form a culture of shatania from one room to another, which promotes friendship, association and leads to long friendship.
This may be a hell for someone who's trying to restore powers.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to keep friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I've been able to restore the energy that I spent to communicate with you."
Try to feel when a colleague is tired - not to knock to him, but send a SMS.
Speaking of the knock, do it.
A guy in my room followed the principle that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw something.
Build friends with baking.
Since you're starting a university life on the popularity of the Bake-Off show, knocking on the door to people to introduce and present a bowl of chocolate cookies, it's not such a strange action, it's not like the 1950s, "Welcome, we're neighbours, I've baked you something, and now smile and I'm going to ask you personal questions."
Proposing home feasts is a great way to be friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and in the end your face will probably be associated with a nice surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you are.
Badly blinded mushrooms, sugar and fat will make people pretend to be asleep when you knock at them.
Food stealing is a typical crime in student houses.
Of course, getting someone's chicken is stealing, but is it a stealing to take a little milk for tea?
Go to the owner of the milk.
He's probably going to suggest you not to be ashamed even if it's in it.
If someone's stealing your stuff, it's annoying, and I'm sorry for you, but try to treat this adulter than my neighbor who poured the fluid in her milk to wash the vessel to revenge those who took it without demand.
She's in jail right now.
You should not make noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a good man, but also because you're the same people in the parole of glass houses.
The girl in my corridor asked the neighbor to beat the sound of the drum and the bass guitar because it was 3 hours in the morning and she had a test.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5 a.m., she mercyfully let him sleep two hours, and then she put her music on and locked the door behind her by going to a three - hour exam.
Was it not romantic if your future husband settled in the same room as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely, before you bite the elbows, if you accepted a neighbour as your future husband, interfered with them, broke up and should you see him every day, and perhaps see him dragging all your common friends on his side?
Of course, you can't order your heart, but if the hot neighbor is absolutely not your future husband, try to cold your own dust.
At the exciting moment when you realize someone left the keys inside his own locked room, the border between the joke and the grass is cheaper than it seems.
Good joke is fun, but it turns into its opposite in a number of seconds.
Learn a valuable and interesting security lesson by hiding something - but never pack any teeth room and shampoo.
Close the door and put the keys in the glass with water that you'll then put in the freezer -- but don't stick strange things with Blu-Tack to the roof more than twice.
iOS 9: how to establish a new operating system on iPhone after the update of Apple
A new operating system can be requested by entering the Settings, selecting General and then - Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will allow you to download it and set it up.
Some faced problems after the installation when the error was reported, saying that " Update of the annex failed " .
In order to avoid this, users are recommended either to wait until the resurrection is silent, or to try to update through iTunes.
The tips on the phone will allow you to pass the whole process to the end.
The process may include the removal of applications to increase the free place -- but Apple minimised the probability of this action by reducing the update, and also facilitated the implementation by a special tool that suggests to remove applications and re-establish them after the process is completed.
It is important to make sure that your phone is loaded or close to the charged device to avoid the battery discharge.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, since the telephone discharge may result in an update.

IOS 9 now includes new functions, including an improved personal assistant, and innovation that increases the productivity of iPad, as well as settings that increase the speed of work and correct the operating system.
Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone.
The Secretary of the United States, John Kerry, called to his Russian colleague, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support that Moscow has provided to President Asada led only to accelerating the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk to the Russian colleague, PJ Media wrote.
US Secretary John Kerry called to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss Russian military activities in Syria.
The PJ Media publication reports on this.
"The Secretary Kerry made it clear that the further support of President Assad by Russia is a risk of prolonging and prolonging the conflict, as well as negatively affecting our common goal - to combat extremeism - if we also do not continue to focus on searching for Syrian conflict resolution through direct transfer of power," said the representatives of the United States Department.
They also noted that Carrie again emphasized the commitment of the United States to combat the Islamic State within a coalition from over 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be her member.
Furthermore, the United States will " be pleased with the constructive role of Russia in trying to resist the Islamic State."
Last Friday, the representatives of the White House stated that they did not know exactly what Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss this issue with Moscow.
However, the Press Secretary of the White House, Josh Ernest, noted that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet occurred: "When the president decides that the phone conversation with President Putin will be useful for our interests, he will raise the phone call and try to make that call."
Sam Barak Obama considers the decision of Russia to increase the support of Assad ' s " loss rate " .
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago, when I told him that this was a mistake, that the further support of Assad would only make the situation worse.
"But he did not listen to my warnings - and the situation has risen worse," said the President of the United States.
The imported boats will free the payment of customs escorts.
The mine-economic development intends to temporarily release the imported yachts and other swimming means for rest and sports from payments of customs e-mails and taxes.
The corresponding changes in the list of goods for temporary immediate imports were prepared by the Ministry for the Government of RF.
This was reported by the Assistant Minister for Economic Development, Elen Laskin.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister of RF Dmitri Medvedev, on the end of the trip to Krim, ordered a number of ministries - Mineconomic Development, Mintrans RF, Minculture, MID, ICB, FSB, FTS, Rosturism - to prepare proposals for the establishment of favourable conditions for the coastal yachts of the country.
Instead, experts note that the main problem is the lack of infrastructure for storage, maintenance and maintenance of boats.
The owners prefer to preserve their courts abroad - approximately $200 million per year in execution of European States for the content, repair and maintenance of boats.
The draft decision of the Council of the European Economic Commission has been prepared by Russia on the amendment to the list of goods that are temporarily exempted from the payment of customs e-mails, taxes", providing full conditional exemption from payments of customs e-mails, taxes for imported yachts and other swimming funds for rest and sport.
In the Ministry ' s view, this would undoubtedly contribute to the establishment of favourable conditions for the development of the yacht in coastal zones of the country,” noted Laskina.
This issue was addressed by the Sub-Commission on Customs Tariff, Netariff Regulation, Protection measures in the external trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which was held in September and was also approved by the agencies.
As the representative of the Mineconomic Development noted, the proposed measure for full conditional release in imports was in fact a relief.
Therefore, following the approval of the Protocol of the Sub-Commission in the Government of the Russian Federation of Mineconom Development, the European Economic Commission for Discussion with the EES Member States explained Laskin.
The list of imported goods, which are fully released from customs payments, taxes, includes goods necessary to promote external economic activities and international cooperation, for the use of science, culture, filmmatters, sports and tourism, to provide international assistance, and so on. These include official equipment (personal computers, writing machines), control and measuring tools, storm suits, scenic suits and decorations, mobile labs and master skies, race cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, journals, musical instruments and objects for religious rituals.
The press service of Mintrans RF " Notifications " stated that mandatory decisions were prepared on the sea ports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Eupatoria, which provided for a simplified order for the establishment and exit of small, sports sailing and walking vessels in the seaport.
Mintrans are given to the Captains of Crimea's maritime ports to ensure the use of a simplified order of entering small, sports sailing and walking vessels in the maritime port and the exit of the ships listed from the marine port.
Mintrans has also prepared draft orders by the Government of the RF to approve the borders of the Crimea Aquatoria.
With regard to Yalta and Feodosia, the orders have already been adopted, the rest are in the harmonization stage,” the Board noted in the press service.
In the opinion of Mintrans, the Government, the classification and awareness, the registration of smaller vessels used for non-commercial purposes should be implemented by the Republic of Krim and Sevastopol.
The problem is that it is very difficult in Russia with the yacht because of a weakly developed infrastructure.
If you look south of Italy and France, it is a whole continuous development industry in which a large number of people are engaged.
In Russia, there's actually everything in place.
Our coast is little interesting, the only piece where the boats can be operated round-year is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Helandjika, New-Russian, Anapa.
However, the challenge is that there are extremely strict rules of border service in this area: a mass of permits must be made to walk on the yacht.
Besides, within Russia, you were going to get somewhere to be loaded.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then the problem is where to take it," said Nordmaine Dennis Novikov, director.
With regard to the sailing sites, in Moscow and St. Petersburg, there are now special yachts for yacht up to 30 metres. The boats are also dispatched to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Newkov noted that the boat buyers were rich people, but the demand for the boats was reduced since the crisis began.
The World Bank granted Ukraine a $500 million loan.
The World Bank adopted a new borrowing project for Ukraine as $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
"The new funding will support a number of priorities to reform in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," the report states.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine Ziyao Fanh said that banking reforms would help renew credits in the real economy and stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank had seen the first signs of stability.
However, because of the seriousness of the problems, Fang calls on the Government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
Previously, the Polish Government approved the provision of a loan in $1100 million in Ukraine, transmitted by the RIA News.
Prisons are asked to create separate blocks for transgenders.
At the Federal Office for the Implementation of Punishment (FCIN) of the rights of convicted in October 2015, the other issues will discuss the possibility of creating in colonies separate blocks for transgenders and transvestites.
A member of the Board, Vladislav Grib, told the " Notifications " .
He believed that, depending on the total number of convicts in Russia who have not been convicted with sex, individual cells, blocks, or even (if such criminals would be many) could be provided for trans-sexuals to create a special colony.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that the determination of the punishment of citizens in such isolated places is possible only after convicted medical expertise that will prove that the offender is indeed a person identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the security of penalties.
He said that the proposed practice has been successfully operating abroad: the SISO (where the accused are before the court's decision) provides separate transgender chambers and the corrective institutions are special blocks.
Today it is the only way to work with such criminals.
They must be isolated, since the presence of transvestites and transgenders in ordinary cameras is dangerous for them, such as suffering for their families and the sea of FSIN staff.
The degradation of transes by compartments is guaranteed," said Vladislav Grib.
Depending on the size of the city, the number of criminals with an uncertain shelf, it is also necessary to calculate where to distribute them.
CISO is definitely not needed. Only cameras, prison blocks.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgenders.
As the Mushroom explained, 50 or 100 people could be contained in the block, and if a specialized corps is established in Russia one, the penalty of prisoners will be possible from any region.
Citizens are contained in the SISO on the crime scene, so transvestites or transgenders from other actors during the investigation and trial are unreal, but such practices are introduced for the convicted already in a separate colony, yes, believes the Grib.
Recall, before the law enforcement officers were unable to decide in which case a man or female isolator was detained for the preservation of drugs of 24-year-old Dmitri Kojukov (known as Alina Davis) was not arrested.
He was released home under a subscription for his departure.
This news was widely discussed in social networks and media, since the transgender mechanism in the SISO and colonies in Russia is not yet.
The Russian human rights defender, LGBT-related activist (LGBT lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans-sexual) Nikolai Alexeev supported the idea of creating special places for punishment by transgenders, noting that there is also a way to define men in the colony, male or female, depending on their own desires.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, it is a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as is the issue of security in homosexual prisons,” said Alexeiev.
Prisons should be safe, so separate blocks could be made for this and for homosexuals, more in prisons than transgenders.
However, Alexeius doubts that there will be a lot of citizens in Russia who are willing to turn themselves into transseksuals in order to arrive in a distinct colony.
Of course, medical awareness can be introduced before putting people in a transgender colony, but it is not always clear.
For example, in the United States, one of Chelsea Manning prisoners looked like a man, and already in prison said he wanted to change the sex," said Alexeiev.
A man can feel anything.
But as long as there are no specific places for punishment for transgenders, I doubt the prison officers will consider the security of such people and aware of the thinness of their orientation or gender identification.
At the same time, an international expert on reproductive health in the PF Boris Lordkipanide noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of trans-defense criminals in the colony could severely delay the initiation of the punishment of the convicted.
A commission is a matter of sexology, the psychiatrics have long observations, not one test based on a high-toctic conclusion.
Today's psychiatric possibilities allow that.
Therefore, prior to gender change, potential patients always take such expertise -- they clearly show whether the change of gender with surgery is a necessary measure,” said Lordkipanide.
However, it is difficult to imagine how to introduce this system in relation to the convicted, since the average survey takes a month.
The doctor, despite the overall idea of establishing a separate trans-sex block, also doubts that in the present economic conditions it would be appropriate to allocate funds to building new facilities, medical expertise, transgenders in Russia.
No official statistics are to be considered difficult, but given that there are about 5 per cent of homosexuals in Russia, transgenders can be said even less, and those who have such a deviation and also commit crimes, they have a small number of crimes,” said Lordkipanide.
Now, at the request of the colony, homosexualists, transgenders can receive individual content conditions.
Michael Antipov won the Junior Peace Championship.
In Hunty Mansisk, the world championship of chess among youths was completed up to 20 years old.
The end of the prime seemed more than intriguing.
The winner was only determined in the last tour, and they became Russian Michael Antipov, who had been able to force the Poles Jana-Ksychof Dudu, who seemed to have been sure to go to the title.
Girls were celebrated by the Ukrainian chessman Natalia Bux.
The championship of the world in chess since September in Hunty Mansisk was in the middle of the tournament distance, it seemed to have lost almost all its intrigue, since the representative of Poland Jan-Kshithof Duda, who had issued a series of four victories (switzerlandic system in 13 tours), was confidently engaged in leadership.
In view of the fact that Duda was the first-year-old favorite, and it was generally considered one of the most promising young chessmen, the probability that he would miss the gap, was very small.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed the Russian Michail Antipov to reduce his retirement to only 0.5 points, he remained an apparent favourite in the fight for title.
Because Antiqué had to win in the 13th tour to catch the leader.
But even that wouldn't help, you won Duda's party.
Plus, this victory obligation, of course, could have affected the game of the Russian chessman and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipov was able to avoid them.
He confidently dealt with Francesco Rambaldi, and then he was forced to wait for his party to finish the Douda meeting Benjamina Bock.
Fortunately, the Polish chessman for Antikov had a fight against the Dutch.
Thus, Antipov and Duda received the same number of points - 10 of the 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
Therefore, Hunty-Mancian autonomous district, whose governor Natalia Komarov, traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, gave the main prize.
But there was no intriguing event in the competition of girls.
The leader of the tournament - Natalie Buxe (Ukraine) - had not lost the last tour that it had successfully done.
So the victory of Alina Bivol did not allow her to reach Bux.
The Russian sportsman remained the second with a 0.5 score distance from the championship.
The exhaust changes the regional structure.
The company combines the Privolg and Ural regions into a comprehensive Volz-Ural region, Siberia and the Dale East to the region of East.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As the Director of Ispellcoma pointed out, changes are being made to " remain a strong player on the market", to develop the company "in new, not always favourable external conditions".
In the interview with the "Russia 24" television, Mr. Slobodin stated that they were intending to reduce " ten per cent" of staff in Russia.
Roscover checked 78 Moscow breakfast Burger King and issued 367 regulations.
As a result, the Volcolam Highway restaurant was damaged by 50,000 rubs, and the large Tulian street was closed for 90 days, but the work was resumed after all violations were removed.
43 breakfasts have violated the requirements for accommodation.
Among other violations, unsatisfactory sanitation and sanitation content of premises, non-compliance with the requirements for ventilation devices, some facilities have found the bacteria of the carbon stick group.
The Burger King Brand Franchise belongs to the OOO Burger Russian owner of the Scoolider's network, Alexandra Kolobova, in Russia operates 293 breakfasts.
Igor Artemieev, FAS leader, stated that the Office against the Indexing of 10 per cent of the goods transport and delivery of fees, as requested by the OAU RHD.
At first, they wanted 17 per cent of the indexation, now they want 10 per cent and many billion budget subsidies, he said.
We're saying that it's wrong, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up the expensive personnel, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money on the left and on the right.
He added that the FAS has its " much strict" proposals that are currently discussed in the Government.
Polymetal considers the possibility of a net calculation from Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of a full $300 million option, the gold-contributing company reported.
In this case, the Polymetal will have to compensate Sumeru to $80 million (the difference between the price of the Sumeru shares and the marketing cats) which can be taken from a free cash flow.
Sumer has time until 3 October to implement the option or require payments.
Details of the Polymetal negotiations do not disclose.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of the Polymetal project " Kysel" in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, Director of the Ministry of Housing Policy, reported that the Ministry, along with the CC, was developing a order for the sanctions of the constructors.
"We understand that we are not going anywhere from this, so we develop the relevant mechanism," said the official.
The blackmails of the Citizen Kane movie will make trades.

Minpromation: Addressing food aid will not be analogue of cards in the SSSR.
The Deputy Minister for Industry and Trade of Russia, Victor Eutuchov, said that the programme of food addressing would not be a similar to the card distribution system of food existing in the CSD.
This is a modern food aid for the population and support of an effective domestic product manufacturer.
I'm asking you not to speculate the word "food card".
In particular, it should be noted that the proposed product cards should not be confused with the outstanding time of the total deficit, the card distribution system where the number of products obtained are normal.
We have yet proposed the concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes in legislation," TASS states Mr. Eutukov.
Previously, the " Y" wrote that the food card programme for the poor had been introduced to the Government.
For more information on the Minprommerce initiative, read the "Y" material "Igor Schuvalov has ordered to prepare food cards".

The names of companies are provided in accordance with Russian rules and standards of "Y".
At the time of publication, the rating is possible to change the status of managers and companies.
Comfortable investment rate is 10-13 per cent.
According to experts, the low and medium-sized loan market in January-April was 40 per cent.
What is the situation today, according to your estimates?
After the end of 2014 panic, the IMB loans were significantly reduced.
The reason is clear: rapid increase in interest rates.
Loaning under 25 to 30 per cent of the year was not profitable.
If the bank had previously been able to raise all its possible problems in the future, from time to return, it is now impossible to do so: the rates and so cloudful.
For business, the current level of IMB loans is uncomfortable.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their occupation.
The rate of 10 to 13 per cent would allow business to invest in a wide range of projects and create attractive income.
How satisfied is the demand of entrepreneurs for loans, according to your estimates?
After the CB rate decreased, the situation had a little improved.
The credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, the clients have become much rare.
First of all, business does not understand the prospects of its development and future income.
Today the business has one way: you need to learn how to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
We need to monitor the current results, monitor the movement of money.
At the same time, new technologies that can modernize equipment, reduce production and energy costs should be used with financial resources.
All of this, eventually, allows companies to make production more competitive and maintain business even in an unstable economic situation.
What basic trends of IFRS credit markets will be strengthened and affected by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The projection to reduce the medium rate will depend on the policy of the Central Bank, and the regulator now demonstrates the sequence of the reduction of the key rate.
However, the radical decline of credit prices for IMB should not be expected.
In the current situation, the problem is primarily the inflation, which makes the necessary increase in the interest rate to obtain real income.
Furthermore, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even when the BC rates are lowered.
With regard to the expiry level, traditionally small and medium-sized enterprises limited both to fund funds and economic adjustments would be a greater risk for creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the share of bad credits.
The main reason is that international sanctions and their negative impact on the economy of the country.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That's how the word Mazda is written by Japanese characters.
Beautiful, crushly and at the same time difficult for those who are used to the quiril or Latin.
So is the new CX-5, as well as any other mark model: without exhaustion, attractive outside, technically completed inside.
The Japanese is simply in its "japanese" capable of bringing a commitment to the articles of the State of the Increasing Sun until the full excitement.
Any arguments can be made for vehicles from other countries, and a person will agree in principle with these arguments, but all the talks will be dissolved from the final phrase, "But this is a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people are likely to love not only technology but all other Japanese.
Cite from Base's moves, cleaning up food, collecting catalogues and clothing your girlfriend -- no, not kimono, of course, but on the canons of the streets of Japanese fashion: sweet, creative and very unexpected.
Apparently, the Japanese school shape is the only form that girls wear with pleasure and after school.
It has amazing qualities: at the same time sensitive and strict.
And the older a girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of CX-5 is the radiator retina with five horizontal lines.
But whereas a new drawing of lamps and rear lamps changes the vehicle’s shape, the vehicle will be recognised in the current of the vehicle.
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
Siluette is harmonious, shapes are sensitive, but the appearance is a strike.
I don't have to call the police.
CX-5, one of the most safest in the world, can be experienced only a standical Japanese calm.
The diesel engine of 2.2 l provides a high rotating point in a wide range of speeds.
The fuel consumption of 175 Lt.- 5.9 Lt. is compiled with an exclusive automatic transmission and full transmission.
Black shoes, black coat, black bag...
In order to add a little black humor to this image, you can select legins from the Not Cross police tape.
In Mazda, however, the maximum effort was made to prevent you from driving CX-5 from becoming in the place of your own DTP.
In order to further improve the comfort by maintaining excellent governance, the collapse reconstructed the construction of the front and rear amortizers, as well as optimized the form of the plugs of the front below.
The system of full device is adapted under Russian conditions.
High-speed noise rates from road and engines are reduced by 13 per cent.
A swimming bath in flowers or bars is as boring as a budget sedan.
It's different if the girl's screwing in a bath with an original painting.
For example, from a computer game in a role-fighter genre.
She'll have no less attention than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 design has improved both front and rear seats, providing the optimum spatial stock for both broad shoulders and for long legs.
Still, the long legs will appreciate that the struggles in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and not beat on the irons in the expressions.
The widest set of active security systems is proposed for CX-5.
In order to identify the potential threat, the radars, lasers and cameras are used.
There is also a adaptive lighting, and a warning of accommodation from the trail, and monitoring of the dead zones, and a safe brake.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best luggages in class.
The convenient, with the minimum performance, includes a load of 561 l. The back seats are in the proportion of 4:2:4 and each section is supplied by a separate retail - and increases the luggage range to 1560 l.
The hero of the multifilm suit in Japan is called "kigurums".
Especially, it looks like a peanut pijama.
It's all in it!
Of course I'm sleeping.
But also entertaining little children.
Or just walking through that beast in the street...
Because it's so great when there's a chance to choose -- a fun dress, a manner of conduct or a car.
Thank you for your help in preparing the Kawaicat store.
Kiev broke the atomic union.
Kiev officially refused Ukraine to cooperate with Russia on the construction of the AECE Hmelish.
The Supreme Council, however, voted on the breakdown of the agreement with Moscow on Wednesday with the second attempt.
The agreements on the construction of the Third and Fourth Blocks have been signed in 2010-2012, but it has not been possible to implement the project.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Council of Ukraine adopted a law that circulated the agreement with the RF on the construction of the third and fourth branch at the AECE Hmelica.
The bill made by the Government has only been made from the second vote, and for the first time 210 delegates had been supported at the minimum of 226, but then 234 members of Parliament voted for the draft.
The first project of the EESC, based at SSSR, had to be four energy clouds of 1 GWT with BERR reactors, but only two were able to build.
Construction negotiations with Moscow led to an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, and in 2011-2012 the Council adopted the relevant laws.
Since no funds were in the Ukraine budget, it was expected that the blocks would have to be credited by the Russian party, but the funds had not been allocated.
After the turnover in Kiev in February 2014 and the following cooling in the relations of two Kiev countries, Moscow in the atomic industry began to distort relations with Moscow, declineing to cooperate on the AECE Hmelica and on the construction project in Ukraine of the nuclear fuel factory.
The only sphere where relations remained remained in the RF of fuels for the current Ukrainian AES (provided about half of the production of electricity in the country), as so far the Ukrainian NACE Energy Replace Russian supply with nothing.
The plans for the construction of the AECE Hmeless with another contractor in Ukraine have not been finalised: negotiations with the Czech Scoda JS were made in Kiev in 2014.
UN Gensek against the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
The UN Secretary-General Pan Gi Moon reported during the press conference that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
"The military decision is not available," the AP responds to the question of Syria ' s military support by Russia.
Mr. Gi Moon also informed that he would meet with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Permanent Members of the Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the MID of permanent UNB member countries later this month.
"The meeting will be in Syria," he said.
Earlier today, the Deputy Chief of Genstab WC, Nicolai Bogdanovski, reported that Genstab did not exclude the possibility of creating a future BBC base in Syria.
There's no plans yet.
"But anything may be," said Mr. Bogdanovski.
U previously reported that the United States did not trust the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, who stated that military assistance was necessary for the official Damascus to combat the Forbidden Terrorist Group of the Islamic State.
For more details about the US doubts about the Russian Syrian assistance, read the " U " Russian military presence in Syria concerns Washington " .
The OSCE reports on the possible meeting of Ukraine and Russia parliamentarians.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine at the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) of OSCE, Arthur Gerazimov, reported the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in South-Eastern Ukraine.
"What I know: a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," TASS quotes Mr. Herasim.
He also called for the implementation of mine agreements and "to return to the normal viability of our countries".
On his view, whether dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level is currently possible in the " Normand format" or in the form of a contact group on the PA OSCE PLAN, Mr. Gerasimov, observed that dialogue was held, there were mine agreements.
At the same time, according to politics, in Kiev, all kinds of dialogue are supported.
Previously, the representative of Ukraine at the negotiations, the former President of the Leonid Kutchma said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugan Republics had not changed their positions in three-sided negotiations, but the tone of dialogue has become more positive.
The parties have given mandates.
Last night, the electoral commission of the Lower Novograd ended elections in the municipal district's municipal opinion, distributing 12 deputy mandates played on the party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of infringements during elections have been made by the representatives of the CPRF accused of the "covering of fakes".
No observations of the opposition have been accepted.
He also rejected the Russian Communist Party in the organization of a referendum on the cancellation of the salary for cappremont of multi-party houses.
The city's election officially presented the results of the elections in the pride of the Lower Newgrode on the municipal electoral district.
The list of voters in the Netherlands was totally included 1.03 million, a vote of 746.7 thousand voted in the section commission, and voted at 268.000 voters.
More than 11.7 thousand bullents were recognized inappropriately and 24 were lost.
12 mandates have been allocated yesterday to political parties, depending on the votes received.
According to the lists of the Single Russia, six deputy seats are proudly devoted to Dmitri Svatkovski, Dmitrij Krasnov, Vasilia Schupranov, Elizabeta Solonchenko, Vecheslav Rasteryev and Igor Nagorn.
The only mandate of LDPR was received by the leader of the Party, Vladimir Žirinovski.
The two mandates of the CPRF are allocated between Vladimir Boulanov and the deputy of the State Alexander Tarnev.
The three mandates of the Just Russia are reached to Alexander Razmutovski, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates should determine whether they will be deputies in the city's opinion: if he refuses the mandate, he will go to the next candidate for the portlist.
The Chairman of the Gorizbirk Alexander Makeev informed the members of the Commission that he introduced offices for " transfer of telegrams to the Gerinovski and other things" for the purpose of refusal of mandates.
In the approval of the election protocol, the representatives of the CFCM have declared multiple violations.
Leonid Rednokutski, a corporate member, with the right of a meeting vote from CPRF, suggested not to recognize the outcome of the vote in four districts No.21-24, recalling that, on order of the head of the Sormov district, the entry into the office of the four district commissions was closed.
The deputies of the Ghos were not able to go within for a long time, neither candidates nor observers nor observers, but the resonant scandal with the door of the administration was shown on the television.
At the meetings of the District Commissions, all observers and members of the Commission with the right of a meeting vote had the opportunity to attend.
The chair has only stopped access to them when the vote has been completed and the stationary commissions have not yet arrived to issue their bulletins.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
"Then the chapter was fixed, and interested persons could be present at all meetings," pared the member of the Mountains of Natalia Andrews.
Communists objected that more than four hours in the blocked building of the Administration had illegally held the deputy of the Zacca of the District of Ludmil Aristov, which made a statement to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also disturbed that a number of WICs in the day of elections began to print urnas at 6-7 a.m. by laying in them billboards for prior votes.
The members of the commissions with the right of a meeting vote and observer have not been informed, so they have already reached the elections at 8 a.m.
Communists are convinced that in the morning before the opening of the electoral stations, there were no control of the bulletins.
However, the mountains, which had already considered more than 124 complaints on various occasions, said Alexander Makeev, had not found any violations with the drop of unequivocated billents.
They did not support members of the commission and the proposal of their colleague from " Just Russia" by Maria Popov through the mulligence to exit with the revision of the regional legislation in order to clearly establish the time for an autopsy of conversions with prior votes, which then fall within the urnition.
"In order of your own initiative, at least contact the CIC," advised Mrs. Popov Aleksandr Makeev.
At the end of the meeting of the Chairperson with loud accusations, a member of the CPRF, Sergei Samohin, shouting that he ignores dozens of complaints and covers the fakes in elections.
"You're not on the quest, be careful!", the president of the election has offended.
The protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
By 27 September, the selection should approve the general results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the city's thought of the Neighbourhood of the Sixth Convention will be appointed within three weeks.
In addition to determining the outcomes of the elections, the City Electoral Commission rejected the political party of the Communists of Russia in the registration of a local referendum initiative group.
According to the documents, the parties were going to discuss the following two questions: Do they agree that the collections for multi-party houses should be " cancelled immediately" and the tariffs for housing-communal services "frozen until 2020".
However, Irina Maslava's legal opinion explained that the treatment of the Communists of Russia was contrary to legislation.
FedEx is a mixed nature, reduction in forecasts for 2016.
The FedEx reported the uncomfortable results of the last quarter, and the giant delivery service reduced the annual income forecast due to the drop of demand for transport services and the increase of costs in its land transport units.
The company also stated that it planned to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At the same time, last year, FedEx reported that it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Its shares were approximately 2,5 per cent in preliminary trades 45 minutes before the opening of the market in the Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that she plans to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the financial year, which ends next May, by 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
The analysts suggested $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The reduction of the projection is observed despite the average increase of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and the increase of collections for land transport of heavy or gabarital goods starting in November.
The company stated that it was still planning to increase delivery compared to the last year by reducing costs, increases in gross income and online trade growth.
The Chairman and the CEO Fred Smith stated that the company " worked stablely in light of the weak, compared to the forecast, economic conditions, especially in production and world trade " .
The workforce plans for the holidays were announced the next day after the competitive statement, UPS, that they planned to hire additional 95,000 employees, as much as they had taken to work last year.
For a quarter ended on 31 August, the FedEx earned 692 million dollars, 6 per cent more than a year earlier.
The share income amounted to $2.42 close to the average projection of $2.44 for the share conducted by the Zacks Investment Research survey by 12 analysts.
The income increased by 5 per cent, to $12.3 billion.
Six Zacks analysts suggested $12.23 billion.
The FedEx has been affected in recent years of decline in the urgent international transport sector, which has resulted in the lack of gross income in its express-traffic units.
However, the shopping boom on the Internet has improved the results in the FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport delivery increased by 29 per cent, but the operating income remained totally unchanged due to increased costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
The Transport Expression Division has received higher income due to higher base rates, while the goods sector has dropped due to increased labour costs.
In preliminary trades, about an hour before the FedEx markets were opened dropped by $3.85 or 2.5 per cent - up to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday by falling by 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the 11 June record.
At the most expected meeting in a few years, the Federal Reserve System leaders will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table from the Honduras Red Tree, deciding whether it is not time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end, a richly decorated room for meetings at two floors above the United States will be drawn up with a walled image.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Jeanette L. Yelen and her colleagues, should place the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank received a double commission from the Congress: maximize employment in the United States and maintain stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the Federal System leaders recognized that there was also a third, unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third assignment may be an unknown factor in the almost predicted decision that will be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to distract the unprecedented incentive provided by almost zero short-term interest rate from the end of 2008.
Even though most data show a reliable growth in the economy, recent financial market shocks can also prevent the precautionary leaders of the Federal System from adding volatility by raiseing a basic rate on federal funds, even at a quarter of a percentage.
"The market of labour and inflation will clearly become the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsay M. Peegza, the chief economist of the Stifel Nicolaus & Co broker company.
"I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise the rates that increased indetermination around the world market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she noted.
There is no consensus about what they will do in the Federal Reserve System, which itself provokes the deficiencies of the financial market.
Approximately half of the economists recently questioned Bloomberg had predicted an increase in the interest rate this week.
The financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to avoid this, while the key indicator shows only about 30 per cent the probability of rapid rising.
This may lead to a fall in the stock market if the Federal system raises the rate, provided that those who make decisions will not mitigate the promise that the next increase will be soon.
On Tuesday, the Doe-Johns index rose to 228.89, or 1.4 per cent, to 16.599.85.
The flight was provoked by the expectations that people defining the Federal System Strategy would leave a bet this week," said John Lonski, the main economist of the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"We will be surprised if the Federal System increases the rates at this point," he noted.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve System does so, “they will have to go far into the approval of their strategy to keep the financial markets in their hands so that they do not panic”.
Other experts objected that the improvement of the rate could relieve the financial markets, as this would eliminate the uncertainty of how the Federal System would act.
A month ago, the Federal system seemed to be inclined to raise 0.25 per cent in this month, making the first small step in slowly decreasing financial conditions, which could reaffirm the stability of the United States recovery.
Yelen claimed in spring and early summer that she was expecting to increase the rate this year, despite the complaints of Liberals of the need for greater economic progress.
While new jobs were slowed in August, labour market growth was stable this year.
Unemployment decreased to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest rate in more than seven years, and almost at the level that the Federal System considers full employment.
Increasing wages shows signs of acceleration.
And while the inflation continues to be below the year-indicated central bank at 2 per cent, the Federal System ' s leadership stated that the key cause was the temporary impact of a rapid oil price drop.
The economy "may be dealt with higher rates, and it is needed, taking into account the reduction of labour markets," observed Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets throughout the world began to shake at the end of the last month, after China devaluated its currency.
The average Dou-Johns Index for Industrial Company shares fell at 16 per cent relatively high in May, as the investors were afraid that the slowdown of Chinese economy could stop global growth.
The market partially renewed its positions in this month, and the Dou-Johns index is now about 10 per cent below the mai value.
For the leadership of the Federal Reserve System, the market disturbance is further complicated with the ultimate calculations of an increase in the interest rate.
"In the absence of information about what happened on the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would be revolving the gates at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher of UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former staff member of the Federal Reserve System.
Now, according to his predictions, they will wait at least a month to get more control of the consequences.
"There is a great uncertainty in the impact of the American economy, and they are almost uncertain after the recent events in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not part of the main concerns of the Federal System and should not be technically taken into account in these decisions.
But in fact, the Federal Reserve System has become a global financial authority.
The Central Bank ' s impact has been enormous in recent years.
One only indication from the then President Ben S. Bernanca in 2013 that the Federal Reserve System could " suppress" its cash expansion, caused market shocks throughout the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly confused, it could be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve System will not only monitor developments everywhere but also consult other Central Banks and Experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is "faster art than science," said Zakari Karabel, head of Envestnet Inc, a global management strategy.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve System, there were cases of excessive reaction to the movements of the financial market, which seem not to be related to economic principles”.
Laker, a member with the right to vote of the influential Federal Committee on the Open Market, insisting on the increase in the rate, presented decisions 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led to the fact that the Federal System has reduced its base rate by 0.75 per cent for three meetings, "with the limited identifiable consequences for growth in the United States," Laker said.
A year later, the leaders of the Federal System canceled these reductions.
The Federal Reserve System should be placed first to care for stability only during major crises, such as market collapse in 2008," said Adam S. Pozen, former member of the Bank's interest rate committee.
The last panic was not close to that level, he said.
"You would certainly not like to be in a situation where you are frightened by the growth of the rates because the markets are in shock," said Pozen, President of the World Economy Institute, Peterson.
The Federal Reserve System Act continues to have a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until this changes, I don't think they should be subject to events.

The Spiker of the Sergey Narškin states that the United States is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East so that refugee waves will be destabilised in Europe.
According to the Interfax, he expressed that view to journalists in Ulan-Bator in the falling session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a participant of conspiratory theories, but the question is: Is not Europe the final goal of those who have destabilised the situation in North Africa and the Middle East in recent years?" he asked.
"Surely, someone had assumed and knew that the streams of refugees, these unhappy and disappointed people who were saved from death, would go to the safe countries of the EU," he added.
Narskin asked, "Have many European political leaders spoken frankly about the causes of the crisis, the wave of refugees, which is now literally abusing their countries?"
"No, old Europe, except rarely, prefers to keep silent," he stated.
According to Naribskkin, NATO has fostered many European values and standards of international law.
"The Europe, unfortunately, has long and impartially looked at and viewed how the military saphogues sewed under NATO standards are also declined by moral ideals and fundamental principles and standards of international law," the speaker stressed.
Government forces and their loyal military formation are opposed to rebels mainly of Islamist.
Later, a terrorist group “Islamic State” joined the opponents of the Syrian Government in Russia.
The United States supports the rebels that oppose Asada and IG.
The official Damascus considers such rebels terrorist.
The President of Syria referred to the reason why the West was unnecessary to Russia.
The claims of the West to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign States.
This view was expressed by Syrian President Bashar Assad in interviews with RT, the First Channel, Russia 24, NTV, Russia today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners and sovereign States.
In these countries, he wished to remove one person and place another to act for Western countries rather than for his family, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sharp deployment of Western media with the beginning of the turning in Ukraine.
He said that the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, “evolved from a friend of the West to the enemy, the king, the dictator, who suppressed the Russian opposition, which came to power in a non-democratic way, despite the choice of the democratic elections recognised in the West”.
Putin called on the world community to combine forces with Assad to combat the Islamic State.
While commenting on the constant statements of the West that Assad himself must leave, he noted that the president came to the authorities with the consent of the people, through the elections, and if it was declined, on the request of the people, rather than by the United States, the Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communication.
"If the people want him to stay, the president remains, and otherwise he should leave immediately," he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and reminded them of their cooperation.
Syria also fought terrorism with neighbouring Iraq.
Speaking of military support by Iran, the Syrian leader noted that the country supported the Syrian State in politics, economics and military areas.
He objected to allegations that Iranian military units were sent to Syria.
Teheran gives us military techniques.
"Naturally, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out," he explained.
With regard to the rest of the States, we are open to cooperate with any of them in a serious desire to combat terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorism and anti-igil coalition, the United States known," said Asad.
The number of victims has exceeded 230 000, the number of refugees is 11.5 million.
Part of the territories was taken by the terrorist group of the Islamic State, which was prohibited in Russia.
The international coalition headed by the United States is inducing air strikes in the IG position.

Braday called the information of the American newspaper a blame on Arrow.
Former President of the Government of the Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Broday, denied the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He made a telephone interview with the Lenta.ru correspondent.
The note in Washington Post is beautiful by the fact that it's all overwhelmed.
The former Minister for Defence of DNR, Igor Strekov, of course, had not linked and " left" from the territory of the Republic of Donbass in a very approximate mood, without ropes, without three funds of money that are allocated to him by different characters," he noted.
According to Broadhai, the talk of Arrowkeeper in the talk with the American newspaper.

Broadway emphasized that he did not know why a correspondent of the American publication decided to write that the Arrows had been expelled to Russia ' s territory ' s " connected " .
I suspect it's a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, it is surprisingly misrecognized because I stressed that the Arrows were leaving alone," said Broadway.
"It's a blame on me and on the Arrow," he concluded.
Previously on The Washington Post pages, a article contained in the words of Broadhai that he was carrying Shooky to the territory of Russia in force.
According to the publication, Broadway noted that he had been forced to link his associate.
The Polish authorities came to search for a train with the gold of Nazis.

There may be weapons and valuable minerals within trains.
On 31 August, the Governor of the Polish Lower Guide Thomas Smolarz (Tomas Smolarz) assumed that the new evidence of the existence of a gold train was nothing more convincing than the previous.
However, the authorities decided to explore the search area.
Three days before that, the Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland, Peter Zuchovski, stated that local finders with "likely 99 per cent" found the same train with the gold of the Third Raich, as described in the legends.
The Buchowski noted that, if allegations are confirmed and precious, they would be owned by a public execution, while the treasures would not be transferred to Russia.
In the middle of August, two legal clients contacted the authorities of the Poland city of Walbji, reporting that the train was found in a frozen tunnel at 70 meters depth.
The chief narcoticist of RF suggested that the sale of tobacco to persons before 21 years of age be prohibited.

He's been mentally prepared for full life in society since he was 21 years old.
"It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemy is finally mature until 21 years," said Brun.
Previously, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the " Treawa Russia" project, Sultan Hamzaev, informed the Notifications, that Mathvienko supported the initiative to increase the age price in the sale of alcohol and " agreed with the Public Chamber to re-establish this issue at the top of the parliamentary Chamber".

It will begin reading the Bible, which has not been done before.
The Brazilian Union of Pediatrics Riu-Grandi promotes healthy food for breastfeeders
The Brazilian pediatric organization of SPRS has designed a scandal method to convince women about the need for full food during breast-feeding: the method implies the demonstration of infant breast paintings of harmful food.
The breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbons, from which children receive all the foodstuffs they need to form a strong immune system.
With regard to high energy needs, pregnancy and birth women are recommended to increase the daily calories by approximately 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study showed that one increase in calority is not the only change in the diet that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, Professor of Medical Faculty of Baylor in Texas revealed that healthy nutrition of pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, there was a negative impact on the immune system of the child.
Under Hamburg, a school bus was scattered by the train.

Some children began to cry and run along the side.
The route is still locked.
According to the police, no one was miraculously hurt but one train passenger who had been injured.

The doctors are calling to ban the box.
The Guide of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called upon to ban a box in the country after the death of a local athlete David Brown's younger.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown ended from the injuries received in the fight against the Philippine Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles on the version of the International Box Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 pounds past Friday was completed by the Nocauth of Magali in the 12th Round.
Brown got in a hospital with a brain trauma.
His condition was evaluated as critical and was connected to the life-sustained equipment.
At the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, only two defeats, and one battle was destroyed.
He's got two children left.
This is the second case of a summer outcome among Australian boxers in the past six months.
In March, a 23-year-old Bradon Smith student died from the injuries received in the ring.
AMA now recommends not to do this type of sport, but rather, in her view, to ban it at all.
I understand that this is happening uninterestedly," said the Vice-President of Steven Parnis.
But in a way in which a box is now, there will always be situations where a sportsman gets bleeding or brain trauma, which either leads to death or severe damage.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that combines practising doctors and medical students.
Sergei Narškin called on the OSCE to cancel sanctions against RF parliamentarians.
The Spiker of the State of RF Sergej Narškin referred to inadmissible sanctions against parliamentarians.
He stated that, speaking at the OSCE session in Ulan-Bator.
We appreciate this as inadmissible acts, as an invasion of the value of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this should not be repeated, because it is the manifestation of political embarrassment and ignorance of the principles of open international dialogue," said the politician.
Furthermore, Narishkin called on the PA OSCE participants to restore the partnership of Russia and the EU.
Let's get morals back to politics.
Let's return the dialogue and the right to the practice of international communication.
Let's return humanistic ideals to the democratic world.
"The two things have never ended well," he said.
While speaking from the Tribunal of the Parliamentary Assembly, the Russian State speaker called on parliamentary parliamentary to convene the inter-paramental contact group on Ukraine.
I urge the members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security tasks.
"Firstly, the authorization of the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parlamentary group," Nariškin said.
He also noted that the OSCE should be given due respect.
"It is almost the only common place where we discuss how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," a politician stressed.
Recall, the fall session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulan-Bator, and would extend until 18 September.
Enjoyed the victory for a couple of days.
Peace champion Sergej Schubenkov.
This season can be called triumphable for a 24-year-old leaflet from Barnaul Sergei Shubenkov.
At its coronary distance, he was able to win 110 meters with barriers at the European command primary, to set several records and to become a world champion, with the first in the history of the country's barrier spring.
Furthermore, the sportsman recently won the final stage of the Briliant League, taking the third seat in general.
The New Notifications have requested Shubenkov to share the impressions of the outgoing season.
Sergei, aren't the season finished for you yet?
Yeah, I'm going to play the World Military Games that will go to Korea on October, and then I'll think about resting.
Truly, I'm going to be at home in Barnaul, and being at home is a different condition.
It's easier than going around the world every week.
You once said the autumn was the favorite time of the year for you.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a great time.
The passion after the main start of the season was distracted, and the burden of responsibility was no longer pressured.
You can argue for pleasure, "relax."
Plus, you know the vacation is very soon...
Do you have tired?
It's a special season, a mass of positive emotions...
The tiredness at the end of the season is always accumulated.
And it doesn't matter what I did more, win or lose.
Each competition is stress.
Permanent flying, moving, all of this doesn't pass for the body inherently.
You're getting up physically and emotional.
But now, of course, I have emotions on the rise.
I'm just happy!
Until you finished the world champion in Beijing, are you going back often?
It happens.
And you, journalists, don't let me forget it.
But at all, I think that the bad sportsman who lives in old victories is screwing his successful races over and over.
Enjoyed the victory of a couple or three days, and we have to move on.
Was the preparation for this wonderful season much different from the usual?
I can't say there was something so special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter competitive season.
He was training at home at Barnaule first, then at the gatherings, and then back home.
It's like usual.
But the trainer was assigned to try to get to a new level that I hadn't been at.
Almost all the winter time spent to build the base.
They raced a lot of crosses, exercised in generally physical training, which included both the weight and the seat, and we stretched our back.
Then they took a barrier training, a lot of techniques.
Did you follow how the rivals are speaking?
I'm always trying to do this, and there's no problem in the Internet era.
The winter championship of Europe was watched and the French were taken in the barrier sprit!
And I thought we had to do something, dissolve this company.
With every start in this season, you add and add the results.
Did that make sure?
I have all the last seasons in the same pattern.
There's no way I run 13.20 first and then 13.50.
I'm always scratching my shape gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was run away from 13 seconds.
The whole work was first aimed at this.
But the paradox is that you feel like you're ready to move, and you're not always ready to show your readiness.
How was that, for example, at the Olympics in London?
Honestly, that half-final race (Shubenkov) couldn't get to the final. I tried to forget at once.
It was very good, I could really escape from 13 seconds.
Even if he repeated his best results at that point, it would be a bronze prize of Games.
But it wasn't lucky.
Do you remember your first world championship?
What about it?
It was in Tag.
I really wanted to get into the finals then, it was a maximum program.
And he went away from tomorrow, in preliminary races.
Then I realized that breaking and breaking your head means not getting anywhere.
Two years later, the world championship in Moscow has already arrived in the final with the best time.
I remember my feelings before the crucial race: I wanted to win the gold!
How is it possible to keep your head off by developing a good speed, not losing your head?
And this is the most complicated thing.
We need to be very careful, focused on the technique so that we don't have barriers.
I noticed that when you're set up not for the result, but for the process, it's much easier.
And the most awesome when you feel like you're running and it's like you do it!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the depth after their first major successes seek to move closer to the capital.
Haven't you ever thought like that?
It's better at home anyway.
I don't know where I am without my coach, who needs me?
Maybe it would be good to have better conditions, but I'm trying to be satisfied with what I have.
Are you with Klevz long ago?
Since I was 12 years old, since I came to a light athlete.
In fact, first I trained his wife, who worked with her children, and then she gave me over.
I started with a sprint, then jumped into length, three.
The child's multiborder was, when the ball was thrown, jumped to the longest of the place...
At 14, he tried to run with barriers, and I liked it.
Since the first race, the standard of the second adult level has been fulfilled.
That's what he's left.
There's never been fear of barriers?
Someday I got to make a deal with them.
But the technique has always had to work a lot.
There's a struggle over how much he's been in trouble!
But there's nothing to do with this routine.
Technology has to be retracted all the time, so I could wake up at night, I got up and run through barriers.
Everyone who saw your race in Beijing claims that it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I usually don't check my races, and I couldn't stay here.
But the efficiency needs to continue - there are no limits of perfection.
Don't you fear now that the victory for a year before the Olympic Games is lying on the shoulder with a heavy load?
As they say in such cases, I will try to justify the expectations.
If you chose this road, you'll have to go to the end.
My coach likes to say, "If you're not a weak, you don't have to feel any extra goods."
And I totally agree with him.
Otar Kushanashville
Well, I'm not so naive that I'm surprised by the response to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are mad, I understand they don't feed their bread. Come on.
And although I didn't get a flag, the same thing I said, like, a million times here, and I didn't call anyone a bastard, I was hit by another one.
All my pseudo-friends went out in a second.
The pressing I'm so strong that even I, who gave the types of boys, think people are white.
It's like walking, walking, and you've been attacked by a crowd, and you've got a bunch of sticks.
But you need to know me, I'm not a bedroom eagle, I'm gonna hit my head, I'm old, guys, afraid.
The other case is no support.
I didn't have any illusions, and now...
I've always had the best self-sufficiency, so you'll bite.
And giving passports to people like Fred Derst or Monson, only assholes can.
I'd rather I, the best journalist, work is embarrassed.
A week ago, in Kiev, Otar Kuchanashvili, in a sharp form, described the Crimean events:
What they did with the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call anxiety.
I believe that the reference to how the dried chrushchevs tried to sign something is not incorporated into the common picture of the human council.
It's like coming to the neighbor and picking up his place...
The war of the Kremlin went away, and it'll end only there.
I'm almost 100% convinced that, as in the summer of 2008, she started calling some Kremlin son of a bitch.
I have a guess who this could be...
Cobson doesn't have much to live.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin' hands.
Is he gonna lose the apartment?
Well, he's got a monument.
Of course, people remembered him as annoying his little family.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovic.
Sunrise of the Seventh leads in the rating despite the attempts of the Ninth to light the loss of leaders in Today Show
The exit of Carl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to light the consequences of the Liberal Party's statement on the release of the leadership was unable to highly raise the rating of Today.
The morning show of the Ninth was transmitted from the capital of the State after the deployment of Malcolm Turnbull Tony Abbott.
The contest - Sunrise - with the leading David Koh and Samantha Armitage, was stuck in London in a weekly series of international talks, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This torture appears to have no big importance for Australian televisioners, while Sunrise's audience was 397,000 in five largest cities compared to Today's audience at 339,000.
Today a little more compared to its rating on Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today, Sunrise's breakdown has been reduced in recent months.
In August today there was 318,000 compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
In the beginning of the year, the break was between 40,000 and 50,000.
Until in September Sunrise has 349,000 viewers against Today's 314,000.
That's the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, boys!
Carl and Lisa are all right, thanks for the clarification!

Three finalists are unanimous that Sam Wood is a perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret is discovered? ...
Lana Jevon-Fellouse, Sarah McKay and Snowman Marcoski may have accidentally figured out who will win at the Holostic.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually stay in the Holostat, is surrounded by a secret curtain.
And the three girls who came to the final, of course keep silent about who had received his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McCay, Snow Marcoski and Lana Javons-Fellouse before the day that three girls have to remain two, they may have unhealthy given a tip about the winner.
Sam Wood keeps silence till the final is held on Thursday.
All three women are in a lyric mood, telling why Wood's perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, purpose, family values, living joy as reasons for which each of them would be happy to become his satellite.
But with their answers to the question, "If not you, who should have reached the last rose of Wood?", they could unwillingly tell who of them actually won the heart of the Holocaust.
Jeffens Fellows and Markoski, without doubt, called McCay a perfect couple for Wood.
There have been a good relationship between Sarah and Sam since the first day.
" Since I entered the number of participants, I felt the energy (Sarah) and Sam's energy and realized that they were very suitable, and I had no doubt about it throughout the show," said Jeffers Fellows.
"Sara is a very open man, with her easy and fun," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and there's a really attraction between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood will be a great couple.
McCay herself said that because of the home dates last week, she realized that Wood might be the "he's the man".
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it was not just a game -- I trusted him with all my heart," she said.
On the question of whom Vudu should be elected, if it wasn't her, she replied mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls equally, and Snow and Lana are equally worthy of it.

Jarrid Hayne had several options to start his career at NFL.
Detroit and Seattl were very interested in him since he moved to the United States, as well as many other clubs that sent requests after the impressive open-ended training day at the end of the last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsull, and it seems to be a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the spare chamber for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball that the former Australian League Leagues allowed at the first return of the pant in a victory game with Minnesota with the account of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another opportunity to return the pant, and also initiated it in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed himself on the good side and after the game, in the dressing room.
Instead of offering a disbursement to the new ones in the presence of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the press conference after the match.
The Special Reporter of the Club 49ers Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received support from the coordinator of Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget the lost ball and to think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayne lost the ball back by the Minnesota Wykings team during the first quarter.
At the beginning of the debute in NHL Hayne and its many Australian worshippers were obviously not counting.
It was seen as Hayne fought out of the field after losing the ball, and later he told the leading Hamish and Andy show at the Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1, that he couldn't imagine a more unfortunate start for his career in NFL.
"It happens, you're just thinking about the next game," said Hayne.
Hayne compared his failure to debute in the 2007 Origin games, when the ball drop in its initial zone was attempted to Queensland.
Finally, this experience was very useful for the 27-year-old player.
Hayne photographed the Australian flag and fans after the game and put a picture in Instagram.

"The defendants such as Vladimir Drinkman who have skills to break our computer networks are a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security," said US Prosecutor Paul Fishman.
Drinkman is in danger of 30 years of imprisonment and a million dollars fine.
The court will take into account the recognition of the Russian and may reduce the term.
The sentence to Drinkman will be announced on January 15th.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitri Smilian, was detained.
The latest guilty of the crimes he has incriminated.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk in support of the Russian regime Bashar Assad.
During a telephone conversation with the head of Russian MID, Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary John Kerry warned that the support of the Syrian President Bashar Assad has aggravated the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry made it clear that the support of Russia, President Assad, is risking accumulation and enlargement of the conflict, as well as to undermine our common goal to combat extremeism if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through the effective political transition of power," said the United States Department report.
Kerry confirmed the commitment of the United States to combat the grouping of the Islamic State (with which is prohibited in Russia by the Supreme Court) as a coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the Secretary-General, Assad " will never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Carrie also emphasized during the telephone conversation that the conflict in Syria could only be resolved by political transition from Asada.
In the White House, Russia was threatened by isolation because of the support of the Assad regime.
Before the press secretary of the White House, Joshua Ernest threatened Russia by isolation, unless it stopped supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to join an international coalition that conducts an anti-terrorism operation against the Islamic State.
The media have recently reported the presence of Russian soldiers in Syria.
The head of the Russian MID, Sergei Lavrov, stated that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and have helped Syrians to take technology to apply it against Islamists.
Four died when the police opened a gunshot on protesters in Nepal.
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in the south of Nepal when the police started shooting in a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution, as the official representative said on Wednesday.
Violence took place on Tuesday in Rupandea County, about 175 miles west of Katmandu, the capital of the country.
Bišnu Prasad Dakal, head of the District Police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters gathered from one of the police departments, some dropped stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dacal reported that the police used a tear gas, then shot in the air before they released rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is irrelevant why the rubber bullets that are known to be killed, but traditionally used as a less mortal alternative, caused such high mortality.
This struggle was the last few weeks of severe protests in the southern, plain part of Nepal, where madesian people claimed that new provinces formed by the new constitution would reduce their political influence.
The protests also passed in the west of Nepal, among the people of the people of the taru who want to have their state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in cruel conflicts, starting with 10
On August, when four main political parties signed a country-separation agreement in the province, which has become a crucial step towards the new constitution, but a very dispute issue in Nepal, which has been centralised for several centuries.
The work on the new constitution has been carried out since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after a destructive earthquake, which took thousands of lives in April.
The legislators voted for articles of the draft constitution in Katmandu this week, and the officials stated that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create a company at 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in Irkut.
It was built in the 70s of the past century as a chemical industry centre, has a developed infrastructure that requires systemic support.
A year ago, Sayansk led a new Mayor - Oleg Borowski.
The outcome of the first year of work, the new projects and the perspectives he told the correspondent " District " .
Oleg Valerjevich, why did you start working as a mayor?
First of all, I have learned the results of the financial and household checks, initiating an independent public expertise for local budget expenditure.
The audit of municipal property was then conducted.
One of the first practical steps was the reduction of documentation to five days.
Previously, instant papers could have been walking for months.
The activities to increase the income base and to optimize costs have been developed.
In November, last year, in Sayansk, the Government was held a trip to the social and economic development of the Territory.
There was no project-count documentation in the city for no object.
Without that, Sayansk could not participate in federal programmes.
We started with the preparation of PSDs for roads, the garden of children, the northern sewer collector and the water.
The road work in the two stations are now ongoing.
How does the city comply with the order of the President of the RF on the construction of child gardens?
In July this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
Such positive demographic has not been observed in the city for the last 27 years.
So the issue of security of places in children's gardens is one of the most important today.
Since 1 September, he closed up for capital repair of 10 children, based on 320 seats.
The cost of repair is 86 million rubles.
Such funds has never been received before.
Last year after the repair, a child garden No. 23, which is currently visiting 200 children, was opened.
The repair was made under the conditions of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, which cost more than 67 million rubles.
The efforts of the Administration and the assistance of the regional Government have helped to purchase furniture and equipment, and the National Initiatives programme.
There are plans to begin the construction of a new child garden in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the number of children aged between 1,5 and 3 years.
We don't have a row for children from three to seven years.
Are the investors interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that the construction of the city must be done, first of all, by the Sayanic enterprises, is the one that needs to be provided with work.
In October, the 60-rent home for orphans in Leningradian micro-ray has already been issued.
With regard to the construction, I would add that Sayansk was one of the four Priangary cities, who entered the programme for housing with a class.
All the necessary documentation is prepared.
The building of 90 blocks will begin soon.
We have generally announced the construction of 10,000 square meters of the Housing to participate in the programme very much.
One of the conditions is that the housing must not be more than 30,000 rubles per one square meter, and that is the value of the "pod key".
If we deal with these amounts, we will continue to participate in the programme.
With regard to investors, we have other interesting projects.
In time, the Saian pig complex was built in the Territory, which was sold for no price in 2004.
We're working with the prosecutor's prosecution.
Moreover, the land under the object is in federal property.
The work with Moscow is addressed by the issue of transfer of 88 ga to the area, with the subsequent transfer of the land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor ready to invest in the reconstruction and launch of a project of 1,5 billion rubles.
We'll have 900 workplaces with a pig-complex rifle, which will be a big backup for the city.
Is the Institute of Social Partnership developed in Sayansk?
We have about 140 socio-economic partnership treaties.
Many projects have been implemented through the active social position of business representatives.
Remarkable support is provided by enterprises such as ZO East-Centre, New Winter Technology, OOO Sayanic Numberer, OOO MDF, the leadership of these enterprises is responding to all treatments.
Right to the Day of OOO, the Saiyan numberer gave the city a child city, the East Center firm conducted the repair of the horse yard, where specialists were working with children of ipatherapy, spent more than 1 million rubles.
As a result of sponsorship, the urban ZHS territory has been equipped.
Sponsors helped to mark the Day of the City.
As in old times, there was a parade with urban collectives and organizations.
The magazine of the city, the book of the Sayan poets, was released.
The originals and people who have contributed seriously to the development of Sayanska have provided jubilee medals.
The funds also participate in the urban charitable fund.
The first step was to acquire tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months, over 800,000 rubles are aimed at supporting talented boys, helping children who need expensive treatment, supporting children from low-insuranced families.
How are staff problems dealt with in the social sphere in Sayansk?
There are no doctors and teachers in the city.
Professional housing is of great importance to deal with the personnel.
In the past year, we allocated five apartments for doctors, and we received four teachers.
We have a housing programme to privatize it in five years.
Plans are to replant a building that will build eight more educational apartments.
The teachers and doctors are also involved in the Russian family ' s Gillie programme.
In the prospect of building homes for budgetary workers.
The most important thing is that there is a working team in town with which I can deal with the most complex issues.
It is important for all the crises to make the right conclusions and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayanski and our region is large.
In Domu, a draft law on the indexing of sociality, taking into account the growth of prices.
The State has introduced a draft law that provides for the indexing of social pensions annually from 1 February, taking into account the growth of prices.
The author, the deputy of the Just Russia, Alexander Lomakin-Rumanians, also invites to make additional pension index on 1 April, if the rate of living minimal growth exceeds the growth of prices for goods and services.
Indexation of socialities, according to the current legislation, is produced annually from 1 April, taking into account the growth of the retirement minimum in the RF for the past year.
The draft law introduced to the Lower Chamber provides for the introduction of social pension indexing, taking into account consumer price growth rates.
The first indexation shall be carried out on 1 February and the second shall be held on 1 April.
The PA OSCE head stated that Mogerini was not allowed to introduce sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the Supreme Representative of the European Union on Foreign Affairs of the Federation, Mogerini, a speaker of PA OSCE Ilkka Canerva, stated that sanctions against legislators involved in the Assembly activities were not permitted.
A member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the PA OSCE in Ulan-Bator Nikolay Kowalev was informed of this.
According to TASS, the European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, were gathered in support of the position of Canerva.
"The strong support has already been formed," said Kowalev.
He had previously stated that the PA OSCE chapter had intended to collect the signatures of the deputies that indicated the inadmissibility of the introduction of sanctions against parliamentarians.
In particular, noted Kowalev, Canerva promised to raise this problem to the level of European Union leadership and " send the relevant petition".
NHC reports that the probability of cyclone to the south of Green Mis is 60 per cent
The wide front of the low pressure area is about 350 miles (560 km) south of the south of the Green Cape Islands has the possibility of 60 per cent of converting into the tropical cycle for the next 48 hours, reported on Tuesday the National Centre of U.S. hurricane.
Another clear low pressure area between Green Mis and Small Antilles also has the 60 per cent probability of creating a tropical cyclone in the next two days, reports synoptics from Miami.
Google launches a doubling campaign for the collection of 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the launch of a double-up campaign intended for a collection of 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations that helped the European countries capture refugees that are running from war and measuring countries.
Google used a non-specific personal approach by advocating a campaign to collect donations in its blog.
Instead of making a statement from one of the leaders, Google Rita Masud, who fled with the Cabul family when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We were on suspicious trains and buses, famine, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But since the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has increased, many people such as my family are desperately in need of help.
The sacrifices will be transferred to four non-commercial organizations assisting refugees and migrants: " Doctors without borders", the International Rescue Committee, the Organization Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million until the amount on the google.com/refugeerelief would reach $11 million.
Europe opposes the strongest crisis with refugees since the Second World War, caused by a majority of four-year civil war in Syria, which has moved over four million people this year.
Many also run from wars covered by Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.
Report - Yasmin Abutaleb; editor Christian Plam
Diabetics with a little fatty may be helped by fatty surgery
The good effect of absorption after surgery in people with a small abundance of diabetes of type 2 may take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is yet early to claim that diabetics with a little fatty live longer after the surgery of fatty than those who receive non-surgery treatment.
"The mortality statistics are not shown at once," stated Dr. Robin Blackstone, expert for the surgery, who wrote on a new study in the column of the JAMA Surgery editor.
The abnormality surgery, or bariatory surgery, uses various methods to reduce the abdominal size.
They reduce the hunger and limit the ability of the body to adopt food.
In several years, bariatrial surgery has demonstrated its effectiveness to treat type 2 diabetes, but basic studies were conducted among people with morbid fatty, having 35 or higher body mass index (IMT).
IMT, a weight measure relative to growth, is considered normal with the value of 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or above indicates that human weight is excessive and that people with IMT above 30 are considered abundant.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from the Taiwan hospital, Min-Sheng General, used data gathered since 2007 to compare two types of bariatrial surgery -- stomach shuffling and glove gastroctomy, with medical treatment of diabetes of type 2 in people with small fatty.
The IMT average of those subjected to surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, IMT has some 29 people who have received non-surgery treatment with diabetes.
Among those who passed the surgery, 36 per cent have been fully treated with diabetes, and partly 28 per cent.
In a group receiving medicine, for comparison, complete treatment of diabetes was observed only in 1%, and partially in approximately 2 per cent.
Furthermore, the blood pressure, triglycerides and " bad" PLNP cholesterol " had been better generally in the surgery group," said the authors.
Researchers have also controlled the levels of A1s hemoglobin in the blood that reflect blood sugar levels in the dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better to keep below 7%, according to researchers.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin rate of A1c decreased from about 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable at approximately 8 per cent.
However, the best glycemic control indicators reflected by the good levels of hemoglobin A1c did not reduce mortality in five years, according to Dr. Chi Chang Su and colleagues.
The research group also compared the average results of two types of surgery.
For the fifth year, compared to the handcuff gastroctomy group, the shuntation group lost more weight (18.7 kg against 14.2 kg), increased decrease in IMT (7.4 to 5.1) and A1s (3.1 per cent against 2.1 per cent) and was closer to the full remission of diabetes (46.9 per cent against 16.7 per cent).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the advantages of the surgery method in life after five years, there are confirmations on the results of the excessive body mass research in Sweden, that surgery treatment is indeed leading to an increase in life-life, according to Blackstone from the Medical College at Mr. Phoenix, the University of Arizona.
According to the Swedish study, the probability to die for 15 years was approximately 29 per cent lower than the group in which more traditional methods were used.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life, Blackstone noted that it encouraged people with IMT below 35 interested in this procedure.
"The report is very important because it claims that surgery is safe in a low IMT group where there is no increased risk of mortality or kidney diseases," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should be taking seriously to weight as soon as the IMT is in the range between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to make people take this seriously," she said.
I think as soon as they accumulate genetic changes that start fat and diabetes in their bodies, it's very difficult to turn it back.
Thieves were brought out of the house's garbage and 9 million rubles.
Thieves attacked the inhabitants of the underwear and stole 9 million rubbers and three female hams.
The Interfax refers to the IMD RF press service.
The incident happened Tuesday morning.
Two unknown in the open door entered the house located on the street of Gorky, tied the 20-year-old son to the house and threatened with both knives, abducted 9 million rubles and three laundry.
According to preliminary data, the damage amounted to 9 million 265 000 rubles, a criminal case on the article “Demolition”.
The European fans are risking to become homeless.
Only 23 Petersburg hotels have the right to place tourists who will come to the world championship in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are still in a hurry to receive the permission.
Experts believe that this is a very disturbing sign.
In the predecession of the world's privilege, the authorities will urgently have to figure out how to displace all visitors of the city.
Rosbalt's interviewers believe that the cost of retail apartments would increase by 10 to 30 per cent due to the tournament, and after the rental championship will have to be repaided.
The soccer championship forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of the Russian hotels.
According to the law written specifically under the primary, each Petersburg hotel should take a classification procedure and prove that it is in line with the amount of stars and the level of service.
It is clear now that it will not be possible for all of them: hotels are so afraid of checks that they often do not even send documents to the requests of the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service on Petersburg.
According to UFAS head Vadem Vladimirov, the office studied 138 hotels and now plans to establish 34 cases on hotels, many of which simply did not respond to anti-monopolists.
There are signs that the leadership of three dozens of companies lied to the towns by placeing a number of stars in the advertisement, noted Vladimirov.
The problem is that none of the numbers can be lost before 2018.
The officials suspect that during the soccer championship, the cheerleader will take all Petersburg hotels.
Tourists can now count at 30.5 thousand numbers in the city.
According to Smolny, in Petersburg, 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotel, 100-two- and three-star, 550-star.
According to the first Deputy Deputy Committee for Tourism, Nana Guican tourism, only 23 hotels had been classified at this point, with so many checks made by the companies accredited in Petersburg.
However, whether any hotel had ordered such a procedure in regional enterprises, the Smollian for the surprising gain of circumstances, is unknown.
I mean, past classifications may be more, but no one knows about it.
"The last six months of the hotels have not been very striving to be classified," admitted director of the Northwestern Division of the Russian Union tournament, Ekaterina Shadska.
This is due to a high season during which hotels earn most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is the budgets in which no verification costs have been established, and the procedure may be costing the hotel dependent on the status of 30 to 100 thousand rubles and more.
However, the hotel managers have recently been intensified and applied for classification, as assured by Shadska.
Hotels have to make it until 1 July 2016, otherwise they will not only pay fines but will not have the right to work for the world's championship.
It is already known that, depending on starliness, a fixed hotel number will be designed for the time of the tournament.
The formulas for which the value will be calculated will be published next year.
This was made to prevent the prices of 200-300 per cent, for example during the Petersburg Economic Forum.
We need to have a conscience and not to allow improvements two or three times, but hotels also need to make money.
"I think growth will be up to 50 per cent," explained the President of the Russian Hospital Association of Gennady Lamshine.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov was not sure that price fixation was in line with the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much this is in line with the economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It is better than a non-containable trip," he noted.
I don't know what's going to happen to popular cheap hosts.
The Deputies of the State have introduced a bill under which hosts should be prohibited in housing houses.
We hope that this law will not be adopted or affected by Petersburg.
"We will stand to the point of view that hosts should be preserved," said Nana Guya.
However, she said that the owners of the hotels should, in any case, be prepared for the relief of the Housing Code.
If the State approves the bill, approximately 80 per cent of the hosts will be closed in Petersburg, and at this point there are 1,5,000 numbers.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurants and Hotels of Northwest Leonida Garbara, there are two- and three-star hotels in Petersburg, which are just required by footballers, but there are a crossing to the four-star hotels and five stars.
Such situations are similar to the situation where "seats 75,000 wires at the 80,000 stadium."
This can be corrected by mini hotels.
Their possible ban, the expert considers "idioticism," "I think it's strange that some people can live in apartments, but there's something they can't come."
If the hostel is used as a room, I agree that this is wrong.
But if it's like a hotel where the guests are coming for a short time, why not?
The mini-hosts are risking to miss the world's championship and because of their neratrophicness.
Thousands of small hotels just won't be able to pass classification, and they're screaming themselves.
By summer 2016, all city hotels will be ordered.
"Companies that may take this procedure not so much, so they will refrain from less payable orders from a mini-hotel and will be chosen by those who travel", said Gennadius Lamshine, added that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the verifications of the verifications made at this time are significantly higher than the Petersburg.
The reason for the Petersburg delay is, inter alia, the continuous intervals in the Government's tourist bloc, which does not contribute to the coherent work.
Experts believe that if the Petersburg Hotels are not enough, what is likely to be paid attention to the district hotels and homes.
Like Petersburg's 300-year celebration, a river fleet can be mobilized in the city, i.e. guests of the tournament will be able to live in the cabins.
Furthermore, many cheerleaders will be prepared to come in trucks where they can stay at night.
"The main thing is not to set so many hotels to let them go," Gennadius Lamshine was sure.
Also, a great popularity during the soccer board will be used in a retail housing.
Most likely the city will create a reservation of landing apartments.
The rental rates will increase by 10 to 30 per cent.
"First of the apparent-first stay is going to go close to the stadium," noted the Agency's rental and research in the real estate of Laris Bragin.
The rent price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in bedroom areas.
It will also contribute to the construction of new transport links in the city, she stressed.
We should not forget the human qualities of the towns.
For example, Leonid Garbar is convinced that Petersburg was always a guest city in which people can not just indicate the road but also conduct a mini-excursion.
There are complications.
In 1970, my father met a family from Murmansk, a mother and two children in the courtyard.
They had nowhere to stay at night — it was hard to sleep at the station with hotels.
"And Dad brought them to our municipal apartment to sleep," the interviewer recalled.
Truthfully, I added that this is not what people of the city have left to call their home inherent consequences and horrible.
But perhaps in 2018, after the failures of the State, the errors of the hotels and governments will have to remember the past?
The Guinean "sal" of the Amurian area.
He was excited today at the Klounade of Gerinovski in the State.
He did such things when our generation was only learning to trade in newspapers, and he is still in a beautiful shape.
The theme of the speaking appears to be "DDPR protest against the results of the elections in the Amurian area".
The protocols do not tremble, for nothing; other protocols other than the electoral signed, of the LDPR, allegedly not.
Here he raises the second seat of Ivan Abram and screams, "This is the winner of the elections!"
And at the same time, he screams on his family, and then, after the chairman's shift, he screams the fraction from the meeting room, "You're all with the fronts of your cheats and thieves."
The press, of course, focuses not on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarche of fractions as a result of this scandal and insult.
Really Wolfovic was beautiful and elegantly floating the area of Amur along with Abramov.
For the whole country, it is a continuous turnover of Gerinovski in the form of "Dunderki" and not at all the protest of the political party against the results of specific elections.
The fraction has been formally scattered, and the elections, if you believe in the party's website and Facebook Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader is apparently coming down.
It represents the dead in Amura to bury their dead themselves, and he himself preaches the Gospel against the "Jedine Russia" as a whole and none of the relatives.
It's an excellent decision not to lose the face, not to the present, rather than the scandal.
Another thing that is now in a strange situation is the same as Abramov.
In addition to the screams of the Chief, he had nothing to wait for; there were no alternative protocols on his hands.
He was not focused on public attention, on the one hand, but on the other, for the narrow circle, it became a formal cause and to insult the respected championship, and, even stronger, the hammines to the ER and UNF.
And then, of course, he must seriously think about what to do.
Because from the primary beneficiary of elections, policy number 2 of the region and candidate number 1 to the only area-one-date district, it can become a pair that has successfully benefited from its own party leadership and super-runner for the same UNF and the party leadership of the stranger.
Surely, there would not be a Gerinovsky, it should be invented and respectfully observed.
The tramp before it grows and grows.
The news has been that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next plenary.
I mean, the bath fell out of nowhere.
Only Abram's theme was buried.
It's really beautiful.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, said Dalaj-lama, added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in refugee countries.
Dalai-lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in its speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Ethics Research in Oxford at the beginning of its 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that, in existing circumstances, the interests of humankind should be higher than the interests of individual countries or even of continents.
He also emphasized that, although this is adorable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was not adequate.
"It is impossible for all to come to Europe," he noted in his speech.
Although Dalajlama highly responded to the actions taken by Germany and Austria on the crisis, he emphasized that this was only a temporary decision.
"The concern of thousands of refugees is great, but at the same time, you must also consider long-term decisions, how to bring this world and development, mainly through education, in these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, Dalaj-lama also commented on the actions of George Bush after terrorist acts 11/11, saying that the US severe reaction has launched a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in the letter to President Bush and told him that the problem could be solved by non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used the power, and that caused unexpected consequences," said Dalaj-lama.
Four-fold increase in the number of children that have swallowed disinficiency for hand over the last 4 years
Toxicological centres in the United States reported almost 400 per cent increases, starting since 2010, the number of children under 12 years of age has swallowed a disinficient tool with high spirt content, according to the Georgian toxicological Centre.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgian toxicological Centre, children were swallowed up to 12 years of liquid for disinfection of hands reported in toxicological centres from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"The children are more frequently contacting these substances and, unfortunately, some of them are sent to the emergency office," said Lopes CNN.
He said that some children are drinking disinfective liquid specially, and some do so to impress their friends or dispute for social networks.
Youtube videos show how adolescents drink disinficient fluid as a cheap drink.
Adolescents reportedly mixed disinficiency fluid with spirtoid liquid for lips to get a stronger drink.
Children of younger age may attract nice smells of disinfecting liquid.
"The child doesn't think it could hurt him," said Lopez.
Many of the most attractive (dezinficiating liquids for hands) are those who are smelled.
There are disinfecting liquids for hands with a smell of pigs, grapes, orange that are very attractive for children.
The disinfecting liquid for hand contains some 45 to 95 per cent of the spirt.
In particular, only a few poisons can cause alcoholic poisoning.
"It is a high-concentrated alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Steven Thornton, chief toxic center at the University of Kansas Hospital.
You wouldn't have left a whiskey just like that, but people have seen these disinfecting tools for hand, and if children get to them, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a disinficiency tool for hand with a jabber smell in the number of approximately four sprays, was sent to therapy to the ambulance.
The level of alcohol in her blood was 179, twice as the adult who was legally deemed to be alcoholic, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her in the Gwinnett Medical Centre near Atlanta.
Naija was confused and could not walk when she was delivered to the ambulance office.
The doctors watched her all night in a separate childhood clinic to avoid missing any signs of brain trauma, since the girl fell down and hit her head, said Ritchie.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, Naigi's mother.
This could have proved to be deadly for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-spirt substances or disinfecting salts, in addition to removal of disinfecting liquids for children ' s reaching zone.
In addition to alcoholic poisoning, some disinfecting liquids link deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after a disinficiency tool containing a toxic undetected ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product had a metanol - mortal agent, not an ethyl alcohol that was indicated as an active substance.
In January, three four-class students in the north of New York agreed to poison their " opposite" teacher by "proliferation of antibacterial substances in class," according to the police report.
The teacher has a strong allergy to hand disinfectors, and she has forbidden to keep them in her class.
The police believe that the failed plan was " empty talks" and addresses the discipline to the school district.
As the oldest child library in Barnaule became a family club.
At the back of the barrel at the entrance of the country's child library, the N.C. Krupski is sad with a owl.
Kids who come for books are trying to feed her with cupcakes.
Several generations have been walking into this library for 95 years.
The first readers in the last twentieth centuries were making loud readings here, spectacles on the verses of Mayakov, literary victorins and were transmitted with Lenin's wife.
The list continued four years, and, as the 1939 Journal of the Young Stanic, "friendship between the Hope of the Constantinal Crup and the friends of the Library of the city of Barnaul" was increasingly strong.
Constantine’s hope even sent a child photo to farewell friends of Barnaule.
And when the barnauls asked whether Constantine's Hope would object to the library's name, she said no, no, no.
The letters have been sprayed in the museum long ago, and the grandchildren and the first readers have to explain whose severe profile decorates a barrel in the library building.
During the years of restructuring, various people were frequently called, why is the child’s library not renamed?
Let it be a library of a good child writer without a political color!
The library workers sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Crup" is probably the most famous and famous library in Barnaule, like "Lenina" in Moscow.
On the floor of the library, the path from the yellow ciggle.
"The Wizard of the Favorite City" is the favorite theme of Oli Moskovski.
Ola used to be a legal manager, attended work at eight, left at five, and all other managers were different only by love for drawing.
And then I found an announcement on the Internet, "Illustrator for the book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called My Cancer Mommy, my mother's cancer.
Ola did illustrations, and she thought that life could end at any point, and there will be no miracles in it unless you create them yourself.
She is now working in the library, illustrating child books of writers around the world, and making tales herself.
It is traditionally considered that children are losing interest in the book that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But the readers are coming to us, and their parents understand the importance of reading, said the Russian planet director of Tatiana Kushvid library.
In recent years, we even have such a moment of confidence that the child's library is needed, and it's going to live. Kids come here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
The library has a large exhibition viteration with the updated photo exposion.
Once there are new photos of readers who go to the library by family: Mom, Dad, and children.
The library is rejoiced that the fathers were increasingly visiting their children.
If a child was read all of the Chukovsky at two years older, he needs more complicated books.
However, the law now acts by which the eight-year-old vunderkind is prohibited from publishing books from category 12+.
In order to get a book like that, the child should bring parents with them -- they come, then return again, and gradually, "Crup" becomes something like a family club.
There are treasures in the library - a prerevolutionary collection of jatas and eras, leading Corolenco to the annex to the magazine Niva, the "Murzilka" for 1936.
Because now we are not just the conceptual temple of the book, we are now open for movement, we are trying to become a special place: not a home, not a job, not a school -- explains Tatiana Kushvid.
You can come to us to read, play, draw.
We made a game zone for babies - the baby just comes to play, and the hand is still pulling to the book!
Some of our readers are kidnapped by parents, and they resist with legs, and they don't want to leave.
Mothers often come with wheels, and we are glad that they put the library first among the rest of the places where you need to go with the babies.
Tatiana Kushvid says, "The modern children like us once love classical child literature:
"The issue is now developing, and much attention is given to the authors who are a linked bell between generations."
And if you're talking about little kids, they're important to be a hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don't like to break up with their heroes.
The library constantly publishes booklets for parents in which it tells us what is happening in the modern child literature, which books are worth paying attention and why.
The boxes are so exciting and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
The books outside the read room are prohibited by adults.
This magic privilege has only children.
...In the next room of the library, there is a square hole with an ancient wooden ladder in the basement, in the bookcase.
The steps will scratch under your steps -- it's a very old time machine.
You meet with your childhood book as an old companion: hello, good thing we're not changing.
Ellie still marvelously walks on the road weakened by the yellow ciggle, the Tolla Rigikov lion steals magic spikes, and boy-Kibalchish never told the goddamn bourguins of the Military Secret - that's his strong word.
The books are like passwords, they can be known everywhere.
There are also present book rareness, for example, a prerevolutionary collection of buckets and eras.
Or lead the Queenenco in a famous annex to the magazine Niva.
Or the "Mursillas" supplies for 1936.
Time aged the pages, painted them in a tea color.
These publications are no longer issued to readers.
It's the parts of our future collection, and I dream of everything, I'll retire and take care of rare child books.
But the kids aren't going to do that, and the colors in old books aren't very bright, and the subjects... you're opening the first page, and there's Lenin, party, comsomol.
Now it seems, "Why did we all write out this Pioneer Truth?"
But it was still interesting, -- tells the Russian planet, Galin Ilasova, the bookkeeper.
The "Mursils" pages were dark from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna has been running the book guard for her entire life.
She knows the color of the Buratino collapse, in which school year Harry Potter became the captain of the Griffindor team at the kviddich championship, where Carlson uses a muscle for a motorbike, and what father Alice Seleznew is working.
The librarian's work is paid a little, and everyone who can live without these book lines is very quickly finding another job.
Only the most convincing are the educators, the teachers, the servants of the book.
They can also be learned in a smile - it is considered to be a professional character of the child's library.
If he smiles to you at the first minute of conversation, it's a professional.
I like children's books at all: as a library I like to have them standing right and beautifully on the shelves, and I also love reading them," says Galina Vasilevna.
I read everything: military, historical behaviour, tales, fantastic.
I read modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think everything was different when I was a child.
The books were the most interesting and fascinating thing that happened to me.
And since I loved them insanely, I thought the library was a magic place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be despite the rowers.
And I'm glad when our former readers bring children or grandchildren...
Rumour mill: There are no disagreements in Seltics
Griffits disagreed with the disagreements in Seltics after Dayle's confession that Hups is in a bad situation, but he'll fix it.
Harts will protest against the claim of the Scotland Football Association to Nailson, and Warberton fears the signing of contracts in January that could violate the unity of the team.
Donz has increased the advantage of Seltics to five paragraphs
Adam Runi's penalty in the first time gave Aberdin a small advantage over Hamilton in Pittodra, which allowed Don's to get away from Seltics at five points.
Griffiths disagreed with disagreements
This led to rumours about disagreements in Seltics, which were interrupted by Griffits, saying that he and his team companions were not suffering from any strong criticism by preparing to meet the leaders of the Netherlands League.
I don't think we're feeling tense, I think the players are looking for it.
The Dutch people are bored because there are no Scots in the fight for title de Burr
The former semi-protecter from Rangers and former member of the Netherlands College, Ronald de Bur, stated that the Dutch Footballers lost their interest in Seltic because he did not compete for the title of Rangers.
De Bur, currently a representative of Ayaks, said, "The most attractive moments of the games are no longer shown in Holland, and why?"
It's because there's no Rangers.
People here don't just talk about returning Rangers.
They're talking about "Old Company."
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
The Old Company games have a lot of tension, and not only people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," said Dala.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Seltics is in difficulty, but the Norwegian coach swore to change everything.
For the defeat of Malmo and, as a result, the exit of the League of Champions was soon followed by the loss of 10 Aberdin footballers, which now, with five points, took the top of the table.
However, Dala said, "The Selitka had bad times before, and we're going out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I understand that it's very frustrating, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
And we too, but we have to go on.
And we really need the Seltica support, because it makes the players much better.
Staying together now is so important.
Warberton untrustedly awaits January's transfers
Despite the views that it appeared only a few weeks ago, suggesting that he had identified some of the goals of January transfers, the Chief of Rangers Mark Worberton was uncertain about the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the unity of the team.
The former attacker of Brantford said, "The January Transfer Window is very different from the summer window."
With regard to players coming in summer, you have a period before the start of the season for their adaptation, which you have seen in our own group in this season.
The team works really well.
Sometimes more harm is to add unnecessary players to those you really need.
Mitch, who is interested in Seltics, suggested the completion of the career
The Swansi Mitch attacker, connected to Celtic during the transfer window, suggested that he could leave football after his Swan contract was completed.
The 29-year-old player suffered from iron problems for two years and couldn't leave Wales this summer.
Harts are going to oppose the SFA on Neilson's statements
"Harts" led with account 2:1 when Patterson was removed and started to lose 3:2, but the red protector's card was canceled later; this is the third red Collum card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson did not give up his words, saying, "I didn't question ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffits swore to avoid Tankasl.
Heibernian's hard player got an excuse after he confessed that he was singing a song with insulting words about the former Harts Rudy Scacelle player.
The incident occurred in a pub in the area of Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the Edinburgh Derby in Tankasl in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was warm," said the attacker, adding, "I can surely say that I was not going back to Tankasl unless he played for "Seltic."
Donnelly: The Tanadis Council is confident in the Managing Centre of Dundy United
Simon Donnelly claims that the Board of Directors of Dunda UNITED remains confident that the team of managers will change the situation to better, but agrees that the deterioration of the field should end.
I think Steven Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the boys to come out again," said Donnelly.
McKinnes is glad he won "unbearing" at Hamilton's.
Derek Macinness admitted that his Aberdin team had to fight desperately Hamilton Assiss to achieve the seventh victory in the first line of the League, which set them up five points above Seltics, upstairs of the tournament table, thanks to Adam Runi's tools in the first time.
McInnes said, "There's no team that won anything, a cup or a League champion who didn't win a meeting like that."
The level of unemployment among Scots is not changing, while it grows in the United Kingdom as a whole.
SCOTLAND WHAT has remained 164,000 in the period from May to July, whereas the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom has increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The level of unemployment in Scotland was 5.9 per cent higher than the United Kingdom at 5.5 per cent, as shown by the National Statistics Service (UNS).
At the same time, the employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, while the number of employees now was 2,612,000.
The employment level for Scotland decreased by a quarter to 74.0 per cent, which is above the average of 73.5 per cent of the United Kingdom.
The Scotland Minister David Mandel, commenting on the latest figures, noted: “The Government ' s long-term plan has established the foundations for the strengthening of the economy.”
It was almost a year since Scotland decided to remain as part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the work market in Scotland in employment and unemployment.
Why I am a witness of the execution in Oklahoma
Today, by avoiding legal intervention at the late stage, I will watch the human being executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll sit in the mortal cell gallery in the Oclahoma prison when Richard Glossip will be executed by a deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
The first time this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As I was near this day, I was afraid.
So why do you do that?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the detailed history of the death penalty.
That would offer a unique round.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since those who want more than places, the results of the dark lottery decide who will be elected.
In Oklahoma, the number of press places was reduced from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen, he'll look at it without emotions.
I can't do that.
I will sit with Richard Glossi's closest friends, and we have a relationship with him after a few months of phone calls and one visit for two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I cannot be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I will not be allowed to take a note and a pen to write what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me at Twitter that I was being impartial.
It's a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes, he gets access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she could "make better form," but she still believes I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with anything I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he said.
I told him he could draw me out of his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to attend there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that the volume will help the movement to cancel the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter from Haffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the subcasts I recorded.
I'm not going to be in detail again.
I can't say with confidence that Richard Glossip is not guilty.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treese make him guilty of the crime aid.
But I believe there's a great probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm firmly sure the evidence for the death sentence was not enough.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die.
I can't say I'll be entirely objective.
There will be other reporters that can be addressed.
From me, you'll find out what it feels like to watch the man I like dies without need.
The human police persecuted were convinced to leave the Canning River
The Constable of Canning-Wail was able to convince a man to get out of the Canning River and to remain dry.
Perth's resident intends to leave the police, but he couldn't, stuck in a dirty water on a small guide, a few meters from a police officer trying to "mildly convince him to go to the shore."
The Canning-Wail police was called on Tuesday on the fact that illegal invasion into a foreign territory in Buckingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to leave them by dropping into Canning.
But he didn't go far.
"He was standing in the water and saying, "I'm not going out, let's get me," said Sergeant Shandell Castledin.
Constable Laclan Perhavac did not really want to pee the form, so he used a safer reception, "government with a good cop."
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," said Sergeant Castledin.
The soccer champion Ben Kazins remembered that.
In 2006, Cazins moved to the cuvet to avoid meeting with a police officer for alcohol checks, and tried to swim Swan.
His efforts have proved to be vain, but the local inhabitants have developed a joke "Ben Kazins".
Peter Moody accuses stewards of attempting to spy and threatens to leave the horse sport
Peter Moody accused the racing Victoria stewards of trying to introduce a spy into his couch last year and threatened to leave a horse sport immediately.
His aim was the stewards and ethics officers of the Racing Victoria Racing Division, whom he accused that they organized a campaign against him personally, and the withdrawal of Lady Tatai ' s startup because of the violation of the rules of the use of medicinal products on the starting day, on Wednesday, became the last slam.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always made all his efforts in the jumps, and he was in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of the Leader's cobalt sample, which he couldn't explain.
He kept his tongue on suspicions of spying for a half year and didn't want it to look like green grapes.
"I didn't mean to say anything about it, and I have suffered for a long time, but sometimes it is so much that you are not stopping," said Moody.
They know it's been on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep hard.
I want to walk with my head, and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start to think that it's not true, I'll have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think what to do with my license.
Previously, Moody sentimentally stated during the racing.com interview that the ethics department was trying to spy in his council.
"Shortly a year ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Bryan Stewart sat in a room with a man I'll call him if they ask, and offered him a job in my couch to communicate information about what I'm doing in the couch," said Moody at Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is true, they should certainly all make statements, since the attempt to catch me was unsuccessful.
Robert Rolston, former President of RVL, David Moody, current President of RVL, and Bernard Sondrie, the executive director of the RVL, knew about it all the time and now.
Shouldn't that make me think the case becomes personal?
Should the RVL not gain courage and call for reply for what is happening in this business, other people other than coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I so bad for this profession?
Maybe there's people who think it's true.
Maybe they should take my license and push me out, and I don't doubt what I'm saying right now might make them think about it.
But now I've reached the point where I don't care, and that's sad.
I'm really sad about that.
I will put pressure on them and put on them responsibility for making a decision.
I have family support, and I can leave.
The coach had only grown during a long investigation of the cobalt case and the Leaderi, and the last withdrawal of the horse from the start made him claim that he could "flip his license on the table".
Moody, most famous of the preparing the invincible Championship of Black Caviar, referred to the requirements for the use of medicines on the day of the competition, after a clay compression was brought on the horse's feet, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules on jumping.
"I must bear full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my mistaken workers made her a compression.
She could have been compressed last night.
She could have got it yesterday, just like it was.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody may be discvalified for three months in accordance with the rules on the use of medical medicines on the day of compression competition, and the stewards have opened an investigation.
It's an anecdote.
People who create these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.
The driver who invaded and hid from the scene of the incident in Cobram was arrested
The police arrested a man who struck a motorist in Cobram on the weekend and hid away from the scene of the incident.
Royal Melbourne's helicopter was delivered to the hospital with serious wounds after the car hit by Murray Wally Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping to help a wounded motorcycler.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be accused of leaving the scene of the incident, not providing assistance and in violation of other road rules.
The Motorcyclest, a 40-year-old Cobrama, remains in a hospital in a stable state.
Trainer Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy parss the accusations of rival forces
Trainer Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy called the criticism of the capture of the ball as his team as " connecting the agenda" by two NRL champions.
Trainer Sidney Rusters Trent Robinson said that the judges allowed Storm to fight his team during the sudden victory of Storm at the final of the qualification game in Sydney on Friday night.
The Brisbane Broncos trainer, Wayne Bennett, made a clear insight on Storm after his team won the qualification tournament final at Nozern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday, when he called this game "typical" for the League of Regby and said that two of the Queensland team were not too successful in the fighting.
Bellamy was protecting the ball overtake by his team and said they were just focused on the "Contact" overtaking the ball.
Bellamy added that he was confident that his team was criticised by two leading coaches, as that means that they were concerned about the possible defeat of Storm.
"This continues to float -- I haven't heard Trent Robinson speaking about strict receipts when they won us with the account of 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can assurance that we have not changed anything in our systems or protection systems for a year, just in the past six weeks, we have given special attention to the contacts when taking the ball, and that has become a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and he's clearly trained a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it has become a shock for him.
It's funny how it always appears at this time of the year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea about "impressive football", reminding his teacher that St. George-Illavarra Dragons won Bennett in 2010, showing a boring football.
Wayne's talking about an exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with our Friday night, and to see how impressive their game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St. George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said that he didn't care about it.
But now he has a team that can show what he considers as an impressive football, especially his young semi-protectors with their speed.
This is the football you'd like to play when you have such players.
He made this comment in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style -- not every team has two semi-protectors like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play so.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they reached the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the Storm and Rusters game was a racing with a large number of points than the Broncos and Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the account? 16-12?
In our game, he was 20:18, there were two other attempts - and what is that impressive football?
Or do you consider the impressive breaks and misconducts?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, that means we can meet them at some point.
The Storm is at the end of this week's weekend, because they have won the right to take Nort Queensland Cowboys, or "Kronalla Sharks" on the next Saturday night at the preliminary final at the AAMI Park stadium, tickets will be sold on the next Tuesday morning.
Prosecutor for drug storage of Serbs is bailed at $200,000
A man who was threatened to live for attempting to award 40 pounds of cocaine delivered to Queensland by a smuggling was released to a jail of $200,000.
Marco Maximovic, 29 years old, is one of the five arrested last month after the Federal Police discovered 100 pounds of drugs on the Solay yacht, moving from South America through Vanuatu and accommodated in Kumera in August.
During the morning, Maximovic and his associates were seen at the harbor, and later he met them at Coomera Roadhouse Cafe, where the police found 40 pounds of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maximovic is threatened to live for attempting to sell drugs sufficient, the lawyer Maximovic claims that the last attempt to obtain the entire party was not available and that a man could be in a cafeteria without any intent.
Judge of the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, doubted that Maximovic was to be bailed.
The last one has contact with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his location.
The mother and father of Maximovic were invited to make a joint bet at $200,000 for his release.
"In both testimony, it is obvious that the amount of $200,000 is too large for them," Judge Flenagan noted.
But one measure was not enough to guarantee that it would not disappear, the judge added.
Maximovic was allowed to be released under a bail provided that he would be given both his Australian and Serbian passport to the police every day and observed the command hours from 6 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Photos of Cacicaris: "I'm proud of the collective Greece that's been fighting until the last seconds."
The chief coach in Greece, Fotis Kacikaris, commissioned his team after the 1/4 final of Eurobasket-2015 with Spain (71:73).
He said that some mistakes were solved by the fate of the game.
It was a big game, quoted by AFP Kacicaris.
We were preparing for an excellent game to perform the Spanish.
They tried to work in defense, but defence errors identified the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my boys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Friland: "In CSC I'm going to be assigned to Kauna."
The CSCA new man Joel Friland said he didn't believe in the curse of the Army.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to break the negative trend and finally win the Euroligy in the next season.
I talked to Coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer, and, myself, after I joined the team, he quoted "R-Sport" Friland. - In fact, I will be given up with Sasha Kauna's functions, who left the team both in the defence buildings and in the attack from the three-second zone, and I think I can handle it.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to reconstruct the central position, but I've played a forward more at NBA.
Now we're going to have to resist a large central rival, but I've done this before, so I think I'm gonna do it now.
The Army won Euroligy in 2008 the last time.
Since then, they've been going six times to the Final four, but they couldn't show their best basketball every time.
There's a view that the team was swallowed.
That's the whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's complicated. I understand all the disappointment of the club and his cheerleaders.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can, we have a good chance to win the Euroligy, I really think so.
I've always wanted to win this title, Moscows have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be a CSCA year.
With regard to the glasses, I am not a superstitious person or I believe in no curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you connect these two things, it's possible.
I don't have any certain rituals before the games, I'm just listening to music and trying to relax as far as possible.
Louis Enrique: "For me, the game with Roma will be special."
The chief coach of Barcelona, Louis Enrique, did not hide that he returned to Rome at the 1st Tour of the League of Championships with Roma with special feelings.
According to the teacher, his current and former team's eye fight will be far away.
Recall that Louis Enrique trained wolves in season-2011/12, but he was unable to show himself on the best part of the capital of Italy.
I've returned to Rome a few years later, and I've acquired some experience. - The UEFA official site of Louis Enrique's words.
I have very warm memories with Rome.
It'll be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start in the League of Champions from victory.
August meeting at Joan Hamper's Cube will not affect the teams in the nearest match.
I'm expecting the Roma game she showed in the series A against Juventus.
It's a strong team that can press and know what to do with the ball.
Vadim Screepchenko: "Crasnodar" has various options for attacks."
The Acting Chief Coach of Ural Vadim Screepchenko, at the 9th tour of the Prime Minister of League with the Krasnodar, noted the diversity of the competitive team attacking schemes.
According to the teacher, "beans" have several patterns of attack in their arsenal.
The battle will take place on 21 September and start at 16:30 in the Moscow Time.
When we play with the "Krasnodar", we'll see, "the Ural's official site of the words Screechenko.
We've been preparing for the whole week.
This team has various options of attacks, many ways of carrying out its attacks, while we are not slow, so I believe that it will be a very interesting game.
In front of this game, taking into account that "Crasnodar" plays the League of Europe against the Dortmund Borussia, we will try to prepare very well to win.
Roher Canyas: "Astana's house can take the glasses from anyone."
Semi-protected Rocher Canyas after the 1st Group League League Championship (0:2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
In the opinion of the kovbek, in their fields, the residents are capable of taking the glasses from any competitor.
Even though the match has come tough for us, I can say we played well, the UEFA official site of Kanjas' words has brought us a little bit of courage in the attack.
Banfika's above class, but at the home game, I think we can count on taking their glasses.
It's real.
But first we have to think about the Galatasare, and then the Atletics.
At home games, we can take the glasses from anyone.
Rafael Benites: "Repeat as many times: Christian Ronald is the best in the world."
The Chief Coach of Real Rafael Benites expressed satisfaction with the great victory in the 1st tour of the Team League Championship (4:0).
The specialist commended Cristian Ronald, who became the author of the three heads.
The match was difficult, because Shahter can own a ball -- the UEFA official site of Benites' words.
The competitor has not had much time, but their counteracts always hide the danger.
I'm not saying "Real" played perfectly, but we had enough naked possibilities.
I'm pleased that we didn't miss the balls and we hit four.
Christian Ronald confirmed his level.
It's the best player in the world, I'll repeat it every time.
George Alba: "Christian Ronald cannot be compared to Messi."
The Barcelona Protector George Alba believes that no one can compare with his colleague Lionel Messi.
According to the Spanish, Cristian Ronald's "Real" Forward can't do that either.
The monsieur of five heads above the others, quoted by Le Figaro Albu.
Even Christian Ronald.
With Leo on the field, I can't compare it to anyone.
Danielle De Rossi: "Barcelona" has not only unique style but also bright individuals.
Semi-protector of Roma Danielle De Rossi before the team tournament League championship with Barcelona noted the importance of compatibility and insurance in the game with such a strong competitor.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, start at 21.45 a.m. in Moscow.

Barcelona is a special competitor, a good team with beautiful players, quoted by UEFA De Rossi's official website.
It's hard to play with blue-granates, because they have not only unique style but also bright individuals.
To leave them, we're going to have to go through the whole game and protect each other.

Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to force pedophiles to send photos.
Pedophile used the phone of a 11-year-old girl to seek pictures of violence against children.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone while she was asleep, registered on the Internet service for communications, where he received a number of rude pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl waked up, found the missing phone and found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She checked it and found shocking photos, and then immediately drew her mother's attention to it.
The police arrived and saw five images, followed by researching the computers found at that address, and discovered "suitable" requests in the search system using words to detect incorrect pictures of children.
Hogg then said to the police that he did it because it could "attach the pedophiles" and then he would "pretend he was a policeman to scare them."
The authorized judiciary Alyd Robertson informed the Sheriff's court in Dunda: "He said that it was an addiction, he was addicted to frightening people.
He confessed that he had made requests on the computer, but he said that it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare the pedophiles.
He was questioned about the conversation with an unknown person who sent pictures to him and that he asked for more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he had a head problem when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see the images of rape and murders.
Ms. Robertson added, "When the girl found photos on the phone, she called her mother, she was trembling and crying.
She saw innocent images on the phone, and then an eye rate was carried out with the accused.
The girl was questioned and reported that the accused used the computer and the Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23 years old, from Ward Road, Dundi, recognized himself guilty of the charges charged with the production of indecent photos of children on 14 June last year, violated the conditions of bail on 25 January of this year and without appearing in court on the hearing on 24 March this year.
Gregor Sim, the defendant, asked him not to put Hog on the list of persons committed with sexual offences, as it could prove that there was no " significant sexual element in this crime".
Sheriff Alister Carmichael delayed the sentence until October, until the social services received.
Hog was released to a bail on this case, but he was detained before the start of the hearing on other cases.
It was made a list of persons committed with sexual offences before the date of sentence.
President Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe reads the wrong speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the senior African government leader, had fallen from the stairs leading from the floor earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of the falling scene was currently spread by social networks.
The opening of the parliament was also undermined by the statements of parliamentary opponents that they received anonymous threats preventing them from whistling Mugaba during treatment.
For a month ago, they exhibited the President during his appeal to the nation in parliament; that was the speech Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Member of the Parliament of the Movement for Democratic Change, Innosent Goneze, stated that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning to prevent Mugabe from interrupting the speech.
"The message came from a number that was not displayed but called Death," he informed journalists on the completion of the speech of Mugabe.
The noted members of the parliament warned that integrity was ended in the parliament building, and as soon as they exited, parliamentary integrity did not work.
Member of Parliament stated that the Party headed by Morgan Zwangirai was “restrained” by its policy threats.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard assumes to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within its restructuring and reducing services costs.
The same year, Hewlett-Packard will be divided into two companies registered on the market, separateing computers and printers from rapidly developed equipment and service operations sectors.
The estimates resulting from the estimated reduction in jobs are approximately $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, states Hewlett-Packard.
"This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, Chairman and Director-General Hewlett Packard, who will head the organization after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more focused than Hewlett-Packard currently, and the business portfolio will be wider and deeper, which will help the company move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better place than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients worldwide.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual delivery of more than $50 billion and " will be focused on the provision of previously incomplete technological solutions" to companies, is reported in the statement of the company.
This is how the company educated in the 1930s by the Stanford University of Bill Hughlett and Dave Pacard for electrical equipment is divided; their garage in Palo Alto was called "the place of the birth of the Kremni Valley".
Hewlett Packard is in a massive reorganization process to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This step of HP, the second in the world of the manufacturer of personal computers and one of the largest U.S. Technical Company, is the latest development in the sector based on confidence that the insolvented companies work better.
"Arsenala" Captain Michel Arteth said that his collapseers should support the traumatic Jack Wilshire before the game with "Dinamo Zagreb"
In his conversation with Wilshire Wanger, he also emphasized that only September, and that if the reconstruction of Wilshire would go according to the plan, nothing would prevent him from returning to the Christmas game.
With the most favourable development of the events, Wilshire will clearly miss at least four of the next games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European championship will remain questioned next summer.
The most of all in this recent problem is that Wilshire was confidently finished the previous season with the only iron injury and was going to return to the habitual aggressive play style during pre-session training.
Hungarian: "This injury does not threaten his career."
It's just not the end of the bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It's not related to irons or injuries that he's had before.
This may be medically related, but, as Hungarian allowed, there is an additional risk for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also a disadvantaged trend.
According to the Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire had 23 different injuries that occurred to him in six years of his debut.
In addition, he played only 65 of the 157 Arsenala games in the League in the last five seasons.
If you look at the Arsenal schedule, you can note that the six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007-08, "Arsenal" was one of the two Premier League clubs, most of which were missed by the day's injuries.
Hungarian recognizes the probability of stuck in a bad circle, but Arsenal believes that the improvement of injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"Every time after the injury, you have been vulnerable for some time -- you need to rebuild forces and gain competitive advantage," said Wanger.
Jack's young enough and he'll do it.
I hope he'll recover physically, and I'm sure that his career will be what he deserves.
Arsenal starts a campaign in the League of Championships on Wednesday with Dynamo-Zagreb and will continue on Saturday games with Chelsea and next Wednesday with Totenham Hotspore and Wanger intends to make a rotation.
Actor Belierin and Aaron Ramsey did not arrive in Croatia, so they would probably play Matheus Debushi and Artea.
Hungarian may also be composed of Qiran Gibbs and Olivier Jiru instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give a little rest to the players who need it," said Wanger.
Although the Arsenal is an unconditional favorite in group F, the Maximir stadium in Zagreb is the number of the most disturbing in Europe.
"Dinamo" has not lost any of the 41 matches since they had the last season as "Invincible".
On Tuesday night, the stadium was affected by the earthquake by 3.2 points on the Richter scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Hungarian is convinced that the Arsenal had learned the lesson received last season when the team had been defeated in the Monaco League of Champions, and it remains with a weak hope to lead the club to win in the final of the Champion Cup.
"It's an incredible drive," said Wanger.
Arsenal has never done that before.
We were very close to the 2006 goal, but on the other hand, I am a realist with the stake.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons of male friendship
The absence of such stories is in the eye, especially if the desperate need for men to be honest is now more than ever, with the level of suicide among young men at the maximum of 15 years.
In 2013, this was the only greatest cause of death between 20 and 45 years in the United Kingdom, and the men were three times more often than women.
In an attempt to deal with the Company against Unfortunate Life, the year 2015 was announced by men in order to challenge a culture that prevents men from looking for assistance when they need it.
Friendship is in the center of this battle to take this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 universities with depression symptoms revealed that if a patient has enough friends in normal mood, the chances for healing are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the range of mentally healthy friends reduces the chance of mental disorders.
But, of course, for friendship to work, it needs to be.
In the age when communications are managed by social networks, when the style prefers content, the response speed is often more valuable than the content contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, loving joy and successful, even if it is real loneliness.
Such surface success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, images, social status, entirely by internal values, our internal desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a stronger impact on our mental health.
And, as a billionaire recently noticed, a video gamemaker, you can't buy any more happiness for money.
The dignity of Friends is that they attract attention to this.
Each of the characters had been defined not by their own work, but rather by the personality that came in contact with friends.
Jumor Joey and Chandler's constant hugs, the moments of football reviewing on comfortable chairs, Ross' sighs on Rachel -- all comes from understanding that men can feel that, even if they are often absent of full exploration of their feelings.
As Samarins officer said to me: "... my role in listening to people who feel depressed and self-suicide stresses how even the smallest association of friends can benefit."
Often, men who are approaching us feel unable to talk to friends.
The old lesson "live with this" is strong, just as it feels that a frank conversation about problems can be considered as weakness."
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I'm trying to offer more working mechanisms to overcome.
It emphasized the moments of male friendship.
With regard to my task, the status of a foreign speaker on the phone helps people when they are desperate, and long-term support comes from the neighbouring circle of family and friends.
So if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where the decorations have been fully restored for the celebration, why don't you take your friends to the Central Perk.
Or even better, if you see a lonely man in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
Not to guess what kind of friendship can benefit.
The Friends Series show at Comedy Central from the beginning and to the end, all 236 series, by tag #FriendsFest
Dee Maria's hitting the goal by helping the PSJ to smash "Malmo"
Angel di Maria and Brad Matthews and Edinson Cawani celebrates the swords at the Malmo gate.
Anhel di Maria, debutted in the League of Champions, stabbed a goal, which allowed the PSJ to easily cross Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the response to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cawani did their case when Parry Saint German started her game in the League of Champions with a very comfortable victory 2:0 against Malmo on the Park De Prens stadium on Tuesday.
Dee Maria hit the ball less than four minutes after his first game in the League of Championships started as a PSJ player, to set a direction to French champions, but they missed a number of possibilities before they finally increased their advantages when Kawani hit the goal for 61 minutes.
In addition to the Real Madrid and the Child Shahter group A, the money had to take a good start in the game against Sweden's championships, because they were targeted not to playoff qualifications, but to continue a series of successful games in the last three seasons where they reached the quarterfinals.
They earned the shoes, but it was not the best decision of Lauran Blan to count Golden Ibrahimovic as useless in the attack and subsequently to replace him in a field in a game against the team from his own city and club, in which he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It is difficult to win homes or guests in the League of Championships, so that we can win with account 2:0, deliver the challenges to the rivals and play greatly in protection is a good start, even if there are other moments that we need to finish during the season," said Blan.
It's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, though I wish we didn't hit one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovic returned after the injury in one of the substitutes of the Paris team, which brought her with an account of 2:2 in the game with the First League on the weekend, but left it to the rear plan of Dee Maria for the fourth minute.
The Argentinian attacker was noted as a player able to turn the PSJ to a new level in Europe after he was purchased from the Manchester United last month, and he proved why when he ran away from Marco Verratti behind the protection of Malmo and had beautifully completed the attack by sending the ball past Johann Villand to a remote corner of the gate.
However, if someone was expecting a light and great victory then they had to be disappointed.
"Malmo", which won Seltik in the playoff to reach this stage, having a serious opponent in the beginning of the game, five defenders and two resistant semi-protectors in the middle of the field.
But except for Nicolas Djurgic's hit, with a ball flying past Kevin Trapp's gate for the 34th minute, they attacked a little bit.
However, the PSJ has sometimes failed himself by irrelevant transmissions and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who was not able to implement at least five attempts in the first half, and then could not process the ball that was killed by Cawani immediately after the game was resumed.
However, he showed himself much more skillful in the exact passages, and it was a passage from Ibrahimovic, which, Di Mary, had sent a ball with a pinched bullet that passed to the Wiland stamp for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally slaughtered after the clock marked by Cawana, and the Uruguayian hit his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovic fixed the ball sent to the center of the field from the left flang Maxwell.
This put an end to all the ideas that Malmo had about returning to the game, and only Viland's ball capture from a close distance did not allow David Louis to increase the final account before the substitute of Essequel Lavessey did not count the goal at the end of the match.
Age Haraide coach later admitted that PSG was a class above his team, and Norwegian said, "Our last game in the League of Champions took place last December."
Since then, we played only in the Swedish League, and that's not the level.
Insufficient qualifications.
Praise "Money"!
It was a great match with them.

The forthcoming activities in Sochi and the interim outcomes of cooperation are described by the honored General Consul of the Republic of Belarus in Tumeni, Vladimir Schugla, a member of the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovic, what are the tasks of the Forum?
The scale in Sochi reflects the industrial policies of the Federal State.
It is based on the fruitful cooperation of the regions - important relationships between the two States.
President Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukašenko, were planned to participate in the plenary meeting.
In the framework of the plenary and sectional meetings, the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policies, the rule of law and programmes of the Federal State.
The forum will be held by the Governor of the Tumen area.
I believe that this shows the successful, sustainable interregional cooperation of the region and Belarus.
The forum will also be accompanied by representatives of Professional Ministries and Departments, Russian and Belarus entrepreneurs.
Trade shops and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tumen region, will work.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
I will add that the first such meeting was held in Minsk in June last year.
More than 200 delegates, including from 19 regions, participated in his work.
At the same time, a very important collaboration treaty between the Tumenian and the Minsk Areas was signed.
The significance of our work is also the fact that the meeting of a permanent seminar at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union and Belarus was held in Tumena.
Furthermore, the APC delegation of the Tumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to explore the experience of Belarus ' work in the preparation of agricultural staff, to identify additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in the agro-industrial complex.
You have recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What subjects were discussed?
During the meeting with the Governor of the Tumen area, Vladimir Jakushov was discussing the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus in contemporary difficult conditions.
The question of the supplies of the Belarus agricultural technique and the use of financial mechanisms will be raised, and it is necessary to reduce the cost of machines for the final consumer.
Problems were discussed in the work of the Tuumen Trade House of Belšina and the prevention of losses.
Questions are important, since investment projects should work clearly and make profits to the region.
There were further supplies of OAO Trade Trade Technology, the development of the OAO OAZ Service Centre, which was established in Tumen on the OAO TPATP.
The discussion also addressed the travel of the work delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus until the end of the year.
Another theme of the discussion was the conclusion of the harmonization and signing of the Agreement on Trade and Economic, Technology and Cultural Cooperation of the Tumen area and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamic of relations promises to become a new level.
These issues were also related to the area centre.
During the meeting with the head of the city of Tumeni, Alexander Moor, we talked about the updating of the Tumen bus park.
Approximately 100 buses are already "freeing on the ladan", so a new part of the vehicles from Belarus are required to work on gas, environmentally clean fuel.
Another aspect: The Tumen elevator collaborates with one of the leading elevators of the OAO " Mogilevliftmash" producers, receiving complementary.
In my view, these activities could be more active, taking into account the new elevator programmes in the area centre.
I would add that, within the extended powers of the consul, there was a meeting with the Governor of the Kurganese area, Alex Kokorin, which discussed the increase of the goods and delivery of modern Belarusian technique in Zauralia.
At the end of September, a meeting with the Ome governor is scheduled.
The enlarged Consul County includes five PF subjects, but the Tumen can be called the district headquarters.
The region is a polygon for many prospective projects, including the work of the honored genconsul.
Such meetings are generally important and good by allowing many problems to be addressed directly and quickly by taking off their sharpness and developing mutual collaboration.
In the present circumstances, it is essential not to ruin the assassination by continuing to work for the prospect.
Matt Damon against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people engaged in film production
Matt Damon argued with an African producer, Effy Brown, claiming that ethnic composition is not necessary.
During the Sunday Show Project Greenlight on the HBO channel, a famous actor override Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views for the main black heroin in the design scenario.
"Multiform is suitable when you're performing a casting for the movie itself, not for the show," insisted Damon.
The freaked Brown, without trusting her ears, cried out offensively, "Wow, wow." As long as an actor from "Marsian" commented in a direct air.
To discuss the finalists of the show with Damon and Brown, producers Ben Afflek and the brothers of Farelli joined.
"I wish that participants -- no matter who will be the director -- were wondering what tracts of the Harmony image they were going to follow," Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute beating white suit.
The film producer of Dear White People has spoken to make the film directors Leo Angelos and Christen Brancaccio; Damon was a sharp opposition, saying that "in the end we can get the wrong thing we want."
After this discussion was shown on TV, social networks exploded by unapproved comments on Damon.
The user of Twitter MrPooni angeredly said about the video, "The explanation of the point of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black man in that White room, which hurt so much."
Tweet picked up more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 liquors.
Damon's statements appear when a literally highlighted racial topic in the media is the most acute issue of the public discussion agenda.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement became popular throughout the country, calling on legislators and authorities to stop discrimination against the colorful population.
In February, the singer of Prince mentioned this movement during the presentation of the pretendents in the Album Year at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
"The albums are still important," he said.
As books and lifes of black people, the albums are still important.
Recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter motion issued an official statement in response to the question of Fox News Elizabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group would be considered as a group of haters.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," said the leaders of the movement.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of show business, producers and media Magnates invited to visit the Pope of Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unknown whether the actor accepted the invitation and whether he met with the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" rewards the first champion
Professional scale and assistant officer Isaac Caldiero became the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show on Monday night, and took home a prize of $1 million.
At this sports show, the seventh season that has just ended, no participants have been able to pass all stages of the road with obstacles.
In the final season, two participants, Caldiero and Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included an increase of 75 feet in 30 seconds.
Britten performed the mission first and took place at the time, became the first athlete in the history of the American Ninja Warrior, the past fatigue phase 4, but Caldiero had done the task for three seconds faster, which made him a winner.
After the winning of the incredible work, Caldiero, who was in shock of winning a million dollars, gave an interview with E!News.
"To think of this incredible, I have never earned or lived more than 10,000 dollars a year," Isaac commented to journalists E! such a serious jump of my income.
And suddenly... I never even imagined how this happens... the future is unknown.
An executive producer Kent Wid met the Hollywood Reporter journalists to discuss the final and why Britten, who first passed the route, would not receive any cash prize.
According to the rules, the money is obtained by the fastest participant.
"If more than one finalized players, the prize gets the fastest one of them," Wid said.
Although money is a wonderful reward and changes life, it still gets great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels insulted about this.
He's happy with what he did.
He received tons of excited responses from fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I was judged to lose someone, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same if we changed our roles.
The American Ninja Warrior show will be returned with the eighth season that will begin to take off in the spring of 2016.
"Detroit Tygers" are quietly crossing Minnesota Twins.
MINEAPOLIS - The second half of the season was not particularly fun for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams once, Tygers, is now taking the last place in the Central Division of the American League.
It's only to be a disturbance, the Tygers won on Tuesday at Minnesota Twins with 5-4 at Target Field.
Twins missed the chance to reduce half-game retirement from Houston Astros and take the second place in the playoff at the number of points after the winners.
For the detroits, even for one night, it was the return of the word to the letter F, which slipped out most of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they get," said Brad Osmus, manager Tygers.
Pitcher Tygers, Alfredo Simon, contributed to the attacks, resulting in three points in the first two innings, added another one at sixth and one in ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a drinker in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third quality start in nine ways.
"I just want to finish a year with good indicators," said Simon.
Pitchers are not able to throw in every game, and that's why I want to go deeper into the game.
The designated Taigers Victor Martinez was able to reverse three strikes and reached two wounds -- the first RBI from the middle of August.
It was the first day with three hits since four hits in the game against Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
"He worked well with a bit," said Osmus.
He showed himself well in (a quality of better), better in the work of a bit and maintained this quality for the game.
Three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, Twins got their best chance to go back to the game.
The central host Byron Baxton opened inning on the left side of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, made a gang, took the first base, and the second bayman Bryan Dozer got a strike-auto on Simon before his place was taken by the left Blane Hardy.
Hardy went through Moire, the only player on the road, before the new designated Miguel Sano, who exploded the two-rano "singl" on the left of the right hand Drew Verhagen.

The original complaint of Kadirov on the book "Please to God" entered the South Sahalian Court.
The South-Sahalian City Court received the original appeals from the President of Chetney Ramzan Kadirov to the decision of recognition of the “extremist material” of the book “Request to God: its importance and place in Islam”, reports Interfax with reference to the President of the Gordus Aleksandr Chuhrai.
The court is now waiting for possible objections to the participants of the process.
Chuhrai refused to comment on the statements made by some representatives of the RF State on the need to check the board for possible cooperation with foreign services and IGIL.
"Let them comment on such nonsense," he said.
On 11 September, the South Sahali City Prosecutor filed an appeal to Judge Natalie Perchenko's decision on the recognition of the book by the Extremist Material.
A complaint came from the South Sahalian prosecutor on Friday night.
There are nuances: The prosecutor believes that they have requested the court to recognise the extremist only the opinion of the author of the book, not the ayats of the Coran.
In the opinion of the prosecutor, the judge has taken a wrong decision," said Chuhrai.
The decision on the recognition of the " extremist material " was adopted on 12 August 2015.
In particular, "extremists" were called quotations from the Quran: "We worship you, and pray for help."
Cadirov called the decision-makers on the book "Shaitans and Provokers".
He called on the Deputies of the State to prohibit legislative judgments relating to the text of the Holy Scriptures.
"I am firmly convinced that the State must adopt a law which prohibits the decision in court relating to the texts of the Quran and other divine Scriptures," Cadirov wrote in his Instagram.

The operational blocking of the unlawful content should also be made by organizations whose professionals are engaged in collecting complaints from users on insulting posts.
The Facebook Guide intends to provide the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts with negative statements to migrants and refugees, the leadership of the social network and the Ministry of Justice of Germany was adopted after the German Facebook segment had rapidly increased xenophobic moods.
One of the most obvious reasons for them has become unprecedented by their scale the migration crisis covered by the countries of the European Union a few years ago.
In Germany, then, all refugee items are already filled with today.

According to the chapter of GBU “Ritual”, when the need to expand the cemetery, the builders will try to maintain existing forest massages as far as possible.
Green plants will serve as a living fence that will divide rest zones and places placed directly under the places to be buried.
The GBU " Ritual " experts also stated their intention to make a proposal for refusal from fences in the funerals.
The new cemetery can really become barrelless.
Furthermore, the Ritual in GBU announced the readiness to establish electronic terminals, with which visitors of the cemetery will be able to know GPS coordinates and numbers of funeral signs.

News of Economy ◯ Nobel Laureath: Globalization
The printing of the Globalization Process had to contribute to the reduction of inequality in the world.
In fact, the difference in the income of the population in the economies in developing countries is different.
Eric Maskin.
In order to correct this, the level of education of low-qualified workers should be improved, the Chief Scientific Officer of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Election of Decisions of the NIU WSCE, the Nobel Prize Laureate of the 2007 Economy.
In the past twenty years, the world has survived the unexpected growth of global markets.
Trade borders between countries were increasingly open.
Globalization parties predicted great benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have come true," Muskin emphasized.
For example, China and India have had a serious increase in GDP per capita.
But it's not all so gracious.
Globalization was expected to reduce the decline between " poor " and " poor" in poor countries, which appeared in a large inequality of income and, more specifically, labour salaries.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, Eric Maskin noted in its article "Why the global markets did not reduce the inequality in developing economies," published in the World Bank Economic Review, translated and quoted by NEE WHE.
In conjunction with the economist, the professor of the Harvard University, Michael Kremer Maskin, developed an alternative theory, which demonstrates why the difference in incomes in poor countries as globalization grows, reminds N.E. W.S.E.
There are specific processes in the new global market.
In order to demonstrate them, Maskin allocates four qualifications - A and B to rich countries, C and D for the poor.
Following globalization, the D experts from poor countries lack the level of qualification to cooperate with Professionals A and B from rich countries.
And if pay is growing from poor countries through co-operation with wealthy members of B, D-raising workers do not feel or their salaries are falling.
The resulting effect is that the internationalization of production will contribute to increasing labour breakdown between two categories of professionals in poor countries and to increase inequality accordingly.
Cremer and E. Maskinom were offered a remarkably beautiful model, alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantages.
It explains why globalization has led to inequality in income," said Fuad Aleskerov, a regular professor in the International Laboratory of Analysis and Election, head of the NIU Mathematical Department.
And as any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to an explosion of empirical work in this area.
The solution to the problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to improve the level of education of low-qualified workers.
However, the workers themselves, as the scientist notes, have no funds for that, but companies are uncomfortable to pay their training.
In this situation, Governments, international agencies, NCOs and private funds can play a significant role, considers Maskin.
The scientist notes that the developed theory does not call for a halt of the globalization process that has brought and produced its fruits as GDP growth.

There was a business game at the airport in Domodedo.
The capital has a new form of training.
Four hundred students tried themselves as airport staff.
For this, three aircraft models were mounted in Domodedov.
Young people were not only watching and registering passengers, but also serving aircraft.
All of this is a business game, but it has not become more real.
The late flights, immediately two passengers with breaks on the ship, lost the trail somewhere on the road to the plane.
For the real airport, hell.
For the one founded in the hangard, Domodedova is a standard set of tasks to be decided by the new women.
Three major airports from different countries were located in one hangar.
Today, there are four hundred students from capital colleges and knees.
It's an unprecedented chance to know everything about the internal world of aircraft.
The registration of passengers, the service of aircraft, the turnover of luggage, even buses in the summer field, trawls and surveillance of passengers.
And the passengers are quite troubled.
One disorder with the documents, another late for the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious objects.
And we need to deal with this, as in life, at a minimum time.
For each of these tasks, they have a certain amount, virtual money, as if airlines paid them the corresponding amounts for flight service.

The US Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The US Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the foreign literature of the American Centre in the Library.
The Centre has worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The US Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unanimous decision of the Russian Government to close the United States Embassy Centre to the Unilateral State Library, M.I. Rudomino, Moscow.
"The unilateral steps taken by the RF recently have questioned the commitment of the Government of Russia to link between the Russian and the American peoples that were not interrupted even during the cold war and in other difficult times of the long history of our relations," said the US Ambassador John Tefft, in the Interfax statement.
The American Centre has created deep and strong links between the people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It represented the centre of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, as well as the place of meeting with numerous American visible actors, including astronauts, artists, sportsmen, scientists, politics and writers.
"Only last year, the American Centre conducted over 400 cultural and educational activities and took over 50,000 Russian visitors," the diplomat stressed.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX Educational Exchange Programme (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal was quick to debate.
Typical situation: Four officials are standing in front of the table of Judge Swatanter Kumar, hearing his claims for the work done.
The court is not fully satisfied with the quality of your work.
We have not given you a 110-party order to enjoy it,” said Kumar.
If there's one more brick, we'll have to take down all the buildings we have.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NZT) — the judicial authority established in 2010 to stop the rapid environmental pollution, accompanied by a violent economic growth of the past decades.
During that time, the Tribunal had managed to consider more than 10,000 air pollution lawsuits, gathering garbage, geological developments, toxic wastes and the construction of dambs.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to stop the construction leading to pollution.
Incredibly high rates: in the incomplete 60 years since the announcement of independence of the increased industrial development, India has become from the country of virgin jungles to one of the most inhabited and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large megapolis, where infrastructure development does not cope for rapid urbanization: cities covered with dense capacities, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste of enterprises and households, and few remaining housing massives are excluded from new housing blocks.
Despite the formal support of the green movement by the State, NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narandra Modi, as it often becomes the main cause of the cancellation of largest investment projects.
In May this year, the Minister of Environment called the Court ' s decisions ' extremal' and 'incomplete'.
Sometimes the court's decision is in fact impossible to fulfil the time given by the court, reaffirms the environmental attorney Raj Pandžwani.
However, incomplete dedlines have a positive side: at least they make responsible persons move.
"His main goal is to shook the system," adds the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly cancelled large buildings: the cease-building of airport, electricity and hundreds of smaller buildings.
They also try to remember people, for example, during the discussion of the fate of the pharmaceutical company in the State of Telagnan, which polluted the local river with ftoridom.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
"The people will lose their job," he commented on his decision, Kumar.
Such explanations, however, do not always find understanding in simple people whose life can be changed through one handwriting of the judicial feather.
Thus, in April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over 10 years of age of entry into the capital than the international disrespect.
Despite rapidly falling popularity and criticism, Swatter Kumar refused to cancel this decision.
Instead, he ordered the Government of Delhi statistics on a drive-and-road vehicle, as well as offered a proposition to buy 10,000 additional buses prior to finding out in the factories whether they could perform such orders.
As the court’s attention began to fall into the field of pollution, such as disposal, fuel quality, and even road incidents, the people's anger began to be slightly consolidated.
But the most painful theme of the Principal Judge was the Gang River Cleaning Programme, with the auspices informed by Prime Minister Narendro Modi last year.
When it comes to Ganga, a sacred river for the Indians, the judge often ceases to keep his emotions and moves to scream.
You know what the word "sacred"?
Somebody poured water from Gang into the statue of God, and there were fecalies in it, and the judge is hot.
You continue to pollute the river because you think Gang is Gang, he will take all our sins.
This is the river we worship, and see what you do to her every day.
The cleaning of Gang is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project provided by the new Government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds more than 120 times.
Each year, from 1,5 to 3 of the 700 million Hindu bathers die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even sacrificed money to the Gang Rescue Fund for the sale of his suit, in which he met with Barack Obama and 455 other items from his personal collection.
Ecolabels immediately accused the Prime Minister of Populism: the costume was purchased for $700, while at least eight billion were required for the cleaning of the river.
Participants of the Green Tribunal agree that India has to take a long way before it can call itself a developed country, but they do not believe that the price of progress should be an environmental price.
"In the developing country, talks on the environment are often seen as disadvantaged luxury," said the Activist of the Ganga Organization, Malik Bhanott.
The court is trying to find a gold midst between environmental and development."
