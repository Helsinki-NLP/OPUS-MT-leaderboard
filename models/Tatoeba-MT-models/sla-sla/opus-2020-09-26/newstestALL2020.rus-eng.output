The official representative of the Office of the KNR on Taiwan Ma Seaguan said this on Friday.

TikTok hides unpleasant videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of which are under the age of 18
Imagine China / Reuters
The Chinese Social Network of TikTok is subject to censorships of videos that refer to the Tinjanmen area, the independence of Tibet or the prohibited religious group of Falunghun, reports The Guardian.
The documents found in the publication indicate that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance company) through the annex promotes the objectives of China ' s external policy abroad.
The majority of the violations of China's policies are under the "inflammation of hatred".
In any case, TikTok places disadvantaged publications in the context suitable for general rules so that the social network does not seem to be a censor.
For example, the prohibition of the criticism of China's socialist system is under the general prohibition of “cryticism or attacks on politics and social rules of any country such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc.”.
The prohibition of mention of incidents in the Tanyanmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under the “representation of the history of China or other countries”.
The document also provides a list of the prohibited names of twenty " foreign leaders or State actors", including North Korean leaders Kim Chen Ira, Kim Ir Sena and Kim Chen Hyna, Indian politics Mahatmu Gandhi, American Presidents Donald Trampa and Barack Obama, the Japanese Prime Minister Sindzo Abbe, South Korean President Pack Kin Hi, President of Indonesia, Joco Vido and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, indicated in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as indicated in the document.
Publications from the first category are removed by the social administrators and are able to block the user.
Not too strict violations relate to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules are old and are no longer applicable: "We are now using a localized approach and attract independent local specialists."
The Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on the publication, composer of the Producer Centre told Ruste Bogdans.
The Producer Centre is one of the Russian media companies who officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of the Producer Centre agree with representatives of social networks, but user materials can be placed without a consent, Bogdans transmitted.
On the question of whether politics or Putin can be spoken in TikTok, Goddanov responded firmly and said that he had seen such publications.
The founder of Our Didgital Roman Zaripov agrees with Goddanov: "The basic rules for the users of TikTok lists in the user ' s agreement: the shocking content, discriminating statements and so on. "
However, any content that does not like moderators can be imposed under these rules is noted by Zaripov.
Zaripov's agency is another Russian partner TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of which are under the age of 18.
According to the user's agreement, TikTok can only use 13-year-old persons.
Social Administrators check their age through artificial intellectual intelligence: neuroscience analyzes the faces and determines how many years a person looks, Goddan says.
If the neuroscience decides that the user is younger, the account can be removed, he adds.
According to RBK, ByteDance opened the office in Moscow in the WeWork Kovorking territory in September 2019.

According to ESO, this week, the construction of the building, where the E-ELT telescope will be located (European Extremely Large Telescope, European supercrupted telescope), was officially launched until the most expensive and ambitious astronomical project.
Its total value, according to the ESO, would exceed a billion euros.
Most of these money will be spent on the production of equipment and construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complicated component of the telescope is its recorded large mirror whose diameter will be about 39 meters.
It will be gathered from 798 six-angle segments of 1.4 metres.
This enormous mirror, as well as two supporting surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 metres, will help E-ELT get the first detailed pictures of the planets outside the Solar System, the stars in other galaxies, as well as to find the Earth's binaries.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to monitor the areas of Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole in the centre of the Milk Path.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome was only launched, mirrors, scientific instruments and other observatory components of the scientists, engineers and other experts have developed for three years since the first E-ELT announcement plans.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total value was approximately 400 million euros, received the German SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
