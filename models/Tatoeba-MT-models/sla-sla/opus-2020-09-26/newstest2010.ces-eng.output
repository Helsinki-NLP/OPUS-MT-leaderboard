Barack Obama will receive the Fourth President of the Nobel Prize of Peace
The American President Barack Obama will fly to Norwegian Oslo for 26 hours to take the Nobel Prize here as the fourth American President in history.
Diplom, medail and check at $1.4 million, among other things, will receive an extraordinary effort to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The Chief of the White House will fly to the Norwegian Metropole in the morning and with Michelle's wife, and she'll be busy.
First he welcomes the Nobel Institute, where he first met with five members of the committee, which he was selected from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The president's couple then has an appointment with Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonjoa.
After afternoon, the visit will summit the ceremony to which Obama will take prestigious appreciation.
He will gain it as the fourth president of America, but only the third who gets the price directly in the office.
The White House has already reviewed that Obama will speak about Afghan war when he considers appreciation.
The president does not want to avoid this subject because he realizes that he takes the price as a president, who is currently warring in two countries.
A few days ago, war effort has increased by sending further units to Afghanistan, which will not forget to emphasize any of his critics.
At the Obama ceremony, he will also receive a gold medal, diploma and check for ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
She's going to put you on charity, but he hasn't decided on a specific charity yet.
The charged programme will then lead the president with hotness to a banket, where he will also be the Minister of Minister and the Queen, and another 250 invited guests.
Obama was more delayed from the beginning to the price.
He, for example, stated that he felt that he did not deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that it was not only for him, but for all those who seek the same values as he.
Right after the announcement, he said he was "a call for action."
Protectors of Nature accused of blackmail
The Lithuanian police accused the President of the Civil Association of Nature Protectors of Lithuania of Extortion.
In several cases in the past year, he appealed to some construction proceedings, he demanded money from investors for his benefit, said Lithuanian police speaker Alena Rom.
The chairman of the Lithuanian Nature Protection Society is Lubomir Studnik.
Now he's in custody and is threatened to be three years in prison.
Brnu's not smell too much.
In Prague, ordinary people can sort packages from drinks, in the south-moral villages you will again meet classing containers at each step.
And in Brna?
That's where you can make a few minutes before you find the appropriate garbage.
I don't want to argue that it wouldn't be a garbage in Brno.
But it seems to me that we're the second largest town in the Republic, they're not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the forest line of waste classification not only by being citizens, we can still throw paper, glass and plastic, but in particular by the number of waste garbages to such waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a PET bottle in the center?
It's a complete buddy, especially it wants time and tight nerves.
The only place I've ever met is on the Moravian Square on the other side of the Potentian Hus.
Don't let Mr. Onderka get mad at me with his colleagues, but I don't think it's a hell of a bit.
Not to mention that, even in other parts, there is no waste classification.
Many of my friends don't want to do that.
From lazyness.
Because they've got it far from the garbage.
I don't wonder them.
I offered myself after the party to throw a few glass and plastic bottles out.
But I didn't see any coloring trash in Counic's street in the supervision.
Fortunately, I ran into the right place.
However, the waste went through.
It's still the center of Brna, which the city is most representing, isn't it?
But the ecology and some esthetics probably don't care much about the bronze socialists.
They prefer to buy a hockey extralig, which will shame us all over the Republic than buy a few extra containers and offer other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I could have confirmed my assumption after a time of browsing on the Internet with official statistics.
According to the EKO-KOM data, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravian region.
"Paruubkov" budget took money for pensions and sickness
After the left added the opinion of the government to farmers or officials, there must be no pension, sickness or construction money in the budget.
But also interests from State debt or international judicial disputes.
This brings trouble to those who will rule in the second half of the next year, says the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and Communist elevated some groups, they relied on sensitive expenditures, pensions or hospital governments to loan additionally. "It's just putting problems into the future, betting mines," Janota says.
Because the loan money is increasingly paid and sometimes it has to be returned.
It's too much to choose where to take it, it doesn't have a state.
If it does not reduce the social doses or the cost of the state's entry, it must raise taxes.
Everyone who's left now added to: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And later, to their children.
Retirement or hospital, from which the account disappeared 1.8 billion, people don't have to worry, they get them.
However, at the price of more debts – the next year will not be missing only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow faster and with him and the interest costs.
The State will need money for its remuneration and it will no longer be sufficient to increase the VAT or to reduce the mother's, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
For money transfers for several election groups, five billion will also be missing next year for road and railways.
It is mostly of the already constructed and set sections that are not able to be re-designed and, if possible, discarded.
The biggest reservation, which is not also free.
This means a delay or suspension of thirty large buildings, also the risk of drawing European money, warns the speaker of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CHSSD suggested that the loss of money will solve the Shalamounsky – will affect the dividends of the CEZ, which is of the most own, and will contribute to the transport fund.
The problem is that the above dividenda is never certain, and it's not a single source anymore.
Last year, from CEZ to the budget of 18 billion.
Each year, dividends are subject to the elimination of environmental damage, the pension account is supplemented or served as a reserve for the planned retirement reform.
Furthermore, this trick, under EU rules, increases the actual deficit of the budget to the level of 5.7 per cent of GDP.
However, this is not the end of the carnaval of movements.
Almost three billion have lost the budget for various communism and criminal offences or expenditures on judicial disputes, even for construction disputes.
If it's going to happen without this money, it's not sure.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international dispute, we'll have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, in the worst case, to reach the government budget reserve.
A hundred million are also missing on the already uptaked two-million national treasury project, which is to allow the online to monitor, for what individual authorities spend.
The first stage will start in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, the sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems.
The Americans are counting on a mobile phone in the future, on which the user will press a single button to switch between different operating systems.
Exposed plans sound promising.
Just press one key and you will move from Windows Mobile in a few seconds to Android.
This is exactly what it puts on the aim of the U.S. VMware company, which focuses mainly on the development of a virtualization software for computers.
We'll allow you to run two user profiles at the same time.
You can switch between them, you can split them into home and work.
Both will work at the same time, named Srinvas Krishnamurti from VMware in an interview for Computer Computerworld.
He was presented in November last year and was first presented several days ago.
It will be marketed in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully produced a smartphone test sample with two operating systems.
It was modified by Nokia N800 with RAM size 128 MB, on which the Windows Mobile and Android systems were running alongside each other.
The development of a new technology for mobile phones is in full stream.
Now VMware cooperates with European and American operators to test smartphone virtualization and to customers should be reached during 2012.
The lack of snow on the mountains suffers from hotels
The naked conventions don't worry about just the croconic luthers.
The missing snow also distracts people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonosis are still allowed to acquire rooms for all the winter terms, including Christmas and Silvestra.
We have a big visit on our sites.
People go through offers, detect prices, but yet they are afraid to order.
And if they're calling us, they're asking right now if we think that this year's Christmas will be on snow or mud," said the operator of the Spindl information portal.Info Martin Jandura.
Who wants a Silvester stay in Spindler's Milk exactly according to his imagination, he said he should not hesitate with the order.
Who prefers money savings and the quality of accommodation is in his place elsewhere, he can still try to wait a few days.
Spindler hotels offer Silvestra mostly only weekly stays.
I think they'll try to give them up for a while, but then they'll allow and go for a shorter time.
And then the free rooms will live quickly," estimated Jandura.
The free bed in all winter terms still offers the top-fashioned travel office of Ingtours.
Now we're most interested in Christmas week that is not yet sold.
That's how half of the places in our offer remain free.
That's why we have already set up some cheaper Christmas stays for the last minute," said Director Ingtoursu Peter Schiefert.
Silvestra in Krkonosich can offer the top-fashioned travel office, but the free places are less.
The first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter terms are selling average.
This year, interest in winter stays negatively affects the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonos.
People are waiting if he attacks.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on the mountains without snow.
If they are snowed during the week of the convention, Christmas will also be produced," said Schiefert.
On the contrary, something better than the voyage can be held in the Horizont hotel in Peca under Snow.
We're about five percent better at that.
We have the last few places for Silvestro and Christmas.
The great interest is in the Polish holidays in January and is also sold in February," informed the director of the best peck hotel, Karel Council.
Of 80 percent, the hotel Omnia has a hotel at the central parking area in Janski Lazni.
On the contrary, on Christmas, there remains half the beds of free in the latest lazy hotel.
Nicely this year, we were surprised by the January that we already have around sixty percent.
It's a little weaker until February, but once the snow attacks, the interest in staying in Krkonoshi will certainly be raised, said the director of the Omnia Eric Sporysch hotel.
However, on the bigger snow part, the crustaceas hotels must have a taste.
Thursday, if there's some snowfall, there should be snowbones on the mountains.
But then hence again, he informed Jirie Jacobs from the castle office of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repeat is the mother of wisdom
It's as comic, with what school skills Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest, repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, who he himself thought was the dumbest.
When he finally sweated his desired Afghan doctrine, it turns out he described it through a copy from Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not only in the text itself, he has several times used the word "as in Iraq," but he didn't even hesitate to use the name Bush's statement from January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New way forward".
He himself criticised Bush's idea to send fresh military forces to Iraq as "independent and in its consequences of a catastrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy based on the recommendations of Polish Commanders was the only possible and most successful enough that today, in Iraq's rapporteurship talks are not at all.
It did not improve the reputation of Bush, but he objectively left his successor much more grateful than it was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle is repeated.
He was asked to increase the military contingent again, especially the top commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even despite the subordinational habit criticised heighty shooters in the White House.
He asked for 40,000 men to break the situation to better.
The president was hesitating for three months, but he didn't seem better, so at least he screwed the General for 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he was able to erase another five thousand promises, even though he originally counted at least 10.
The most difficult in the entire Obam strategy seems to be his intention to start downloading armies from Afghanistan in 18 months and to terminate this process in three years. The whole Obam's doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that half an increase will give the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the hostile war in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders honor the agreement.
The Afghan situation is indicated by the opposite symptom - no one can be relyed on and no agreements are observed.
Under these conditions, the Afghan security forces used to change the master every day according to their fitness.
Political institutions, even if they are formally established, will remain only a rural village for which patriarchal tribal relations will continue.
The balance of the interests of various ethnic groups is unusually complicated in view of the unreasonableness of ratios that even more complicate Pakistan and Iranian influences.
Even building "Accessibility State", which is a minimum target for the entire operation, doesn't seem too real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy infects its voluntaryism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only been worsening and now it is on the edge of the explosion.
To believe that soldiers sending to war waves to "swift return home" will cause a miracle here, only the soul really romantic, in fact not touched.
Politically, the determination of the date of the withdrawal of the armies is by undue responsibility, as Taliban will consider it an intermediate recognition of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in fighting operations in Afghanistan is a minority.
European politicians do not even want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy relates to the war in the underground of Hindukus.
Another factor that is capable of radically affecting the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to be worsened and the strengthened sanctions on Iran will not affect the United States, it will be a difficult question whether to try to solve the problem with the military force.
It will be necessary to answer it just when Obama says that America will move to the winning download from Afghanistan.
However, every such solution will also mean a dramatic turning in the Afghan situation.
The only plate for Barack Obama is that there are three years left for presidential elections, and so there is still enough time to come with another strategy if it turns out to be a total failing.
The Goldman Sachs bank managers will no longer receive rewards in cash
The high-level officials of the US Bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash rewards this year.
It was announced by a company that responded to the acute criticism of its remuneration practices.
The group of 30 front managers will receive instead of the money of the stock that will be sold in five years.
Furthermore, the actions may be taken by the managers if they are excessively risked.
Goldman Sachs is so set up by the Reuters Agency in the head of the attempt to bond awards on Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction to be issued, the former investment banker of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott stated.
The problem is in details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs Bank has become a target of criticism after the first three quarters of this year has paid a party nearly $17 billion (about 300 billion Kč) for rewards.
The total remuneration in the company for this year, according to the Reuters Agency, apparently, in spite of today's announced measure, exceeds $20 billion.
The high prizes in the banking sector have become a hot political theme in a number of countries with the coming of the financial crisis.
Britain announced in the Wednesday that she would want to bonuses of bankers exceeding 25,000 pounds (about 712.000 CZK) unanimously to charge 50 per cent taxes.
Similar steps are prepared by France.
This year, women have received the Nobel Price in all fields other than physics
The recorded five women today in Stockholm took over from the hands of Swedish King Carla XVI. Gustaf's annual Nobel prices in professional categories and literature.
With four scientists among them, the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine received two American biologies Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider along with their countryman Jack Sistack for chromozom research.
The price for chemistry was received by Israel Ada Jonath along with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for the explanation of the structure and function of the fishosoms.
The latest laureate had Nobel's price for the economy won by American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson for economic administration analysis.
The only professional category that took place this year without the owner was physics.
This price was taken today by scientists Charles As for research in the field of optical fibres and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical videos.
Each evaluated took over the diploma, Nobel's medal and the financial remuneration certificate.
It reaches ten million Swedish crowns in each category (about 25 million CZK).
If they are more marked in each of them, they share the reward between themselves.
Traditionally the most expected Nobel price for peace received this afternoon in Norwegian Oslo, US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognized the controversy of his appreciation, because he is only at the beginning of his path and also stands in the head of the country leading two wars -- in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In the defence of his policies, however, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary to combat peace, even though the price is high.
Mr. Janota considers the demision.
The President Václav Klaus will accept on Friday morning the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janot, who considers the government's endurance, because he disagrees with the form of the state budget for the next year as the Ambassador approved by him on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps Janot's staying in the office will be themes of their Friday meeting.
The startup is criticizing Klaus too.
He believes he has too high deficit, which further enhancing the public financial crisis.
The meeting was informed of the president's speaker Radim Ochvat.
He wants to deal with Prime Minister Jane Fischer on Monday.
According to the Budget Act, which is now given to Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should earn 163 billion crowns.
The Convention, however, agreed on the proposals of the left to move money in Wednesday and increased the money to pay public employees, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government highlighted the proposals for social democracy that hidly raised the budget's deficit.
Among the left of one and the government, Klaus and the right side of the other, there was a sharp internal-politic dispute that started to raise a questionnaire on the other effect of Fischer's official office, for which the OSS, CHSD and the Green Party agreed on spring formation.
The criticism claims that the budget, as the Chamber adopted, is essentially eliminating the package of savings measures that the Fischer's government has emerged on the autumn and which it considers to stop the debt of the State.
Klaus, which the State budget law, but also does not have to sign, on today's breakfast with the entrepreneur, declared that politicians for a long time had ignored the "essential problem", which is "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
He doesn't think he's got a good solution today.
The improvement could only be made by a strong government, which could further support the broader consensus of political parties, the president is thinking.
The President of the ODS Mirek Topolanec stated that the budget is scary and the government should consider another existence.
Vice-President Peter Neweather said the CTC that the concept of the Officer's office with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the green is obviously no longer working.
Prime Minister Fischer in response marked similar words as "powerful words".
The Chief of ČSSD Jiri Paroubek responded to Topolanka by saying that the scary deficit of the budget that the former Topolank government prepared for this year and which would exceed 200 billion crowns.
In Wednesday, she marked the approval of the State budget for the next year for success.
People were also satisfied.
Mandelu played Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's news
South Africa claims that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The unbeaten will tell the world a lot about the earth, its battle and victories despite some critics that the main roles of American actors are.
The story tells about sports, racial relations and Nelson Mandel.
A tired fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in the South African Republic and her first black President Nelson Mandelu in his life story represents an Oscar American actress Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that the 19-year-old Mandela asked him to make it in Eastwood's movie.
Another important role in it plays Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I play you, I'll have access to you.
Twenty-seven-year-old actor who won a price for the Eastwood drama from the box Milion Dollar Baby, has already created a leader of the movement for abolition of slavery, from which he eventually became a slave, a fictional President of the United States, and even a god in God's Evan, but only a rare one who still lives and is as important for many people as Mandela.
For 27 years, the former South African state was in prison for his active work for ending the apartheid in the South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was marked by the Nobel Price for Peace.
Invictus is a Latin word for unbelievable and is the name of the poem of the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The picture is a true story of how Nelson Mandela has connected powers with the captain of the South African football team, Francoise Pienaar, to help unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his people remain after apartheid are still racially and economically divided.
He believes that his people can connect through sports, so he decides to unify football players who belong in the world's standard between outsiders.
The South Africa team will eventually join the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman's been working on getting Mandel's story on the platoon for several years.
I had no other goal than to play this role so that I could get closer to it as real as possible, said Freeman.
Of course, the greatest challenge was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politicians were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, to be behind his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandel with his hand.
I found out that when I printed your hand, I'm taking your energy, transferring, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon forms a film of Françoise Pienaar, a captain of the national football team in which white players were overcome.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for his role in the hard world of football.
The great surprise for him was finally when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I ringed the home bell, he opened me, and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was, "I look much bigger in the movie."
Despite the clear differences in the characters of actors compared to their real proposals under the leadership of the Eastwood director, he won Invictus: Unsupported positive reviews and also talks about ambitions on Oscara.
The film critician of Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summarized his evaluation into the words: "It was a very good story, a very well done movie."
In film reviews on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus has received 76% of positive evaluations.
Secrets of light over Norway: Russians tested the missile
A special light effect of unknown origin could be observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence just admitted yesterday that near the Norwegian borders tested an intercontinental ballist missile.
But the start was again failed and the shot marked as the type of "Bulava", which was originally the Russian army, becomes a black sea of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the missile tests had no appropriate effect on the success of the test flights.
The boulava didn't fly at all or damage itself in the air.
The Russian newspaper already says "Bulava" is like a missile that's not flying.
A rocket that doesn't fly but lights
This one in the order of the 13th attempt was conducted normally at the beginning.
On the end of the flight, there has been a renewed technical damage to the apparatus.
Apparently the engine exploded in the third grade of the missile.
This time, "Bulava" launched from the atomic submarine Dmitri Donsky, who swimmed under the White Sea.
Because this type of missiles allows the shooting from the ship that is in movement and at the same time flooded.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by a nearer uncertain flying object was really broken "Bulava".
Otherwise, Norwegians had no doubt about the Russian missile since the first time.
The generals are defending themselves this time and claiming that it cannot be spoken clearly about failure.
The first two degrees of missiles endured, and the accident struck to the third.
In previous cases, engines broke right in the first degree.
Although no test start has been completed without error, the Ministry of Defence is only six of the thirteen.
Almost 50 per cent of the success of the generals, therefore, fills with optimism, so still claims that "Bulava" will once fly without problems and even take up ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract in CSKA in Moscow in 51 years
Legendary defender Vjačeslav Fetisov will be presented again in a professional hockey fight in 51 years.
The former world master, the Olympic winner and the holder of Stanley Cupu will help his CSKA team in need of Moscow and will apparently enter the Friday duel of KHL against Petrohrad.
Fetisov, who finished his career in the forty years of 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was hurt, we need another defense.
Fetisov trained regularly and agreed to help the team.
We just need to solve some formal matters, quoted by the AP Coach of the Moscow Club Sergei German.
It's not clear yet whether the return of the famous hockeyist will be about only one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the spirit of other players, he said Germans.
So, according to the AP, Fetisov will become the oldest Russian professional hockeyist.
In NHL, he played a season over the Hartford legendary attacker Gordie Howe and put 15 goals and 26 associates.
The oldest of the famous five of Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockeyists in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold, seven titles of the world master, triumphed in Canada Cupu and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also gathered success in NHL, where he twice raised Stanley Cup over his head.
Since 2001, he is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai pleased the councils.
The management of the Hyundai car has agreed with the commissions to cancel all overtime.
Just because of the frequent overtime orders, the commissions announced a strike on Monday.
The speaker of the Hyundai Peter Vanec confirmed it.
However, the leadership wishes to agree with the experts on another Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign on our production plan, this is essential, so it was designed voluntary overtime on Saturday 19 December with two shifts, said Vanec.
The server Sidmička.cz wrote that the company of employees who work on the Saturday shift offered a bonus 400 Kč.
They'll get it back in work Saturday 28 November.
According to Vaňka, the company has decided to change the way employees motivate for an overtime designed.
Either they allow to pay for overtime, or they can choose a replacement vacation on December 28th, and we fall on the day to extend Christmas holidays, said Vanek.
Furthermore, all Saturday shift employees will get paid ride and lunch.
Since overtimes were the most urgent and most vulnerable point in terms of comments and complaints by experts, and protesting staff who had stopped production, the leadership decided with the immediate validity of the cancellation of all overtimes for the month of December, Vañek stated last week.
Car employees have been forced practically every day after eight hours of shift to work overtime for two hours in the past week.
After the signing of the agreement, the committees shall revoke the strike emergency.
The next proceedings between car management and experts are to be carried out on Friday morning.
The chief of the Cook's commissions said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign the joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation in the car was sharp last week on Wednesday, where about 400 employees spontaneously strike overtime.
They also protested against bad salary conditions and alleged scumbags.
The leadership opposed that overtime employees have to do to meet the requirements for car delivery.
The experts in their Monday statement also demanded that no sanctions are affected by employees who interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, the company commissions require that it minimize the overtime work.
Furthermore, they want to pay 5000 crowns for her this year.
The Hyundai car is now employing 2,000 people.
The serial production company broke up in November last year.
By September, she produced about 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200 000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also takes advantage of HIV's virus
The Czech and German scientists test new compounds that can slow down the spread of HIV virus in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also takes advantage of viruses that have already obtained against immunity medicinal products.
This fact in some cases overlooks that the compound on the normal version of the virus does not act as strongly as any already available medicines.
AIDS disease can't be healed yet.
However, a mixture of medicines that prevent HIV reproduction in the body may significantly prolong the lives of patients.
However, a number of side effects are performed.
Furthermore, the incomplete pulse of the virus is due to the development of so-called resistant viruses against which the medicines are already ineffective.
The work of experts from three institutions of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, of the WCHT Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have demonstrated that the substances called metal carborates are affected by protein responsible for the multiplication of HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are compounds of pine, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all the medicines used today, so they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come with new “developed” compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their connection to the virus protein.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multidimensional cells created by pine, hydrogen and carbon are connected with metal atoms, in this case with cobalt.
Traitor and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein of HIV virus which is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV infection, the mature infectious viral particles would not occur.
When we stop the HIV protease, we also stop spreading the virus in the patient's body, scientists explain in the press report issued by the Institute of Organic Chemical and Biochemy of Sciences.
In the work published in the Scientific Journal of Medicinal Chemistics, scientists describe the series of compounds in which two pairs of cells (see table) are connected to a short organic chain that is further systematically modified.
Something weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in the research and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metal carborans on the normal encim variant is not as strong as in clinically used medicines, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants which are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of the effect, as well as their other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical adjustments so from metalocarborans, constitutes interesting compounds for further research towards the design of effective medicines against HIV, says Paulina Rézačová, head of the Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemical and Biochemy and the Institute of Molecular Genetic Sciences.
A fight about the budget.
The Chief of ODS Mirek Topolanek has marked the approved budget for the next year for "scary" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider further existence.
The statement of OS has been marked by the President of the Government as strong statements.
He says he's keeping time for analyzing.
Vice-President Peter Neweather said that the concept of the Officer's office with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party is obviously no longer working.
The President of the Government must, according to the Untime, decide whether it is going to rely on a minority in the Parliament to combat a growing deficit, or whether he is interested in resistance with a parliamentary left.
Access to OSS and social democracy to public deficits is diameterally different, noted No time.
The Charter adopted the budget for 2010, however, with the left-hand amendment proposals for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Convention has increased the money to pay public employees, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's elevation addressed the proposals for social democracy was hidingly to increase the budget deficit.
The CR should deal with a decree of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, so satisfied the Government's wish that even the modified budget is a less bad option than the budgetary provision.
Disappointment and ruthlessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of disappointment and sense of vain, said Prime Minister Jan Fischer that the government would still assess the current situation.
Untime is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to leave the function in the event of the adoption of amendment proposals, the situation could look different.
According to the Czech TV, Janota ordered himself on Monday after the government to the Prime Minister.
He indicated that he considers further responsibilities in the function.
The reason for his disappointment is for the negotiation of the budget.
If Fischer is pronounced for further combating the deficit of the budget, they do not have time in the government to do the nominants of the ČSSD, which has made changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will demiss if the House approves other laws of deficits that increase, such as those relating to sickness, retirement, or the novel of the official law.
Topolanec: Ministers Nominated OS did not blame themselves
It's the matter of Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The Ministers Nominated ODS did nothing wrong, stressed the Topolanec in the US text report.
He recalled that in several ministries there are people reporting to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
It emphasized that if Fischer decides to resign on the principle of combating the highest interest in public finances, "It is absolutely logical and correct that he relies on the left majority that is currently in the Parliament."
They say he can't count on support and tolerance of civil democrats.
I didn't think about it, and when it's real, I'm going to dedicate it, told the journalists in the parliament of defence minister Martin Bartak, who was just nominated by civil democrats in the government.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to the European Council to Brussels this afternoon.
At the request of the Prime Minister, the OS resigned
At the same time, he emphasized that the ODS would apparently vote against the modified budget in Wednesday, unless the Prime Minister of Civil Democrats explicitly requested the adoption of the budget.
We don't seem like orphans, we are not small children, then responding to the question whether the ODS in the political negotiation of the budget was not anxious for the absence of the President of the Party in Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice my voice would be missing.
Since I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the next months, it would be mainly about the improvement of the parliament and the destruction of all positive things, the Topolanac himself responded.
According to the new order, the CD will drive less trains for almost the same ride.
The Czech trails will cancel or limit some less burdened speeds and locations from 13 December, while other connections will strengthen the contrary.

This year's account for regional railway: 200 million more
Speeds order and pay the Ministry of Transport, totally for the salary of so-called proof losses, will give the roads the next year four billion crowns, as well as this year. The locations order the regions, totally paying eight billion crowns for them next year, with less than three billion countries contribute to the state.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The trails of a new ten-year contract have been made to the locals and rapids, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The roads commend the system, and it appears that they did not contribute to increased prices of a crushing majority of tickets.
Changes only occur in one-day network tickets CHD Net and cheap eLiska web tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of CD Net will be increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of elishka will be newly derived from the distant distance, so far for the journey between any district cities was united and made 160 crowns.
Philippines are still detaining over 50 people, children released
Today, weapons took 75 people in the southern Philippines, including several students of the basic school and their teachers.
It was stated by the AFP, which originally informed only of 65 kidnapped.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping happened in the Agusan del Sur province.
Approximately 19 armed men said he used hostages as a live shield to escape from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the issue of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP Agency, weapons belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is a armed component of the Communist Party of Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP Agency, the police originally persecuted the kidnapper because of violence that demanded the settlement of accounts between the two local family clans.
In the southern Philippines in the Maguindanano province, 57 people were killed in the recent massacre.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre related to the elections to the Governor's Office were 30 journalists.
For suspicion of the involvement of the massacre, the governor of this southphilippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influenced house of Ampatuans was arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But on Tuesday, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government.
JAR story concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next days, the new Hollywood film Clinta Eastwooda Invictus (the official name in Czech is Invictus: Unposed), which is a part of the life story of the former President of the South African Republic of Nelson Mandela.
The role of a world-famous warrior against the apartheid has been made by Morgan Freeman, whom he said he chose Mandel for his creation years ago.
The man's role of a legendary South African champion in the rugby of Francoise Pienaara was made up with Matt Damon.
With a picture in the movies, they rise from the voices of criticism and public
Nelson Mandela
The entire name of Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in the South African Muvez.
In 1988 he received Saharov's price for freedom of thinking, then in 1993 with de Clerk Nobel's price of peace.
The President of the South Africa was in 1994-1999.
a great expectation, as it comes to the public at the time in the South African Republic, where the top preparations for the world championship in the football, while the media are shaking anxious reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination by the Montenegro ruling majority.
According to the rapporteur AP, the voices for a new film in JAR are still positive, despite the numerous remarks against the main roles of "proflected" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is, however, according to his words for a new movie proud.
I've dreamt about that role for years, and I've been preparing for it well.
I've also met with Nelson Mandela personally many times to -- as it is said -- incorporate his energy, in an interview after a celebrated film premier in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remind Mandel's personality and the message by film.
It's the story of the South Africa, but it's about every man, he added.
Rugby National Team Dress
The photo based on the book proposal of the British writer John Carlin with a freely translated name In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and a game that has created the nation portraits a South African human rights entrepreneur during his first presidential election period.
Thus, during the film, Morgan Freeman is trying to bloom two racial and long years after one another, and as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, he is also in the acting role in the South African national rugby coat on the world's cup playground that JAR won.
During the entry into a grass suit, which is understood almost as something holy in JAR, Mandela scratched fourteen years ago large sheep mainly of the white audience and gained the recognition of the white population.
The football championship may be able to reconnect people to one nation, stated the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in 1995 in the national team.
Whether the tense situation in JAR improves, it will only appear.
The White South Africa, however, are skeptical, as the latest interview in LN gave up a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
In Lounland, tens of millions of crowns are burning.
The fire was caught by the transformer of Cheps in the divorce in the village of Highs in Lounland in the morning.
In the fire, he interferes with six troops according to the speaker of the restraining troops, Lukas Marvan.
The firemen originally wanted to burn the transformer, but later they reevaluated the opinion and fires mixed water, pens and special disposal substances.
The cause was the technical disorder, the internal shortcut of the transformator.
No one was injured, the crash according to the speaker of Pauly Mandat's company does not threaten a safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated to dozens of millions of crowns, exactly counting it will succeed until the fire is over.
The destroyed transformer will, according to Mandath, be replaced by new.
In ten years, the work of Cheps did not happen, the disadvantages of this type are unique, complemented.
The electricity supplies were not interrupted, household functioning, offices or companies, by the speaker of the Czech Republic for the northern Czech Republic, the fire of the traphostation has not affected.
A.s. Cheps operates in the Czech territory as an exclusive transmission system operator, electrical management of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 divorced with 67 transformers transmitting electricity from the transmission to the distribution system and lead routes of 4339 miles.
The Janchura shall submit a criminal notification for the three heitmans of the ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jančura will present today a criminal notification for the negotiation of three social-democratic heitmans.
And it's on Michal Haška from the South Sealand, Radko Martynka from the Pardubian district and the Hajtman of the Olomouck region Martin Tessarik.
Janchura said it in the 20 minutes of the Radiojournal.
The complaint relates to the efforts of the company to operate regional train transport in certain regions.
However, all regions finally signed long-term contracts with the Czech roads.
All three Heitmans attack us and talk about choosing plants, and we offered only what they wanted.
He claims that we are more expensive than the Czech roads, which is not true, because we know the prices of the Czech roads that were closed last week.
So we don't have to defend ourselves.
It's to talk to the Student Agency, he said to the Radiojournal Janchura.
At the same time, he stated that he had evidence from all regions that they did not take their steps in accordance with European law.
It therefore prepares an incentive for the European Commission.
The Hash of Criminal Notification considers the further continuation of Mr. Janchura's media show, which serves him as an unpaid advertising to his company and his own persons.
I am, of course, ready to protect my good name and my district, and I will call for the same thing for the other haytmans.
I assume that, even in this occasion, it is clear that it is Mr. Janchura, who manipulates the public and uses false and false arguments, Haszek said.
The Janchura announced that he has invested several million crowns in the advertisement that will warn the inappropriate step of the regions.
He said to the Radio Journal that the Christmas campaign would interrupt and continue in it after the New Year.
He stated that the campaign would be conducted against corruption as such.
The Campaign launched Jančura after the regions agreed to operate regional railway links with Czech roads and for a procurement of about 150 billion crowns did not sign the tenders.
According to Janchura, similar actions are illegal and in contrast with the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train transport in the regions, Janchuru, he believed, also threatened the messenger for the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we don't let it go, we can lose the bus licenses.
He was represented as a member of the CHSSD, I know who the master is, I don't say his name, said to the Radiojournal Janchura today.
Vaccination against tyres will be free and unnecessary
The vaccine against tyres from January will break the experienced habits.
It should be first for the families free and at the same time unnecessary.
But the voices are already called to make vaccination more effective.
Preparations for the establishment of free vaccine against tyres of the top.
The Medicinal Institution already lays down the maximum prices of vaccines which pay health insurance.
Experts are also clear in the vaccination process.
New vaccine
Free vaccines for August children
Since January, children who were born last August 2 and later can be expected freely against tyres.
The condition is that they haven't received any vaccination dose yet.
Whoever starts to vaccine last year or earlier, he has to regain another vaccination.
The first vaccine dose must be given between 3 and 5 months of child age.
Last year, a quarter of the families were voluntarily allowed to vaccine their children against tyres.
Parents paid 1600 crowns for one dose and more.
Four doses are needed in the vaccination of the youngest children.
Total experts estimate that health insurance provides 300 to 450 thousand crowns per year for vaccine.
However, it saves the treatment that children need without vaccination.
For now, the State gave about 500 thousand a year for all the general vaccination of children.
The vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumokok causes middle ear inflammation, but also serious infection, including brain blade inflammation and blood poisoning.
He's going to die for the pneumococ infection in our hospitals up to 28 children up to 10 years of age.
In addition to Czech Republic, they introduced the compensated general vaccination of children against tyres of approximately 40 countries.
Will vaccination be obligatory?
At the same time, there are views that this vaccine may be obligatory in the future.
From January, it should be paid by insurance and innocent.
For example, the head of the Civil Association Naglas Rudolf Kalovski indicated that vaccination would be better.
His association of pneumococ vaccine has been promoting for a long time.
The experts at the international conference that our association attended were not fully satisfied with the voluntary vaccination.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we're glad to have been able to settle at least this.
I think that's the way we've got to go now, Calovski said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against tyres.
At this point we don't even think about it, said his speaker Vlastimil Srzeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, says doctors
The Chairman of the Expert Society of Practice Children's Doctors, Hannah Cabrnoch, admits that she has voluntary vaccination of her disadvantages.
If all the children were expected, it could be considered to reduce the number of reversions "For the situation where this vaccine stands so high, we relatively understand the political decision that the vaccine was launched as voluntary," Cabrnoch said.
Experts expect that their babysitters will vaccine against tyres since the next year, more than 80 percent of the fresh parents.
The vaccine against pneumococs is also broken in the fact that as the first general vaccination of children, it is preserved by health insurance, not standing.
Insurances should spend money on prevention, save for another treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
The doctors will have to buy the substances themselves
However, it is related to the concerns of practical child’s doctors relating to the shopping of vaccines.
According to the original intention, vaccines should be purchased by insurance vaccines and the doctors would receive them similarly as the State delivers substances to other vaccines.
However, some Members feared that insurance would "may take money from health insurance".
Therefore, the doctors will have to buy the substances and wait for the insurance to pay them.
According to estimates, individual practical child doctors will invest in the vaccines 40,000 per month, which is a significant sum.
It's not gonna be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
The American Artist's son stole in the museum
The son of the renowned American creator of fantastic Frank Frazetta was accused of attempting to rob images worth $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
The Pennsylvania Police stated that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught in loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
The named Mr. Frazetta and the other man used to break into the museum in the Poconco Mountains Bagr region.
Mr. Frazetta, aged 81, was celebrated by creating the forms of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time it happened, the artist was located in Florida, as the press agency Associated Press stated.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Mr. Frazetta, younger, could have been motivated by long-term family disputes.
Before the police, Mr. Frazett issued a younger oath statement, age 52, that he did so to his father's instructions, "to get into the museum any way possible and move the images into the sugar space," said the agency.
Mr. Frazetta, the senior, denied the granting of any permission, as the agency said.
Labourists prevent planned tax growth
The ministries defended the increase in tax and shortening of expenditure notified in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism by the opposition, businesses and committees.
As Alistair Darling stated, the Torys "protracted" the possibility to show that they are seriously deferring deficit deficit deficit to the time after the elections.
Even the Chancellor got under fire because of low and medium-income workers.
According to his proposal, the increase of 0.5 % in social insurance and 1 % adjustment of public payments since 2011 is mainly an increase in 0.5 %.
Insurance on social insurance
The boards protested that low-income workers were punished for a recession that they did not blame and warn before "probling".
Social insurance is increasing - growth is approximately 3 billion pounds a year - which has embarrassed the company of businessmen who indicated that it is a employment tax while it should be focused on the renewal of the economy.
This increase, limiting these revenues over 20000 pounds a year, affects approximately 10 million employees.
CERTIFIC BODES PBR
Social insurance shall be increased by 0.5 % since April 2011
The economic situation will worsen more than expected, by 4.75% this year
New taxation of 50 % of bankers' bonuss
Increased 1% tax companies for receipts in small companies
Tax reduction for electrical vehicles and wind power plants
Increased retirement measuring by 2,5 %
According to the estimates, some revenues of 30000 pounds will be reduced by 90 pounds per year and some revenues of 40000 pounds will decrease by 190 pounds, while some revenues of 10,000 pounds will increase by 110 pounds.
The Ministers announced that their target to reduce deficit by half to 2013 means "complicated decision," but insisted that 60% of the specific taxes should be 5 % of persons with highest income.
The Minister of Finance, Stephen Timms, denied that the proposed increase in taxes and expenditure limits would be "the scope in the ocean" in comparison with what would be necessary.
"There are large numbers, which allows us to reduce deficit by half, which is absolutely the basic requirement for the next four years," said BBC.
Mr. Timms said he is convinced that economic growth should occur at the breakdown of the year.
But the development of prognosis for future economic growth -- which will have an impact on the volume of the necessary loans and on how quickly the deficit will be reduced -- must be in question after the Chancellor was forced to revise the previous amounts.
In the opinion he stated that the economy decreased by 4,75% in this year -- far worse than the fall of 3.5%, predicted in April -- because the loans were 3 billion pounds higher than previously estimated.
Wasted opportunity'
Conservatives who started a new promotion campaign on Thursday, warning against the "crease of debt" of labourists, marked the planned loan of 789 billion pounds of pounds in the next six years as unacceptable.
The Ministers failed to present a credible plan as it could be compensated, added, "cinicically" deferred this decision until after the elections -- which must take place until June 2010.
"They didn't add anything important to be done," said the Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do this, but they wasted it."
"All important notifications will be made after the elections, if we win them "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labourists insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future sketches, unlike Tory's proposals that would want to reduce the deficit faster and more.
But Liberal Democrats argue that money gained by tax and cutting costs should be used to support expenditures in the next year, not to reduce deficit, and argue that the plans are "built on sand".
Political commentator BBC Nick Robinson reported the timeout of the communication - for example, the above-mentioned inflation will rise and there will be incapacity of paying dosages in April next - that this could lead to the accusation of the candidate in the election campaign if money would be gained difficultly back a year later.
However, labourists insist on providing special assistance if people need it very much and the situation will be revised on September 1, 2010.
Suspect budget'
While the ministers did not publish the expenses details after 2011, the economy said that it was clear that the reduction of public expenditure would only be the beginning of medium-term restrictions.
The recognised Institute for Budgetary Studies reported that the Chancellor's digits indicate substantial scratches in many areas, potentially include transport, high schooling and defence.
"It's really very painful yet," his director Robert Chote said.
"The highly important statements will come after the elections, if we win them," added Roger Bootle, economic advisor to the Deloitte Revior Accounts.
"It was a report on the suspicious preliminary budget, the markets implement it."
The FBI is conducting an investigation in 'American prisoners in Pakistan'
The FBI's conducting an investigation in a prison in Pakistan in five Americans suspected of the connection to extremists.
The men were imprisoned for attacking the house in Sargoda in the East Panjab province, as the US Ambassador in Pakistan announced by BBC.
The FBI reported that it was an investigation, whether it was the same men who were pronounced in the last month in their residence in the American state of Virginia.
The American Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stated that it was also about getting information on these men.
Three of them are reported to be the origin of Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors and others come from Jemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in what conditions they were detained and under what circumstances they were delayed there," said speaker Ian Kelly.
The FBI speaker Katherine Schweit reported that the agency was informed of the prison and was in contact with the missing students' families.
"We cooperate with the Pakistan authorities to determine their identity and nature of their starting here and whether it is really missing students," she said.
The Pakistan embassy in Washington stated that men were arrested in a house belonging to one of them's uncles.
It indicated that the house was always in the middle of the interest of the local police and that there was no charge against the arrested men yet.
The Foreign Minister Hillry Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, said the press agency Reuters, but said that the United States had to "cooperate much more with Afghanistan and Pakistan in covering the infrastructure of terrorism that is encompassing in recruitment and training of persons".
The disappearance of these five students from home in North Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Refusing amnesty for Iranian torture.
The situation in respect of human rights in Iran is as bad as in the past 20 years, as the report of Amnesty International Group Travel reports.
The report detailedly describes "torture patterns" in the regime before and after the controversial presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened by rape.
Iran denied the above criticism of this report on human rights compliance.
The officials have identified this criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people were imprisoned and dozens were killed after President Mahmud Ahmadinejad, which led to the greatest street demonstrations from the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens of them were detained, and the prosecutors sentenced the last five persons to death.
Written by the BBC in Teheran John Leyne, now located in London, stated that earlier in the protests, the highest leader of Ayatolah Ali Homeyni declared the irregularity of some torture methods and prohibited their implementation in the Karizak correction device.
But since then, almost no criticism of legal power has been tolerated, as said our writer.
Unfair confession.
Amnesty International quoted the report of the 26-year-old studyer of the Ibrahim Methari Technology, who stated that he was accused of "working with Facebook network" and protests against the results of elections.
"They're often beating me in the face," he said in his statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, my head... threatening me with execution and humiliating me."
After five days he signed false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the presidential candidate, Mehdi Charrubi, was detained after the elections and tortured to death in prison, and others were raped.
Iranian higher state officials denyed the charges of rape, but admitted torture.
Amnesty also indicated the case of a former prisoner who said he was held in the container with 75 others for more than eight weeks in prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesti acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the Justice had established committees for the investigation of eligible concerns and reaction of the government, but said that the mandate and powers of the authorities were incorrect and the findings of the parliamentary committees were being published.
The group indicated that at least 90 persons were detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstration.
In the city park, a ski beach was created.
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow was used to transform the memorial in Bristol into the seasonal race.
The gathering road for the race in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowbordists to compete for financial prices.
At the top of the seasonal road in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short skok bridge before 100 m long seaway.
John Hickman's fourth-year-old medical student said that it was a beautiful view from the top of the seatway, but that it was really crushing.
It was a beautiful view of the blinking lights of the city downstairs.
There were some of the best skiers and snowbordists from all over the country -- some of them are real talents," he added.
Prices were granted for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the seasonal road.
After the Thursday night race, snow was left to stretch.
Still they and we
Can he be a Muslim French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secular state.
At the time the Swiss voters called after the ban on the construction of minarets and generally the alarms of the alleged islamization of Europe, John Bowen, the American academic wrote and informed and wondered whether Muslims could integrate - and whether they were integrated - into one of the most open secular companies of the continent.
After reading this book, some readers became the admirers of the author's last work, "Why the French do not like the blankets on their head" (2006), this elegant and discussed study on issues that they have divided and employed the country for 15 years and whose effects are still affected today.
The last book of Mr. Bowen has a wider and much more ambitious recording.
As a good anthropologist wants to know not only what politicians and the media reported about islam in France, but what really happened in the foundation.
He spent all months in the messes, schools and institutions that now care about 5 × 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He's a good listener, reproduces debates between teachers and students about questions that concern them most.
Should Muslim enter a marriage bond in a mosquito or in a city (or in both places)?
Should young Muslim be taught about gay development and rights?
Can Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does Muslim have the right to use an interesting banking system if he wants to get a mortgage?
These are the seemingly worldly dispute issues that are being discussed and which are part of daily life rather than political dramas that are employing the media.
The author identifies a new generation of possessions, teachers and intellectuals, among other generally known persons, not exclusive of Tariq Ramadan, Arab, Muslim Student and Academy, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open a debate about how you can at the same time be a good Muslim and a good citizens in modern secular society.
They don't have any arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are untrusted to the real idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophs and activists with whom Mr. Bowen interviewed are attached to the domain that it is the anti-poles of Selafi, the fans of Purity Sunni Islam, mergered in Saudi Arabia -- this group is small, but affects the European Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that the Muslim values and the French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromise on both sides.
He asks himself how far far the French politicians (and intellectual elite, which so utterly defends the laic public) are truly committed to pluralism.
The view is that the Muslims are likely less experienced in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to compromise historical compromise with the secular republicanism.
Rather than the development of pragmatism he found out "craping the value screws".
When you read this book, someone may be inclined to say "Yes, but not now."
The world’s most uncomfortable prospects
The arctic change faster than the other planet's environment.
The limiting ice covers an alarming speed, which affects animals and their survival as anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural water sources, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers during their waking.
Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, is a natural history of the North Icon, a polar bear.
A well-known complicated history and whale practices describes a long tradition of polar researchers who tried to empowered a white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson with a brave 14-year-old swimmer who only fought with the musket is a myth, but everything else is true.
The young bears who swimmed behind the bodies of their mothers just killed were caught and sent to the zoo and circus.
At the beginning of the 20th century, there were 75 polar bears in one circus state.
Even today the gardens in the zoo have a typical area million times smaller than the area available by adults in the wildlife. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.
After clicking here, you'll find more!
Mr. Ellis draws from the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat of the hunters to survive of species.
Although the hunt is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greece and Canada, where helicopters and Indians are hunted on the skies and they are all armed with the executive towels to shoot their capabilities.
It's ironic that it happens in the water north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the greatest.
In his new book "Allon Anderson", former editor of New Scientist, offers clear and unconvenient responsibility for science for the Arctic and a boundaries of a long view of how the future can change it.
Not all the scientists have answers.
Even meteorologists and oceanographics have no adequate response to the speed of change.
It's for lack of tests.
The research paths of Fridthjof Nansen at the end of 19th and the early 20th century showed the first time how there was a swimming ice.
The submarines for cold wars then maped the swimming spaces when they were swimming.
Satellite examination and widespread sondy fields in flying ice supplement are a useful supplement, but many are still doing thanks to unbounded individuals, camping in winter.
Mr. Anderson is looking at the extremely fragile world of the falling system inside the arctic ice created by accumulation of salt water that crushes in the freezing.
But from the height of that bear to microscopic miracles, it is all convicted to disappear when summer ice moves, which will happen sometimes between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... that can be us.
6000 marine members put the veins on the graves in Arlington
De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to put a simple vein on a soldier's grave that he never met.
For him and other marines who took a journey from Johnson's camp in Jacksonville to North Carolina to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate the graves, it was the day when they gave up to men and women who used to wear the same shoes.
In a few months, when we're loaded, we can be the ones, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me in order to show respect to me as I try to do.
He was one of the more than 6000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to put the veterans on the cemetery in several departments at the Arlington Pete Act.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of Worcester's funeral company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Peasant Act.
It is now 18 years old tradition when Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen take this trip annually and stop in different cities along the road to honor the memorial of the members of the army and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters are not looking for profits across America, which they believe in other countries.
In this year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 veneries on the Arlington cemetery, in Pentagon, on the graves at the National Fayetteville cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City and in the memorial place of flight number 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
In the second year, Walmar's fundation has been devoted to more than $150,000 for shopping and transporting branches.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she took a trip to Arlington to honor her husband, a dead member of armed forces.
Because her husband wasn't buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way to return what the victim was doing.
It's a small way the citizens can support our units, she said.
It's like a family grave visit.
The volunteers walked through the cemetery after the surrounding grass and hills.
Volunteers headed to the older graves from the first and second world war and from the war in Vietnam, because they are not visited as often as the new graves
The mood was positive when the children played and held their hands together when they transported the young pine to the stone stones.
Each circular vein was darkly green with a small red shelter wheat the upper part.
Nearby in section 60, where most veterans of war in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained silent.
The Joint Services Organizations devoted 1,000 branches to decoration the department, but the cloudful mood of wars just filled this area.
Some cried sincerely, others prayed and families and friends kept each other in a cold air.
Some read the names loudly, stamped into stones, while others were scratching to see small black white names pushed into wet mud where the grave stones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who washed their tears from their eyes in front of their son's grave.
She left eight hours from Zanesfield in Ohio to visit the sergeant's last rest of the sergeant's architecture of David Shane Spicer, who fell in the fight in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. ..my son paid for it, rules.
"Although I've been away for a long time, I want to be the one who will remember him."
US government supplier imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has captured an American government supplier importing mobile phones and laptops into the country, as officials of the Foreign Ministry introduced on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, has worked for the development company Alternates Inc. with the Bethesda seat.
The company is working on projects for the American Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the American Interest Section in Hawana, were looking for access to the detained one that was imprisoned on 5 December.
Some accusations have not been published, but under Cuban law the Cuban citizen or a foreigner may be imprisoned for almost anything that is called "dangerous".
All so-called contrarevolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical states, cause the risk of imprisonment.
Countergovernmental graffitis and speeches are considered to be serious crimes.
There is a young blog community in Cuba, led by the popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are monitored and bothered by government agents.
Mrs. Sanchez repeatedly requested permission to leave the country so she could take the prices, but her permission was rejected.
The detention of an American supplier may result in a growing tension between the Communist Caster Brother, the ruling in Cuba, and the Obama administration, which was monitored as "resistance" in improving relations with the island.
The first report was filed on the New York Times prison on Friday night.
The new US policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes specific steps, such as the release of political prisoners and create more space for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and searched commodities in the country where the average pay of the state employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has given the right to customs citizens to buy mobile phones just this year; these are used mostly before sending text messages, because the 15-minute phone call would cost more than one day's remuneration.
Use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government trailers, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to sign in must announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
Detention of Americans in Cuba is rare.
Most of the U.S. citizens in the cubic prison are behind grids for drug trafficking, Gloria Berben, the Press Officer of the Department for American Interests in Hawana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about prison.
The imprisonment and detention were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open company - let's give it free mobile phones - are criminal offences in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the American Human Rights Programme, who recently published an unlikely report on freedoms in Cuba called "New Castro, Cuba, the same," as an instant on the installation of Raula Castra as the leader of the country and the replacement for a sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco stated that the defendants were often arrested, convicted and imprisoned in one day.
He stated that all solutions would be rather political and that the Cuban government often causes negative reactions in the United States, just when these two countries are heading towards a broader dialogue.
Pakistani state administration workers cover the confession of men to Afghanistan.
The Pakistanian authorities revealed the alleged leader of a confession on sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill members of US units on Saturday, and said they hoped that this case could help to disclose a large network of terrorists' verbs that follow online and find radicalized young men.
The investigators indicated that they were looking for gray rebellion personalities known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after he first discovered them when one of these men published a comment that approves terrorist attacks has a website of YouTube.
Saifillah took the lead of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, he tried to help them get into the distant region of Pakistan in the pakistan tribes, which is a home of al-Qada and its camps to train terrorists.
But the Pakistanian rapporteur, who reported the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in convincing commanders of al-Qada and that men were not part of the CIA attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were put to the eastern neighborhood of Sarghoda, far from the threatening mountains in the northwest, which became a refuge of terrorists.
They were considered to be a strike unit.
The reason why they were expelled was stated by the official who spoke of preserving anonymity in view of the sensitivity of the case.
The official stated that men were not intimidated and were still trying to obtain consent for access to al-Qada camps when they were arrested by the implementation of Pakistan law.
The case of this five -- which remained in Pakistan and was interrogated by the FBI -- stresses the critical role of the banders in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, which is much more important, to determine who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US Intelligence Service has assigned the highest priority to attempts to place human resources into al-Qada.
Organists work as guards, exposing those who are not sufficiently serious in their commitment to the holy war and those who could be investigators.
The American false recruits were subjected to a special study in al-Qaeda, the analysts reported.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group, because their potential approach to American goals and their promotion value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the Foundation of NEFA with the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become more careful in the recent years that they will allow them to come to them because the US rapporteur agencies have obtained experts on their merchandise methods.
If we are trying to get into these groups, there is no better way than to follow their master model that has been monitored so much? Mr. Kohlmann said.
This model is one of those that are much more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Codan, demanded climate 'acces'
Thousands of protestors walked around the streets this Saturday and demanded more emphasis on climate from negotiators in Bella's City Congress Centre.
Protestants indicated a number of hundreds of thousands of participants in this event, but the police reinforce that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively calm and a bunch of masked activists placed several small positions near the group of government buildings in the center of the city.
On the day a small event occurred in the climate talks that the United Nations sponsored, thousands of activists passed through the city and carried transparency with the English texts "This is not a planet B" (i.e. second line) and one in Spanish, which said "The Earth says "how."
The protest attended several celebrites, including the Danish model and the photographer of Helena Christensen, who said that she traveled to her mother's parents in Peru and gave me information about the uncomfortable state of the country in which the impact of climate change is still involved.
That is a partial reason why we have decided to join this great march -- to walk through the world and appeal to the leadership of the world to submit a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not a easy task, but it's necessary to be performed, we can't keep avoiding it.
The police prevented the protesters from approaching Bella's center and said that she held 19 people first because they either had masks or had pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating viewers, who would not be identified because he was involved in climate rogues, activists masked as sportsmen and put several posts in black clothing close to the Copenhagen main channel, located near several ministries.
They agitated at the buildings, he said, they were starting with lightlights, but then there was a few big explosions.
Inside the Congress Centre, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not come into awareness of key officials, such as Su Weie, the main Chinese climate negotiator.
When asked whether the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (really it is something I don't realize).
Then he continued in Chinese and said, "Because the history is broad, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He monitored whether the march was painful or helpful, depending on the prospects of everyone.
The focus of the broad public and different sectors and the subject of climate change is seen, he said.
In other words, "I can also say that it is a violation of the negotiations or freedom of others.
Test data revealed persistent racial differences
The federal certificate from the last week on the achieved knowledge from mathematics was a welcome element of good news about the public school of the Columbia District.
Although the district is far behind the highly performance systems of the country, the certificate has shown greater progress in the fourth and eighth classes in the last two years than in the cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers of the National Athestical Centre for Progress in Teaching is the persistent differences in the achieved knowledge between African and white students, both local and national.
The average result of the fourth grades of the Columbia district was increased from 267 to 270 points (of possible 500), but only three points, from 209 to 212.
The difference in knowledge achieved has indeed increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
Progress in the Africans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a statistically unsignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average result in white students was not included in the test results because the sample size was not sufficiently large.
The image in the horizont of six years is not very encouraging.
The difference between white and black students of the fourth classes in 2003, when the first NAEP was carried out in the district, was 60 points of degree (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved in both groups were improved during this period, the difference was barely closed to 58.
Some advocates of education in the district last week expressed that the results, celebrated by Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were more stimulated in white students where the results were already high.
This would suggest that we have increased the amount of support for those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and anxious, said Jeff Smith, the executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-productive group that defends the equality of employing in the district.
I'm not jumping up and down because of the distance of two or three points, the member of the D.C. Kwame R. Brown Committee (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of basic school in Eaton.
Frequently criticizing Mrs. Rhee's management style, Mrs. Brown stated that the report on the results of the test means high school in the city is in desperate state and requires attention.
It's obvious that you always want to see the bets, and I respect it.
But what is terrifying is that we did not spend almost any time and energy that we needed to devote to our high school.
Ms. Rhee said the efforts of the district were to continue looking for better ways focused on the needs of students with low results.
In this case, for example, some teachers are trained to use new basics of reading, Wilson’s reading system, focused on students of high school classes and high school students who have failed to manage the basiss for reading earlier in their career.
Daily mathematics and basics of mathematics to the sixth grade, emphasizing the games and experiences of real life that arrived in the district as former director Clifford Janey, can be added to the verb of the progress of NAEP, which was given the report last week.
And I think that we should continue to work and do the best inflammation in those students who remain under the class level, Mrs. Rhee said.
Others indicated that the results of NAEP explained whether Ms. Rhee could continue to increase the overall performance of the system and continue to provide additional money and funds for low performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It is a certain equipped dilemma of Mrs. Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor at the University of California in Berkeley where she studies the results of urban tests.
The conventional correction procedure is to focus funds and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of the Columbia District.
Thus, focusing can bring political awareness that aims against the important agenda.
But the edge also belongs to other urban directors who are trying to maintain a medium between white and black.
We need to focus on building a high school system.
We need to use our schools' relatives so that all families, no matter where they live, can be trusted that their children will be given excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, director of the schools in Newark, said this week in an interview that the main element of reducing the difference between the achieved results is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district to achieve the power of schools.
You have to get up to 200 days to make changes, Mr. Janey, who concluded the contract with his association of teachers for the school year last 185 days, which is considered "sign" for finding a greater increase in the next year.
To make higher education part of the better future
The race bus drove to the Gettysburg College with a loud breathing.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, came out and for a moment rested on white columns, bricks and smaragd green grass.
Graciela’s parents barely graduated high school in El Salvador.
So far Graciela, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the railway ground.
Now she and other eighth grade students in the group were studying Gettysburg, where the school was $38690 annually, their position was rather than scaring visitors of the excited potential students.
That's it! called Graciel, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? ruled intense when they told them the low ratio of teachers to students.
The Pennsylvania rail was one of the seven who visited their classroom, and now they were completely obsessed with the future message: The question is not whether you will enter the railway.
The question is from where.
Of course, this is a nose problem with the high number of children born in the United States, Spanish immigrants, who are exclusive from high schools or pregnancy as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who get another education and thus enter the high school.
In fact, the fifth of this "great generation" of Spanish students from the sequence - the remarkable achieved results suggest that many of their immigrant parents, most Mexicans and the inhabitants of Central America, have arrived in the United States without finishing high school.
Their story of success is important, according to researchers, because it underlines their way forward for a generation that played a border role in the fields of the country's workforce.
Those who have achieved high school education say that they had natural affection for school and inherent injustice and efforts to make success.
Many of them also had parents who set up high targets for their children and looked for ways to replace the ignorance of the American school.
But school programmes also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciela and millions of children who would like to graduate the row - especially if these efforts persist in time.
If we consider that children are from low income groups whose parents have no experience and ability to help them to be nourished in the system, any simple intervention at each point will not solve it, says Patricia Gandara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, where she studied students in the Latin American region.
We have to think about providing these children with an exciting network in the pre-school age in all ways to go through high school.
The federal programme that funded Graciela's railways is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (application), provides more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems to start the next preparatory programs that start for students with small income in high schools and continue until these students finish high schools.
Since 1999, this programme has served more than 10 million students, of whom more than% have entered the college, according to the American Ministry of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industries has reached agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the fears of violence and political unstableness, the Iraqi government has managed to reconstruct a significant oil company during two auctions held on Saturday.
Ten agreements have concluded the Iraqi Oil Industry Ministry with foreign oil companies, which suggests that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a significant role in renewing the Iraqi oil industry, covered by decades of war and sanctions.
The American companies left with capital participation just two of the 10 exhausted fields.
Seven American companies paid for the second auction that started on Friday.
Only one offered a lost offer.
Two American companies reached agreements on the field that was drunk in June.
The participation of American oil giants in open Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and instead of American companies you have here first on the road of Asians and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor Iraq Oil Forum, online reporting.
It'll be a long time before something else is sold in Iraq.
The security concerns emphasized by massively coordinated bomb attacks on Tuesday and political instability, as the downloading of the US army are likely to disturb US companies from much more intensive business in Iraq, which has a proof of the third largest raw material reserves, the analysts say.
In some cases, American companies were in disadvantage, in particular Chinese and other governments controlled by energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more inclined to risk because they do not respond to shareholders.
The Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that concluded agreements with the Ministry.
The front companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintained close contacts with the Iraqi oil ministry and offered technical assistance in the past years, left empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts allocated at the end of this week.
China's National Petroleum Corp. participated in offers for more contracts than all other companies and left with large shares in contracts on two main fields.
We all know that China is trying to become the main economy, as well as technology force, said the speaker of the Ministry of Oil Industries Assam Jihad.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be comparable to competition and deserve its obligations towards Iraq.
Companies that were previously elected to submit offers, which were then compared by the Ministry according to the price of barel and the Ministry are willing to pay for strengthening the output over the current levels in each field.
Al-Qaeda's spinning planner was probably killed in Pakistan.
During the impact of the US missile on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, it was apparently killed by the top al-Qada planner of operations, as the officials of the American Anti-terrorism Division announced on Friday.
As confirmed, it could be a second death attack on one of the highest terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several rockets arrived on their cars on Thursday near Miran Sah in the northern Vaziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistan officials in the area.
Local authorities informed that the missiles were fired from a plane without a type crew operating by the ClA in the area of illegal domestic tribes.
These were reported on a white car that was headed towards the Afghan border when it was hit, the official stated with the Pakistanian Cicillary Intelligence Agency that called from Miran Shah.
The official stated that local weapons have moved to the point and quickly entertained what remained from "totally destroyed bodies".
The local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two American counter-terrorism officials quoted an unspecified witness who stated that Somali was death poison.
Somali was introduced as a highly constructed planner of military operations al-Qaeda, who managed the operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in the world's creation, said a higher official who does not want to be appointed, who has indicated the sensitive nature of American air strikes in Pakistan.
If he was in such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from Al-Qada's highest leadership and planned possible terrorist attacks on the basis of them.
Another US official said that Somali was rapidly in the al-Qada hierarchy and was well connected to other extreme groups in the region.
He must not have been a generally known person for some Americans, but that he did not in any way humiliate himself to position in front of us and our allies, said another official.
When his death was confirmed, Somali should be the second highly built leader of al-Qada or Taliban who should be killed since September, when the attack was killed by the Namudin Jalolov, the leader of the military fraction in the area of the tribes and the three other top operative leaders.
The rate of attacks launched by the ClA through pilots has been reduced since the summer of the averages of about six operations per month, according to Long War Day, websites managed by an unprofit group.
The reduction may have a reason for improving terrorist tactics, which have made steps to limit their vulnerability by also killing unmilosrdly people suspected of being informants, the site stated.
The United Nations U.S. Deputy departed in Kabul.
The United Nations U.S. delegation in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would want to resign from his position in March and end such a violent functioning period which was was wasted by the charges of large corruption in the election of the President in Afghanistan, supported by the United Nations.
Eide's departure is happening because Obam's administration has decided to send another 30,000 American soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations delegation stated that it supported growth, but expressed concern that the U.S.'s timetable for reducing the state, which starts in 18 months, should be a challenge for the Governments of other NATO to withdraw their powers.
We need to accelerate the construction of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans to trust in the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment accepted must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pushed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian employees assisting in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
Increasing on the side of armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but that he was just fulfilling the promise that he gave his family in March 2008 that he would spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now said that he would need time to find the refund.
As I said, it's the highest time to look at the follower, said Eid.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, the UN Ban has launched a search for a refund.
The officials stated that it was decided between Staffan di Mistura, who had Swedish-Italian origin and had before the United Nations mission in Bagdad, and Jean-Maria Guehenn, France, who had previously led the United Nations peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won in the country's presidential elections for masking the presence of massive elections.
Eide denied this claim, but he stated that the charge of Galgraith -- which was released -- "surely damaged the mission, because there was a high degree of skeptics in view of international intervention" in the election.
Eide stated that he proposed a meeting with the highest representative of citizens to coordinate the relief of efforts to lead the US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow its successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries that would borrow them for the Afghan mission, so he said he would want to strengthen their confidence that their money was used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment over the limitation of his efforts in Afghanistan and stated that the UN heavy employment regulations undermine its ability to use its ability.
The rules of the United Nations are that I had only one chance from May, he said.
It's a disaster, and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Robert M. Gates, Minister of Defence, said on Friday that the world powers will soon embark on Iran because of the lack of engagement in the interviews on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq during a weekly journey on the areas of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, batalised the prospects of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to the question of the soldier on the likely development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I have learned something from Iraq in the past six years, [this] is an unpredictable inforeseenness in the war.
Obama's administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could affect the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of these sanctions could also be affected by the ordinary Iranians.
He said that "a package of encouragement and restraint" would require "to force the Iranian government to really feel less safe with nuclear weapons", because "her inhabitants will suffer extremely" by sanctions.
According to the Friday opinion issued by the speaker of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration has included the European leader in the warning that Iran will bear serious consequences if it does not fully comply with the UN Nuclear Safety Committee and its supervisory Authority, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that he wants to develop his expertise only for peaceful purposes.
During the Geneva interviews on 1 October, he pointed out that he wanted to return to the discussions on the restriction of his nuclear programme and agreed to provide a significant part of his enriched uranium stock in exchange for urgently necessary fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The administration has been planted for such an agreement as a way to establish confidence between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to be derogating from temporary agreements -- partly that is why, the expert states, because Irish leadership is divided in view of whether to engage in the United States.
Honestly, if it concerns the Iranian stubbornness against the international community in the case of some of the proposals he actually agreed at the beginning of October, I think that it has led the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese together to the road, which is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set the final term for Iran on December 31st to answer the proposals before he returns to search for other elections, including monitoring, which Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions".
In the opinion issued in New York, the Iranian mission in the United Nations condemned on Thursday what it called "unrecognised and unreasonable charges" before some members of the Security Committee on Iranian nuclear activities and stated that he would continue interviews with the United States and the five other world powers "to achieve a proper long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Minister Nouri al-Maliki before he flew to Kurdistan, rich on oil to meet soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish representatives in Irbil.
It remains highly tense between Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, in particular because of borders, property rights and income division.
Gtes insisted on both parties to reduce conflict potentials to prevent US plans to limit the number of US soldiers from 115000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to embarrass the Kurdish concerns of persistent depression. The U.S. official places quoted Gates when he told Massoud Barzaanini, President of the Kurdish Regional Government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in the United Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In aging China, a change in course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew surrounded by propagandistic posters, on which they read that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to take more children" and "One child also means one more grave."
Then they learned that when official government places in Shanghai, alarmed by low birth and aged population in their city, suddenly changed the course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We've always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We've left nothing for others, Wang, 31 years old, the managing of human resources that has an 8-month son.
For more than 30 years, Chinese policy has been introduced to have only one child, creating two generations only noorically boubelled and screwed children, as well as the named "little emperors", threatens the country's population crisis.
The average birth rate dropped to 1.8 children per couple compared to six before the voyage has arrived, according to the UN data.
The distribution of the population where the number of populations aged 60 and higher are predicted to grow from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This is far above the total average of about 20 per cent.
Inequality is more rich coastal cities with high school education, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and higher were nearly 22 percent of the registered in Shanghai, while birth was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning, said that many couples must have children to "small the proportion of the ageing population and reduce the number of forces in the future".
He says it's about "being old, it doesn't mean to be rich -- like in developed countries, such as Japan or Sweden."
Consequent calming
As stated in 1978, Chinese policy of one child is probably the most controversial mandate established by the Governments of the Communist Party.
The two who violated politics were facing immense penalties -- up to three times their annual salary in certain areas -- and the discrimination at work.
The Chinese official places promoted a policy that helped the country to prevent criticism of natural resources, while the defenders of human rights were convicted in promoting policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to be subjected to abortions at the second child.
Furthermore, many couples had to have sexist selection abortions, leading to unnaturally high men's relationship with women.
In the past years, the population officials were gradually mild in their opinion on one child's policy.
In 2004, they generally authorized exemptions -- including the inhabitants of towns, the members of the national minorities and cases where a man and a woman were single -- and in 2007 they mitigated the dictions of their passwords that promote a hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research of the Peking University, said that central government officials had before debate on radical changes as allowing couples to have two children, if one of the partners was one single.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city that launched an aggressive campaign for incentives to more births.
Almost overnight they were posted, encouraging parents to have only one child replaced by copies of regulations detailing how to have the second child and how to ask for permission.
The City Administration sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and move them under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, introduced by family planning officials.
Smoothing response
Although officials in one village town in the area of Shanghai observed the increase of interest in couples that would like to have a second child after the start of the campaign, most urban districts did not report any changes.
The Huinan city district with 115000 population, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
The disappointed officials in Shanghai stated that, even though the campaign was born in the city in 2010, only about 165000 is still expected to be slightly higher than in 2009 but less than in 2008.
Feng Juying, the Chairman of the Family Planning Committee in the Shanghai County, pointed out that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people don't want to have more children.
They want to provide the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juungan, 26 years old, said she would like two children and was legally allowed.
But as many Chinese who only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without an integrated network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the west feel the politics of one child wrong as a controversial legal question, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant in the seventh month of pregnancy in connection with the first child.
Yes, we were deceived about the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It's about money.
Other couples indicate psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the governor of human resources, says that they wanted only one child, because she was also the only one: "We were the center of the attention of our families and we were all caring for us.
We were not used to provide care and we actually didn't want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who is a translator company, expressed it much more uncovered.
For two career parents from the high-class that reduced birth, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today, 20 and 30 years old adults view parents as the first days of the Czech experiment with capitalism and do not want to feed for themselves, he says.
Just one child puts enormous demands on parent's time, he says.
Mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still disputed questions of the space -- "You must reconstruct your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You must have resumes prepared at the time of the child's nine months for good pre-school education.
Most of his friends want to be happy with one child, says Che, but not with two.
We're the first generation with higher food standards, he says.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
The UN group has shadowed the emission reduction plan.
The UN sponsored Climate Conference -- characterized by far-discriminated positions and mutual plasma -- again focused on release of a document on ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas gas in the next 40 years with industrialized nations that are not most of the burden in the nearest term.
The text that can provide an exit for the final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation emphasizes the remaining obstacles, as lights the way forward.
But there was an important progress in the proceedings that took place in the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
The UN ad hoc working group, this text clearly indicates how much money the rich countries should provide for the poor to deal with global short-term and long-term warming.
And it provides a whole set of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage economies coming so that they can limit their carbon output, and what should be the upper limit of the growth of global temperature that politicians will still be able to tolerate.
This delivers a large dose of flexibility process, says John Coequyt, the top representative of the Washington Club of Sierra.
Michael Zammit Cutaiar, who proposed a six-page document, declined from 180 pages of the text of the negotiation to focus on what the top Climate Officer at the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, described as "great image".
It sets the risks for a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions to 25 to 45 per cent in comparison with 1990 levels, while the main developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 per cent during this period.
Together, the country would reduce emissions to 2050 between 50 and 95 per cent.
The European Union has discussed a rapid promise on Friday that it will provide $3.6 billion in the next three years to help the poor countries adopt adaptation to climate change -- from the cope of flood and drying until the forest prevention.
But on Friday, he still indicated the same kind of verbal fireworks that were overcome during the interviews last week.
The U.S. Special Ambassador for Climate Affairs, Todd Stern, rejected the speech, which requires the binding limitation of greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries in comparison with voluntaryness in major developing economies, if not financed by the developed world.
The movement signaled that Obama's administration has set a harder line against China begun by Bush's administrative officials just two years ago.
The United States does not enter into the contract without transfer of main developing countries and the implementation of action, said Stern, who also complained that the text is not sufficient to secure restrictions and should be verified by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei informed the U.S. main negotiator of climate issues that either the lack of "real sense" or "extreme responsibility" had led before a week to the communication that the United States would not financially help China to deal with global warming.
With the future of the economic path of the main world's powers in the bet, the tags broke both within the development world and between the industrial world and the economies developing.
The current struggle is a majority of preserving individual economies rather than preserving the planet, between China and the United States on the fulfilment of their respective obligations, while the poor nations notify that two dozens of the world's most influenced countries ignore the scientific imperative for the implementation of more significant actions.
Ricardo Ulate, the delegation of Kostarica, said that it is not surprising that the main powers are struggling for who should bear the costs of greenhouse gas constraints, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in searching for the way to prevent large emissioners responsible for their actions.
It is clear that the new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, which also serves as regional adviser in the field of regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature protection.
Some countries who are most vulnerable to climate change have indicated that they would want to continue promoting a legally binding agreement in Kodana, but most of the main participants, said that the best outcome of the interviews would be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, created a 24-page proposal of the agreement last Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, who led international climate negotiations for the benefit of the European Commission, said that the promotion of small island nations "related political pressure on the whole political process" partly because they are now united and demanding action from growing economies such as China and India.
The proceedings have caused a new urgency as soon as the delegates focused on the fact that they have to resolve most of the remaining issues before the heads of governments face the agreement.
High-level officials, such as the Indian Minister for Environment Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, have exited the aircraft and run the Halls of Bell's centre to close the doors of the meeting and the new conferences so that they could emphasize the rights that will be assessed next week.
The total scale of the meeting - when 13,000 people moved every day from and to the Congress Centre, the guitars playing activists incentived the ironising views of countries they thought they had been sent, and there were proposals from hand to hand on paper rather than electronic mail -- controlled by the challenge.
Intensity is only a construction: almost all key ministers were present in Kodana and earlier in Wednesday 60 Heads of the States.
We arrived in high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Deputy Minister for Global Policy for International Nature Protection.
They're coming tough weights.
The British first train with speed 140 miles per hour redefinied this Monday's feelings
At 5:13 p.m. on Monday morning, the whistle cut the darkness on the mark of the ride of a train, which meant a transport revolution in Britain.
The first high-speed personal train in the country reaches the speed of 140 miles per hour and flys from Ashford to Kent to London St Pancras and exceeds the distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and entered the first high-speed personal composition outside lLdin.
He hopes that the new service will connect Britain with the international network of rapid, reliable trains and connect the large aglomeration of Midland, north and Scotland with London.
The limited standing waters should reduce transport time in personal transport and on business roads and the transition from aircraft and cars on the rail could reduce car emissions and eliminate road traps.
Theoretically, three major political parties have been earned for this vision.
But dozens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national railway network, an imminent fight against projects and concerns about environmental disturbance have now contributed to the building of the British high-speed routes.
High Speed Two (HS2), the company created in January to provide a government's conductive study, transmitted its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, as the Times stated.
She gave him a detailed map of the next planned stadium of high speed network.
The new tracking of London's connection with Western Midland was designed up to five meters in urban areas and quarters where it could be problematic.
In the open land, it was planned up to 25 m of the final route.
HS2 also assumes to determine three options for a large high-speed network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will answer the spring.
The preferred option is the adjustment of the shape of letter Y, where one high-speed trail should lead to the Western Midland.
The trail should be divided near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the second, leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One trail should lead to Scotland.
"They seemed to have the most executive choice," said also a railway expert.
As soon as it's done, the ride time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage that will not be opened before 2025 could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in present.
The proposals should allow trains to ride at a speed of 2250 miles per hour, which would make the British network the fastest in Europe.
The starting track is already proposed to abduct trains within 400 m , which would be able to transport 1100 persons.
When 18 competitors could operate every hour on the trail of London - Birmingham.
This means that the London Terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if necessary.
In view of capital restrictions, the existing station would expand so that the high-speed network would be realized.
Training experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such a potential.
Lord Adonis will notify whether he considers or does not plan to implement this scheme, but the broad public consultations and planning procedures mean that the final decision does not come before general elections.
Even if it moves the wheels, the network should be built by parts.
The trains should first be put into operation not on high-speed routes, but already existing routes north of Birmingham and maintain travel time between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered to be a decisive contact point to ensure the transition from aircraft to trains, the orientation point for railway revolution.
The taxpayers paid the mortgage of 75,000 pounds on the Tory orangeries
Alan Duncan, holder of the front seats of the Toryes in the messenger's parliament, paid a thousand pounds of expenses last year for the orangeries he built in his house in the electoral area.
The speaker of the party behind the prison, which was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the messengers lived "from awards", increased his hypothesis to 75,000 pounds to build a dub of the enlargement in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, total of hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
General authorities approved the claims in time, so Sir Thomasen Legg was not interrogated by who was conducting the control of the Membership's expenses, and last night Mr. Duncan expressed his requirements "It was more clean or easier".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of the Parliament, owns two two floor houses on all in his electoral area Rutland and Melton.
The houses are worth approximately a million pounds.
There are kitchen, living room and dining room, but the financial office agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added a winter garden to the house, which is in the plans called "Orangeria".
The neighbours describe it as a "happy bowl for fun and holiday."
Mr Duncan has not been requested to provide any explanation for an increased loan during the last check by the General Standards and Privileges Committee in the last comparison of the hypothesis.
The Committee informed him last month that he violated the rules after reviewing his expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the pupilary security of the mortgage of 271406 pounds from his property in London to the house in his electoral area, which he bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the Parliamentary Assembly.
The documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately 1400 pounds per month in the interest of mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1800 pounds per month.
The interest of the RBS mortgage of Mr Duncana could not change at this time, which suggests that all of this was intended to finance a loan of 75,000 pounds.
The standard RBS variable mortgage payment dropped from 7.94 per cent to 4 per cent in March this year, where it remained.
The latest document of the general authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued the sentence of 1250 pounds per month in May this year.
Mr. Duncan left his job as a shadow leader of the House in September after a secret rapporteur filmed it and said that the messengers must survive "to award" after the scandal with expenses.
"In principle, it's nationalized, you have to live for appointment and treat you like you're dealing with."
He said, "I spent my money for my garden and my privilege and a little fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't do it."
The messenger, a millionaire of the former career as a oil trader, was first invited to explain his publications in May when it proved to be pronounced thousands of pounds for his garden, before the financial authority approved, that "this may be considered excessive".
One of the activists digged the jam in the form of a pound mark in the grass of Mr. Duncana to protest after he discovered that he claimed 4000 pounds for three years.
When he was asked last night about an increase in mortgage, Mr. Duncan said, "It was because of the capital increase, which was approved by both the financial office, and then Legg."
He added: "This is not a question of hiding and calling or violating rules or something else.
It's absolutely equal to a line down, according to the rules, justified, and that's all.
That would not be more clean or easier."
Everybody come closely to see the house on the brighton coast with an advent calendar.
The coastal houses in Brighton found a new meaning of life in winter months as an interactive adventure calendar.
Beyond, an alternate church group that induces the cultivation of creativeness, called on 24 owners to decorate their houses for every day in December, and to use Christmas wheels as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on December 1, when it allowed visitors to see the last chamber from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and the bishop's flour and the free wine.
The chosen Christmas included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noil, when the chat represented the work of Janetty Tozer, the local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, assistant at the Hove TV marketing, is a priest without scholarship in chichester diet and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion much more important for people in the post-Christian society.
"Why should we as a church expect people to come into a foreign old building? I feel the church should come to people and serve in a waking way.
"The idea of an advent calendar in the chambers just came up as an interview with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantasticly creative and pulsing place and we have tried to present it in a spiritual way."
Strong mobilization in Codan and in the world against climate change.
Thousands of thousands have come to the streets on Saturday with a demand for an important and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Kodana, demonstrated throughout the world and in Kodana, where the police arrested hundreds of people at that occasion.
At least 30,000 people according to police resources and 10,000 organizers showed in the cold weather in the Danish capital at the occasion of the United Nations Conference on Climate, aimed at adopting an agreement on Friday that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedgaard, the Danish President of the Climate Conference, stated that the growing global mobilization, whose clear proofs are present manifestations, contributed to the "political tax" of possible failure in Kodana, would be too high.
According to AFP reporter, the incidents in the Danish capital shortly after the start of the show, when a group of about 300 demonstrators dressed in black began to break the exhibits by the bones and slaids.
The order police immediately hit.
Overall, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and stated that it was particularly members of "Blacks Blocks", ultraradical separate groups that have already been shown in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, Eastern France.
Coalice Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of action, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without difference" and emphasized that about a hundred of them were in the bonds and in the seat "holded in the streets yet Saturday night" even through extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, a peaceful passage went towards Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
For speakers, there was a stage before which a spiritual meeting was held at candles in the part of the former South African Arcybishop of the Cape City Desmond Tut.
Most protesters arrived by bus and trains from large European cities, and other than Africans there was a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Almost 3,000 people dressed mostly in blue pants created the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning, at the challenge of the Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create the "blue waves" for "fair climate".
Today, we go to the streets to demand a compensation of the ecological debt for the southern, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine warrior from Jubilee South Coalition in Codan.
We can't keep saying, that's the time, the Benin singer Angelique Kidjo declared.
In Africa rivers and water flows dry, we can walk in them today, and that was never possible before.
For the first time in the history of the climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 by adopting the UN Convention, the struggle for another world approached environmental organizations.
The French European Ambassador José Bowa, one of the characters of the fighting for another world, said that he arrived in Copenhagen in order to "connect climate and social justice." "There is the difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The first manifestations began in the Asian-Tychomore area where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, some 50,000 people went to the streets according to organizers.
In Manile there were several hundred people, mostly students, in red clothes, and shoes of evolving solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, there were also hundreds of demonstrators in Canada who demanded a emphasis on climate change.
In France, hundreds of people attended the protests organized by the "350" movement, especially in Paris, Marseille (them), Lille (ever), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
Separatist Abchazia has chosen her president, Georgia condemns it as a "free"
Abchasia chose her president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognised this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi declares this step "frush".
About 131,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian and Georgian war in August 2008 on control over South Osetia, which is another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
Election rooms closed in 17 hours GMT.
According to the officials of the Abchaz Election Commission, a few hours before closing the election rooms 58% was attended.
The first preliminary results should be reported at night from Saturday on Sunday.
All five candidates, including the official President Sergei Bagapš, have categorically rejected the idea of merger with Georgia, which condemned these elections.
These choices are frash.
On the other hand, Georgian President Michail Saakashvili "regrets Abchazia has completely fallen into Russian superiority," his speaker Manana Manjgalaze said.
In addition to Russia, the independence of this territory with 216,000 inhabitants only Nikaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally engaged by Russian armies.
After the division from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict, in which several thousand people died, Abchazia is trying to show through elections that she is ready to return to international policy.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said AFP Kvarčia Svjetlanová, 54th-year-old historian who also admitted that she voted for President Bagapša.
She was one of those who came to the electoral room in the school in Suchumi capital, in a beautiful white building with several palms at the entrance.
The question of Russian superiority is the main theme of presidential elections in this region on the shore of the Black Sea, which can be proud of the beautiful nature.
All over this small country with 216,000 inhabitants are located in large billboards with Bagapsh next to Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who have arrived to supervise the long-term progress of elections have been hotly accepted by the district mayor Beslan Archby.
"We, Abchaz, we are grateful," said on a small ceremony, bearing in mind the support of Moscow, and in particular its decision to recognise Abchazia's independence.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Islandski, a member of the Russian parliament, and had a glass vodka for it.
The opposition, which was represented in the elections by the former Vice-President Raul Khazhimbo and two traders by Zause Ardzinbo and Beslan Boutbo, criticised the contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as a contract that allows the Russian control of the railway network of Abchasia for 10 years.
Fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba says he does not support the current government or opposition.
The majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win in elections.
If none of the candidates reaches this result, the decisive struggle must take place within two weeks.
Climate: world manifestation, events in Kodana
Thousands of thousands have come to the streets on Saturday with a demand for an important and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Kodana, demonstrated all over the world and in Kodana, where the police arrested about 700 people at that occasion.
At least 30 000 people according to police sources and 10,000 organizers showed the afternoon in the cold weather in the Danish capital, hosting by 18 December of the 193 delegations of the 193 countries, which could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving Parliament, a peaceful passage went towards Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
For speakers, there was a stage before which a spiritual meeting was held at candles in the part of the former South African Arcybishop of the Cape City Desmond Tut.
According to AFP reporter, there were incidents shortly after the departure of the passage, when a group of several hundred demonstrators dressed in black and armed bricks and benchmarks began to break exhibits.
The regular police immediately surrounded them and hit them without waiting, and several phenomenons hit the ground.
In general, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and stated that it was particularly members of "Blacks Blocks", ultraradical separate groups that have already been shown in April at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, Eastern France.
Late afternoon, one police officer was injured with a bone on his jaws and four cars were burned near the squat near the incidents that were due to a number of about 20 detention sources.
We focus on extremistic groups, warned the speaker's police Henrik Jacobsen, while the helicopters were aired again.
Most protesters who came by bus or train from large German cities from London, Amsterdam and Milan were European origin.
But there were many Asians, including several Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Almost 3,000 people dressed mostly in blue pants created the first meeting in Copenhagen for the challenge of the Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create the "blue waves" for "fair climate".
Today, we go to the streets to demand a compensation of the ecological debt for the southern, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine warrior from Jubilee South Coalition in Codan.
We can't keep saying, that's the time, the Benin singer Angelique Kidjo declared.
In Africa rivers and water flows dry, we can walk in them today, and that was never possible before.
For the first time in the history of the climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 by adopting the UN Convention, the struggle for another world approached environmental organizations.
The French European Ambassador José Bowa, one of the characters of the fighting for another world, said that he arrived in Copenhagen in order to "connect climate and social justice." "There is the difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Oxfam organization called on several famous personalities, such as the Danish model Helen Christensen, or former UN commissioner for refugees, Mary Robinson, to talk to the crowd.
The first manifestations began in the Asian-Tychomore area where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, some 50,000 people went to the streets according to organizers.
In Manile, several hundred people, mostly students in red clothing, showed the council of the capital city of Philippines, and with the sheets of evolving solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred demonstrators also met with a requirement for a emphasis on climate change.
In France, hundreds of people attended the protests organized by the "350" movement, especially in Paris, Marseille (them), Lille (ever), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history will be strengthened under the general high school reform, Chatel declared.
The Minister of Education, Luc Chatel, said on Sunday during an interview for the JDD magazine that the subjects of history and geographic will be "increased" in the context of the reform of the general high school, although their education will no longer be required in the last year of the gymnasia with focus on exact science.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week and for everyone the same program from the universal culture, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "this must be done with hypocrisy," because he believes S's specialization is not already focused on exact sciences" but "the best students are in it in fact."
The EC and L specialization cannot be for some sub-specializations, continues and stresses: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals that would hardened to learn no geographical or historical learning in the last year of high school."
The examination of the Agency ifop, which published the Humanite Journal on Saturday, showed that seven French from ten (69%) did not agree with the government project to discontinue the mandatory teachings of history and geographic in the graduation of S specialisation, and therefore many intellectual and teachers criticize this discharge, both the left and some right Members.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "does not come into consideration" to cancel philosophy in the specialization programme with the graduation year.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform in educational education, while 16 organisations (students and committees) called for participation in Tuesday Mobilization against this project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical education of future high school teachers.
In the context of the Master Study 2 (M2), the Minister explained, at the beginning of the year, a receiving test focused on their fields and at the end of the year.
Participants are trained during the second year of the master study, and in the first year they will be speaking to the students as a professor.
If you collect all the stats that will be offered before the receipt procedure, you will get more experience with students, almost 300 hours , he continued .
The Minister also announced that he would propose "personal right to education", which is not yet available in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to cancel the school map by 2012.
In the elite University École normal suppressions have 15 minutes to convince experts of climate.
Fifteen minutes for the presentation of the Copenhagen Summit objectives: this is the challenge he announced in the summit in the morning, Jean Jouzel, a multi-Chairman of the International Group of Climate Development Experts (GIEC) to incentive Ecole normal supierieure on the street Ulm.
As informed by one AFP journalist, the Nobel Price of Peace, Jean Jouzel, opened the first of the Ernest conference, which is some one-day seminar consisting of 15-minute contributions of experts to be filmed and opened to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people, and on the basis of which they would want to learn more, he explained at the occasion of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo conference, one of the organizers of this seminar, who got the name by the fish from the local lake that students named.
About 20 contribution experts from individual scientific disciplines will be selected and indicated that the choice is based on their charisma.
We can talk about climate warming "we can talk about hours, but we can also summarise the basic objectives in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke before 50 listeners without prior notes, just using graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with hope that the listeners will recognize that "the Codan Conference is based on very seriously prepared scientific bases".
Videos on these lectures will be placed on website schools since 15 December.
The next Ernest seminar is planned for February and the other will follow with regularity every two months.
Payment delays: anger oversighters in prisons, planned measures
The prison overseers' committees announced on Friday "Great Mobilization" because they demand that the Christmas Christmas fees be paid and overtimes whose refund has been postponed for January for financial reasons.
Prison FO (2. board of overseers) requested employees who would not have the service to attend the demonstration held on Tuesday morning before prison facilities and to "block" them and notify them of "thefting their wages".
CGT for prison overseers (3. boards of this sector) called on them to "convene meetings in individual prisoners and start a major mobilization" with the "shame and unacceptable" in December that "times and supplements for work at night, on Sundays and holidays" are not placed.
The first committees of overseers, the Federal Union of Prisoners (Ufap/Unsa), "urges total mobilization... to demonstrate dissatisfaction and anger".
The Directorate's Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtimes has increased significantly in 2009 and not all have been included in the financial budget, but are assured that the debt amounts will be retained in January.
The Office stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari sent the commissions of prison overseers to the communication in which it assures them that the payment will be carried out next month.
I know about the efforts that the prison staff is making to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system, the Minister in his message writes.
I ordered the Chief Prison Director to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation that has come to an inadequate overtime assessment has never been repeated in the future, the Minister Alliot-Mari added.
The December remuneration will therefore be low, except for managers who receive a famous premium for carrying out functions and targets, states Ufap/Unsa, and for those "will always be placed in the budget".
It's just a scandal, the interregional FO union in Marseille, and she announced her decision to boycott to the appeal of "all meetings and calls".
Workers will not come to work on Sunday or on holidays, unless they have paid payments for these days in October in December, as well as in overtime, FO Rhane-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the time they give us more work and more jobs without giving us more staff, it is sad to allow those lowest employees to pay for it, states CGT prison guards in Bordeaux.
According to the commissions, the situation in all regions is not the same, some are better than others.
However, in any case, financial funds because little, the Secretary-General Ufap, Jean-François Forget, established.
Obama claims that on Christmas he gives "better gifts" than the ones he gets.
The American President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, conferred on Oprah Winfrey's "the goddess" screen that with regard to gifts, has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than those that I receive."
The President and his wife Michelle spoke in a special edition of a show that will be transmitted on Sunday night at the ABC station about how to spend Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, a small four-foot family companion gets his piece.
Jesusic likes Boa, Michelle Obama said that the dog also "of course" gets a gift, as it comes from the passages of the preliminary show.
And Michelle Obama also repaid herself against her husband's claim on the subject of the quality of the gifts she gets, "Surely not, I gave you great gifts last year," she scattered the president.
Well, of course it's true, he was forced to agree to the president, but immediately after that, he showed his finger on the pearl necklace of the first lady, "And who gave you this?"
At this single very relaxed show, a famous moderator, who strongly supported Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, also talked to Obama's husbands about their most favorite gifts that they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a circle with ten degrees of transmission, but also a basketball basketball, which was dedicated to him on Christmas, his Kenyan father, with whom he only met very rarely.
I remember seeing my father who came to see us on Christmas and as he gave me that basketball ball, the president told me.
A long time later, I realized that he actually gave me that ball.
The first lady remembered the doll house again.
I didn't know how to organize all this in the house, so I balanced all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the chamber, but I loved that little doll house, remembering Michelle Obam.
Johnny Hallyday surged again, RTL states he's in an artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was reoperated in Los Angeles because of "injury" caused after the bigger operation he performed in France, but the situation is according to his nearest "controlled", while the RTL station stated that the singer is in an artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was reoperated from Wednesday to Thursday in Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors established the "injury coming from the operation" of the screwed plates he worked in Paris on 26 November, announced in Paris his press department, with the requirement of these leagues to "regular operation".
The press department, however, tried to calm the public down and stated that the situation was "subcontrolled" and also announced that new medical communications would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to the RTL station, which is the main partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial sleep to prevent "sickness and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we'll have a little more security, RTL delivers.
The press department, on the AFP question, did not confirm or confirm this information.
The RTL also states that, according to “some sources”, no drone was placed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated at the international clinic Parc Monceau because of a screwed plot.
The operation, which was scheduled for several days earlier, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delioux, a doctor well known in artwork circles.
However, the physician was not available on Thursday to speak to RTL information.
After this operation, a singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized in Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles for the infection that happened after the intervention.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallydaye, said on Thursday in the RTL radio that his friend is just passing through the bad period, but he added that he was not worried about rocker because it's a big fighter.
He called me just before he went to Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing stupid because spending 12 hours on the plane after that surgery was no fun, Eddy Mitchell said.
Wednesday night the site was calmed by a singer producer, Jean-Claude Camus, who said that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics", and that the infection was "stop".
Mr. Camus also said that he met Laetia, a wife of a singer, and that he did not notice any special concerns.
The health problems of the singer are only multiplying since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to surprise everyone, it was discovered that Johnny Hallyday was operated on a "little tumor of a thin infection" and then a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tournament "Tower 66", which is presented as his settlers.
But since then, every of his health problems has been very monitored and commented. The fans and journalists noticed that the singer has difficulties with the movement at the stage.
In the middle of November, his team had to dement the new hospitalization report again.
Euro-2009/ Small pool: Prime Minister Bousqueta in his favorite discipline
French Frédérick Bousquet, a three-fold medialist at the world's championship in 2009 in a large pool, received a title on Thursday at Europe 2009 in a small pool in Istanbul in the discipline, which he especially likes: 50m free way.
The first day of the championship that last allowed suits, only three world records fell, although they were expected much more.
One of them overcome the Hungarian Race Evelyn Verrasht at 200 m location race and two remaining men's headquarters of Russia to 4x50 m the location race.
The great grief for Bousquet, who has made the world record in a 50m free way that already holds in a large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, 50m free way, 28-year-old French won with the final time 20.53 seconds in the final, where the prime minister launched ten swimmers instead of ordinary eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatia Dji Draganja (20,70) and Russian Sergei Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to overcome the world record (20.30), as he assumed.
We can always dream of something better, but I said, if the world record is in my reach, I'll try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all the swimmers were wearing suits made from polyuretan that would be prohibited since 1 January.
Combineses helped from February 2008 to 238 world records and their era ends in Istanbul, who first hosted them in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the combine this time did not help the Germans Paul Biederman, a double world master in a large pool in Rome, who had a world record at the reach of hand.
The young swimmer failed to overcome the record held at 400 meters free (3:32.77), but yet he won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian race Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything in that race.
I knew I couldn't overcome the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and fulfill my task.
Lobintsev will be a serious competitor to the future, explained Biedermann.
USA: the Romanian sarkofage board belonging to Zola was educated for 1.5 million USD
The board of the Romanian sarkofage, which belonged to no other than the French writer Emil Zola, was educated for $5 million on Thursday, which is much more than it was estimated, said a trader with Sotheby's art.
The price of this two metres long and 63 cm high frontboard, originating from the third century of our year's number, was estimated by $150,000 to $250,000.
Mramor "representing four dioniss scenes in an architectural decore, surrounded satyra and bakchant is a rare part, similar pieces in the world are very few, perhaps four or five," said AFP on Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice-President of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby ́s.
The work was sold among hundreds of others.
The sales continues, but it is the subject of which the AFP speaker Sotheby ́s, Dan Abernethy, was told to the AFP speaker of Sotheby ́s.
The fact that Emile Zola took this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The board was nearly 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borgia family and then appeared gradually at the French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated the van with her in her private hotel in Paris and Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic in France, and the President of the Council, before the power of marshal Petain.
She stayed shaded there for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz found out when searching the Museum database in Louvr that this board was part of "Emila Zola's remains" opened since 1903, year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresky "Rougon-Macquart".
An interrupted attempt to leave President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico decided on Thursday that no conditions were met for the transport of the dumped President of Honduras, Manuel Zelayi, whom rebels refused to guarantee safe departure.
After the telephone interview that I had with President Zelaya last night, everything now indicates that there is no way to implement this transport, the Mexican Foreign Minister, Patricia Espinos.
The Mexican government plane, which arrived on Wednesday to Salvador for President Zelaya, reverted back, stated the source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The government of pumps wanted to force President Zelay to "demision" and to ask for political asylum in abroad, only so it would give him a safe departure.
But the president dismissed these requirements because he wanted to go to Mexico as a exile head of the state.
The government of puppets "has experienced another failure when she wanted me to give up my function... they wanted me to demiss," said Zelaya's radio Globo on Thursday, in which it often expresses political crisis that lasts for five months in this Mediterranean country.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, adds a dumped president, hidden on the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few ifrds.
The Ambassador of Mexico asked us to provide a safe transport guarantee, but unfortunately we can't accept it because it does not contain a asylum, said in Wednesday the Minister of Publishing Government Oscar Raul Matute to the Honduras Radio of HRN.
I will not ask for asylum any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur station in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, then I leave as the president of the Honduras people, he emphasized.
The news of Zelaya's departure was mobilized in the middle of the resort of the President who came to gather around the embassy of Brazil, where the army strengthened protection.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticised the position of the pussy government.
They show their marginal attitude to international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who approached the Socialist President of Hugo Chavez, was removed on 28 June on the day he organized in preparation for his re-elected public consultation against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
From exile in Costarica, he suddenly returned on 21 September and found refuge in the Brazilian Embassy.
If he gets out of here, he will be arrested and responsible for the crime of the "velezrade", which he's accused, the pussy government claims.
Purity President Roberto Micheletti was able to organize presidential elections to replace President Zelaya on November 29th.
In controversial elections recognised by the United States, but condemned by Latin America, such as Venezuela, Argentina, or Brazil, won Porfirio Lobo.
Three days later, the Congress voted against the return of President Zelaya to power until the end of his 27 January mandate.

Cuba : hundreds of employees of the regime squeezed "Ladies in white"
Several hundred members of the Cuban regime have screwed up women of political prisoners meeting in Hawana on the occasion of the World Human Rights Day and prevented further manifestations for which dozens of disidents were arrested.
About 40 "Ladies in white," wives or close political prisoners were screwed directly on the street to Raula Castra's regime at their walk towards the centre of the capital with a request for the release of political prisoners, the journalist informed.
Go away with Yankees!, "Works!", "The street belongs to the revolutioners!", "Let live Fidel and Raul!" scandaled the raised fists of the dissident regime.
Disidents were eventually escorted by civilians who arrived to "secure security".
The day before it happened in Hawana, there was a similar manifestation against "Ladies in white," but there was no injury or arrest.
But some ten disidents, who were also going to show on Thursday on the occasion of the World Day of Human Rights, were detained in the Havanese quarter of Vedado, informed AFP journalist.
According to this journalist, the police have loaded dissidents who have been printed by government supporters in civil vehicles using force.
Detention of disidents in similar conditions only takes a few hours.
The holders of Sahar's European Parliament's price for 2005, "Ladies in white" organized an unauthorized march for "release of all, according to the disent, about 200 political prisoners", said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is resigning a sentence for 20 years of prison.
Mr. Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban disidents arrested in March 2003, 53 remaining behind the nets.
The Cuban authorities consider opponents as "smugglers" or "agents" paid by their main enemy, the United States.
The complete miracle, the Cuban television, has brought a report on the fourth manifestation of officials of the government regime against "revolution opponents".
Cuba, with the Communist Party headed and the government of one party, is regularly accused by European or American non-governmental organizations of disrespect for human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A mad man with a knife killed an eighty-year-old man and injured five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A mad man armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old man and injured five other people in Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at the top of Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary results of the investigation, an attacker aged 28 has reportedly attacked two knives and for unknown reasons an eighty-year-old man in the pharmacy or before it, on 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
Hardly wounded old master, born in 1929, died by the Alliance police syndicate in the hospital for the consequences of injuries.
In this pharmacy or in front of her, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
A husband aged about 30 years began to defend himself and was hurt.
The first two seriously injured victims were accepted to the same hospital where an eighty - year - old man died.
The life of the second injured person is in danger, according to police resources, apparently vital authorities have been affected.
The pregnant woman then crashed and was transported to the hospital "in shock," said the police source.
A armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as he stated by the police source, then fled to the street, still on the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He hurt two more people, apparently accidentally: a thirty-year-old and forty-year-old man, the other man seriously.
It's not quite clear, because it all happened in the evening hours.
He was armed with two messenger knives he was carrying the cross behind his back, said at the site of the Alliance Syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Presse.
A few past people, including young people, have tried to stop and disarma the mad man according to the testimony of the AFP gathered.
I saw some 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commenting on Alberto's situation, a waiter from the near bar.
The crowd, including a city cop who broke his wrist, added it.
Still at Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of 61, two city police officers, including their commander, tried to arrest an armed man and were wounded by the hands, stated the police source.
The incident happened in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
The colleagues came to tell me there's a person injured out there.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and I noticed big wounds on my stomach, I told AFP Frederic Allione, a 30-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, there was another approximately 30 - year - old person who also had stabbed knife wounds.
A man who didn't have any evidence of identity arrested the police.
The State Representative in Nanterre handed the matter to the District Police Department in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect attacker was transferred to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody waiting for an interrogation.
The police source didn't exclude his location in a psychiatric physician.
Another police source indicated that six police officers needed to handle him at the Clichy police station where he was transported.
He was "with all out of himself" like "all crazy people of this type whose power is raised ten times in action."
USA: Polansky's lawyer is asking again to terminate the criminal prosecution
The lawyer of the Polish-France director Romana Polanski asked again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States) to stop the criminal proceedings against his client, currently located in his Swiss residence because of a moral affair that happened 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a legal representative of the "Pianist" film director, criticised three judges of the second district court in California of serious mistakes that occurred during the trial in 1977.
I demand a stop of the prosecution now and now, said lawyer Hummel, and he added that the conduct of the judge who made a decision in that matter, Laurence Rittenbanda had "frozening in his back."
He said that the judge (which already died) had reportedly dealt with a public representative who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to jail, which is a serious offence against the law.
The information on this conversation appeared in the "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, searched and requested), from the mouth of a state representative, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally declared at the end of September that he lied to the author's document.
If the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, the lawyer Hummel will require the conduct of a judicial proceedings where he will be able to submit evidence of his claims.
The applicant repeated what was already said in the first state, that there will be no serious study of the request for the cessation of the criminal prosecution until Roman Polanski is brought before the court.
76-year-old director fled from the United States in 1978, before the court judged the matter with a minor girl of 13 years of age.
Since then, he has never entered the United States territory again.
The prosecutor's deputy at Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said that Roman Polanski "he should be there to participate in the judicial proceedings."
In this case, we want to tell not only Roman Polaska but also other defendants that it is possible to escape? Mrs. Asayam asked.
It is the opinion that the director "proposes a favor in court and also despises his authority."
One of the three judges, now having 90 days to make a decision, also emphasized that "there are other alternatives to escape."
Hummel's lawyer was not the one who asked for the suspension of Roman Polanski.
The legal deputy of the victim, Samantha Geimer, also asked for the end of the criminal prosecution.
She recalled that her client would no longer endure the everlasting disturbance every time the case of Polanski comes up and adds: "No one in this room can say that the process was fair."
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on US command
After more than two months behind the nets, he was released to home prison in his chalupe in Gstaad, where he was waiting for any proof.
Wall Street ends in no direction, he's stopping up a dollar
The New York Bureau ended on Friday without a direction, the market is disturbed between indicators that are better than the US expected and the growing dollar price: Dow Jones won +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final conclusion, Dow Jones Industrial Average progressed from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points and Nasdaq, with technology domination, left 0.55 points and ended at 2.190.31 points.
Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, stated Mace Blicksilver from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of the trade has been very reduced, and I think it's going to stay until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by publishing economic indicators that are better than expected and which "have helped improve the mood on the market as regards the stability of economic recovery," analyst Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, low-market sales increased by 1.3% in November, and that was the second month after each other and much more than it was expected.
According to the preliminary estimate of the index from the University of Michigan, the confidence of American consumers has also returned and has increased strongly to 73.4 to 67.4 in the previous month in December.
The indexs, however, have been compromised by a new increase in dollar prices against the euro, which is highest in the last two months, which "built down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank.
Technological stocks are losing the ground under their feet.
The sales of valuable papers are down.
The contribution of State treasures for 10 years increased to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night and with a 30-year-old view increased to 4.497% against 4.492% per day earlier.
Miss World's choice again in the South Africa.
After a monthly journey across the South African Republic, 112 candidates for Miss World title on Saturday will cross the target to achieve their dream: to be selected by the most beautiful woman in the world before a billion television viewers.
This great celebration of beauty has been held in Johannesburg in the second year, and five candidates have now obtained a semifinal procedure.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasakiová, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Maria Kargboová from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Maová from Canada were selected Miss sport or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real faith of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape City.
I've seen a lot of things and I have so many experiences!
The competition in the South African Republic will be transmitted in direct transfer from Midrand, northern Johannesburg, since 17 hours (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't dream of a beautiful country in which I was putting a crown.
It was fascinating experience.
I'm happy that I could have experienced it twice, Miss of the world, Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot south summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in the South African Republic was held in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and new discovery of the country and its "lands that rise out of breath".
After a month of performance, tests, press meeting and safari now focuses on the competition itself.
India Pooja Chopra hopes to go in the steps of Priyanka Chopra, selected in 2000, which also participated in Aishwary Rai, winners of 1994, which both became Bollywood's stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman of the world is a dream of every woman, but it's not just the appearance.
We're the ambassador of our countries and I want to go home with a crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to organizers, 59th year, music and dance will be carried out in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimming.
The presentation will be presented by the Chinese TV moderator Angela Chow, former Queen of the Beauty of the South African Republic Michelle McLean and the Chairman of the Miss World Committee Steve Douglas.
The South African Republic has shown that she can welcome the world with the heat that it is difficult to face, said Julia Morley, President of the Miss World Competition.
As the candidates attended safari last year, visited a famous town of Soweto, this time at the bike, and tasted local kitchens.
The extraordinary event was the meeting with the South African President Jacob Zuma, who shake their hand.
For the president unusual, Miss Sierry Leone noted.
No doubt the most beautiful memory will remain the loosening in the Cape City (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup that will take place in June 2010 and which has helped the country to support more.
I could've met people I didn't even dream of.
I'm sure to return to the 2010 World Cup, Miss Italy Alice Taticchi says with thrill.
According to David's son, Hallyday's state reports are "very positive".
The reports of Johnny Hallyday's condition are "very positive", as his son David assured us at his Friday arrival in Los Angeles, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong and everything is doing very well, said David Hallyday when he arrived from Paris a moment after the 13th hour of local time (21st hour of world time)
The singer's son, who acted quietly, declared that "as soon as possible" would get to the Los Angeles Hospital Cedars-Sinaí, which Johny Hallyday was adopted on Monday due to post-operation infection caused after the surgery of the heavily inter-vertible plates, which he approached on November 26th in Paris.
According to the press statement, the night was singing in Los Angeles because of the comfort of "used in artificial sleep", which would prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was the doctors of Cedars-Sinaé hospital in Los Angeles already invented in the artificial sleep. The hospitalization was infected after the surgery of the heavy inter-removable plates performed on 26 November in Paris.
Because of serious damage caused by this infringement , the singer must have been reoperated at night from Wednesday to Thursday .
According to the photographer AFP, his wife Laetia attended the French Lycea school show on Friday morning in Los Angeles, visiting their daughter Jade.
Preferences of ortopedic surgery and traumatology of the hospital la Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he leaves for a singer to Los Angeles on Monday.
The manufacturer strongly accused Dr. Stephana Deliouxe, a neurosurgeon who operated on Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
They told us it was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles declared they were disturbed, M. Camus said.
I heard about the possibility of the future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday's gone too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of his Paris surgeon."
I personally spoke to a doctor, and he assured me that this road was no problem, which surprised me so much, since I had already twice suffered from an outbreak of the cross-border plot, he added me.
For a moment earlier, the RTL radio station stated that the singer apparently flew after a Paris surgery without drone, without anything."
Dr. Stephane Delioux is very famous in art circles.
He operated her actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before she died at the Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic that he was working on at that time.
In 2007, he also operated actor Charlotte Gainsburg to remove the hematom resulting in brain bleeding.
However, it is also a doctor with a dark reputation, sentenced several times in cases of neglecting medical care, for tax escapes and fraud.
The medical attorney Olivier Metzner named him "man without scrupule", who is "regularly" called in front of the medical chamber, which can't even be "recommended from far away".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stephane Delioux spoke to the matter on Friday through his lawyer David Kubbi.
He announced that the operation had "too good progress" and the post-operation examination was "normal".
Operation was not a haemorrhagic nature, so the introduction of drone was not necessary," he added.
The health problems of the singer have grown since this year and, in any case, it seems that the other tour remains with a questionnaire.
It is obvious that the period of renewal of the planned tour on January 8 (In Amiensa, recognised red.) appears too close, Camus declared.
The UDF association increases the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre to continue to use their shortcuts.
The UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançoise Bayrou, responded on Friday to the attempt of the President of the Nouveau Centre, Hervo Morin to accommodate the shortcuts of the former Giscard's party with the abbreviation of any media under the threat of criminal prosecution.
Herve Morin publicly announced his intention to own a short UDF with the fact that François Bayrou does not deserve to bear her her inheritance after he handed the left hand.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step has received support from Hervego de Charetta (ex-UMP now for NC), which assigns the ownership of the UDF mark, since he first registered it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institution national de la propriette industry).
But on Friday night, the UDF Association of Managed Friends of Françoise Bayrou, who did not intend to be taken out of their silence, came out of his silence and filed a formal request to the Minister and the Members to stop using shortly and return the property of the protective mark under the threat of the criminal prosecution.
In the last days, you have increased anxious statement that you will propose your political movement + new to take a short UDF, the Association in its letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the Committee, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance Center.
At the same time, you considered it suitable to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome of your web site name+Nouveau center+, with a slog +UDF today+, also set the signators of the letter.
As you know, you do not have the right to use this shortcut, explains the UDF committee that requests the NC movement immediately to remove all the names of UDF from all promoting materials, including its web sites."
At the same time, he asks Herv de Charette "to transfer the property of the protective mark to legitimate owners".
If you do not, we will turn to courts in order to respect the law and legitimate rights of the UDF members, the signatories warn.
In their letters, UDF is a full political movement from 1978 " and reminds that Mr Morin and his friends "elect " departure in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as well as others in 2002 to establish UMP.
Therefore, the Nouveau Centre does not have any right to use the UDF shortcut (Union pour la democratia française).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF convention voted in 2007 to join the Modem for three years and for the establishment of a committee responsible to protect "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valerim Giscard d'Estaing.
With regard to Hervego de Charette, the committee continues: "When it registered a protective mark", it has not been "for three years a member of the UDF", but UMP.
In a scandal and fraud, he used no registration of acronyms to make it on his own account.
This incredibility begins to be converted into a criminal act, they declare, and then with ironia, they express to the NC strategy: "We seem that both in politics, and in normal life, it is more valuable to create a name for ourselves than to come out of anonymity with a fake acceptance of a name that we do not have the right to."
The case of Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness.
The court in Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist Françoise-Marie Baniera and to judge whether he used the state of weakness of the 80-year-old billionaire to lose her part of her wealth, which blames her daughter Liliana Bettencourt.
Photograph (62 years) known by its photographs of famous will be judged by 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of the state of weakness, which is a criminal act for which the penalty is stored in the maximum period of 3 years and the penalty of 375 000 euros.
This Decision confirms that a process in the case can be identified as a family stag of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and her daughter are attacked and fighting for the management of the L'Oréal cosmetic empire.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be conducted by the three doctors' College.
The inheritance and chief shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to take such examination, certainly not under the conditions offered by the State Representative in Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors to be elected on Friday should develop a report by 10 March 2010 and also give a statement whether Liliana Bettencourt could be in the state of weakness and in which period.
I think he'll come up with him.
I'll talk to her about the matter, he said after the hearing of Mrs. Bettencourt's attorney, Georges Kieman.
With regard to Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
It's a great report(...). Expertiza will show that with this old lady who needs protection, he manipulated (M. Banier), he confirmed.
There are two years that the only daughter of Liliana Bettencourt launched a criminal proceeding against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-mistress who is guilty of the long years of using the state of the weakness of her mother to gain a billion euro form of checks, contracts for life insurance or images of masters.
So Lilian Bettencourt always refused to be a photographer who she considers a long-term friend, manipulated.
While the court had to judge the jurisdiction of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the Friday Court of Justice was changing at the family hour of truth.
The lawyer of Liliana Bettencourt presented three letters that his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent to her notebook, in which she expressed her untrust against her husband Françoisy Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt delivers, "you could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for 15 years once or twice a day.
Since she married, I could never talk to Françoise."
The State representation in Nanterre reiterates that the complainant's proceedings are not authorised, more than that the custody judge in these days rejected her request to initiate the proceedings to issue legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully able to participate in the court, is not under protection or in custody.
No one else will act for her," the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney, confirmed.
The Court eventually decided that Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers will be expressed at the time of the start of the process.
Managing revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for economic intelligence development was useless...
For more than ten years, it reminds the behavior of the management of large companies against employees of the company's access to consumers before marketing revolution: it is that colleagues are to identify the "values" of mountains, as was before when consumers had to force products that came from the ideas of the heads of factory techniques.
By becoming the customer's business centre, the marketing revolution of the marketing strategy in the right direction... even if authoritary attempts to force products different from customers' preferences are regularly returning!
Passive access to employees can lead to death demoralization.
Suicide in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a visible part of a much wider general phenomenon that mainly affects the managerial cader.
This demobilization affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, EI "requires from all participating parties... active access and ability to predict" and requires employees of commitments that are completely in contrast with the revenues of authority management.
We therefore call on the manager's revolution, which should aim at bringing employees to the centre of business interest as well as the client.
Relative use of internal public opinion research.
Internal research of public opinion - as a questionnaire submitted to employees of Orange - will contribute to the revolution in managerial procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid it's not.
Especially because I've already convinced myself that the structure after different diversions returns to... what she always did!
Furthermore, the authority, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in moderately with the severity of its own failures.
And finally, because most governing workers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of high schools for engineers, they have mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For reasons of the convenience of mind, the old behaviorist theory, now renewed by "neuveds" from the United States, and widely spread without greater knowledge by the scientific constitution and the media.
With the possibility of moving "packs" (sic) the involvement of managers, the recent research of the Ipsos Agency on Figaro.fr, which only establishes the governing workers in their position of mechanical governance, inappropriate to today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises is expected to accept the final vision of human behaviour.
It is incorporated into all the purposes and practices of management : For employees, commitments to the undertaking will be possible only if they appear as a clear means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
This concept of the motivation of employees is currently dealing with only the studies of the Motivative functional analysis.
These studies showed that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of the pre-defined doxes that will enable them to evaluate what it offers to achieve their life objectives.
With the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the managers can control, predict and anticipate on their "social performance" and indicate their management of human resources "in the right way".
This creates a live soil for the development of solid and effective economic intelligence.
With the expression of Oslo: "the fair war" Obama earned praise from the right side.
The American right welcomed on Friday the speech Barack Obama presented a day before in Oslo, satisfied with the concept that the holder of the Nobel Price of Peace for 2009 defended the concept of "righteous wars" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who first laughed at the price of Obama on October 9th, this time the presidential speech was challenging, including Sarah Palin, former candidates to the Vice-President in 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the museum of the right Republican wing, for USA Today's journal, and added that she had expressed herself to this theme "ever necessary" of war in her memories that are just coming out.
The war is of course the last thing the Americans would want to have to do, but it's necessary.
All terrorists need to be held there, he thinks.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessorGeorge W. Bush, on Thursday in Oslo, justified the sending of forces and used his speech to explain his decision to send another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days ago.
Another Obama's opponent, Newt Gingrich, evaluated the president in Oslo "very good work".
I think that the speech was really good, congratulations from the former President of the Parliament of Representatives, who appreciated the mention of the president of "existence of evil in the world".
In my own way, I considered this speech a totally historical, I declared Gingrich during an interview in the "The Takeaway" radio.
The former messenger, which some consider as a possible Republican candidate in the presidential elections for 2012, was excited to see the "left president" remind the members of the Nobel Price Committee," that they would not be free and could not transfer a price for peace if the use of forces had not existed.
According to Michael Gerson, the former author of the speech George W. Bush, now the editor of Washington Post, Obama presented "very American speech".
Not only did he represent himself as a "worldian" as always, but "he spoke as an American president" and reminded the Europeans that they lived in a safe bubble that they didn't create themselves, and that they did not do too much to save it," said Gerson.
Ambassador of the United Nations John Bolton, who described the speech as "singly, abusive and without inspiration" on the National Review Online websites .
On the left of the president, for example, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is frightened by viewing Barack Obama, as justifys the use of forces.
"When we put the war in the package of justice, we can easily reason the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the medium-left press stands against the president's commendable opinion.
Although Los Angeles Times continues to view the price of peace to Obama as early, he considers his output as "supreme" even for a speaker famous with his talent.
The exhibition of Oslo should serve as a guide to international decisions to address conflicts, in the fight against poverty and distress," the California Journal states slightly.
Obama "pronounced what was needed," estimated the New York Times, and the speech marked "a simple and lessonable."
Road carriers: three maratones to a treaty that will save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three maratons, the road carriers and TLF committees, the only employee organisation that remained until the end, on Friday night, to an agreement that terminated the call for a strike and a threat that was hanging over the delivery of Christmas supplies.
The Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, during the Friday signing of the Agreement, expressed "rejoice" after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night, the negotiators broke up on Friday morning with hope that the text of the agreement will be signed as soon as possible at the end of the morning.
Even though three employees (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have withdrawn from the negotiations.
But there was a need for more than six hours of a meeting that started at 11 hours to all agree and sign the agreement at 18:00.
This conflict "will hurt businesses very much" and "threatened to disturb holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text contains a 4% increase of wages for lowest salaries (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
The hourly remuneration of the lowest salaries shall be increased from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we'll give our members an order to avoid blocking, no blockage of supplies.
But there may be several other opponents who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of the TLF, welcomed the "correct agreement", even though it was difficult to acknowledge the increase in high wages due to international competition".
He believes that increases by 170 euros per month in lowest wages and 100 to 120 euros in the highest.
It is a healthy understanding and respect for employees, said CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), it is a "admissible compromise".
The Agreement also envisages the revaluation of travel expenses of 3% and the report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow us to focus on the question of 13 payments and the modernisation of the collective contract.
Bussereau recalled "declined by 100 million euros on taxes from the remuneration of businesses" which was the subject of the Government's modification proposal to draft the 2009 budget law, which was voted on Thursday to Friday of the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "properly".
The signature allows this Agreement to apply first to undertakings which are members of this organization, later to the whole sector, in case of enlargement by the Ministry of Labour.
It will be "in the shortest term," Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only reduce the disagreement of employers' organisations.
The FNTR organisation speaks of "looking trade" because 100 million euros "but offered to the sector under compensation for part of carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us not to act as an emergency as a result of mutual analysis, but to make sure that he should not be angering crochets during the coming Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
For the organization of Otre, the agreement in the next 12 months "this will bury a large amount of small and medium-sized businesses."
Pregradary RER A trains: interruption of the weekend transport, committees are unsatisfied with the proposals of the RATP transport company.
The interruption of the transport on the frontier trains of RER A, which is the largest line of the city's mass transport in France, will continue on the weekend, as the Friday talks between the RATP and the other day led the strike to no specific results in the issue of the premium.
Saturday and Sunday, therefore, the days of the important buying weekend before Christmas, trains will ride only between 10 and 20 hours, on the main section (mean La Defense and Nation) will ride every other train, outside of this section only one train from four.
The SNCF connection will be interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture and the passengers will be forced to move to another train.
Trade houses Galleries Lafayette who expect more than 200 000 customers every day welcomed the fact that "A RATP has been trying to ensure connection with large business houses".
Line RER A leads from the west to the east of Paris Aglomeration.
The section managed by RATP leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Leger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, there was one of two trains in operation, and practically no compartment drove outside the time, as it was planned.
Like Thursday, the people of Ile de France settled differently, and there was no confusion on the stages.
So early in the morning, the St. Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less people than usual, among other things because the students and students were missing.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he rose up about "hour and a half before to make sure he's arriving in time."
The St. Lazare Railway was not overloaded, SNCF state railway announced, since more establishments and guards of order were predicted.
RER Pregradary trains and operated SNCF in the direction of or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left Station Saint-Lazare with a metro accession.
Another valuable meetings of strikemen will be held on Saturday and Sunday, where the results of the Friday afternoon meeting will be evaluated by the committees as "slab".
The management of RER proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER trains and after all pages, adjustment of working hours, the progress of the career, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who require the deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (CommitteesJih).
RATP has even delayed proposals for the premium, which made CGT worse with the "managed to solve the problem, while it was done with travelers and SNCF".
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, the RATP transport companies referred to as "to review the conditions of performance of the job".
Which is why experts think that the business is making fun of the weekend travelers.
In the morning, about 150 drivers have been employed by the business committee in its Paris seat.
The leadership that has denied any discussion during the strike has therefore decided to meet in the interest of calming.
It is threatened that the conflict will also expand on RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Nedependent announce the strike emergency.
The committees require a premium of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros of variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Jih), Independents (Independent)) and tough on the worse working conditions on this line, which will transport a million passengers daily.
Prigrad train drivers RER earns in advanced career periods of 2200 to 2700 euros of gross wages and 600 to 650 euros of premiums in an unregular working period and on Sunday and on holidays.
The Turkish justice has dissolved for the Kurdish party, and this decision brings difficult consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court decided on Friday to abolish the main pro-kurd parties in the country. This decision immediately caused protest demonstration in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision may significantly complicate the government's task that is trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and thus try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become "the nest of the activities threatening the independence of the State and its inseparable unit," the reporters told the Chairman of the Supreme Court of Justice Hasim Kilic after four days of the negotiations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, when most or seven votes were needed to dissolve the party, Kiliç said and added that 37 side rates, including her President Ahmet Türk and Ambassador Aysela Tuglukow, were prohibited from taking part in political life for five years.
The judge also announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity by Mr Türk and Mrs. Tugluk and confiscation of the property of the party to the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP Party has 21 chairs in Parliament (of 500).
The head of the party has already warned before the verdict that the messengers would rather leave Parliament than act as Members without political privilege.
The decision is to continue the process launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Casition Court, Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, accusing the DTP of obedience against the "commands" of the Workers of Kurdistan (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider terrorist organisations.
Many observers are convinced that DTP is a legal political vitre of rebels from the PKK.
The party assures that there is no "basic connection" with the PKK, but refuses to designate it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's judgment comes at the time the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and attempts to limit the support of the Kurds against the PKK and to end the conflict.
The leadership of the DTP confirmed that the discontinuation of the party could lead to renewing the tension in the southeast of Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions under which the leader of the PKK Abdullah Öcalan was detained in conflict with the police during the past weeks.
Since notifying the decision of justice, thousands of demonstrators have gathered before the DTP seat in Diyarbakir, a large city in the south-east, mostly Kurdians.
The police used the tear grenades and water vessels, demonstrators were throwing Molot's cocktails again or shooting stones from the practices.
In Istanbul, there were also about a hundred people.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the decision of justice only "prolooks desperation".
Turkey can't solve this question (Kurds, recognition) by ban of the party, he declared in the press.
The government, which was established by the side of the Islamic Movement, also condemned this decision.
We're from the principle against the interruption of the parties.
It's nothing to solve, Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a totally democratic launched by the government, commented the politologist Ahmet Insel.
Clearly, we can wait for the PKK response, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK joined one of the most murdered attacks in northern Turkey, who killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow can come.
That's what Wolfgang Brauburger wishes.
Not because he wants to scare citizens, says the head of the Winter Department of Technical Services of the FESs.
But so that his employees can try and learn to control all the vehicle techniques.
The first time the meteorologists would have done this for the weekend.
More than 300 employees and 120 vehicles are prepared to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is working according to the exact plan.
Once it snows in Frankfurt, and temperatures fall under zero, they go to 20 so-called segments, Brauburger explains.
These sections include main and passages such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also the arrivals for firefighters, the lines of pregradary public transport, walking zones and segments with declines like Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at 3:00 a.m.
If necessary, it is necessary to dry with wet salt that better holds about 1040 miles [1040 km] during at least three hours.
That's why the FESs starts at three o'clock at night, "that the roads are free when the transport starts to work."
It's unlawful when it starts to snow at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the chief of the Winter Technical Services department, "because no one is willing to make the syringes a place."
Only when they don't snow so much, there are arrival and connecting communications, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority has side and sideways.
Brauburger knows they'll complain there.
At 5:00 a.m., the FESs pedestrians will go on their way, rather cleaning dangerous places and transitions.
The FES can't usually take care of all cyclostes.
In Frankfurt, there is a special service that follows from 22 to 4.30 mostly bridges, says Brauburger.
Since the ice cream is made up quickly, the syringe is driven immediately as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
If necessary, the police will also call them.
Dinosaur wheel
Tawa Hallae looked like a lot of other massive dinosaurs: a animal long two meters and 1,50 meters tailed at two strong back ends, had a long skull with a sharp, tight teeth, short front ends with scrubty tails and a long tail.
If this kind had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt from University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the quarter edition of the Science magazine says that Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these physical signs.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was in the equation of the dry area of the Pangea supercontinent.
Tawa opens a new window to the former evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He's showing us a lot about relative relations, enlargement and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006 Nesbitt and other paleontologists in Ghost Ranch, north of New Mexico, began.
Sometimes in one day, we found a dozen dinosaur bones, which is unseen for trias, informs a member of Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones identified scientists quickly as a new species.
During the digging, the remains of five individuals were collected.
The finding confirms theory of the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun's god of the Indians Hopi.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual finding: "The fossilies of the dinosaurs of the trias are very rare, mostly only separate fractions are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without an exception.
Especially sensational this finding is not, but confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the university in Bonno.
According to the present scientific opinion, the dinosaurs first appeared before about 230 million years.
Many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradinosaurs is mostly controversial.
Experts discuss, for example, when the teachers divided into three of the most important development lines: the massaged terropods, which later belonged to Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor, and also birds, "long-night" four-foot sauropods and their relatives, and the biologists of Ornitischia (Ptakopans), including Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa Hallae is after Nesbitt's analysis and his colleagues' original terrapod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
In Tawa Hallae’s skull, for example, researchers found the evidence of air waxes that also have descendants of birds.
The air vacuum makes the breathing of birds more effective than the suckers.
In Tawa Hallae, the bones of the back were obviously partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive thermopode with air waxes, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative line of huge sauropods later had air waxes and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestor of both groups had created this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most famous dinosaurs were living in South America so far, scientists were exporting that the messengers first appeared there.
According to this, three development lines have already been divided early and spread from South America to all continents that then, as a supercontinent of Pangea, formed a united earthly meat.
She would also speak about the fact that Tawa Hallae and Tawa found the remains of two other, not particularly close relative terrors.
Those three can't come from a common, immigrated ancestor, scientists argument.
We believe that there were at least three migration waves in North America, says Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a coautor of scientific studies.
Of course, there is also a dispute.
Another older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to the group of the most difficult dinosaurs, lived in Poland today, says the Bonnian paleontologist Martin Sander.
His assumption could bring together a scratched picture, because in South America there remained very many primitive fossils of dinosaurs, and the other continents are rarely found when.
As the dinosaurs have proved that the relatively rare sidelines of the plasma species have developed to rulers in the earth in the mid - century times, remain a mystery.
During the trias, dinosaurs shared their lifespace with many other beaches, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying teachers and the number of other cheers.
Approximately at the end of the trias, the dinosaurs spread across the world and many new species developed, while relatives died and the interface of trias and jury.
Success History has not lasted forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
It could have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the beaches weren't.
Or the dinosaurs adjusted better, so they could push the competition.
The history of success did not last forever.
150 million years later, the meteorism of another group of animals, which has also developed in trias and lived in the shadows since then.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
There are professors of the University of Toronto, University of Cambridge, Vienna University or Berkeley in California.
They joined donors from Neapol, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paul, Berlin, or Brem.
The police cleaning of the busy casino of the Frankfurt University of Goethe took care of the world's disturbance.
278 teachers and teachers of Goeth University, but also high schools throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidised with protesting students in Westend Campus.
In the declaration written in German and English, they "do not approve" by the presidency of an incited police intervention.
Because walls and artwork were scratched, the university president Werner Müller-Estler had cleaned up the building that the striking students and lectured last week.
Five students were injured.
The damages of the matter, the signatories, do not justify the "violent discontinuation of self-organized student learning and teaching police command."
Cleaning represents "unappropriate intervention" in the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves as "irregularity and criminalization of the protest" and distracts the contents.
The presidency has avoided the necessary discussion.
The lecturer calls for the cessation of a criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most strikemen did not support real damage.
Administered Protest
Youths are also solidarised by students by the profession organisations of Verdi and the German council Union.
Protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern about its own future, says the mysterious Earth Youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
The Hesen Minister of Science, Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), are now protecting the procedure of the university president and police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and employment are absolutely unacceptable funds, she said on Thursday in Actuellen Stunde (Aktual hour) in the Visbaden Earth Hall.
We have understanding for the protest, but we don't have any understanding for vandalism, said the messenger of the Earth's dream for the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition fractions of SPD, Greens and Links saw it.
The CDU takes painted walls for a reason to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and requirements of the students, there was a cleaning.
The link has submitted a proposal that calls on the Secretary of Interior to report on the police station.
New Silicon-Valley
For years, it was paid for a secret city that was not available to visitors from the West.
Greengrad, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a strictly guarded location where a secret armed research was conducted.
Today this area is considered with 216,000 inhabitants, 37 miles away from the Moscow Centre, "Russian Silicon Valley".
There are significant micro- and nanoelectronic research and manufacturing centres.
Since September 2008, green city representatives have been contacting the Frankfurt Scientific Centre Riedberg - with university institutions and firms of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and they signed on Wednesday in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg "Protocol on close cooperation".
The Russian delegation led the Moscow multiannual Jurij Rosljak and the prefect of Green City Anatolij Smirnov, signed for Frankfurt the leading referee of Edwin Schwarz planning.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will be headed to the seminar to Greengrad.
Scientific exchange
It's a periodic scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
The FIZ companies will be allowed to capture the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian Scientific companies want to get procurement in Germany.
Greengrad is the seat of significant Russian research institutions and companies.
These include Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, Big Sitronics and Russian Electronic.
The period was founded in 1958 as so-called "socialist planned city" for armed research.
Greengrad (Further translation "Green City") gained his name according to a forested hill landscape in which research facilities are planted.
Stuttgart brake
The size of Stuttgart 21 can't be prepared at all enough.
The project's favors are completely simple about the "new heart of Europe".
S21 is more than a railway launch, more than a monster building that will throw the main city of Badenska-Württemberska for a decade into the desperate construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 came from spirit in the '80s.
The head stations with railways that ended in the center of the city were then considered transport and technical fossils in the 19th century, which acts as brakes of modern railway transport, because it took enormously much time to scratch the locomotives backwards.
Go, stop, go on, it's supposed to work.
And that's why the head station is gone: Frankfurt and Monk.
And in Stuttgart: Travel Station, which is located nearly in the middle of the trans-European railways between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, is why the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
It really begins with S21, even though visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with the reality.
Very ambitious designers have learned that in the Hesenian and Bawarian large, the beginning of the building is almost unfunded.
Since there are modern kivadle trains with motor vehicles and drivers on both ends, the head stations have no problems with riding and riding.
However: It begins with Stuttgart 21, including a new ICE track to Ulm.
The country and community politicians have made it.
The roads cooperate, even as the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are taxpayer, not state concern.
Urbanistically, the project can be apologised in another way.
There will be a new urban space that - if we trust computer images of designers - will contain many green.
The railway transport system is harmful to S21.
Travel stations and road construction are designed for personal transport, which - typically in the '80s - was assigned to a huge increase.
There was no cheap flight competition then.
Modern transport policy must, however, go first on strengthening the car transport, because railway transport is far more ecological than the car car on the road.
But the new track is not suitable for cargo trains because of a rapid rise.
More seriously, S21 directly touches many other railway projects.
In Sweden, good six billion euros should be buried.
It's an official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion realities.
Clearly, in the next decade, finances will be missing on the next knot points and narrow sites in the network.
There are sixty bigger projects on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important things is the construction of about 180 miles of the long route by the Rina Valley.
Since 1987, it has become a slow pace on this route.
You'd need to push it out here.
But S21 will be like a brake.
The trail in the valley of Rina becomes a throat of a bottle of international cargo transport: directly in the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the judgment on the airport
The country's government has left open in the Visbaden Earth House if it goes against the judgment of the Hessen Administrative Court (VGH) on the ban of night flights and will make it revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition authorised experts to legally judge more than 400 pages of VGH's judgment, said the Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel today has written reasons that the State should re-establish the nightly ban of flights in the event of the construction of the northwestern runway of the Frankfurt airport.
The authorization of 17 years between 23 and 5 hours, as the earthly government assumes, does not comply with the law of the protection of the population against the noise of the night.
The coalition must be decided by 4 January if it requires a revision of the judgment.
The opposition criticised this delay and insisted on the representative of the government to renounce the revision of the Social Administrative Court in Libya.
The chief of the SPD fraction Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called for CDU and FDP to return to the promises concerning the ban of night flights that she had given before the election. Otherwise, it is possible to evaluate as "breach of the word".
It's damn hard, if you can keep your word, the head of Green Tarek Al-Wazir said in the shop on the FDP electoral slogan "We hold the word."
Minister Posch refused the Schäfer-Gümbela elevator, the country government is trying to get to his night flights through "creaming law and tricks".
The exact legal control needs time.
The coalition doesn't want to work on the basis of "fast first impression."
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His fractions to ban night flights were never as opposed.
American banks pay aid
The American, the crisis of the large banks is getting rid of the state lifts.
The Bank of America paid all the aid from Tarp's bank rescue fund at a total of $45 billion (approximately 30 billion euros).
According to the U.S. CNBC report, Citigroup also plans to pay state aid.
Constitutions therefore want to get rid of the restrictions that have occurred by receiving money - the limitation of bonus payments to managers and the refund of high fees.
The Bank of America has obtained 19 billion pure money from investors in exchange bonds.
The remaining amount was taken from its treasure, which was, inter alia, filled with professional sales.
The boss of the Kenneth Lewis bank thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday night: Money injection helped us to overcome the difficult time.
The cash institution damaged the top of the financial crisis by taking over Merrill Lynch's investment bank.
Citigroup wants to free himself from its commitments to the State by also receiving money on the capital market.
The CNBC has been informed with the revocation to the source that this US Bank could notify the capital increase of approximately $20 billion on Thursday.
Citigroup speaker didn't want to say that.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid for help.
Quick choice
It just went faster than it was expected.
The station presented the successor only two weeks after the ZDF Administrative Council pushed out of the office of Chief Editor Nikolause Brender.
Yesterday night, the grammy wanted to make an agreement on that person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio, was marked as favorite in Berlin.
But the station didn't confirm it, officially, so she wouldn't be in progress.
However, the role could also play that they did not want to harm the intendent ZDF Marcus Schächter unless this proposal was passed by the Administrative Board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of 14 members of the graemy.
The result of the vote was not known before the conclusion of this issue.
Two weeks ago, he lost the Schächter Administrative Council with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Brender's loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, even though it was expected.
The EU's majority in the Administrative Council has signaled a few weeks before the election that it does not want to confirm Brender in the office.
The resistance against the chief editor organized the Hesen Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He denied further intervals in the Office of a highly respected editor by argument that the quotas of the monitoring of the reporting of the ZDF were dropped for Brender.
Soon before the election, there were protests in which a political impact on ZDF was criticised.
The last time, even 35 state-law lawyers have been involved in the debate, which Koch's procedure is regarded as counter-constitutional.
It was nothing.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He was studying politics, pedagogics and romantics.
Then he worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 Frey went to ZDF, first into "heute-journal".
Next station: 1988-1990 personal referencer of the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 leader and moderator "Morgenmagazins"; to 2001 head of foreign policy of ZDF; since then leading the main ZDF study.
After the Brender, who was elected by the Medium Magazin professional period in the Wednesday as a journalist of the year, the Greene announced that they would file a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch's counter-chandidate in the Administrative Council, Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the United States should change the State Treaty with the ZDF so that the personal proposals of the intendance could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck, however, also rejected the exclusion of party politicians from the Supervisory Board of ZDF.
Brender's alleged successor, Peter Frey, commissioned the Governing Council with a smart chess move - immediately after the Brender settled for it, he criticised strongly.
With this evidence of journal independence, he could be nominated as the head of the editor without losing the face of Schächter, so he could be elected by the Governing Council without being suspected that a party would be pressed into the office.
In the party arithmetic, Frey is still handed to the left liberals.
Study Reduction of Harampades
Partial success for students: After the year of strike, the Ministers of Culture at the Conference of Ministers of Culture and High School Rectors finally took place on Thursday after the strike.
Students should be able to manage their study in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the load of tests: In particular, each study module should be completed with one single test.
Furthermore, the workload of students should be checked, and it should be guaranteed "real and defensive measure".
Politicians and high schools want to simplify recognition of trials between high schools in Germany and abroad.
Social countries are committed to creating more flexible structural assignment for bacalary and magistrate studies.
Earth deviations should cease to exist.
Less Tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in the worm, the ministers of culture and university rektors in their mouth had crooked words about a better study.
Now they're first filled with specific content.
The so-called accreditation Council concluded that the number of tests are often drastically reduced: "Each module will usually be completed by only one test," says the 30-page report, which should partly regulate the approval of the study fields.
"Extraordinally lower test burden," said the President of the Reinhold Grimm Accreditation Council, "is to stop a mistaken development which significantly restricted the difficulty of study."
This should be the "authority of study" in the future of the "decisive criteria" in the implementation.
Modules and contents are "We need to be hardly checked" so that "does not limit students at the option
the seminars."
Students should have a "sight to space that allows and supports their own initiative."
The rules should apply in approval of new study fields, after reviewing, but also for existing study obstacles.
This needs to be "pre-acredited" every five years – which, however, means that it will last until 2015 before all study obstacles are checked.
There are ten accreditative agencies all over Germany who are subject to the accreditation councils established by the United States.
The Ministers of Culture called on the United States in October "decisively" so that the agencies would act so that the instructions could not be too large and the test regime would not be strict.
In individual countries, universities and high schools have already agreed with the country ministries on appropriate measures.
As yet, the only country has promised Porini-Falco additional means for further development of the Bologna process.
In particular, high schools should build consultative programmes and study advice, and strengthen the testing and foreign authorities.
This is what countries and high schools want to make up ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, he wants to rule in the parliamentary novel of the universal law.
According to it, only one test should be required to end the study module.
The forming of the study should be even more flexible, thus guaranteeing recognition of studies from other high schools and facilitating my access to the master.
By the end of the next year, the difficulty of all study activities in the country should be checked.
The government and opposition were again arguing on the study conditions in the country on Thursday.
The resolution was also criticized by praise.
Juso has called on the Social Office of High School Groups to not play the policy of education in the future "on the closed doors" of ministers and high-school rectors.
Later after the strike, the students should "speak at least a word" as well as those concerned.
Future academics also received support from the President of the University Rector Conference (HRK), Margreta Wintermantel: "We need experience from students," said on Thursday at a meeting with the Cultural Ministers, with whom the HRK consulted on the joint reform report.
According to the Committees of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolution has not gone far enough: They require a legal privilege that would allow each graduate with a bacalary title to access the mastership study.
Secondly, the United States must ensure that for today's generation of students, the bachelor industry is available enough rooms in the master study field tomorrow with the best conditions of study, said the member of GEW Andreas Keller.
Social countries must hire much more lecturers.
But the Ministers of Culture did not express their free access to the master programs.
More than a note to Herta Müller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, nearly no control..." is the introduction line of one poetry of Werner Söllner, who in this broken language piece discusses the experience of the landing of a disident who has obtained freedom, but also lost his language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Romanian Banat, first worked as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest, and later as a teacher of a child’s bookbook publisher, then moved to Frankfurt over Mohan.
Söllner was awarded by various literary prices, 1993 lectured a poetry at the legendary Frankfurt University of Goethe, and since 2002 he was the head of the Hesen Forum of Literature in Mousonturm, Frankfurt.
A significant outliterary disturbance took care of last Tuesday at a seminar in Mnichov, on which it was about "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror of its security acts".
The apparently uncertain and infected Söllner left a statement in which Romanian German writers, namely Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, confessed to cooperate as a secret informant of Romania's secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the presents, Söllner won the German linguistic price in 1989.
They said the attempts to recruit have started inadequately, first in 1971.
I'm, continues Söllner, "this is someone who has not defended enough intimidation attempts by Securitate."
Poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent Walter.
Almost at the same time with Herta Müller's Nobel Price and her inappropriate literary dealing with the dictatorial government mechanisms, it is a literary scene, and especially the communities of German authors originating in Romania, are compromised by a case that marks depths and shamefulness of the political system which is based on control and scrutiny.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said according to the actual state of knowledge, just a convict, but it is also a victim.
In the Securitate files, a secret agent Walter played a role, said after Söllner's confession, Michael Markel, and he relied on a positive impact on himself by secret agent Walter.
"He cut me out" then in all the important points for him, says Markel.
He's morally obliged to make this note.
Söllner's statement was in this form and was unexpected before this audience, but completely surprising to the recognition of the former dissident and his cooperation with Romania's secret service is not.
Herta Müller wrote in July when she read her own acts, 914 pages that Germany was a pleasant booking for the Securitate spicles.
Dossiers, may be assumed, will speculate and in some cases even know what name is hiding behind the secret name Sorin, Voice and Walter.
Otherwise, rather than in the country, while a very certain examination of the Stazi folders, manipulation with the remainder of the Securitate control is still very difusive.
In the past years, systematic light was waste and limited.
One of the Birthler's offices, corresponding to the National Council for the processing of Securitate (CNSAS), was founded only in 1999, the issue of the act has been carried out a rather long time since.
Only since 2005 there is a law that manages the management of the files.
That former members of Securitate have still a major influence in Romania, he reported after the publication of the Nobel Price for Herta Müller a interview in which one of the former heads of Securitate from Temešvar expressed appreciation holder denied.
He said he had a psychiatrist, and at the end, she was interrogated only once.
The absorption of power has been expressed completely incorrectly in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, Söllner's case, like in connection with the silenced prosecution, will be raised by unexpected questions.
The special response of the listeners to Söllner's confession allows him to expect the continuation of this chapter to define the desire to know rather than to say guilt and shame.
The genesis of Herta Müller's work, who accepted the Nobel Price yesterday, is more than a note under line.
Saturated contribution Champions League
It seemed like a purely dressed business representative from a cute Christmas party on which the manufacturer was handing out the sports goods of sweetness when he was coming for four o'clock after midnight to acquired Mercedes of class C a new coach VfBr Christian Gross in accompanied by the orange-colored sponsor bag.
The man with a markant pleasant was allowed to drive a foreign city because of him.
Otherwise, he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and fortunately, a 55 - year - old man was too little.
It was a nice night, but tomorrow it'll continue to work.
Or it's just starting.
Words only three days of the Swiss engaged: "We have reached eight finals" in the Champions League victory3:1 over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let us shine with success: It will be a brutally hard fight against acceleration."
"Most important task" stands in front of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the Royal Class in Mohuc and in the ordinary League Day.
And avoid re-explicit weaknesses after three rapid Marica goals (5.), Traäsche (8.) and Pogrebnyak (17).
Smoothing
Osmifinals Champions League (facing 16./17. + 23./24 February/recommendation 9./10. + 16./17 March) will be held in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy of the babel’s successor will therefore be preserved.
Not only with a suspected patient who gave uncertain Stuttgarth professionals a short time of self-consciousness, willingness to plant and joy of the game.
I went to the players and told them that they were to focus on their strong sites and I encouraged them to be more courageous, explained the healing of the soul Gross so easily sounding a successful recipe, but for the effect of the therapist Babbel did not show any more effectiveness.
He squeezed some magic, acknowledged Babbel's counterpart Jens Lehmann, "when a new pulse comes in football, sometimes things that you don't think possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a weekly break caused by injury, became his dynamic immediately the best player on the playground, tried to describe the detected "phenomenon" by the arbitrary "free wind" and the working procedures of the new supervisor: "He is a man that is radical and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the present situation."
Apparently it missed Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not saved yet, warns Sports President Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
Like Gross, even players and managers do not want to overestimate victory against a weak replacement and completely overloaded defense of Romanian guest.
They would also win in Glasgowa before the ugly awakening came after defeat 0:4 in Levercusen, he considers Khedira.
And the sports president Horst Heldt recalled that, although one goal has been achieved in the season, the other is far away.
We're not behind the water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate at his 40th birthday even after the first home victory after three months, it was caused by weekend events that were freshly living in the form of a television interview with Mr. Jens Lehmann just before the start of the fight.
There are decisions that acting other than Jens, Heldt responded to the hard Lehmann's criticism.
He forsakes a weak leadership and decided to change the coach after the puberty of puberty fans.
Even the cancellation of his day off after the fights marked Lehmann as a sign of missing sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's words "forms pure egoism," answered Heldt and announced the consequences for the branners.
Both of the 40s will probably have no joy in their lives.
In any case, they are with each other that without the work of the coach team, it would not be possible to play so strong and fighting.
Babel and his assistants had a "great share in success," said Heldt and Lehmann in a loud - and a man with the igelite bag agrees.
Fighting World Championship in Hard Weight
Your duel in Bern: The challenger Kevin Johnson has constantly provoked the words and gestures of the Master of the World Vitalia Klička.
However, after the twelve hard wheels, the Ukrainian defended his title in the heavy weight of the boxer organisation of WBC.
The judgment of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitalij Kličko remains the master of the world in a box in heavy weight.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated on Saturday night in Bern American Kevin Johnson at the points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Click it is the third successful defense of the title after his return in October 2008.
Previously, Ukrainian was twice the master of the world of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't come to.
Click improved his balance to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice been defeated for injury.
Prosecutor Johnson was first defeated in the 24th battle.
Before about 17.000 viewers in the Bernin arena, he drove 2.02 metres high Click battle mainly with his left.
About 11 centimeters smaller Johnson, who announced the end of the Click's era before duel, was downloaded before the attacks of the master of the world, so Kličko couldn't plant a decisive strike with his dangerous right hand.
All he did is passive Johnson on the challenger a little bit and he was just trying to get into the next wheels.
Although he provoked words and gestures, his strikes but the master of the world hit only a few times.
But still, it's only the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, who fought with Click full of twelve wheels.
The challenger took care of the disturbance in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Click like "resistant zombie", which "nothing can do well."
During the respect of Friday, the champion was allowed to provoke, pull Johnson's sunglasses out of his nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Click's return
Click remained unbelievable after the fourth struggle after his return on October 11, 2008.
After a nearly four-year break then he defeated in Berlin Nigerian Samuel Peter and took back his "his" WBC belt, which he had to give up without fighting before.
This year he defeated the title of Juan Carlos Gomeze from Cuba and in September Chrise Arreola of the United States.
In this struggle, I only got one shot and physically in good shape, I justified Kličko quick return to ring.
But his dream remains the defense of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the champion of the world of the WBO and IBF organisations.
The WBA belt wears, however, Brit David Haye, after he landed from the throne of 2,13 metres high, Nikolay Vulajevo in November.
Haye denied the summer fight against Click, which was planned on September.
Accordingly, his promotional company plans a fight against Kličkov in the London Wembley Stadium.
Case Kunduz
Head of the opposition: The Chief of the Green Yurgen Trittin's fraction marked the wrong information about the afera Kunduz defence minister Guttenberg's liar.
SPD and Links (left) call for an office to make explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge of the attack on Kunduz, opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) had made a fake fraud.
The Minister for the Death Bombing of Two Cisterns in September said "with no doubt the truth," said the head of the Green Yurgen Trittin fraction in the Saturday Newsletter ARD "Tageschau".
Let's call it the usual expression: He lied.
The murder order was issued in the absence of the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the element of the report NATO read by Mr. Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it showed that the attack was not only the destruction of the car kidnapped, but the targeted murder of two Taliban leaders.
During the American attack required by the German Commander Kunduz Colonel Klein, the NATO investigation suggested that 142 people were killed or injured.
Greens, SPD and Links called on a joint Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the Spolk Hall, and also explained what Guttenberg really knew about this event.
Ms. Merkel must explain whether the strategy of targeting killing was part of the Afghan Social Snam Policy - and if the Office of Officer, Bundeswehr and the rapporteur service have approved this new strategy, the Jürgen Trittin and the colleague of the Green Renate Künast.
The government speaker Ulrich Wilhelm definitely rejected the criticism.
The Office of the Office of the Office has no effect on the placement of Bundeswehra in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also no doubts about the treatment of the Ministry of Background on the release of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both Guttenberg had been informed correctly and completely about the background of the tank attack.
It officially sounded that they had to deny the existence of NATO reports and shut the minister's sensitive details.
However, from the area of both top officials, the Ministry of Defence noted even a number of reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein and one report of the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sontagsheitung" reports that Wichert was meant to request in a letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that he has not received any answer yet.
The Ministry did not speak on Saturday and pointed out that this would be dealt with in the Committee for Investigation of the Social Charter, which will be established next Wednesday.
Worlds of dreams
Some see images in awake and hear voices that others can’t see and hear.
Not only mentally ill or drug connections have a limit between imagination and reality.
As long as it comes to sleep, everything's fine.
If we lay closed eyes in our dark room, we may be surrounded by the wildest imaginations and fantasies.
But who experiences dreams in awake, sees and hears things that others can't see and hear, mostly in the west world today is a fool or a drug addict, or at least as a freak.
However, such images and voices are not only in mentally ill or in drug connections.
The guilt has our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to propose houses, paint images, or write romans, will make sure that the borders between the dream, the imagination and the fact.
A changed state of consciousness can occur in different forms, in a better way we call them visions, in worse frauds.
Although the initialator and effect can differ, visions of the Hildegar von Bingen, drug experiences of the Prophet New-Age Carlos Castanedy, shamanishing, psychiatry and hallucinations can be removed from similar processes.
The hallucinations or visions will occur if the balance of neuronal brain transmitters is eliminated - mainly dopamin, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholin - and the interaction between the various parts of the brain is discontinued.
Complex hallucinations and fortune thoughts occur very often in schizofren psychology.
Gravity has no power over it.
The relationship between adultery and dream has been employed by philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristoteles understood the hallucinations as a form of dream in awake, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, established in 1861 a "great similarity of sliding with substances" for Sigmunda Freud was dream even "psychosis, with all nonsense, translucency, deception of senses".
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. is transforming into a comic figure.
His body is double-dimensional and screamingly colored.
The gravity has no power over it, it's rising up at the ceiling of room.
He feels a stroke.
He's behind the winged curly figures with bloody red grims, appreciating teeth.
They're chasing him, digging into him with heavy, fired shoes, throwing him on the wall, feeling pain all over the body.
Volumes, bad voices are threatened from walls and radios.
He can't stand the voices they give him and insult him anymore.
Henning T. will extract two stereo cables, take them into the seal and tie it on the clock.
He's getting on one reproductor, and he's got a pin around his neck.
He's jumping.
The pump will allow it.
Learn, the voices of the congregation screaming, "Go to the clinic and let yourself heal!"
Today Henning T. 40 years ago, experienced six acute psychiatrists, last two years ago, first almost 20 years ago.
They were launched by LSD.
His diagnosis is a schizoafect paranoic psychosis, and besides maniodepressive, taking medicines against depression, mania, schizofrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness. He's been married for three years.
I've experienced the worst fear and deepest doubts in my psychology, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality
About one percent of people are sick at least once in the life of schizofrenia, in psychiatric clinics, it is after depressions of the second most commonly treated disease.
In acute schizofrene psychiatry, they cannot distinguish mostly from the internal and external world, get into awakened condition that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusion or illusion of persecution.
Especially expanded is hearing voices - voices that command, comment or lead dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations are not unusual.
Infected is not able to distinguish important from irrespective, the brain cannot filter disruptive signals, consciousness is floating the impression.
Just like the dream opens the psychology built floating thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest sorts of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychiatry is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, top doctor Clinics of the universal psychiatric clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizofrenik is located in the center of action, everything is important to him.
At the same time, it comes into a passive role, it becomes, like in the dream, overcome by events and cannot actively form them.
Therefore, Schizofrenica often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
The comparison with reality is not mostly possible in them, the ghosts are a terrible reality, the awakening is excluded.
Once for life, hallucinations are experienced
Otherwise than in a dream, Fuchs says, "but the senseful and space structure of the fact that people perceive in psychiatry is essentially preserved."
Third thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the deviation of experience occurs in a real framework.
The scientists are still standing in front of the mystery why our brains are making such a trap.
Extraordinary states can lead to short-term loss of relationship with reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone's going to get into psychiatry.
It seems that there is genetic disposition to schizofreny, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists come from the minimal brain damage.
We believe that at the early stage of development, there will be damage to the neuronal brain eruption, such as your mother's viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery of how there is a breakdown of the neuron system that has not been shown for years.
The role also plays environmental impacts - stress or traumatic experiences can be an initiator of psychology if it is available.
The hallucinogenic drugs can also start psychology because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain cooks
It's crazy that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, swallow expensive medicines, others give money for drugs to get them, says Erich Kasten's psychology professor from Lübeck.
If we perceive transluces as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often just a question of attitude.
Kasten has collected reports of hallucinations and translucinations for the past year, interpreting his results in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (Inreal World in our head).
Although hallucination belongs to typical psychological phenomenons, but also to surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to psychic disorders such as border personality or depression, frequent diseases such as migraine, epilepsia, sclerosis or Alzheimer or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, he halucinates under certain conditions, even the brain of a healthy person himself.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of the contents of thoughts that are normally depressed.
It occurs when parts of the brain, in which sensitive senses are processed, are too active or a little depressed; if our brain cooks, or if there is no stimulation.
Drugs can start this condition as well as brain injury or psychiatry.
But also the abduction of stimulations, stress, concerns with love or other exceptional situations.
In recent studies, only one third of the hallucinations were hallucinated at least once in their life.
In summer 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Meklenburg-Front Navy and attending a high school.
Actually, it's a totally normal girl.
If there weren't any pictures and voices.
About the breaks, she may be called a colochnate with long, dark hair.
When he answers, the students look at her with a surprise - no one but her can see and hear this boy.
This creepy girl thinks a dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't eat, she knows.
He's up, he hears and sees the boy, just like he hears and sees a girl sitting next to him in the cage.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, she likes that boy.
I'm crazy? He asks sometimes.
But he knows that this boy and other transluces aren't real and he'll disappear again.
The phenomenons are more embarrassing at night
Frequently, the transfusions are burdens.
When he's sitting in class, he can't watch the teaching multiple times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just representing a new classmate, but he explains to all others in a sensitive and apparently on the mathematical equation table.
The phenomenons are more embarrassing at night.
When he waits in his dark room for a sleep that comes a little and too late, he can often distinguish whether he's up or sleeping, whether the images he sees, grimas, or a girl with bleeding cutting wounds on his hands and legs rise in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at those figures.
The parents and friends don't say anything about it, they'd think she's crazy.
It's autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She made her graduation and she lives with her boyfriend.
The hallucinations stopped a year ago.
Since Casten's psychologist contacted on the Internet, she knows exactly she didn't get mad.
Transluces are also the art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or is taken from stimulations, he'll have a great probability of hallucination, says Kasten.
I think the brain doesn't have enough work then, and it takes care of its own fun.
Sarah K., the only little girl, was afraid of other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when at 13, she learned that the man whom Dad calls from the time she thinks he's not her own father.
Because visual and acustical hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that also process real concepts and sounds, it is difficult to distinguish from each other fraud and reality. "Every experience," Casten says, "as happening in the brain, the reality is also shown there.
The hallucinations are also images that let the brain occur, so it works real."
Also, the nighttime dreams evaluates Kasten as a form of hallucination.
The hallucination of healthy people is not essentially different from hallucination in acute psychiatry.
In contrast to schizophrenics, people are mentally able to identify their frauds as unreal.
Casten therefore advises patients to evaluate hallucinations as extraordinary ability.
Border status between dream and hallucination
In our world concentrated too much on awareness, the imaginary experience is mostly patologised, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor Heidelberg and Psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic Florence-Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
Psychology is a severe, severe illness, but it also brings positive, creative - translucency is also art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied a so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of a changed consciousness for sleep.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that he considers real and can't distinguish them from awake.
The oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, such as polyradicular experience patients who are fully aware of motor sickness.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, perhaps the lasting, complete incapacity of movement, he replaces life threatening the real situation with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
The type of border status between dream and hallucination.
Because in reality there is no way to deal with a situation, there will be a change in the worlds, but the real situation will be present in the imagination.
The intense form of support for senses and conversion of senses in some insufficient situation that allows us to make our own ability to form, to move in a moment to lose consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memories
Also a historian of art Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his oneiroid experience in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue action of the soul.
He was 49 years old, after the operation of the heart chloppy with the next heart transplant, his consciousness was released on a multiple-day journey, and his body was lying on an intensive care unit.
Claussen floated into the world that he created, visited foreign times and places: It becomes an old man trapped on the bed, in a train sanatorium, the robot guards his health.
He lives in the early Middle Age between a noble that produces lumps of blood.
On the motorcycle, the Greek will take him to his country, surfs on the hospital bed in the Alps and meet the Korean mafian.
It's going to swim into the imaginary event, everything's real, even later in memories.
These internal journeys are essentially different for Claussen from any dream.
The dream is a different condition, describes its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of these mental paths have been clear after years and in unsignificant details.
Even clearer and more intense than real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other real experience, says Schmidt-Degenhard psychiatrist.
Eventually, they show the states of the oneiroid, psychiatric, hallucinations and drug links, how fragile our internal images are even in awake.
Any change in consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to deformation of what we call reality."
The reality that can also be enriching.
Snow can come.
Burda
At 27, children are to take over the carriage
The new Guide of Callen is a transitional solution: Hubert Burda wants to transmit his business into the hands of both of his children, SPIEGEL said.
Holding has to belong 100 percent to the family in the future.
Hamburg - Computer Hubert Burda has seen his business for a long time in the hands of his children.
Both children will be inherited when they are 27 and have a firm will to enter the company, says a 69-year-old SPIEGEL.
We were carefully dealing with it.
The question of whether they're also active in the company is given afterwards.
And the question is, if they're capable of it.
There is no way to put their children in the head of 7500 employees unless they are capable enough.
That would kill both the kids and the business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he was retrieving from the presidency of the branch and appointed his successor Paul-Bernhard Kallen since January.
52-year-old Kallen has been a member of Burdy's office since 1999.
He was in charge of technology first.
Subsequently, the Company added responsibility for the property of the company and after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer, the direct marketing, the Citina, Print and Finance.
For the first time, no member of the family is headed by the publisher.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Callen's name also serves to "close 10, 15 years", Burd told.
Holding should be in the future in 100 percent of the family, Burda says.
With regard to Schickedanz and Schaeffler's cases, Burda expressed that even family businesses have no certainty before the disappearance: "It has always affected companies that have been infected by the desire of capital that they speculated and thought they could become large players.
It was never my strategy.
He never had the dreams of world power, Burd says.
I don't view myself as a political preceptor of this country, like Springer, and I don't want to play a world league with "Time", these trades are too big.

Endesa and Barcelona, with an electromobile
Energy company Endesa and Barcelona's council founded 'Live Office'.
It is a project for the development and promotion of electrical vehicles in the capital of Catalonia.
Live's office (Electromobile Logistics) establishes and manages a travel plan for the establishment of electrical vehicles in the city and ensures mobility agreements, will establish, coordinate and present contributions, etc.
It will also develop the project MOVELE, promote electromobile, collect opinions and results of the activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to support this transportation of the future.
3 'electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city that is involved in the introduction of electric vehicles in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will also join the project.
It is three cities chosen by the government within the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric vehicles.
Energy company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The objective is to support research and technological development in the catalogue autonomous area.
This includes energy-related activities and energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with the participation of Endesa in promoting electromobile.
The company is represented in European normalisation teams and actively implements a number of additional projects, such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts the period of calmness in the car industry.
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, predicts that the Spanish car industry, the main export sector of the State, is waiting for a "climate period".
In the 2009 economic report of the President of the Government, Zapatero summarized the measures introduced during the year to support the car sector.
"Without the Competitive Plan for the Automotive Industries, we would be in the face of the state of desertivity today, closing up some of our main production businesses," the government's chairman stated.
"By this plan and the wish of individual marks to continue to work in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of peace in this industry, which is our main export sector, is expected to be futurely," he added.
In this regard, it stressed that the competition plan, which forms a part of the Integrated Automotive Industry Plan (PIA), set 800 million for projects of 19 producers and 137 subsidiary companies that mobilized the investment exceeding 3 billion euros.
The President of the Government explained that this investment is intended to develop new models, to modernise production and existing processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government measures for support and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is applied in collaboration with autonomous areas and car marks.
According to the president's statement, this plan has reduced the average emissions by 6% in new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and ensured a significant increase in the records, in particular in November by "40 per cent".
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first International Hall of Classic Vehicles will be opened, which is the space for meeting professionals and amateurs from the world of motorcycles.
This initiative will take place on 5-7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilón of Madrid Casa de Campo.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Conservation of sports style
The Mazda is going to show that discernment to the environment has no negative impact on the sports style.
And therefore Mazda3 has also a built-in stop and engine start system - baptized also as-Stop-, which is a device that is currently available only with a gasoline engine 2.0 150 horses.
This second generation Mazda3 is characterized by good characteristics that it has achieved as a whole.
Physical adjustment, vehicle implementation, population, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent in Mazda3.
The front seats of the driver's seats have excellent ergonomy and are greatly fixed.
The volunteer is also extremely gentle.
Using the tools and console composition, we conclude that Mazda continues to develop a futurist design with many buttons and drivers and a significant red and blue color.
This style partially reminds us of the style that also presents Honda Civic.
So we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are contrary to the soberness of German products and, in particular, more sVolkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to defeat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who wish a very comfortable ride.
Furthermore, a large baggage area and regular forms should be mentioned.
The automatic stop and engine starting system is currently available only with a gasoline engine on two litres and 150 horse forces assistence hand transfer.
This engine is a real flavor. It is very gentle, marked with a lower noise level, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most desirable Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not find so many miles a year should not exclude this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, as it marks a greater comfort in riding and reduced consumption.
With regard to equipment, the version selected for testing is named Sportive and includes more serial elements.
For serial equipment, it is necessary to mention primarily the tracking system (RVM), which prevents the creation of a dead angle, control of track and stability, speed control, internal mirror sensitive to light, aboard computer with a large screen, parking sensor, separate air conditioning, rain sensor and light, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and wheels of 17-inch.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped with Pack Premium, for a supplement of 1.500 euros: adaptable lights of twoxenone and sound system BOSE with CD holder, except for other parts.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compatible cars of its category.
It shall be designated primarily by the quality of the materials used, by its operation and the high level of equipment.
Furthermore, people who do not find more miles per year can choose this i-Stop version, which is only with gasoline engine2.0 and 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is his higher price, which is 21.770 euros for Luxury and 23.270 euros in the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price, Mazda3 offers us a great dose of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Premiera'
L.A. has a red carpet, gentle like hands of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
Stars shine more than ever in new elegant and sexy models of the Nine mark.
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose dark 'lady'.
FonPeek Promised
The peek is extremely limited, it only serves to view the mail, without the possibility of viewing a certain type of attachments or surfing on the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of glory in the United States when Time magazine appreciated it as one of the products of the year.
Seeing him outside is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is marked by a very low price and monthly payments, less than a half amount applicable for example for the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began to offer two new devices: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the second on the basis of permanently provided free data service, but it is necessary to pay a six-fold amount for Peek.
FonPeek, who was presented yesterday on Le Web action, is a European version of invention and at the same time his third transformation.
It is limited as well as his American prostate, but it brings surprises.
The monthly price for maintenance is approximately 12 euros per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People traveling with smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing borders or to look for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection) so that they can check their mails.
The contingency with a solid price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but according to my experience, a doctorate from physics would need to understand them and very good glasses to read the miniature letters.
The European Commission constantly requires to reduce roaming tariffs so that they are accessible to the whole Europe, which still does not have a broken effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that a device like FonPeek (it is interesting that it still has the name Fon if it does not have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that the operators start thinking differently and consider different offers to compensate their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offers downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and applied when purchased, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect that once in the case of PhonPeek, this is the possibility of buying a permanent approach such as Peek has already been introduced in the United States.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm checking my mail on the phone, thanks.
I'm expecting it, because I think it's the best type from the consumer's perspective.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used in the computer.
The color Michelle loves
The yellow is certainly the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
For Barack Obama to be President of the United States, she chose dresses and coats in this color, she also chose the same color when she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: the transfer of the Nobel Peace Price in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: except that it is similar color - yellow green with brightness effects - in both cases, it was a classified set - dress, bag and coat from the same substance - decorated with a large elevation or slipper.
At first, it seemed that the first lady of the United States decided to go in the tracks of the Astury princess and wear similar clothes.
The suit from which the clothing is made makes both models very different.
In the event of the entry into the function, Michelle used a large stretch in Oslo Sumette with pressure.
Changes also supplements: green shoes with medium high heels, now similar model, but in gold color.
It also wears various hairs: this time the drddol, previously dissolved hair.
75% of the mothers working have work problems with motherhood.
Discrimination in employment has increased over the past years, especially in women of younger ages who are going to acquire a child.
This is the result of the study “Plodity and work career of Spanish women” that CSIC conducted in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
Study attended 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 years and results are clear: 75% of mother workers have limited opportunities on the labour market due to maternity.
The study emphasizes that at the beginning of partnership, there are many differences in the views of the number of children according to whether they work or not, as well as the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside their homes work for partial jobs or have no stable jobs, start living with a partner earlier, sooner they have the first child and have more children in general.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partnerships and motherhood are delaying and have less descendants.
"Women from 35 to 49 years of age with stable employment have the first child in the average 3.7 years since the start of partnership. This number is 4.1 in the case of women who have committed most of their life and therefore had to postpone partnership and children's arrival.
The job type also has a strong impact on maternity, even though a smaller impact on the start of partnership," explains Margarita Delgado, who is committed to research in CSIC.
Another factor that affects women’s age at the time of the marriage of the child’s birth is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the degree of education is, the higher is the age of women who marry and have their first child.
The differences are also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the age of 35 to 49, women with basic and higher education have borne their first child at age 25.1, denied 32.1.
"There is another difference between women depending on their degree of education.
Women with basic education are married and borne the first child before they find stable jobs, while women with high or medium education are proceeding in opposite ways to get stable jobs before marriage and birth of the first child," Delgado states.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oreal Paris just added a new name to her prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
Since the next year, the German actress will become the face of different products of this mark under the universal password 'Because I'm worth it.'
The representative of 'Joyeux Noil', one of the most elegant actress of the international level, is added to another famous personality L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
She's already joined this selected actor's club Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Millioner from the chamber').
The male part of this cosmetic mark is also represented by significant characters:Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's anatomy) and Matthew Fox (Evangelina partner in 'Lost').
Prices of British Mode
The British have a lot to talk about fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, earlier and present - met at the annual transfer of prices that were carried out in London, on Royal Court of Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen by the best model of the year.
Poker Manuel Vicenta
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Esov poker' (Alfaguara, illustration Fernando Vicente) thirty X-rays of writers whom he met in his literary life (and in some cases even in the usual life).
It does not do so in feared and predictable genres (biographic similarity, life, and work), but seeks something like a core of creative personality.
The road brings excitement and Vicent does not save the benefits or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reader’s benefit, even in repeated reading.
I'm putting some observations here.
About Albert Camus: "I found on the pages of this book that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, just like what I feel, but it can't be named: the benefit of anti-justice, the moral without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "The Nihilist, butgorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not intellect, something between power and ignorance, with a blind poetical humor, without sense, as if it was a knife of a knife that almost killed him."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been familiar with passion for this woman for all thirteen years, adultery, delight and pity, which is a spiritual privilege to reach the sky by the way of damnation."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssea issued in Paris in 1922 Sylvia Beach, which is one of the eight-month tops in universal literature, which must be overcome from the northern side, from which the best mountains often destroy."
About William Faulkner, "It was a strange man.
He said himself that he was an inheritant of the County, and sometimes he was the son of a black crocodile.
In both cases, it was a great dream."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught a confused scream on the bridge of this man from Mnich to bring his remarks to the night of the 20th century in his literary form, runing from himself and calling for the future and speaking to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker, "One day she kneed and prayed, "Oh, my dear, let me stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "In his grave, Spencer's verse was scratched: 'The dream will come after the storm, a peaceful port,/after the war of rest,/ after a full life's death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "He also took his depression in his trunks.
The husband fully agreed to tell him that Eduard VII was watching her between asals or that birds sang Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic, whose literary talent goes in hand with madness."
About Peo Baroya: "What else was Martin Santos than to focus Joyce on Baroy?
What else was Bennett but let Baroa fix Faulkner's weapon?
What else was it to the Cel but to make a famous punishment for the glory of the man?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my 70 - year - old mother went through our neighborhood, in the Fuenlabrada district, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 years passed the surroundings and our dog, a rescued circle with a weight of at least six pounds, doubled and severely wounded.
Our anger is that we see nothing fun in such aggression against a small and unprotected animal that was also on the lead.
And to that end, the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she struggled with these individuals, she began to worry about her own safety, because such a devil, who attacks a animal, is able to do the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man or anyone who is weaker than he himself.
It happened at 5:00 p.m., Tuesday, usually a quiet quarter.
The dog cryed all day.
Of course, we filed a complaint on the nearest commissionership, but we doubt that it was something, and not to raise noble questions, we find that these coward killers were Spanish nations.
The distress made us notify this fact.
We do not understand what happens to youths today when they have fun with a lifeless animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don't understand where the right discipline, respect for animals and people fell.
Michelin and Fesvial together for use of helme
The manufacturer of tyres Michelin in collaboration with the Spanish Transport Safety Fund (Fesvial) has launched a campaign to support the use of helms, especially in the younger motorists, as both of these entities informed today.
The purpose of this initiative is to emphasize the importance of the use of a helmet, as it is the only means to avoid injury to the head in case of death in case of a motorcycle accident.
The company Michelin states that this campaign constitutes a part of their commitments to transport security, which "seems more than to propose and produce even safer products" and confirms that it is trying to fulfil this purpose in other ways as a form of instruction and information campaign.
This new campaign to support the use of a helmet on the motorcycle, under the password 'To be or not to be', is the first phase where more than 500 motorcycles repaired will be placed to reach the awareness of the most public.
Finally, Michelin noted that transport security "is a constant problem" of this company, which is the manufacturer of tyres for bicycle vehicles, and its main purpose is continuous increase in product safety.
Sales of light use vehicles are increased
Almost two years later, the market of light use vehicles begins to be remembered.
All 9.425 vehicles recorded in November in Spain meant an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and more than the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to numerous data, the patronate organisation of producers of Anfac and Ganvam.
However, the favourable figure is better to put in the quarantine, since November 2008 is a significantly bad time for comparison and meant 60% reduction in comparison with the previous year.
As a result, regardless of the increase in the last month, the total number of vehicles reported in the past 11 months is 40% less than in the previous accounting year.
Since January, it was sold 95.853 vehicles, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of light use vehicles: derivatives of personal cars, pick ups, supplies, smaller trucks and light trucks/transports.
And the clouds that are most damaged by demand, even when private persons were purchased, most of the shoppings were carried out by smaller and medium-sized companies, and 100% of cases were financed through third parties.
Other factors such as stoping or continuing the bad economic situation should be added to restrictions resulting from the closing of banking loans.
In this situation, unlike personal cars, the shopping support of 2000E did not help too much.
In addition to private persons, it is necessary to mention the irrigators on the animal sheet of small and medium companies who are going to buy a light use car up to 3.5 tonnes of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per mile, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvam, they reiterated the need to pay special attention to the management of these vehicles, as well as to industrial cars (cars and buses).
The Sales Association assumes that in 2010 development will be similar as last year and according to the calculations, sales in private cars and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The help system on the hand brake is already mandatory equipment.
As in the case of the ABS anti-blocking system, this will also be the management of the ESP, the helping systems of the hand brake, all of this will become a mandatory equipment for European vehicles.
In fact, it is already part of the compulsory equipment of all newly registered personal vehicles and light use vehicles, while the term for the removal of deficiency is established in others, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aims to increase the protection of walkers, and it works so that it can help prevent many crashes.
The hand brake system increases the brake pressure in an emergency, which the system finds out after the driver breaks down.
But it can't always keep this pressure until the end.
According to the study carried out by Bosch car manufacturer, a third of the drivers with accidents did not break the brake before the crash, and half of them did not use the brake power.
Until 1.100 accidents
On the contrary, this aid requires the maximum braking system, reducing the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1,100 death accidents related to walkers would be avoided annually.
The reduction of this number will be even more markant by calculations would prevent one of the four accidents with an impact on the introduction of so-called intelligent braking systems.
In this case, the vehicles will be equipped with a system that (aids to the radar or cameras) captures obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for the light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help him increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even if the crash cannot be prevented, the device will affect the brake as much as possible and reduce the risk of minimal damage.
General Motors defers the Opel plan until January
Nick Reilly, a new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, employees of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza), that the production of new Merivo will be started in the first week of April - probably on April 8th - as informed by Javier Ortega, the US producer notes that it will take more time to fulfil the Renewal Plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, a new president of GM Europe, is trying to make each point of the plan first agree with the party concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to employees and then to the governments of individual countries in which the production races are situated, will be issued at the beginning of 2010.
On the contrary, the GM ensures that Saab’s sales decision should be adopted in these days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the US producer to make a decision as soon as possible.
The GM provides contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wishes to obtain Volvo, but considers the possibility of the Dutch producer of Skyper sports cars that operates under the protection of the Russian Converg Group.
In case there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some assets of the Chinese Baic company Saab.
It continues to be decided to close Saab in the end of the year unless it is succeeded in its sale.
Carriage with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this brilliant model, Porsche engineers used Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce weight by 80 kg, thus showing weight only 1.275 kg.
On the basis of, first, the automatic downloading roof was paid with manual control, which has also contributed to reducing weight by 21 kg; the aluminium doors such as GT3, which were used by another 15 kg less; air conditioning, 13; the reduction of fuel tanks from 64 to 54 liters also contributed to weight reduction by 7 kg; after the installation of the sport seats of another 12 kg, thanks to the 19 palc wheels more than five kilograms.
And eventually, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less and replacement of door captures with textile captures means another kilogram.
It is also offered with a two-stage PDK transfer, one vehicle was tested with a hand-reduced six-step speedbox, especially on the roads of the second class in California, on mountain segments with many complicated scrolls.
His behaviour can only be qualified as intact.
The weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle to asfalte is not printed.
Rather, we haven't been testing so small and light model for a long time, which would also carry such security when moving in the turn, even at high speeds.
It's a small athlete able to warm the muscles at a short ride for a long time until we order him sprint, braking, and renewing the use of the engine...
Anything we want, thanks to the direction that's as communicative as precise, whatever we show hands on the wheel is what the car does.
And it'll do with surgical precision.
Engine sound according to will
The V6 boxer sound, with 320 horses (in 10 more than Boxster S) is a very gift and can be strengthened by the option 'sport' and by the system that modifies the engine sound that has already been used in Panamera.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, whether or not while sucking or recovering.
The curtains are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The Asfalt roads we're driving with Boxster Spyder was pretty ruined, but the car managed well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; and in some turns, we ran into the dawn at the hatred and squirrels even in the advanced morning.
Definitely this ultra-free car is one of the most fun in the market, because it's more than just a modification of Boxster S.
The car will be entered in the sale in February 2010 at the price of 70.831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
A girlfriend Karla Lagerfeld, a series icon of Coco Cocoon and occasional 'starlette' on the show of 'company', a singer presents her face of a bad girl as well as her own Chanel purse.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Basconia has won Israel’s victory
The work treasury won the brilliant victory in 82-91 at the complicated Maccabi Electra field, despite the numerous absences in Duska Ivanovica, and thus came to the head of her group after the great performance of the Peace of Teletovica, which with eight three-pointed points was announced by the best in the company (29 ratings).
Vitoria has been able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertase or Mic's large dose of planting and collective work, even though it had to suffer until the end to win.
Furthermore, the large accuracy of the circle with the 16 three-points had a great deal of participating in the final triumph.
The fight began with the front for the blue ones who have arrived at the mark from the beginning.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance, it already suggested that they attacked the Israeli community very hardly.
English and Teletovic belonged to the main shooter 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alavian company decided for Baraca's internal game and the work of Eliyah, which was adopted by swinging and applause when returning to its original work, to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
The Teletovic has already started to be the best in his 13-point company, although 'without six' at Splitter''' assessment, it has already suggested that it will not be the best evening for Brazilians.
But even though the struggle was sharp until the rest, it was not decided in the least, and the Makabean wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone wins on their field, and they were able to win with Elias' hand.
Eidson and Pnini certainly contributed to returning the yellows (50-49).
More inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, injuries, but not dead, needed a few exact games to get their breath, and there appeared the Mirza Teletovic tower, which was three three-three after and with English and Ribase returned the score to a calming number (54-67), which reached the local at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaba’s skin was shaded in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to lose their earned results for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their men, did not give up and try to keep the company alive from a line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and Splitter excluded by faul SeIvanovic, they did not properly defend and even though the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the battle had a Tel Aviv lost the first time in the season.
Injury prevents the Union from fighting
The Union has lost significantly in Greece with Olympiacos and left him the leadership of the B Group in Eurolise in the struggle, which was marked by three attacks by Unicai, but mostly the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
Malagy’s company did not surround the environment of Pavilon’s peace and friendship or competitiveness, perhaps one of the sicker in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusans to dream. Aggressive defense and three three points, two thanks to Omar Cooku and one Guillem Rubia, brightened the field s12-18, minutes 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by intensityUnicaja , although the arsenal of locals in the internal game with Bourousise, Uncle and Schortsanitism, turned the score 22-20, minutes 13, which was the moment the battle between the resistances between USBeverley and Williams meant excluding both players.
The Greek company started working and proved its advantage in both zones where the absence of English beer due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal errors of Carlos Jimenez have been burdened by the Unicaja company
Between the internal players and the Lithuanian wing of Linas Kleizas, they increased the advantage of 44-32, a minute 19.
Impossible remedies
The third part was very attacking by the Olympiacos, who, despite losing 19, demonstrated the advantage and even managed to compare the difference from the Malez Malaga 66-48, a minute 27, which was shaken by the leadership of the group.
The Unition tried to overcome the absence and the last absence of the Scottish beer, Robert Archibald, who was injured at the last match.
Despite all the unsuitableness of the Unicia through the leadership and the three Cook and Lewis's contribution left some hope n victory 66-57, a minute 31.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos by strengthening and overwhelming in centimetrs in his zone proved unstoppable.
The Croatian beer Nikola Vajcic, was able to equip the average 81-62, a minute 37, and the Unica screwed up and passed the lead of Olympiacos.

The British programmer takes 45.226 euros rough annually and French 31.059, while Spain gets 24.000.
The driver also has 34.247 euros of pure annually in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 in Spain.

The most demanded network jobs in the last three months are driver, half-time employee and social worker.
Brazil set Zelay's departure date
The Brazilian government set out the time limit for the end of Manuel Zelayi at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The meeting president must leave the diplomatic mission not later than 27 January 2010, when his mandate is officially completed.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d’affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in the Hondura capital, confirmed for TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he has to leave the embassy from that date, where he is hiding since September 21th.
"He is aware that on January 27th, after the end of his mandate, he must leave and look for another shelter."
The station also quoted a former state who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the protection of the Brazilian government," Zelaya telephoned.
After the elections on 29 November (when Porfirio Lobo was elected) Zelaya assured that he remained on the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to get a refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually lost, because Zelaya rejected the condition of a political asylum, which the government tried to put on him "de facto", which was President of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After the days of wine and roses since the last spring, when the inflation of assets represented the prevailing mood on the markets, there has been renewed uncertainty on the markets, which should not be surprised because it is already a natural situation in the environment where the operators are taking decisions on the future that is uncertain about themselves.
The medicinal product used by central market stabilisation banks was a direct purchase of assets and an immediate release of liquidity in the nearer zero course so that the financial institutions could buy assets to subtract.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have already been practically completed and without questioning their non-natural liquidity policy, they start throwing a little sand into the colleague, as the Spanish Central Bank did with their auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such a heterox measure, and we are participating in the return to the reduction of risk profits.
The movement of the storm and the differences in the communities regained points, although they are still very distant to the unnormal levels that have reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize the private risk, which has again affected public debt.
Once again, the US, Japan and Germany have become a shelter of selected investors, which has expanded the diversification of the euro zone countries against Germany.
Spain was almost affected by this unstableness, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the qualifications of the Spanish Kingdom.
On the other hand, certain uncertainty is not useful for the silence of moral risk players who have tried to reload the conscience of persons responsible for the world's economic policy in order to prevent destructive consequences of impairing employment loans when a new day of thanks is actually necessary.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal fight between emirates for renewal of power in emirates, and with regard to Greece, we have seen this before.
The government that covers deficits, elections and the new government is coming.
He sold it in Italy after Berlusconim and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It doesn't make sense that Ecofin save Hungary from non-compliance with foreign payments in the beginning of the year and to allow the euro member state not to fulfil its obligations.
But what makes sense is that Ecofin forces the Greek government to transparency and commitment its own citizens to joint responsibility in the need of extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are before the period of normalisation of the premiums from the transitional risk, after some excess in supported positions, they would be within the expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt differences will increase as well as the debts of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If the European differences are reduced and ours will continue to expand, it would be a typically Spanish risk.
The importance of Standard & Poor's is only an anecdote. When our front indicators force most studies to take over their renewable scenario and revise their script for 2011, including OCDE and the European Commission to return to the Japanese scenario, it is not aware of the great hope of experience of the fulfilment of this warning.
Again, it looks like it'll be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, though for now, "see carefully, buddy driver."

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sanchez Galan first intervened yesterday before the subcommittee of the Parliament, where the energy strategy of Spain is discussed in the next two decades.
After his intervention, following the presentation of President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villasecy, Galan provided several notes on the proposal submitted to the subcommission behind the closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of 50,000 million euros until 2020 and another 60,000 million from this date to 2030, if nuclear power plants are currently in operation.
If it did not, the investment would be necessary for 60,000 million, but up to 95.000 million.
Iberdrola really believes that in the next decade investments must be focused not on increasing production capacity, but on distributing networks and international connections.
Since 2020 the issue has been changed and will need to increase its performance.
Its offer focuses on gas and carbon power plants with coal oxide capture mechanisms and, in particular, on renewable energy.
In this case, he believes that new 18,000 MWs are needed, however, with other "sustainable energy".
Gallan, who believes that the bill of the Sustainable Economy Act, which the government has just approved, corresponds to the line he demanded, did not want to release a vial as a royal decree to support the consumption of national coal, which opposes the policy against climate change.
According to his opinion, "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "precise" measures, as President Iberdrola called them.
Whatever it is, Galan believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must be taken now, because their maturity takes place and is necessary a stable tax framework for their starting.
Ferrovial won 'handling' Aer Lingus at ten airports
The daughter Ferrovial for airport services, Swiss Swissport, will play the role of the preferential partner of the Irish Airlines Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels belongs to the most important of them.
The agreement from which the economic terms have not yet come is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Castilia-La Mancha and University at Alcala de Henares signed yesterday a protocol on cooperation to create the Centre for Intelligent Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructure
The Association assumes the investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% is Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be the energy efficiency research on roads and airports.
Acciona is trying to reach its first road in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
The Actiona fights for its first concession on the road in Australia, which is a market where he already works as an energy and water economy.
The building is estimated by 1,700 million dollars (approximately 1.047 million euros).
Her rivals are the French Bouygues and German Hochtief.
The tunnel long 5 km in the Australian city of Brisbane on the eastern coast became the closest opportunity to settle in this country as a construction and concession road company.
The Council wishes to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After selecting public-private cooperation (PPP according to the English initiative) for further development of the project in the commercial plan protected by Erns & Young, the administration has already a final list of candidates for the implementation of the construction and operation of the mine.
The offers are expected to be submitted in May, and the expected investment will reach $1,700 million of Australian dollars (EUR 1.047 million) and in the last stage three contests with significant presence in European buildings.
The group named Transcity leads Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, and the second with the headquarters in Italy is one of the biggest European specialists for subworld buildings.
Acciona is in the Northern Direct game with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French Buygues construction group.
The third and last concern that went through the network has the name of LBRJV and is part of the Australian capital Leighton (the daughter of the company of the German Building company Hochtief, here represented by ACS), also the local Baulderstone (the ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and a significant company specialized for the Civil Buildings.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large buildings and privatisation, but it brings with it a clear difficulty of entering in other ways than medium-sized acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy of the mentioned Hochtief or Bilfinger is still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector, except for the Asian references.
ACS has obtained a market position through its 30% share in Hochtief, the owner of the quoted Leighton.
Million assets
The Acciona is betting on the geographical area with the greatest importance for the sector where it has already a significant presence through its energy supplier activities and in the desolvement trade.
In addition, other assets have the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and runs a group of businesses that build and manage the Adelaide desolve facilities with the budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and to use common energy to enter the construction and operation of infrastructure areas.
The underground road under the mine, whose promotor is the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office, named Northern Link (North Link), should connect the Western road from Toowong with the district route in Kelvin Grove (see map) within 5 km of the tunnel. This is the biggest action to reduce the transport burden of Brisbane.
The calendar set out by local administration plans the mission for the summer 2010 and starts work for December next year.
Although this payment passage would be opened in the last months of 2014, the complete completion of the work is planned until 2016.
The tunnel started designing in 2005.
It will contain two streams in each direction, an electronic mine system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its finance.
Brisbane already offered this procurement Hochtief
Australia still brings a significant profit, since she announced a contract with the government estimated at 154 million yesterday.
The ACS partial shall operate through its local branches Leighton infrastructure of the national network of a wide zone with a cable from an optical fibre.
This situation will allow a rapid internet access to 400,000 people and provide the German company's work for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the tower building project King George on 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Building work was only about to start and Hochtief closed sales for 129 million.
In Britain, in particular in Manchester, will participate with Laing O'Rourke in building and operating two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC was allocated to a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has obtained the construction of a tunnel length of 2.1 km for a highway in Slovenia of 64.5 million euros through its Alpine branch office.
The company obtained a contract for a few days after the work done to expand the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
This way Alpine strengthens its experience in building tunnels.
The start of work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and the time limit for implementation is 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore got a Renfe advertisement
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services to Sra. Rushmore for an approximately three million euros per year, informed the railway company.
The Treaty contains the possibility of prolonging 12 months each year. Sra. Rushmore was chosen among 16 agencies who were represented in the Renfe competitive competition, from which four of them went to the final, including TBWA , which was responsible for the creation of advertising in the last three years.

Punishment 63 million proFrance Télécom for braking competition
The French Competition Regulatory Authority filed a penalty of 63 million euros LFrance Télécom for counter-competitive conduct in the Caribbean areas belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited the competition of firm and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programmes to the consumer on the edge of the regulation.
This sanction, the former French monopoly and still acquired more than 560 million euros since 1994 for impeding its competitors.
The penalty stored yesterday was de facto raised, because the competitive authority believes France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past, and therefore a reverse.
Business with applications
On the other hand, the French company's mobile branch is still a star among other operators and has opened the Internet applications trade in order to increase revenues that will not come from voice transfers.
From the beginning, orange applications will be active in France and Great Britain.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries like Spain.
Playing in the Champions Lia has brought 476,4 million from the beginning of Madrid and Barçe
The League of Masters has become a source of income for these clubs since its creation in 1992.
Until Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476,4 million since then, which is the third and fifth most profit club in the competition.
The paper leads Manchester United.
The paper leads Manchester United.
Wining the League of Masters of EUFA does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for large clubs.
Until that the competition divided 5.362,5 million euros between 105 companies (of which 12 Spanish), which participated from the beginning of the 1992/1993 tournament, according to EUFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona went out of this division very well.
The White Club was the third on the continent with the most money he gained for participation, and the only one with the AC Milan who won the main price three times.
The Catalan contemporary champion and the last winner of the fallen European cup in 1992 is in the fifth classification.
The list is managed by Manchester United and Monchow Bayern, two companys that also charged the most money for the participation in the last Lisa of Masters.
And yet, she's both lost Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is a third country that has obtained the most money through Champions, although it has obtained the most titles of all (fifth to four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This seeming paradox is explained by a complex method of dividing the money used by EUFA.
In this accounting year, the authority President Michel Platini plans to earn 1.090 million for the Championship League.
The EUFA is devoted to 413,1 million for solid payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the preliminary classification circle (except athletic Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Furthermore, those who have been involved received 3,8 million for their presence only, except another 550,000 euros for each match they participated.
There is also a premium for winning (800,000 euros) and a remisis (400,000 for each company). Osmifinalists get three million each; eight quarterfinalists 3,3 million.
Each of the last four gets four million.
She's a champion of nine million, while the second finalist is 5.2 million.
This is how the club will earn at least 7.1 million and at least 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça won 2,5 million for winning in the European Superpower in August.
Furthermore, there are moving payments for which 337.8 million are intended.
These money shall be divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main places and has four seats.
Last year the champion gets 40% of allocated money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% Sos
The Group of Nueva Rumasa published yesterday the details of the purchase of stocks, with which it is intended to obtain a top place between 25% and 29.9% of the Sos capital.
This percentage does not oblige the public offer for acquisition (optional) of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros for a share that would be paid in ten years and which would pay the interest for this deferral1% annually.
Last night, the Sos shares ended the trade of 1,85 euros; therefore, Nueva Rumasa's offer evaluates the company by 18% below the market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is provided by appointing eight of 15 members of the Council.
The Jerezian Group provides a period of 15 days to notify the shareholders their interest in the sale.
The CNMV declared that it was not informed of the offer, although Ruiz Mateose confirmed that it had connected with the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalisation of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, the sauce continues to change the structure of its leadership.
As an attempt to endure on the edge of possible offers for buying and compensating the judicial proceedings of his former leaders, Jesus' brothers and Jaime Salazars, the election of Maria Luisy Jord was announced as the leader of the internal audit.
This decision is made of the first woman who has highly functioned in the food company.
It's about a newly created place that will be directly subject to the president of the group.
And it is not excluded from a dispute, since the company is still underway in the legal battle on the alleged movement of more than 230 million from the Sos of the Salazar brothers.
De facto cannot be scratched for the possibility that the Sos will reveal new transfers of funds in the next months
As regards the loan of Salazars, the former members of the Ildefonso Ortega Council and angel Fernandez Noriega (protectors of CCM and Unicaja) reaffirmed the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV allows Paternina's exclusion option that Inversor Mer participated
The National Commission for the Market of Pricing Papers (CNMV) granted yesterday an exclusion attended by Inversor Mer against Federicu Paterninov on October 9.
The supervisory authority explained that it permits this operation because it understands that its conditions comply with the applicable standards and believes that "sufficient" is the content of the explanation of the brochures submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer is aimed at acquiring 550.008 shares of Federica Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of the company's capital formed by 6.142.786 shares accepted to trade in markets in Madrid and Bilbau.
Furthermore, he explained that 5.592.778 million shares were disrupted, which would not be able to be transmitted in no way until the offer was concluded, which indicated that the price was fixed by Federice Paternina under the provisions of the applicable standards.
New car assessment tools
In these days, storms and accidents don't just make autoservices.
Every day, thousands of cars who have suffered a insurance event are dragged to the service where an expert must estimate damage and repair costs.
No insurance event is the same and the calculation of the costs of works and the working time may be a long and complex work.
Calculate manually the costs of repair from 20,000 to 30,000 euros, including parts and forces, may take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools would be a matter of minutes
That's why almost 100% of the experts use this type of system.
The suppliers of services and solutions for the assessment of insurance events and maintenance shall be devoted to the collection of information provided by the manufacturers to develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the US Group of Solera is the leading company; 80% of the evaluation is carried out with its products.
Other companies that compete in the fields of evaluation tools and processing information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velazqueza, business director Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers and each of them provides information in another format.
Furthermore, the number of data for processing continues to grow, since more versions, options and engine solutions have been given in the past five years than in the previous 15 years.
Once a new vehicle enters the market, these businesses will start working.
It's a very hot job, because each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle must be catalogized and set its price.
Furthermore, in each model, there is a "intelligent" graphical processing", where it is possible to "push" individual parts of tourist cars.
With regard to the model with massive sales, work can be complete in a week if the process is very fast.
With regard to a minority car, it may take three or four months. At present Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models that they have information are Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
They're over 99% about the ride park in the circuit.
Audatex has eight centres divided around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them is specialized for specific marks.
The National House is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than 100 techniques (normally mechanical experts) working along with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month 2,5 million data are classified and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this enormous flow of information allows businesses to make different uses and delivery of different products.
The most frequent use is focused on repairs and maintenance, but, according to individual countries, there are also tools for the management of replacement parts or for the calculation of the sales value of the car.
The only company available to the guide who informs the value of the vehicles used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex is not offering in our country, but in the United States, yes.
With a view to the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to obtain the support that professionals can use in the sector.
This company offers ten different devices, and the star product is AudaPlus, a standard solution to the assessment of insurance events designed for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the costs of the parts, the time for repairs estimated by the manufacturer or the fertile.
This instrument shall apply according to the application for each evaluation.
The highest price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it less than ten times per month.
Then every insurance that performs thousands of estimates will negotiate its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow the complete identification of the vehicle and the device with which it came from the mounting line only on the basis of the first number of the carriage.
AudaGlass focuses on the vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows vehicles to be eliminated with a total insurance event.
His statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, geodemographic analysis or detection of deviations according to marks or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many model marks have passed through the service because of the crash or how serious insurance events suffered during a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company that is devoted to the development of this type of tools.
In addition, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of manufacturer.
Gt Motive is the company of the Eins Group established in 1971 as the provider of services and the management of damages, crashes or maintenance of cars
Gt Guia assessment is its reference historic product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in services, 3.100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The volume increased by 20% per year in the last three years, and in 2008 it accounted for 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization of the office installation in Paris.
Audatex was created in Germany in 1966, and in 1979 she was acquired in Spain.
According to the company's sources, 62% of her brother forms in Europe and 38% in North and South America. He works with 900 insurance and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
The World Factory of Soler Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Information ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company earns 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Soler Group was at $1,000 million bureau and now its shares are estimated to total value of $2,400 million.
Since 2007 it has been catalysed on the New York Bureau and is included in the standard & Poor's reference index.
Internet auction of distorted vehicles
Last October, she bought the Autoonline, the Internet database for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after the insurance event.
The operation assumed the inclusion of 59.5 million euros from 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended next year by 15% remaining.
The goal of the purchase was to provide more services with added value to customers with the possibility of access to the huge international market.
This estimation and purchase and sale service is guaranteed exclusively to professionals in the sector such as insurance, experts, borrowers, services, selling replacement works and professional sellers who must be registered before the start of operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and managed more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey are emerging among the main markets.
The Web currently has more than 1.500 registered sellers and 4.000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily advertisings and at the Spanish market approximately 100 new advertisings are added every day.
According to the Spanish law, the car whose vehicle number has been deleted cannot be returned to operation, but can be used as a source of replacement parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may have allowed operation, although they were dismissed, after preliminary procedure.
Budget of service in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Auda-Taller company guarantees that the user gets the budget only in four steps: identification of the vehicle, searching for the replacement work, creating the budget for budgeting.
The easyness of use is a key condition for these systems, in particular for the persuasion of professionals of higher ages, who are delayed in the use of new management techniques.
The database contains 1.034 vehicles, of which tourist 666, 109 territorial, 137 motorcycles, 78 deliveries and 44 trucks.
Naturally, the Internet connection computer needs to be used.
After identification of the model to be fixed, using the number of the cartridge, a real graphical display of the model appears and then the required replacement part is selected.
The user may include variables as the cost of working force, payments or discounts, and then print and transfer to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference directory.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is oriented on the service and does not include the estimates of workforce.
The costs of the use of this workshop tool are 350 euros per year which the customer can finance.
The Audatex is currently working to make this view three-dimensional.
This is the innovation that the mechanics are welcomed because they will allow for example to choose a door and turn it around to show the internal side.
