The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned that they look like muppets
Part of the members of the Assembly are amazed by their invitation to change to the CHUP (the members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal is provoked by plans to change the name of the Wales Parliament Assembly.
The members of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this could be a reason for laughing.
One of the layberists stated that his group was worried because the new name was "rome with the Tup and Udeb".
For readers outside Wells: In welsh this is definitely offensive.
According to one of the members of the Party Plaid, the entire group "is not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
The representative of the U.S. Conservative Party pointed out that his group "is not prejudiced" to the change of the name, but notes that the new name of the HWP (English - MWP) has a certain wordlike with "mupette".
In this context, the welsh letter W is pronounced like the English yorkshire phrase of U.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drawing up the black draft law to change the name, made the following statement: “The final decision for all the descriptive names called members of the Assembly will, of course, belong to the members of the Assembly itself.”
The Wales government law of 2017 gave the Wales' Assembly the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public interrogation on the proposals by which the Assembly has established broad support to start calling “Parlament of Wells”.
As far as its members' duties, the Commission prefers "members of the Wells Parliament, shortly the CHP, but the option "CHUP" has received the greatest support after the interrogation of the society.
The members of the Assembly offer alternative options, but reaching consensus will clearly be the headache for President Elyn Jones, which is expected to submit the black to the change bill within a few weeks.
The reformative law will include other changes in the way of the Assembly work, including the rules for discvalification of its members, as well as the design of the commission system itself.
The members of the Assembly will have the final vote on how they will be called when they reach the discussion of the draft law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum whether to change their country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was planned to address the prolonged decades of the dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is an administrative area named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of her north neighbour is a claim to the Greek state territory, and has repeatedly objected to her attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is a opponent of the referendum for the change of the name of the country, said that you will not read the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name of the country is just the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s bells shut down in the background of the difficulties of churches in Harlem
"If we look from the historical plan, according to the old people I spoke to, there was a bar and a church literally on every corner," Mr. Adams says.
"They both are gone today."
Adams tells me the extinction of the bars is understandable.
"The people today are socialized in different ways," he added.
"The bars are no longer the quarters of the daily, where everyone is gathering regularly."
As far as the churches, he expresses concern that the money from the sale of assets will not reach as long as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later will be in the same situation.”
The man adds that churches can be replaced by blocks of apartments where people who do not help survive the other sanctuarys of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy housing in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the closing process of these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most new settlers are visiting them."
Both churches were built by white sheep before Harlem turned into a neighbourhood of black people – the Metropolis community in 1870, and St. Martin decade later.
The original white methodistic pasture was carried out in years after 1930.
Then the building became the possession of black people in the neighborhood.
St. Martin was poet by black Christians under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a fightcott against traders on a small 125th street, which is the main market street in Harlem because they didn't want to hire black workers.
In 1939, the building suffered severe fire damage, but Father Johnson's enorias made a plan for its restoration, ordering the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson’s son and heir of St. Martin, proudly calls them “poor bells. ”
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: “Cultural Treasure” and“ unreplaced historical instrument”.
The relevant expert, Tiffany Ngu from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first system of bells in the world used by a black musician – Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the larger system in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Mariewood mentions that from St. Martin, they never replaced it.
What happened in St. Martin in the past few weeks was a complicated story that was confused by architects and executors, some brought by the world leaders of the church, and others from the episcopic episode.
From the newsletter, which is the leading body of the shelter consisting of world leaders, they wrote to the eparchy in July, expressing their concerns that the erythema would "will be inclined to transfer the costs of the newspaper", although it had no role in renting the architects and the executors sent by the eparchy.
Some enorias have complained of the lack of transparency by the eparchy.
A 13-year-old child was injured by shark hunting lobsters in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while it was diving for lobsters in California in the first day of the hunting season, the representative authorities reported.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Beijken's beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel shared in front of KSWB-TV in San Diego that he swimmed with friends about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and went in with a whole group to get him out of the water.
Hamel first thought that the kid had caught a lobster and was excited, and then realized how he was screaming “He bit me!
You bit me!"
Hamml says that when he got to the boy, he realized that the whole area of his key was broken.
"I cried for everyone to come out of the water because there is a shark," Hammel added.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the child's work hospital in San Diego, where it was taken critically.
He's still not known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Captain Larry Jills, savior, said to the media briefing that a few weeks earlier in the water, a shark was observed, but it was estimated not from a dangerous kind.
Jills adds that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries on the top of his body.
The responsible authorities closed access to the coastal line from the beach Ponto in Kazablád to Swaomy in Encitinas for 48 hours of security reasons while the investigation is running.
Jills notes that there are more than 135 types of sharks in the area, most of which, however, are not a threat to humans.
Sainsbury plans an offence on the Great Britain market for decoration products
Sainsbury stands against Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams, opening stains for beauty products in its objects, where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the substantial offensive on the market for decoration products in Great Britain, which is estimated to 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while the sales of fashion and household products are reduced, the largest items for decoration products will be located in 11 shops throughout the country, and the success of the initiative will be discovered in other objects.
Investment conversion in the decorative industry is made at the moment where supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the stellages recently taken by televisions, microwaves and other household devices.
The Sainsbury said that they would double the number of proposed decoration products to 3000 products, with the first inclusion of marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current product gammas from L'Oreal, Mogelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more place, like the proposals in Boots shops.
The supermarket also regains its bottle gamma brims, so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly demanded from younger users.
Furthermore, Fragrance Shop's parcel trader will test deficits programs in two Sainsbury shops, the first of which opened in Croiden, South London last week, while the second will be discovered in Seli Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and moving focus on shopping smaller foods daily in comfortable times leads to that supermarkets must make more effort to attract buyers.
Mike Cope, the Chief Executive Director of Sainsbury, shared that the objects would look more like universal shops, while the chain of supermarkets is trying to overcome the Aldi and Lidl Discounters, offering more services and non-food goods.
The Sainsbury has the objects of Argos in hundreds of shops, and also opens the Habitats objects since they bought both chains two years ago – which the company claims that it has increased sales of food goods and has made profits even more profitable.
The previous experience of the supermarket chain to overlook its objects for beautiful and pharmaceutical products has failed.
Sainsbury did a compatible experience with Boots in the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after the dispute for the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company objects in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold his pharmaceutical business with 281 Celesio object, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds ago three years ago.
From there they claim that Lloyds will have a role in the plan, providing a rich gamma luxury marks for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hix, Sainsbury’s Trade Director, made the following statement: “We have transformed the type and character of our beautiful stains to improve the overall experience of our clients.
We also invested in special training by our colleagues, who will offer professional advice in place.
The proposed gamma marks aims to respond to every taste and all necessary in a captive environment with a comfortable location, and this combination turns us into an attractive destination for decorative products that makes the challenge to the concept of the old shopping way itself."
Peter Jones "wretched" after Holly Wilboby's cancellation deal for 11 million pounds
The star of Dragons Den Peter Jones "has been mad" after the television leading Holly Wilboby quit a deal for 11 million pounds with his Lyfstein company to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Wilboby doesn't have time for the mark of household devices and accessories Truly.
The couple's business is compared to the Goop mark of Guinet Poltrow.
The 37-year-old leader of "This morning" announced its leave in Instagram.
Holly Wilbby left the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones "to kip" after retrieving from their income business with the Lyfstein Mark in the last minute – with a view to focusing on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones "has been mad" when the golden girl on TV recognized during a tense meeting on Tuesday in his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts -- worth up to 1,5 million pounds, mean that there will be no time for his mark of household products and accessories Truly.
The business is compared to the Goop Mark of Guinet Poltrow, and the rumors are that he doubled Wilboby's wealth, whose value is predicted to 11 million pounds.
When the 37-year-old Wilebby announced in Instagram his leave of Truly, Jones left Britain with a plane to go to one of his vacational propertys.
One of the sources said: “Truly was Holly’s highest priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to ensure her future in the next few decades.
Her decision to leave the quarrels absolutely all unprepared.
No one believed this could happen Tuesday, so close to the start.
There's a warehouse in the centre in Marlow that is full of waiting for products to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leading “This morning”, which is one of the most successful stars of Britain, could cost the company millions due to the large investment in products varieting from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, as well as may lead to delay in placing the market mark.
And not in the last place, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Wilbby, who's mother of three children, along with her husband Dan Baldwin, is a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
The Wilboby itself founded Truly with the Cape in 2016, as Jones, who was 52, joined as chairman of the company in March.
Both families often go on holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of the Baldwin TV producer's company.
Wilbobby will become an Ambassador of the M&S Mark and will also replace Anne McParlin as the leader of the ITV broadcast.
The source close to Jones made the following statement last night: “We will not comment on his business matters. ”
Hard negotiations leading to “closure of relations”
He jokes about the criticisms he would take from the press channels for commenting, which some would be considered "not suitable for the President" and as too positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump take so much back?
Trump replied in his jokeful "new" way.
"I didn't retreat anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first one was held in Singapore in June and was declared by Trump “a great step towards the elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons”.
But the negotiations to remove this weapon are delayed.
More than three months after the youth meeting in Singapore, the diplomat of North Korea Ri Jung Ho informed representatives of the UN General Assembly that North Korea "does not see a reciprocal relationship" by the United States to the first steps of his country on the way of disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the United States continues with sanctions that aim to maintain the tension.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
"North Korea's concerns are beautiful," he noted.
"We were going to war with this country.
Millions of people would have died.
Instead, we now enjoy wonderful relationships."
The President said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results – termination of missiles tests, release of hostages and returning home to the bodies of American soldiers.
He also protected his neortodoxal approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's extremely easy to behave as president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside who are trying to enter this overwhelmed zone, we would have about 200 people right there," Trump said, pointing the crowd ahead of us.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia desolate the island and lead to hundreds of deaths
Following the earthquake in Lomboc, foreign non-governmental organizations were stated that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lomboc population were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for international assistance.
"It is unfortunately expressed in many cases that there is no need for international assistance, which makes things slightly challenged," Mrs. Sumbung said.
While "Save Children" forms a team to go to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the country's territory.
The National Speaker of the Disaster Agency, Mr. Sutopo, announced that the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palo to decide whether international agencies are allowed to contribute to the recovery efforts.
Given permanent earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains so unprepared for such natural disasters.
Although the asylums were built in Acheh in the case of tsunamis, they were not often seen on the other coasts.
The apparent lack of a warning siren for tsunami in Palo has likely contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate even more this logistics.
Until recently stationed in Lombock to serve the victims of the earthquake, the hospital ship has headed to Palu, but it will last at least three days before he can reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joco Widdo has turned the improvement of the remaining infrastructure of Indonesia into the centre of its pre-electoral campaign, investing a large amount of funds in roads and railway lines.
But the insufficient finances constantly harass his office, while Joco is regaining the urnas in the next year.
Mr. Joco is also under pressure, born by continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes, while Christian and muslim gangs fought on the streets with cats, bowls and arrows, as well as other original weapons.

Chelsea took 1-0 in the 25th minute after the naked on his Belgian star One Azar.

Cromwell's parliamentary statue becomes the latest memorial hit by "prewriting history"
Its ban would be a poetic justice for its almost Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artefacts, which was done by his fanatic puritanian followers.
Ala Cromwell's community described Mr. Creek's proposal as "insane" and "transscription attempt".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in this debate to remove the statues of Oliver Cromwell to the Westminster Palace to become a target.
The iconism of the English civil wars has not been ordered or done by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be made sacrificed because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the past century.
The magnificent presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hammo Thornikroft is proof of the opinion in the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many still consider as worthy respect.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Chromuel is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, a parliament defender against external pressure, and, of course, this is a monarchy in his case.
Whether this is a whole exact presentation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is sure is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, which formed the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clear recognised person, which represents one side of the incremental division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve a celebration and honor."
A pig killer wounds a fatal Chinese farmer
The farmer was attacked and killed by pigs on the market in Southwest China, local media reports.
The man, identified only by his name as Juan, was found dead with a discontinued artery and covered in blood near the leupanschoo market in Guayjou, reported on Sunday South China Morning Post.
The pig was prepared to inject its pigs with vaccines on 30 May 2005 in Sinin of Cinhai Province, China.
He was supposed to arrive with his cousin from the neighbouring province Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and also stopped the door to the next door opened.
He also reported that there was a big male pig in the cart with a bleeding vision.
The judicial expertise confirmed that 550 pound pigs attacked the farmer fatally, reports the report.
“My cousin's steps were bleeding and disappointed, ” said Cousin Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera record shows how Juan goes to the market at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal killer didn't belong to Juan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up so he could not attack anyone else while the police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It is also reported that the Yuan family and market leadership are negotiating compensation for the death case.
Although they're rare, it's reported before for pigs that attack people.
In 2016, a pig attacked his wife and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, and after the attack, the man had been injured with critical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig knocked a welsh farmer into his tractor, while his wife was able to chase him.
After the Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the blood taste can act as a “sleep”.
"They just play.
The pigs are like little kids, extremely curious... they don't mean to hurt anyone.
But also a person should treat them with respect," the man ends.
The weakening hurricane of Rosa will lead to common and spilling rains in the southwest of the United States.
According to the weather forecast, hurricane Rosa loses weight while moving over the cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next days, Rosa will lead to flood rains in northern Mexico and southwest parts of the United States.
Rosa includes winds of 85 miles per hour, which is a hurricane of category 1, counting up to 5 hours Sunday east time and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
During that time, over the Pacific, it begins to form a synclinal that moves east to the west coast of the United States. While Rosa approaches the Baha California half island on Monday in the form of tropical storm, it will start to push the tropical moisture deeply north to the southwest of the United States.
In Monday, Rosa will lead to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
During the next few days, the tropical moisture along with the approaching synclinal will create common rains in the southwest.
At local level 1 to 4 inches rain will cause dangerous and rapid floods, carrying fragments of streams and possibly seals in the desert.
The depth tropical moisture will lead to mass between 2 and 3 inches per hour in certain places, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, it is expected from 2 to 4 inches of rain, especially above the majority of Arizona.
It is possible that there are lightning floods in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the dispersed nature of the tropical rain.
It will be extremely unreasonable to travel a patch into the desert when there is a threat from tropical rains.
The heavy rain can turn the canyons into storm rivers, and the thunderstorms will lead to a raised dust and scattered winds.
The nearing synclinal will lead to heavy rains in some parts of the southern coast of California.
It is possible to reach a scale of more than a half inch, which will lead to minor waste streams and sliding roads.
It'll be the first rain season wave.
Late Sunday and early Monday, clouds scattering with themselves tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger zone on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread over the four corners on Tuesday and will continue to Wednesday.
Octobers can bring great temperature heights in the United States, while the Arctic Ocean is cold, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
On Sunday, there is an excellent example of dramatic temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
There's about 20 degrees of temperature between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, the rest of the summer heat will try to increase and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States are expected to have a warm beginning of October, and from the south plains to the parts of the northeast, they are expected to overcome temperatures of approximately 80 degrees.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above the middle.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Cavanou's hearing.
More than 20 million people were watching on Thursday on six TV networks the attractive sight of the testimony of nominations for the Supreme Court Brett Cavanau and Christine Blacey Ford, who accused him of sexual attack, which took place in the 1980s of the 20th century.
During that time, the political opposition continued, while the networks interrupted their regular reverse programs last Friday: the agreement arranged by the Arison Senator Jeff Flake, and according to which the FBI has to conduct a single weekly investigation on the charges.
Ford said in front of the Senate's Trial Commission that she was 100% convinced that Cavanaugh had pushed her drunk and tried to remove her clothes during the high school party.
Cavanaugh, in his emotionless testimony, is absolutely categorized that such a thing has never happened.
It is probably even more than the number of 20.4 million viewers reported by Nelsen to watch the witness on Friday.
The company counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no direct data available for other networks that were emitted by the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nelsen in tradition experiences difficulties with the measurement of a number of people who see from their jobs.
In comparison, we're talking about audience, similar to the size of the championship football match or the Hollywood Prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported the appointment of Kavanau, is the first among all networks with a average of 5,69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, reported by Nelsen.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nelsen CBS, it had 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN – 2.2 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office came out with a declaration that he would vote in favour of Cavanau, CNN and CBS cameras took a shot on Friday as protesters swing him while trying to catch the elevator for the meeting of the Court of Justice.
During the entire obstacle for a few minutes, he hasn't raised his eyes from the ground, which was emitted live on CNN.
"I'm right here, standing in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he represents the truth in front of the country?
"You have power, while many women are completely helpless," the attacks continued.
Flake replied that his office had already exited with a declaration and before closing the doors of the elevator reported that it would be made further during the commission hearing.
The cables and emissions networks provided a flexible coverage for a few hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to decide whether to transfer the nomination of Kawanau to the attention of the full voting Senate.
Alla Flake reported he would do this only if he was sure that the FBI would review the charges against the nominations next week, which democrats insisted on opposition.
Flake was partially convinced of conversations with his friend, the senator of the Democratic Party, Chris Queens.
After talking to Queens and a few senator Fleck made a decision.
His choice was definitely essential, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have sufficient votes for the approval of Kavanou without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to examine the charges against Cavanau.
British President May accuses critics of "political events" with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa Mei accused the criticism of her plans for leaving the European Union in "political events" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests in interviews with the Sunday Times.
British President Teresa May arrived for the conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published with her on the first page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson has strengthened its attack on her so-called "Lady Game Plan" for Brexit, proposing that the collection of customs taxes from the United Kingdom for the EU and the opposite is "completely absurd".

From the office, they express their appreciation for the quest of refugees to the Louisian State Police, the police criminal laboratory, the Southern University police and the local inhabitants for the assistance provided in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
The Director of Athletic Sports of LSU Joe Aleva thanks the local law enforcement authorities for the "minute justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The high six feet and six inch player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.

On Friday morning, the basketball coach of LSU Will Wade reported that the team was "shit" and "in shock" after Wade's death.
Wade said that “this is something that is anxious all the time. ”
Vulcan scatters ashes over Mexico City
The ash of Popocatepetel, thrown from the volcano, reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexican citizens to stand away from the volcano on Saturday after the activity in the crater increased and in the last 24 hours 183 gas and ashes were registered.

The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
The police faced Catalan Separatists before the anniversary of the vote of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after the protesters for independence encountered the gendarmeria, when thousands joined the opposing demonstration of the first anniversary of the polarizing here for the deception of Catalunia.
A group of masked separatists who were not allowed by the gendarmeria began to embarrass peacekeepers with eggs and powder paint, creating dark and dust clouds on the streets that usually hurried by tourists.
Later the day there were other conflicts with the police, and the police fled to their sticks to control the situation.
For hours supporting independence groups screamed "We do not forget, we don't forgive", while the country's entirety was retained with "Spain forever".
The local press reported that, as a result of the protests, 14 people received medical assistance for small injuries.
The tension remains high in the desired independence region even a year after the conduct of a referendum on 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist catalutions.
The vast majority voted whether their vote was independence, although the activity was low, since most opponents of the secrecy were bouncing the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people have been injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote in the voting sections in the region with a number of violent conflicts.
The demanding independence groups spent the Friday night on the street to prevent demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but it was forced to pass a different route.
Narciss Termes, an electrician, joined the separatist protest with his wife, says that it is no longer hope for Catalunia's chances to get independence.
"Latest year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out of joy when they could vote, but now it seems we're in delay," the man added.
Despite the important victory, whether in a small variety, regional elections last December, supporting Catalunia's independence of political parties experience difficulties this year, since many of their most famous leaders are either in self-employed detention, or are arrested in the expectation of the process for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Pyug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on his phone a protest in support of the police, claims that the conflict was provoked by politicians and both sides.
His comment is, "It becomes increasingly tense."
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine arrested catalan leaders in anticipating the preliminary process last year, announced that he would be candidated at the European Parliament elections next year.
He claims that "my candidature for European elections is the best way to resist the repression of democratic values and repressions that we observe by the Spanish government."
Londonders: Arrested men after the car crashed in the house

Goal of Menga brings Livingstone's victory with 1-0 over Rangers.
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston has secured the victory
The new man in the League of Livingston surprised the Rangers and brought only the second loss of Steven Gerard in his first 18 game as the manager of the Eibrox club.
The goal of Dolly Menga turned out to be decisive, and Gary Holt's team equipped at points two in Hybernian classification.
Gerard's team remains without winning a foreign field in the High League during this season, and next Sunday he faces leader Harts, from whom he leaves eight points in classification.
But before that, Rangers is the host of Rapid Vienna in the League of Europe on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone has already been in a series of six games without loss in the championship, and the manager Holt has not felt the taste of the loss since he changed Kenny Miller's post last month.
Livingston missed good opportunities against the unidless guests.
Holt's team had to lead in a long way before he noticed the naked, and his direct style of the game made Rangers extremely difficult.
Scott Robinson broke the defense, but his strike went aside, and then Alan Litgow shot next door after Craig Halket returned the ball with his head to him.
The households let Rangers play the ball, knowing that they could seriously make the guests static.
And that's how you got to the winning naked.
The Rangers did a violation, and Livingstone played well, as Declan Galacher and Robinson combined each other and took Manga, who took the ball and pointed out from the middle of the penal field.
By that moment, the Rangers ruled the ball more, but they faced the intact protection of the households, and Liam Kelly's doorman rarely had to interfere.
This game style continued in the second half-time, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save.
The Rangers' gate saved by Scott Pittman's leg shot, and a hit with Litlow's head passed by the door after another statistical position for Livingston.
In Livingstone's penalty field, the centers were declined, however, which were easily cleaned, and the judge twice did not respect the claims of the guests for a bunch – first after the struggle between the Halket and the Glenn Midlton reserve, and then in the doubts of the game with hand.
“Fenomental” from Livingstone – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a wonderful result for Livingston.
The team just plays excellent, keeping over expectations and improving its presentation.
The style of the game and the composition hardly suffered changes after returning the team to the High League, but Holt deserves a great commendation for the way you transformed the team after your appointment.
He has real heroes in the field.
Captain Halket was incredible, organizing the defense in an excellent way, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warrell under tension.
At the same time, Rangers didn't show anything inspiring.
Under Gerard's leadership, they're demonstrating some great things, but in the case, they were very under these standards.
They missed the last passage before the naked, only once they managed to break the protection of the households – this loss should wake the Rangers who are currently in the middle of the classification.
Erdogan gets a mixed reception in Köln
On Saturday (29 September) we became witnesses of smiles and blue spaces when Turkish leaders and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to fix relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship is cold because of problems affecting human rights, freedom of media and the adoption of Turkey in the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Köln to find a huge new mosque.
The city is a home for the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented the 25-third crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but there were still many supporters around who wanted to see their president.
Thousands protesting against Erdogan, many of whom Kurds also raised their voice, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to allow him to go to the country.
Different protests reflect the fracture caused by a visitor who is recognised as a hero of some German Turks and is contemplated as a desp of others.

Prison Long Lartin: Six overseers are injured in a turmoil
Six prison overseers were injured in a male prison with high level of security, reporting from the Prison Service.
The disturbance exploded in jail of Long Lartin in Warchester at approximately 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and still continues.
In order to control it, special officers from the Tordano team are called to deal with eight deprived of their freedom, as well as the very disturbance in the limited to one prison wing.
The injured overseers have suffered mild injuries on persons and have received medical assistance in place.
The speaker of the Prison Service made the following statement: “Special trained officers are called to deal with the incident in jail of Long Lartin.
Six overseers received medical assistance.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons and expressly state that responsible persons will be transferred to the police, and their sentences may be extended."
In jail Long Lartin, there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that after the prisoner's attack, the director of the prison was required to be treated in the hospital.
Also, in October last year, police officers from the parts of the fight against disagreements were called to prison, where they had a severe disturbance in which the staff had been attacked with billard balls.
The hurricane of Rosa threatens with a bright flood of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (either dried areas can benefit)
Arizona rarely happens to be hit by a tropical storm, but there is a great probability that this will happen early next week, while the weakening hurricane Rosa is carried through the southwestern desert, leading the risk of floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already established positions against lightning floods on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including in Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different way over Finniscu on Tuesday, as late Monday can bring rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that “only ten tropical cycles have held tropical storms within 200 miles from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Centre for hurricane predicts 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas from the southwestern desert, including central Rocky Mountains and the Great Pool, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inch rain, and in separate places are possible up to 4 inches of swimming.
For those who are not threatened by floods, the rain caused by Rosa can actually be a blessing, since the region is severely affected by the drought.
Although floods are extremely serious concerns, part of the rain is likely to be useful, since the southwest part is now in the drought.
According to the United States Drought Period Commission, a little more than 40% of Arizona suffers from at least an excessive drought, which is the second weighing categories," weather.com reported.
First, the road of the hurricane Rosa leads to reaching the drought at Baha California half island in Mexico.
Rosa, which can still be commended on Sunday morning with the maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north with 12 miles an hour.
The storm meets colder waters over the Pacific and therefore weakens.
Therefore, it is expected to reach the land in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain above the part of Mexico can be strong and lead to a significant risk of compensation.
“The rains are expected from up to 6 inches from Baha California to northwest Sonora, as possible up to 10 inches” reported by weather.com.
Rosa will then go north in Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona to South Yuta by Tuesday late evening.
"The basic risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely strong rain in Baha California, Northwest Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Centre for Hurricanes warn.
These rains are expected to lead to life hazardous floods and various waste flows in the desert, as well as sewages in mountains.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempting murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of a murder attempt, after a 16-year-old kid was discovered with injuries in the Summerset.
The wounded boy was discovered in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
It is located in a hospital where his condition remains “stable. ”
The night in the area Radstock were arrested a boy 17 years old, two boys 18 years old and 20-year-old man, reported by the police in Aven and Summersett.
The police are asking everyone who could have recorded what happened to contact them.
Trump says Cavanau "has suffered from rudeness and anger" of the Democratic Party
"Every vote for Judge Cavanau is a voice that rejects frank and disgusting tactics of the democratic party," said Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Cavanaugh "has suffered from rudeness and anger" of the democratic party during his nomination.
Cavanau witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, cautiously rejecting Christine Blacey Ford's accusation of sexual assault decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testifies during the hearing of the charge.
The President made a statement on Saturday that “the American people today have witnessed intelligence, courage and quality” of Cavanau.
"Every voice in support of Judge Kavanou is a voice in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a real lawyer with a wonderful reputation in public service," the president said before the gathered crowds of supporters from Western Virginia.
The President indirectly calls for the nomination of Cavanau while he spoke of the importance of the Republican votes for the general elections.
"They leave five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
Although I'm not a candidate, I'm actually involved," Trump continued.
"I therefore run around and fight for good candidates."
Trump noted that the democrats had set up as a mission "to interrupt and interrupt".
The first key procedure is expected in the Senate for the nomination of the Cavanau nomination not later than Friday, as CNN reported by one of the High Representatives of the Republican Party.
Thousands die after earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims increases
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were taken from the shore of the giant waves, when a strong earthquake and tsunami defeated the Indian island Sulavesi, the authorities reported on Saturday.
Thousands of people were gathered for a beach festival in Palu on Friday, when at evening the coast was swallowed from waves up to six feet (18 feet) and took many to their death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami shoes after the earthquake with a magnet of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and have not escaped immediately, and many have become victims of the disaster," Jacarda Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, speaker of the Indonesian Disaster Agency BNPB, announced during a briefing at Jacquarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
"The water was pulling cars, trees, whole houses, defeated everything on its way," Nugroho continued, and added that the tsunami exceeded the open sea with a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h), before it hit the shore.
"Some people have scattered themselves on the trees, so they have been able to save themselves from the water," he added.
Near 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centres in Palo.
Published by the Air Disaster Photos Agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and stores, broken and drilled bridges, as well as surrounded by water mosque.
Secondary shakes continued to swing the coast town on Saturday day.
The order of earthquakes was felt in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Evaluation and Appendix Agency (BPPT) announced that the energy released from the Friday massive earthquake was approximately 200 times stronger than the Hyrosima atomic bomb in the Second World War.
The declaration also states that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long and tight bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damages as "great" and concretes that thousands of houses, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the screwed buildings, added the speaker, and then added that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said the victims and damage could be higher on the coast of 300 miles (190 miles) north of Palu, the area called Donggala, which is closer to the strawberry epicenter.
He also added that “communications are completely cut off and there is no information from Donggala. ”
The Red Cross on its own indicated that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that his teams and volunteers have already moved to the affected zones.
"It's a tragedy now, but it can make it even more difficult."
On Saturday, the Agency was criticised that she did not inform the defeat of Palu tsunami, although the officials explained that the waves arrived during the announcement of the message.
Shared in social networks, loving videos show a man on the top floor of the building, who screams to people on the street of panic warnings about the nearing tsunami.
After a few minutes, the huge water wall slips into the coast and treats both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to verify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a severe interruption of electricity, which stopped the communications around Palu and so made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue efforts.
The Army began to send cargo aircraft with the assistance of Jacarda and other cities, reported by the responsible authorities, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other products of the first need.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue operations and will remain closed by October.
President Joco Widdo will visit the evacuation centres in Pali on Sunday.
The deaths in the Indonesian tsunami are already over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision officials from Donggala managed to get safe to Palo, where they found a shelter in the brezent shelters opened in their office court, they passed along a number of desolation scenes, says Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw countless destroyed houses."
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the initial work on rescue and recovery of emergency groups, some complain that they have rich experience in such situations, foreign rescueers are prevented from reaching Palo.
In accordance with the Indonesian Regulations, the financing, dispatch of staff and abroad supplies can only be started if the defeated place is declared as a national disaster zone.
And this hasn't happened yet.
"The poverty is still at the regional level," said Aulia Ariani, speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government announced that it was a national disaster, we could accept international assistance, but they still have not announced that statute."
While the second night after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami, friends and families of those who are still unknown continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones have survived somehow after natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescueers released a woman who was buried under the ruins for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the national paraplanerism team of Indonesia, trained two missing paraplaners for Asian championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those caught in a trap in Roa Roa Roa were his students, added Mr. Mandagi.
"As elders in the paraplanerism field, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours after the news about the crash of the Roa Roa Roa has reached the paraplanerism community, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to the rivals in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue marks, however, the only answer to his messages was one-one grey.
"I think that means that the messages are not delivered," he added.

Kanie West: The Rapper Changes His Name of Ye
The Rapper Kanie West has changed his name to Ye.
Together with the announcement of the change in Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: "The man officially known as Kanie West."
West, 41, has been carrying the name Ye for a while and used it as a title for his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change prevails his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present its new Yandhi album.
He's changing the singer Ariana Grande at the show, which stopped "for emotional reasons", the maker of the show informs us.
Besides a shorter of his current professional name, West has before claimed that the word is religiously important to him.
"I believe that "he" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means "ye" or "ye", West shared earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with the radio leader Big Boy.
"In this way I am you, I am us, it is us.
It passed from Kanie, which means only one person, just Ya – which reflects the good of us, evil, confusion, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of our being."
The rapper is one of the many known in his sphere who changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and names, including Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preferences to the alias Lions and Brader Love.
One of West's previous colleagues, J. Z., also presented himself in an option with or without tire and/or main letters in his nickname.
The president of Mexico swears not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore that he will never use military force. This happened until the country is nearing the 50th anniversary of bloody reprises against students.
On Saturday, Tlatelko Plaza, President Lopez Obrador promised "will never use the army to oppress the Mexican people".
The soldiers fired a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people, while students with left political views gradually spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador oathed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships for students and discovering more free public universities.
The President also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attracts young people to criminal gangs.
The United States must double the financing of the II development
The moment China becomes increasingly active on the front of developing an artificial intellect, the United States must double its research budget in this area, the researcher and developer of II Kai-Fu Loy, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was sent after the US government's different offices made statements on the topic of I.I., although the United States has generally no official I.I. strategy.
During that time, China presented its plan even last year: the country seeks to become number one of the innovations in the II until 2030.
"Dubling the I.I. budget will be a good start, given that all other countries are far before the United States and are about to make the next breakdowns in relation to the I.I," Lee said.
Double funding can also double the chances of the next major achievement in the field of II to come from the United States, as Lee informs the CNBC in the interview last week.
Lee, whose book “The superpowers of the II: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the chief executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the largest II companies in China – Face++.
In the 1980s of the University of Carnegie Melan Lee worked on the I.I. system, which won the most successful hotel player in America, and then was the executive director at Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee gives the duties of the previous technological competitions of the federal government, such as the robotic competition of the Agency for improved research projects on defence, and asked when will be the next, which will help recognise new visioners.
"United States researchers often need to work hard to win government funding," stated Lee.
"Not China takes the academic leaders, but corporations," said the man.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies hire university lights to work on the I.I.
Lee also claims that changes in immigration policy can help the United States to strengthen its I.I. program.
"I believe that doctors in the I.I. science should be automatically offered green cards," said the man.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan to develop an artificial intelligence from the next generation in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people from academic institutions like the way the National Scientific Foundation and other state organizations finance researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee clarifyes.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established a Joint Centre for Art Intellect, which aims to include partners from industry and academic environments, and the White House announced the establishment of the Special Intellect Commission.
Also this month DARPA reported an investment of 2 billion dollars in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF, they now invest more than 100 million dollars a year in the development of the I.I.
Meanwhile, the US legislative authority, which wanted to create the National Security Commission on Art Intelligence, has not not noted any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum whether to change their country's name
Macedonia's citizens voted in a referendum this Sunday whether the name of the state should change to the Republic of North Macedonia. This is a move that would authorize a forthcoming decades of dispute with Greece, which blocks Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is a area called Macedonia, claims that the name of her north neighbour is a claim against its territorial integrity, which requires the veto of its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
Both governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonia.
President Georgie Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum himself, while the boycott campaign casts a shadow of doubts whether the referendum will be able to reach the minimum 50 per cent required for recognition of his validity.
The issue of the newsletters is: "Do you support NATO and the EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the name shift, including President Zoran Zaev, claim that the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the formed State of Yugoslavia in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians, so that they can live free under the rain of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79-year-old Citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough members of the parliament have said that they will comply with the results of it to that extent that the voc already has a decisive burden.
In order to alter the name of the State, two thirds of the parliamentary representatives should vote.
The State Electoral Commission reported that there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the electoral activity was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters visited the urnas.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Giose Tanevski, a citizen of 62 of the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Duško voted at the referendum in Macedonia for a change in the country's name, which will discover the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov, on 54, prepared a small scene and arranged chairs in front of the tents bounce-referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proudly raised heads, not through the servants' gate," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will lead to the investment needed for Macedonia, since unemployment in the country is over 20 per cent.
"I believe that the huge majority will be with us because more than 80 per cent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zeev said after I released my own voice.
The state also stated that the positive result would lead to “affirmation of the future of our people”.
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Research published the results of the study, according to which between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters will participate in the referendum, which is under the necessary activities.
Another study, the case of Macedonian Television Telma, announced that 57% of the respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote with yes.
In order to make the referendum successful, the electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum is unsuccessful, it will be the first serious strike against the pro-west government's policy since it won the power last May.
Look: Serhio Aguero from Manchester City is crossing the entire defense of Bryton and marks goal
Sergeio Aguero and Rahim Sterling have overcome Brayton's protection and have won Manchester City with 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stedium in Manchester, England.
The play of Aguero for his naked at 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine golmajster was found with a passage in the middle of the field.
He runs three defenders from Bryton before sprinting with the ball in the empty space ahead.
Then Aguero became surrounded by four green players.
He dragged past one of the defenders, then left the rest of them behind at the border of Briton's punishment field.
Then he passed onto the left to Sterling.
The English attacker with one touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who hit the right foot over the doorman of Briton Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his neck.
"Aguero fights with some injuries in his legs," the reporter of City Pep Guardiola reported.
"We planned he to play about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky you marked the naked at the moment."
But Sterling was the one who provided the initial advance of the "the heavens" in this game of the Supreme League of England.
He signed in 29th minute.
In the naked Aguero situation, he received a submission deeply in the half of Briton.
He immediately released the left flag pass to Leroy Sane.
Sane advanced with the ball, and then he found Sterling with a dog on the distant grede.
The attacker of the unbears managed to detect closer, just before the ball went out.
City will face Hoffenheim at the group stage of the Championship League at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at Rayne Necar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Shercer wants to play the destiny of Rockies
After the Nationals didn't classify for playoffs, there's no special sense for another game of the title-starting beecher.
Still, the ambitious Shercer is always hoping to be a titler on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, if the game is important for Rockies, which lead with a game in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the classification of NL West.
Rockies guaranteed their participation at least in the Wild Card game after victory with 5-2 against Nationals on Friday night, but it's still not sure they'll win their first title in the Division.
"Although we don't fight for anything ourselves, we want to finish the season with a nice game in Denver, where the audience and the other team will give everything they can to win the most important game for them in the year.
Why would I want to miss a match like that?"
Nationals haven't announced the starting pitcher for Sunday, but they're supposed to let Shercer participate if the match is decisive.
For Shercer, this would be the 34th match as a starting pitcher this year, when he spent his training on Thursday and would have the normal time for rest until Sunday.
The right-handed Washington beecher has a balance of 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strikejauts in 220 2/3 inning in this season.
Trump calls supporters in Western Virginia
The President Koso pointed out the situation with his elected man for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Cavanau while talking about the importance of the Republican votes in the general elections.
"All we have achieved will be at risk by November.
There's five weeks left to one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the greatest moments in the present history - I also state that, although I am not a candidate, I am also actually involved, that is why I am fighting all the powers for the right candidacy," Trump said.
Then he continued with "All of you see this horrible, horrible radical group of democrats, you see them with your eyes.
They are determined to restore their power in any way, you are witnesses of their injustice, their evil.
They don't care when they can hurt whom they need to cross to get in the power and governance, because they are only interested in power and governance, but we will not give them."
The Democrats, according to the president's words, have set their aim to “interrupt and interrupt”.
"What we all see in the last four days," he continued, calling the democrats "anger, creepy, malicious and unfaithful."
The President reminded the Senate Court Commission, mentioning the senator of Democrats Diane Finstein in a name, which caused strong screams from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you distribute the papers?
Excuse me, what?
No, no, I waited -- it was really bad gesture -- maybe the worst I've ever seen."
Laberists are no longer widely covered.
The party is not tolerant to those who speak openly
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
Finally, I am just the last member of the parliament from the layberists to whom it was said he was not welcome - only because I was honest.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, got a similar attitude, since she was decisively opposed to antisemitism.
In my case, the censorship criticizes me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, those that are ironicly similar to those with whom Jeremy expressed disagreement during the times of previous leaders.
The report on the meeting of the Leaberists from Nottingham East on Friday said that “we want meetings to include all and be useful. ”
During most of my eight years as a local representative of the layberists in the parliament, the Friday meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, the tone of most meetings and promises for “slighter and measured” policies have been forgotten for long, if they were ever in a daily order.
It was increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Leberist Party and that every opinion is evaluated on the basis of that as far as it likes the leadership of the party.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I used to think that they share similar political views, began expecting me to make a reverse revolution and to take positions with which I would never agree -- either national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I do public statements -- no matter what I actually say -- a whole offensive tirada in the social networks, where it is called for revocation, rejecting moderate policy, statements that it does not belong to the leuberists.
Like that, it doesn't happen only to me.
In fact, I know that I have even got more luck than some of my colleagues, since the comments for me are at least of political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and targetedness of these colleagues who face sexist or racist obstacles every day without fearing them.
One of the greatest disappointments of this age in politics is how such insults have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the layberists should embrace the culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer widely covered, as at any sign of untrusting or changing the rules of selection, it becomes increasingly tighter.
In the past two years, I received many advice to be embarrassed, not speaking so much, and then “all will be fine. ”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Leberists 32 years ago as a student provoked by Thacher's government, which has led to a literal decline in my excellent school, I fought for better public services for those who need them – either as a local advisor or as minister.
I've never hid my political views, including during the last elections.
No one at Nottingham East could be confused in any way from my political position and my disagreement with my current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state confronts Brexit, it will harm households, companies and the public sector, and I don't understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the leader of the Leberists.
But in reality, my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of the layberists, or not: It is proud to serve you and I promise that no threats from revocation or political separation will deny me to act in the way that I think is best in the protection of your interests.

Air 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Air led to classification
The two late essays may have changed the slight final result, but there is no doubt that Er deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting game from the Tenent High League.
The team is already headed by classification and only of the ten teams are without loss until now.
Better protection and better use of opportunities have proved to be decisive in the game from which coach Peter Murci and his team can be very satisfied.
"I'm happy because the other teams tested us quite seriously in the past games, and we are still without loss," Merci noted.
Robin Christy from Melrose said: “Greats for Er, they really benefited from their situation better than us. ”
The esej of Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional strike of Frazier Climo, led the Eire forward in the result, but the yellow card for the Scotland National Rory Hughes, released to play in the Waryers game, allowed Melrose to arrive in the result after Jason Bohot realized the esse followed by an unsuccessful supplementary strike.
Climo increased the front for the Air from a punishment hit a little before the half-time, marking the eses after salt action, and then realizing the additional strike, which made the result 17-5 for the Eur of the vacation.
But Melrose started the second half-time well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful additional hit on the Bogot, reduced the front of only five points.
Followed a continuous stop of the game due to a severe injury of Ruarid Not, which was carried on a bearer, and after the renewal of the Eir match, they increased their advances after Stafford McDowell's esej and successful supplementary impact on Climo.
Then the active captain of Er Blair McFerson received a yellow card and Melrose again used their numerous advantages by exposing strong pressure and realizing the esej through Bruce Colvin, followed by an unsuccessful additional strike.
However, the householders returned the presence of the spirit and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card, after he demolished Climo without a ball, from the next punishment of McFerson realizes the ess through the advanced Ere's offence line.
Climo realizes the additional strike, and not long after he did it again, after Kyle Row caught the bullet from David Armstrong and took out Gregor Henry's wing on the fifth eso of the households.
The star of Still Game seems to be headed for a new career in the restaurant business
The star of Still Game Ford Kiernan appears to be directed towards a slighter and warmer industry after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, which is also a scriptist and one of the two stars along with his long-year comedian partner Greg Hemfield.
The two announced that the forthcoming ninth season would be the last for the broadcast, and it seems Kirnan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official registries he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor abstained from comment, although the source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan had intended to engage in the “prospering restaurant business” of Glasgou.
"The sea is ours," the none of the seas of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The seamen are constantly patroled by the Oxies with a sea headquarters in La Paz.
There's an ocean blue flag above the public buildings.
The sea bases from the lake Titicaca to Amazon are rigged with the moto: “The sea belongs to us right.
It's our duty to bring it back."
In all Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit handed to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century, is still alive – and the call for sailing again across the Pacific.
In fact, this hope is now the strongest for decades here, while Bolivia is waiting for a judgement from the international court on 1 October, after five years of consideration.
"The power is in Bolivia, it feels clever and unity everywhere, as the country expects a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadila.
Many Bolivians will watch the conviction of the international court of the large screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support the request of Bolivia and that after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Evo Morales, a charismatic local president of Bolivia, who is about to go to a controversial re-election battle in the next year, also put a lot and a lot on the judgment of the court on Monday.
"We are very close to returning access to the Pacific," Moralez promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the probability of the court to make a decision in favour of Bolivia is pretty small, and even if it judges it for her use, it would not change things in reality.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no authority to take Chile's territory and has decided that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgement of the international court is only six months after hearing the last arguments, indicates that the case is "not complex", returns Paz Zarate, Chilean international law expert.
And instead of contributeing to the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could actually hurt her.
"The problem with access to the ocean was broken by the current government of Bolivia," Zarate said.
Then he suggested that Morales' military rhetoric has emphasized and the small remained Chile's good will.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at a moment, but it will be extremely difficult after what happened to normal dialogue.
Both countries do not support diplomatic missions at each other from 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
He said on Monday, Bolivia will have "amazing opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile" as well as the chance to "stop 139 years of disagreement by reaching benefits for both countries".
Calzadila also rejected the idea that Morales -- who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America -- used the problem of accessing the ocean as a “political pattery”.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific out," he added.
"The conviction is an opportunity to see that we must overcome our past problems."
North Korea claims that it won't continue nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never step into nuclear disarmament first if he is unable to trust Washington.
Ree presented his speech on Saturday before the UN General Meeting.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises that they made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposition countries in Singapore.
His commentary comes after the US Secretary Mike Pompeo appears to restart the nucleus diplomacy on nuclear issues more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Yong Un from North Korea.
Ri called the "free hope" the idea that the continuation of the sanctions and objections of the United States to the declaration that ends the Korean war will make the North fall on the knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the declaration without Phenjan first to make a significant gesture on the way of disarmament.
As Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump wants a second meeting.
But there is a widespread skepticalism that in Phenjan they are serious for their refusal from an arsenal that they see as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenjan next month to arrange the preparation of the second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion audits in Paris reveal the last screaming on massive hats that will soon be in fashion shops next to you
If you want to increase your collection from hats or completely block the sunlights, you don't need to look for more.
Valentino and Tom Brown designers discovered gammas incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, who laughed at the fashion floor during the week of the fashion in Paris.
A lot of irregular hats I caused a wave in Instagram in the summer, and designers sent the creatives to their own creations to smash the community of fashion.
Valentino's exclusive offer was an extravagant bee hat with a similar feather wide periphery that literally swallowed the heads of the models.
Other too large accessories included jewelry, magic hat, and even ananas – but they do not mean to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – at the same time for Halloween.
Many of the color masks had sewed lips and reminded not as much about the highest fashion as for Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs was like a diving equipment in a full set of snorhel and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
If you're facing these fashion trends, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats will soon be sold in fashion shops near you.
The huge hats come soon after "La Bomba" – the slammed hat with a two-foot periphery, which was seen on the heads of all - from Riana to Emily Rataikovski.
The kult to the extremely irregular hat, which has taken over social networks, led to another giant design of the fashion podium – a slammed beach bag, large as much as it was wearing with a bathroom model.
The bag of rafia with a colour of a burned orange, with rafia creams and scratched with a white skin handle, was attracting all the views of the articles in the Jacquemus collection of La Riviera SS19 during the Week of Fashion in Paris.
The stylist of the famous Luke Armitid said before FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in fashion stores the next summer – after the designer made such a big impression, it will be difficult to ignore searching for edrogabarian accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential to global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation of academic distinction, which continues in 2018 with another excellent presentation of the test results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective success in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scotland Association of Independent Schools (SCIS) seek to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their chosen career and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector, which can create and implement a personal training program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a tongue that understands him, your words can reach him.
But if you speak his own tongue, you touch his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English only when we want to build relations and trust with the nations of other countries.
Through the results of this year's exams, we see languages first with highest success for independent schools.
Overall, 68% of students who studied foreign languages have reached the high evaluation of A.
The data collected from 74 members of SCIS schools show that 72% of the students have reached an estimate A in Chinese, with the same estimate 72% of the German students, 69% of French and 63% of the Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland accept foreign languages as vital skills that children and youths will definitely need for the future.
At present, languages as subject of free choice by students receive the same attitude as natural and mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical discipline) both in independent schools and beyond them.
In 2014, the Commission on Employment and Labour Skills of the United Kingdom showed that, for the reasons of which employers were difficult to find employees, 17% indicated insufficient language competences.
As a result, the government of foreign languages is increasingly required to prepare young people for their future careers.
More jobs require the rule of foreign language, which turns these skills into essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the selected career, if a person controls a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, after he has the same skill that remains for life.
The possibility to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the man who owns several languages in front of the competition.
According to the YouGov study, among more than 4000 full-year citizens of the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% have not owned a foreign language sufficiently well to be able to perform the language, and the French was the only language whose ownership reaches a two-digit percentage of 15%.
That's why the investment in learning languages today is important to children now.
The governance of several languages, especially those in developing economies, will give children a better chance to find a good job.
In Scotland, every school will differ from teaching languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important to the United Kingdom in the future plan by 2020, for example Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose in independent schools, and teachers will be specialized in its area.
Independent schools in Scotland are firmly determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills to succeed in life, regardless of what the future hides.
It is currently not possible to deny that in a global business environment, languages continue to have an incredibly important role for the future of which country, which requires that this be taken into account in the educational system.
And indeed, modern languages should be considered realistic as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.

Lebron's gonna make his debut for Lakers this week in San Diego.
The waiting is almost over for the fans who're embarrassing to see Lebron James's first match with the L.A. team.
Coach of Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would take part in the first team's pre-season training game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he's gonna play in a fight.
"We'll be in the field between one and 48 minutes," the joke Walton announced through the official Lakers website.
The reporter for Lakers Mike Trudelle announced on Tweeter that James would probably play relatively few minutes in the game.
After training earlier the week, James was asked about his plans on the six games of Lakers' pre-season training.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season matches to prepare for the new season," he said.
Tramp myting in Western Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of elections tonight in Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned Trump's myths, which include stops in famous places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By delaying the confirmation of its choice to fill a free place in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the forthcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as the Republicans are threatened to lose control of the Congress in November.
At what time will Trump's myth be held in West Virginia tonight, and how can you look online?
The Trump visit to Wiling, Western Virginia is planned for 1900, eastern time tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see the Trump visit in Wiling, West Virginia, below by transmitting live on YouTube.
Trump will probably consider the hearings this week on the nominations for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Cavano, in which there has been tension for claims of immoral sexual acts, which holds the confirmation of the Senate by a week while the investigation is being investigated by the FBI.
The main goal of this series of myths, however, is to help the Republicans pick up an inertion for the elections in November.
Therefore, the campaign of President Donald Trump announced that these five appointments next week aimed at "activating volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The control of the Congress is so important for his programme that the president will visit the most States and start a campaign season filled with engagements," said the Reuters speaker of the Trump campaign, who refuses to be mentioned.
The event tonight, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wiling, can bring the supporters of Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the media from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, the second visit to Trump for this month in West Virginia – the state in which more than 40% in 2016 won.
Trump is trying to help the candidate of the Western Virginia Senate, the Republican Patrick Morrisi, who left in the sociological studies.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisi the fact that the president came to give him a pressure in sociological studies," said Simon Heather, a politician from the University of Western Virginia, according to Reuters.
"Ryder Cup" 2018: The US team will fight to last, keeping its hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three follow-up sessions without "foursom" intrigue, the games on Sunday afternoon may have brought what the Rider Cup needed.
The change of advantage in sports is a very subjective concept, however, in which players believe undeservedly, even more in races like this.
So, what team is in a better position right now?
"They led with six points, and now there are only four, so I guess we have a little inertion," Jordan Speed said at the end of today's competition day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage at only twelve more.
But as Speed says, the Americans have something else to show and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge the sports form of Speet and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each of them took three out of four possible points.
Speethe shows an excellent form from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the real leader of his team.
The encouraging voices of the fans were getting stronger, while he progressed in the round, in which with a precise strike he equipped the result in the fourth match, after Thomas and I left with two hits after the first two holes.
His strike, which won the 15th hole game, was welcomed with strong reactions that make us believe that it's not all lost for the American team.
"It's important that you don't think about anything else and focus on your own game," Spiete says.
That's all that's left to these players now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Speet and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the uncontrolled heroes of Rider Cup so far.
The strange but wonderful couple from Europe won four out of four, and they seem to be doing everything.
"Mollywood" were the only couple who did not make "bogate" on Sunday afternoon, but they also had no "bogita" either on Saturday morning or Friday afternoon or morning.
These successes, as well as the way that it seemed to pass the energy between them and the enthusiastic fans, confirmed that they were players who would win on Sunday and there will be no better couple than Flitwood and Molinari, which would bring the potential victory of Europe, while the sun comes over Le Golf National.
To prefer both of you on different holes at the same time.
However, European glory stories have proved a little early.
Bub Watson and Webb Simpson quickly handled Sergio Garcia, the hero of the football games since the morning, while he was partnering with Alex Norren.
"Bogs" and two "dubles" of the first nine holes brought a Spanish and Sweden into problems that they failed to deal with.
But there's no way anyone else can solve your problems in the Sunday matches.
"Fourball" and "foursom" matches are extremely interesting to look closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice that exchange each other, and the way a strategy can take changes at any moment.
The Europeans played better teams, so they accumulated a significant advantage before the last day, but this session of "foursom" matches showed that the American team was also ready to fight until the last time -- something in which many people, especially in the United States, had been strongly doubted.
Europe leads with 10-6 on the last day of the Rider Cup.
Europe will have a strong frontier before the last day of the Rider Cup, after taking the United States with 10-6 after playing games from the Fourball and Foursom formats on Saturday.
The inspiring duet Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari started with two victories against the unconvincing Tyger Woods, with which their assets in the Le Golf National race increased to four points.
In an attempt to restore the trophy that lost Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bjorn dominated the tomorrow's football games over the Americans who did a mistake after a mistake, and eventually Europe won a series of 3 to 1 wins.
The United States has proved more resistance in the Foursom games where they won two victories, but they failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furic's team needs eight points from the 12th Single game on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first newly elected in Europe, winning four points in order, and he and Molinari, known as Mollywood, after this senzational weekend, have only become the second couple, won four points of his first four matches in the history of Ryder's bath.
After Woods and Patrick Reid played the football games without appeal, they were extremely motivated to win the broken Woods and the US Newman Bryson Decambu with even more categories of 5+4.
Woods, who barely passed through his two games on Saturday, only sometimes demonstrated exhibits of his geniusity, but yet has 19 losses of 29 games in the "fourball" and "foursom" matches, as well as a total of seven follow-up losses.
Justin Rose, got a vacation for tomorrow's football games, partners with Henrik Stanson in the "foursom" conflicts in victory with 2&1 over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copka -- number one and number three in the world.
However, the European team failed to enjoy a fully pleasant, cold and cloudless day southwest of Paris.
The three-time Jordan Speed winner and Justin Thomas returned the hopes of the Americans by wining two points on Saturday.
They achieved a difficult victory with the Spanish John Ram and Ian Polter at the football games, and later they returned to beat Paulter and Rory Macilroy with 4&3 in "foursom", even though they lost the first two holes.
Only two times in the history of the Rider Cup, the team was able to qualify four points of deficit before the singles, and according to the Rules, the Furic team would keep the trophy even at equality.
However, after they were overwhelmed in two days, their chances of turning on Sunday appear to be not very big.
North Korea says that there is no way to disarm unanimously, untrustedly
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea reported to the United Nations on Saturday that continuing sanctions deepen the uncertainty of the United States and there is no way the country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
At the annual meeting of the World Organization, Ri Yong-how said that in the last year, “relevant measures of goodwill” were taken, for example, to stop nuclear and missile tests, to destroy the nuclear test object and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and technologies.
"Although we do not see the relevant response by the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security and, under no circumstances, there is no way we first disarm ourselves singlely."
While Ri expressed the known complaints of North Korea on Washington's resistance against the "poetapan" approach to the removal of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded, since she had taken steps, his statement seemed significant, since he did not reject the unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Phenjan did in the past.
Ri called on a joint statement by Kim Chen Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the President of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim promised to work for the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has aimed at the official end of the Korean war since 1950-1953, but the United States say Phenjan must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls for relief against strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"United States insist "to remove nuclear weapons first" and increase pressure by sanctions to achieve their goal by force, and even object to "the declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The understanding that sanctions can make us kneel, is a meaningless dream of those who don't know us.
The problem, however, is that the continuing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention whether the second meeting between Kim and Trump was planned, which the U.S. leader emphasized in the UN earlier a week ago.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Je-In in the past five months and added: “If the country had been South Korea, not the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a delay.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was much different than the previous year, when he told the UN General Meeting that the direction of North Korean missiles to the United States continental part was inevitable, after the "looking president" Trump called Kim "man-racket" of a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations Trump, who threatened North Korea with "complete destruction" last year, commends Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said that there is still a lot of work to do and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
Wednesday Trump emphasized that there was no time for this and said: “It doesn't matter if it take two years, three or five months. ”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Phenjan for the measures taken.
Nevertheless, the US Secretary Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the fulfilment of the Security Council sanctions must continu until full, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in attempting to stop the financing of the nuclear programme and the Phenjan Balistic missile programme.
Pompeo met with Ree at the UN general meeting, and then said he would visit Phenjan again in the next month to prepare a second summit.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Phenjan in July, saying that progress was made, but only a few hours later North Korea accused him of sending "gangster requests".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has promised to destroy a missile object and a nuclear complex if the United States take "suitable measures".
He said Kim told him that the "suitable measures", which he seeks, were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted to achieve normalization of relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard course for enough vacation
The new course at the Harvard University this year makes all students sleep more in trying to overcome the growing culture of learning "all night" with the help of caffeine.
The teacher found that students at university number one in the world often don't even think about the foundations of how to care for themselves.
Charles Kaissler, a sleep medicinal professor at the Harvard Medical Faculty and a specialist in Brigam Hospital and Women Hospital, set up a course he thinks he's the first in the United States.
He inspired to start the course after he talked about the impact of sleeping on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why are they telling me that just now, in my last year?"
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep which surprised me," he said to the Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains the most important thing to students about how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements and improve the overall well-being.
Paul Bareira, a psychiatric professor at Harvard Medical Faculty and executive Director of the University Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students suffered from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room in a room where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, maratons and books to explain to them the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements affect the lack of sleep, and the importance of the routine of sleeping for sleep.
In another part of the participants, it is described how long-term sleep exemption can increase the risk of heart attack, insulation, depression and cancer.
Then the map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects on the health of the choice to smoke," said Professor Kaissler.
The culture of pride from "training all night" still exists, he says and adds that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students mean that deprivation of sleep is a growing problem.
Ensuring sufficiently and quality sleep must be the "sacred weapons" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says – even in order to avoid filling, as the deprivation of the sleep makes the brain hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kaissler to prepare a course, taking one of his classes in his first year in Harvard.
He says his course has "opened his eyes" and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is that all final students will be asked to complete such a training programme before they join the competitive institution.
Professor Kaissler recommends that students consider whether to set the alarm for bed and wake up and know the harmful effects of the “Blue Light” emitted by electronic screens and the lightlight that can disturb the circumstance and lead to problems with sleeping.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal of Menga broke Gerard's team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shock broke Steven Gerard's idol team and brought a victory with 1-0 for Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to write up his first victory as a guest of the triumph in February with 4-1 over St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team led only the second defeat of Gerard in his 18th game as the manager, which left his team with eight points less than the ripped Harts team, the leader in the Leader League of Ladbrokes.
Menga marked seven minutes before the vacation, and the deprived of the constructive ideas of the Rangers team at no time seemed close to the equation.
After the Rangers' game, they took off to the sixth place, and Livingstone is already third, leaving the second Hibernian only on the head of the difference.
For Rangers, there may be additional problems, as the side judge Calam Spence got a head wound after he was hit by a object that was obviously thrown out by guest fans.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that broke the Eur in the semi-finals of the Scotland League.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with the same Livingston's 11th, who pulled the point against Harts last week, and should be pleased with the way his aggressive team parsed all the actions of the opponent.
Rangers could dominate the ball, but Livingston did better in rare cases when they owned it.
They were supposed to note in the second minute when Menga made a touch of Scott Pittman against Alan McGregger, but the semi-protector missed a good opportunity.
Later, the Kygan Jacobs center of the faul found Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in protection Alan Litgou pulled the ball away from the back grede.
Rangers took control of the game, but they failed to create nothing containing in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought that there should be a slip in the 15th minute when he struck Steven Lawles, but Steven Thompson's referee rejected the claims of the Colombian.
Rangers only made two exact hits during the first half-time, but the former gateman from Ibrox Liam Kelly was easy to handle the head of Lasana Culibali and the weak shot of these Ejaria.
Although Livi's impact in the 34th minute was surprising with the ownership of the ball, it was fully earned.
Rangers never managed to handle Jacobs' deep center again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who coldly bleededed Menga for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacted to the vacation, changing Culibali with Ryan Kent and this shift almost immediately led to the result when the wing passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the strike.
Livingstone, however, continued to force guests to play in a comfortable for the household style of the game, such as Litgou and Halket constantly screwed the advanced long balls.
Holt's team could have increased his front in the last minutes, but McGregger managed to handle Jacobs' hit, and at the next corner of Litgow shot with the head next door.
The entrance as a reservation of Glenn Midlton from Rangers asked for a hook at the end of the fight after Jacobs' fighting, but Thompson didn't see anything wrong again in the situation.
Anniversaries: Inventor of the gaiger counter
Page of our Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BroENE... the day the future physicist Johan Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany was born.
Gaiger develops a method of detection and measuring radioactiveness, an inventory, which eventually leads to the creation of a device known as a gaiger numberer.
A collapse stone in science since then, the gaiger counter turned into a cornerstone of pop culture, when in 1950 the Coronado Cambanes came up with the apparently incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: “What, for God, is this?
Rogers: This is a gaiger counter and is used to discover radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these listeners on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms separated from radioactivities in minerals."
Evans: “It certainly cares right now! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th birthday.
But the discovery that brings his name continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells
A new vaccine against cancer can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation into the lab
Then they can "see" protein that is common for many types of cancer and is injected again in the patient
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancer diseases.
A woman treated with the vaccine that trains the immune system to recognise foreign cells saw her cancer of eggs disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation into the lab, so that they can "see" protein common to many types of cancer called HER2 and then be injected again in the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofski of the National Oncological Institute of the United States in Bethesa, Maryland: “The results suggest that we have a lot of promising vaccine. ”
HER2 “suppresses the growth of several types of cancer”, including breasts, eggs, lungs and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
Similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and their "training" to cancer cells was used for treatment of leukemia.
Kenny West made a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat with the title "Let us make America great again", with its participation in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was whistled in the studio during Saturday Night Live after making an insensitive implementation in which the President of the United States Donald Trump said he would be candidated for president in 2020.
After he performed his third song for the evening called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the label "Let us make America large again," he declared against the democrats and said his support for Trump.
"I often speak with whites, and they ask me, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL started the show with Matt Damon's participation, in which the Hollywood Star screwed up the testimony of Brett Cavanah before the Senate Legal Commission for Sexual Violence complaints made by Christine Blazey Ford.
Although it wasn't emitted, West's performance record was mounted into social networks from a comic Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to ridicule West with his publication.
Furthermore, West complained in front of the audience that he had problems behind the towers about his hat.
"I was tortured behind the towers.
They told me, "Don't go out with that hat."
I've been hampered!
And then they say I'm on a drowning ship," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the drowning ship?" claiming that he will wear Superman's suit, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
The comments caused at least two screams from the audience and the SNL team members seemed ashamed, Variety said, as one of them said, "the whole studio shut up."
West was invited at the last moment to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, McMiller, died a few days ago.
West confused many with the song "I Love it", dressed as a bottle "Perier".
West received support from the TPUSA Conservative Group manager, Candes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of the most brave: Thank you for making the crowd right.”
But the leader of the show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was just "he was himself and that's great."
"But I choose not to reward a man (as I buy music or clothing or support his art), whom I think he welcomes and disseminates ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That's what we are," she added.
Before the show, the raper reported on Twitter that he changed his name, as now "he is officially known as Kenny West."
He's not the first artist who's changing his name, and he follows the example of Deedy, also known as Puff Deady, Puffy and P. Deedy.
His friend, the rapper Snoop Dog, was called Snoop Lion, and the music legend of Prince changed his name with a symbol.

The star of "Igran a thrones" Keith Harrington is against the toxic manhood
Keith Harrington is famous for the role of the waving sword John Snow in the full of violence a medieval fantasy series of NGO "Igrane of thrones".
But an acter, who is 31, declared against the macheotype of the hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen leads to that youths often think that they must be "raw" to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something was wrong" and asked us how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the age of #MeToo.
Keith, who recently married his partner from Rose Leslie's Game of thrones, also 31 years old, admits that he feels "sure" that this problem should be solved.
"I am personally firmly convinced at the moment - what did we do about manhood?" he said.
"What do we teach growing men about the problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television may partially be responsible for increasing the toxic manhood because of many male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What do you teach from television and on the street that makes the boys feel like they should become this specific type of men?
I think this is really one of the great issues of our time - how do we change it?
'Cause obviously something's confused for young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the prehistory or continuation of the "Game of thrones" after the end of the summer series, claiming that he was "finished with battlefields and horses".
Since November, Keith will play part in the reconstruction of the Real West of Sam Shepherd, the history of the film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that meeting with his wife Rose was the best thing that happened in the Game of thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so so he gave me my future family and set my life ahead," he said.
Rose plays Igrit, the girl where the hero of Keith John Snow falls in love with a fantasy series, an Amy's award bearer.
The two married in June 2018 in the name of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a jump with 14% of the number of citizens living with HIV and back.
According to health services in the country, more than 820 000 people have been affected.
Only during the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases have been caused by sexual contacts, which notes a change compared to the past.
Traditional HIV is rapidly distributed into certain parts of China as a result of the transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV thus has been taken down almost to zero, said China's health services at the Yunnan Province Conference.
However, each year, the number of those living with HIV and back in China increases by 100,000.
Transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminated in China, but discrimination against people in the CGBT communities was widespread.
According to studies due to conservative values, 70-90% of men who had sexual contacts with men eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of transmission of diseases are due to incorrect protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of the efforts to address the problem.
Maxin Waters denies the expiry of the senator's data from the Republican Party, slaughtering "dangerous lies" and "theories of conspiracy"
On Saturday, a member of the United States Chamber of Representatives Maxin Waters condemned the accusations that a member of her team published personal information to three state senators from the Republicans on the websites of the Wikipedia legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles said that the statements were made by experts and sites on the Ultra Right Wing.
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement in Twitter.
Published information includes home addresses and phone numbers of state senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hutch, who are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person by the Capitol during the hearing of the Senate's composition on the accusations of immoral sexual behaviour against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanau.
The expiration is made after the three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of publications was linked to the Waters' office and released information about the member of her team, according to Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and is absolute lie," Waters continued.
“Article of my team – whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised by these fraud and false claims – is not in any way responsible for the expiry of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and is absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly caused online criticism, including the former Prime Minister of the White House, Ari Flysher.
"There is poison in this denial," Flysher wrote.
“This suggests that it does not have the temperament suitable for a member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be mad.
He shouldn't be acting challenging.
I shouldn't question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and balanced."
Flysher compared Waters' response to the criticism of Judge Cavano's democrats, who was accused by the critics that he also seemed mad during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republicans for Waters' place in intermediate elections, also expressed his opinion in Twitter.
"In fact, if it is true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had examined the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators will be disclosed," she continued, "and that they will be subjected to legal responsibility for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team."
Review of Johnny Englez Explodes again – the weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for references to Brexit in every new British film and it seems to apply to the renewal of an exchon-commedian, spy French for Johnny English, who launched in 2003 with Johnny Englez and returned in 2011 with "Johnny Englez returns".
Will self-dismitting and mimics that say how obvious it is that we're stupid become a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with a embarrassed eye and a gumed person has the permission to renew the things for the second time – his name is most important when it comes to a great comic creation intended for fans of the movies that do not speak English.
He, of course, is a stupid secret agent, who despite his strange claims for flattering has little of Clouseau, a few of Mr. Bina and a large part of the man who contributed with a note on the music theme Chariots of Fire at the ceremony of the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
Furthermore, it is originally based on the leaving chaos after itself a traveler and an international man whom Atkinson plays in already forgotten Barclaycard television ads.
In the last movie with Johnny English, there are or two nice moments.
I liked when Johnny Englez approached the helicopter, wearing in a medium-term armor, and for a short time, his helmet was stuck in his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to the physical comedy and apparent, but humor is quite weak and strangely excessed, especially when "serious" film brands such as "007" and "Mission impossible" include a dosage of comedy.
The humor seems to be directed rather to children than to the adults, but the crazy accidents of Johnny Englez, I think they're not innovative and focused, because they don't have Actinson's game reminds Mr. Bean.
Always the current prediction is that Britain is faced with serious problems.
Cyberhacker hacked the British super secret network of spying and revealed the identity of all operational agents for the horror of the deputy agent -- unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is induced and remembered the figure and has already suffered from a full break of political dispopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything she can for this kvazi-Tereza-May role, but there is nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that she should call a retired agent because all active agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a teacher in a squeaking center, who, however, teaches illegal lessons how to be an undercover agent: there are some good impacts here when England reconstructs a spy rock academy.
English was called to Whitehall for an emergency instruction and gathered again with his former long-year assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, a joyful role in which Vicki Pepperdin's talent is screwed up.
And so, Batman and Robin are again in the game to solve the big problems of the secret service of Her Majesty and face fatal beautiful Ofelia Buletova, played by Olga Kurillenko.
Meanwhile, the Minister-President is under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technological billionaire, who claims that he can solve British computer problems: the creepy Jason Walta, played by Jack Lacey.
Andanglish and Bo start their odissey from farses: dressed as waiters, burn the French restaurant; they create chaos when they slip into Walta's luxurious yacht; and English causes real anarchy when he's trying to use a helmet for virtual reality to recognize the interior of the Walta house.
All smiles are certainly taken from the previous movie, but since as sweet and buyneous, there's a lot more content for children.
It's a very medium product.
Just like in other movies about Johnny English, I continue to think: Can the British film industry not give Atkinson the role that corresponds to his talent?
Leiberists deny that they develop a plan to work four days a week, but to get a payoff for five
The Leiberist Party of Jeremy Corbin is considering a radical plan, according to which the British should work four weeks, but to receive a fee for five.
The party claims that he wants the company's bosses to provide economies made through the revolutionary artificial intellect (II) to workers by giving them another resting day.
She wants workers to enjoy the three-day weekend but to receive the same payment.
Sources say that the idea would "pass" the economic programme and the party's plans to shake the country for workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been approved by the Congress of Professionals as a way that workers can benefit from the change in the economy.
A higher source from the Leberist Party said to the Sunday Times: "It is expected before the end of the year to be reported to revise the policy.
"It will not happen immediately, but the four-day working week is an effort that is included in the economic rebalance approach for workers, as well as in the common industrial strategy of the party."
The Laberist Party will not be the first one that has such an idea. The Green Party has promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, at present, this aim does not meet the approval of the entire layberist party.
Leberist speaker said: "The four-day working week is not in the party's policy."
The Chancellor in the shadow John McDonalle used the conference of the layberists last week to reveal his vision of socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonall said he was determined to take the power back from the "no personal directors" and "speculants" in community services companies.
The plans of the Chancellor in the shadow also mean that the current shareholders in water supply companies may not receive their entire share, as the layberist government could impose “supports” on the basis of established violations.
Furthermore, he confirmed the plans to put employees in the company's boards and create privatisation funds for transfer of 10 per cent of net capital to private firms who can accumulate annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy speak "60 minutes ago" whether Cavano's investigation by the FBI could change their opinion.
The FBI investigation against Judge Brett Cavano slowed down the final vote of his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raised the question whether the findings of the bureau could make some of the senators of the Republican Party withdraw their support.
In the interview, emitted on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 minutes" Scott Pelly asked the senators from the Republican Party John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham whether the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I want to say, of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Cavano.
I called him after the event, after the statement came out, and asked him, ‘ Did you do it? ’
He was decisive, categorical and uncertain."
Graham's voice, however, seemed to be compromised.
"I have an opinion on Brett Cavano and to change it, there is a need for shocking charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett rejected it categorically," Graham added, turning to Christine Blassey Ford.
"And no one she mentioned but could confirm it.
It's been 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it at all help to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will be a host of the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event, which has an impressive composition of performers and also performs such an impressive mission: the elimination of poverty throughout the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in the large sea park, which will not only enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, but will also meet the real goal of the event – to remove the exceptional poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival launched in 2012 is a continuation of the Global Poverty project, an international protection group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who fight it actively.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (except if you don't want to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to fulfil a number of tasks or acts as voluntary participation, sending email to the world's leader, calling on the phone or connecting in another way to help raise awareness about their goal to eliminate poverty.
But how successful is the Global Citizen 12 years before he achieves his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concert a brilliant way to be convinced to require action or is just another case of so-callictism – people think they do something important when they sign online petition or send post on Twitter?
Since 2011, “Global Citizen” has recorded more than 19 million“ actions” of its supporters who insist on a variety of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion, which will affect the life of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
In the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and messages resulting from its actions, which have already been paid or collected at least $10 billion.
The group believes that the funds provided have already been directly influenced by nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include “Food Force” established in the UK partnership between investors and executors, engagement with “help the children to develop their full potential”, which promises to provide Rwanda $35 million to help to stop non-continuation in the country after more than 4700 posts are received in Twitter from “global citizens”.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn social injustice to non-food simply into a historic note," said Ambassador of Tracy Ulman's Food Force in April 2018 before the audience of a live concert in London.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions were taken, which urged Britain to improve mothers and children's nutrition, the government reported the financing of the project, the Food Force, which would reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of his CHVs on his website, asking: "Why do you think we can stop the extreme poverty?"
"Global Citizen" replied: "This will be a long and difficult road -- sometimes we fail and we will fail again.
But as with the great movements for civil rights and against the apartheid before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardie B, Janel Mona are only some of the performers of this year's event in New York, which will lead to Debora-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use marine forces to "bloc" and prevent energy exports – Minister of Interior Affairs
Washington may, if necessary, run to its marine forces to prevent the input of Russian energy products on the markets, including the Middle East, revealed the U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zink, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zink claims that Russia's engagement in Syria -- more specifically, where it works on the invitation of the legitimate government -- is a pretext to study new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just as they did in East and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"United States can, through our marine forces, ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zink addressed the attendance of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group with a non-stop target represented as the “good energy users” in the United States.
He intended to compare Washington's approaches to deal with Russia and Iran, noting that they are the same.
"The economic option for Iraq and Russia is, more or less, stimulating and replaceing fuel," he said, at the same time defined Russia as "pony with one number", with an economy depending on the fuels that are dignified.
The statements come at the moment Trump's administration has the task of strengthening the export of liquid gas to Europe, replaceing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this purpose, the officials in the Trump administration, including the US President itself, are trying to convince Germany to retire from the “inappropriate” project for the North Stream 2 tube, which, according to Trump, turns Berlin into “taker”.
Moscow emphasized several times that the pipeline for 11 billion dollars on the North Stream 2, which will double the existing capacity up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean economic project.
Kreml claims that the ruthless opposition of Washington to the project is simply directed for economic reasons and is an example of unloyal competition.
"I believe that we share the perspective, energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position caused a negative response from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leadership of the German industry, the Federation of German industry (DBDI), urged the United States not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third country is mixed with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German industry (BDI, after a recent meeting between the Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will look seriously" at the presidential candidacy in 2020, said the Senator of Massachusetts
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "see seriously" the presidential candidacy after the intermediate elections.
During the city council in Hollioke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering to candidate.
"It's time in Washington to enter women and repair our broken government, and that includes a woman on the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take serious consideration of the presidential candidacy."
Warren expressed his judgment on President Donald Trump during the city council, saying he "goes this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried about the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was honest with her criticism to Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Cavano.
At Twitter post on Friday Warren said "of course we need a FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a sociological study conducted on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think that it should be candidated in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be candidated, according to the Suffolk University of Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent have supported this candidacy.
The sociological study showed more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent and 48 per cent against.
Other senior representatives of the Democratic Party discussed on potential candidation in 2020 include the former Vice President Joe Byden and the Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden said he would make an official decision in January, Associated Press reported.
Sara Palin pointed out the PTSP of Track Palin at the Donald Trump triumph
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after writing in September.
He was arrested and accused of a domestic violence incident on Monday night
"What my own son passs through after he returned, is known to other families that feel the consequences of the PTSR and some of the wounds with which our soldiers are coming home," she said before the audience of the Donald Trump show in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans of the war that "they returned to a little changed, crooked, returned and wondered if they would receive the respect that they and their brothers gave to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska and accused of attack and domestic violence against a woman, included in the domestic violence report and weapons possession in an impressive state, according to Dan Bennett, speaker of the Vasil police administration.
18 states and district Colombia support the controversy of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the county of Colombia support the judicial controversy of the new US policy, which denies asylum to victims of gangster and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a request for goodwill in Washington in support of the asylum-seekers and contesting the policy, reports NBC News.
The entire name of the prosecutor in the case "Grace v. Sesions", which the US Civil Freedom Union has filed against federal policy in August.
She claims that her partner "and the sons of the cruel members of his gang" abused her, but US officials rejected the asylum request on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The state lawyers who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, as nations faced a comprehensive problem with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has returned the decision of the Appeal Board of Immigrants since 2014, allowing immigrant documents to flee from domestic violence to apply asylum.
The Colombian Attorney Carl Rusin said on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law."
"The Federal Law requires that all asylum applications be considered under specific facts and circumstances and that prohibition violate this principle," said the report of goodwill.
Furthermore, the lawyers claim in the report that the policy that refuses to enter immigrants is harmful to the US economy, pointing out that it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and "to provide the necessary labour hand."
In June, the Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sesions ordered judges in immigration cases to stop providing asylum to victims running from domestic abuse and gang violence.
"The asylum is given to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear for race, religion, nationality or membership in a specific social group or political belief," said Sesions in their message of 11 July on politics.
The asylum was never meant to relieve all problems -- not all serious -- people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate efforts to rescue in Palo while deaths are doubled during the search of survivors
The situation for survivors is getting more difficult.
"I feel very tense," said 35-year-old Mother Risa Kusuma, calming her sick boy in the evacuation center in the desolate city of Palu.
"Each minute, an ambulance wears more bodies.
The clean water is poor."
The inhabitants are noted to return to their destroyed homes to try to save something from their flooded stuff.
Thousands of people are wounded, and hospitals damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 are filled.
Some of the injured, including Dvi Harris, who suffered the breakdown of the back and shoulder, was located outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients are treated openly due to the continuing secondary straws.
His eyes are filled with tears when he remembered how he felt the cruel earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed in the ruined wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he came to town with the family to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of quarrel with "propaganda advertising"
One week after the official newspaper in China released a four-page advertisement in the American daily for mutual benefits from trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador in China accused Peking of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump called on China Daily's paid publication in Des Moines Register – the most selling newspaper in the state of Iowa – after accusing China of an attempt to interfere with the US convention on 6 November.
Trump's accusation that Pecky is trying to interfere with the elections for the American Congress, pointed out what American officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign for pressure against China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise trade promotion, Beijing and Washington are currently participating in an escalating trade war in which import tariffs are equipped between countries.
According to US and China experts at the beginning of the trade war, customs tariffs in China were intended to strike exporters in the states like Iowa, supporting the Republican Trump Party.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador in China and the former long-year Governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in a comment in the Sunday number of Des Moines Register, “in the moment it doubles this obstacle by putting advertising in our own free press.”
"In the promotion of its propaganda, China's government is using the respected tradition in America for freedom of speech and press, by launching a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," says Branstad.
"As opposed to that, the press down the street here, in Beijing, you will find limited statements and you will not see the real reflection of the various views that the Chinese people can have in relation to the anxious economic trajectory of China, taking into account that the media are under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the proposal to publish” his article, although he does not specify exactly who.
With Cavano's invasion, the Republicans disturb voting women for intermediate elections, warning analysts
Since many of the highly esteemed Republicans stand behind and protect the nominations for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano, regarding several sexual attack charges, the analysts warned that there would be a response, more specific than women, during the coming intermediate elections.
The emotions around the barrel are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue voting.
These things can't be restored," said Grant Raher, a Politology Professor at Maxwell University in Syracuse, in front of the Hill for the article published on Saturday.
Rahher said he doubts whether the insistance at the last moment of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for the FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national speaker on the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to Washington's newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters scanded "November coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate's corridor, as the Republicans who control the judicial committee decided to continue with Cavano's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blassey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded," Stu Rotenberg told the news, a non-party political analyst.
"People say the problem is already serious; that is true.
But it may become even more serious, especially among the women's voters in the suburb and the younger voters, between 18 and 29 years of age, which often do not vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, describeing her sexual assault charges against the nominations of the Supreme Court, the analysts suggest that the replies may be followed if the Republicans insisted on confirming the candidacy.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the vote of the committee, the final vote or whether Cavano is placed on the chamber. It's about how the Republicans deal with it and how they treat it," said Gay Cesil, director of Priorities of the United States, a group that helps choosing democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided about whom to believe as a result of the testimony of Ford and Cavano, slightly more branching towards the second.
A new sociological study from YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents are certain or likely to believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say that they definitely or likely believe Cavano.
Furthermore, 38 percent say that Cavano, according to them, probably or surely lied during his testimony, while 30 percent claim the same for Ford.
After Flake's insisting, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's claims, as well as at least another prosecutor, Debora Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath in front of the Senate's judicial committee that Cavano attacked her in an impressive state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed his genitalia before her while they were at the party during her follow-up to Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Burners-Lee starts the beginning that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in the field of technology, Inrupt, is a company that builds a platform with open code of Burners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company Burners-Lee, it is a joke that the intention behind Inrupt is “the world domination”.
"We need to do it now," he said about the beginning.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "online storage of personal data" or sub.
It contains lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional instruments.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are accessible through each browser, and at the same time all of them at the same time.
The unique in the online storage of personal data is that the user determines which information has access to.
The company calls it "authorization of personal data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the executive director of John Bruce, is the company to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become available to all.
The company is currently composed of Burners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a number of developers concluded a project contract and a group of volunteers programmers.
Since this week, world technology developers can create their decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a full change, or not when all their business models are updated completely for one night.
"We do not want permission from them."
In the media publication on Saturday, Burners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission was to provide energy for trade and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid basis.
In 1994, Burners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical Institute.
During the past months, Burners-Lee has a strong influence in the debate on the net neutrality.
Although initiating Inrupt, Burners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic for this new era on the Internet," Burners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: In memory of a priest who was acquired with a cross Victoria during World War I
It is noted for 100 years in the hometown of the only English priest devoted to Victoria's involvement in warfare during the First World War.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Van won the prize on September 29, 1918 at the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he was killed by a sniper, without knowing that he was honored with the highest military honours of Great Britain.
The memorial was discovered on Saturday by his two grandchildren, at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said that it was “extremely symbolic” that the monument was discovered for exactly 100 years from his grandfather's case, honoured with medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin “in a very thick fog and under a severe shooting of artillery and cartridges. ”
Later he attacked the fire line, and with the "incredible courage" he led forward before he attacked an artillery gun with one hand and killed three of the crew.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were “what I know I could never do, but it makes me humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, set a vein after the parade led by the Brantwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he was "a great honor to participate in the parade" and added "the advantage of the real hero is demonstrated by support that will be granted to many."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine that you wait all night to watch the full edition of Bellator 206 and finally you can't be witnessed the main event.
The San José programme contained 13 fights, including six of the main map and had to be emitted live at night in Britain by Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mussassi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the British viewers remained embarrassed when the transmission changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed since they were built until early hours, especially because of the fight.
The fan described in Twitter the switching of a child animation film as a "some painful joke".
"The government regulates that at 6 p.m. this content is inappropriate, so the program has been changed by child transmission," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president of the Bellator marketing and communications, in response to the issue of the emission.
"Peppa pig," yes.
The President of the company Bellator Scott Cocker said they would work on the planning of the meetings to include British viewers in the future.
"I think, when it comes to repeating, we can solve the problem," Koker said.
"But there is six a.m. on Sunday and there is no way to plan things so that the event will be held on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we received a lot of messages and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But he wasn't like that, he was government.
I can promise you that next time this won't happen.
We will stick to the inclusion of five fights instead of six -- as we usually do, and we have tried to provide ourselves more to the fans, but we have overcome.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt "niversal" because of his sexuality
The Olympic jumper in the water Tom Daily says he grew up, feeling less than everyone else because of his sexuality -- but it motivated him to succeed.
24-year-old sportsman claims that until he started to study in high school, he didn't realize that "not everyone is like me."
In an interview on the first issue of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he talks about the gay rights to give "nadea" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he started interested in less than the winning of the Olympic Games.
The Permanent Head of the Long Year Show, Crusty Yang, is in hospital for a few months.
When he participated in Lavern Daily's first program, he said he felt "minor" than everyone else while he grew up, because "that was socially acceptable to love girls and boys."
He said: “To date, the feeling of minority and the fact that I'm different from others are actually things that give me energy and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove it “this is something,” he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when he finally learned about his sexuality.
Duplex Olympic Bronze Medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used its participation in this year's Britain Community Games in Australia to invite more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said that he did this because he was happy to live openly, without consequences and wishes to inspire the “nade ” of others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man - American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, he was "with surprised."
Daily married Oscar's owner, who is 20 years older than he last year, but claims that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you go through so much as you are so young," he participated for the first time in the 14-year-old Olympic games, and his father died of cancer three years later," he said, "this is hard to find someone at your age who has experienced similar climbs and falls."
They both became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black Daily, and Daley himself said that his "the whole view" changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would tell you that I would only be interested in wining a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was called his father Robert, who died in 2011 when he was 40 years old after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daily said that his father couldn't accept that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for the Olympic Games in London in 2012 – because he wanted to be on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, "You won't be with me, Dad, nor in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand until I stopped breathing and at the moment when I realized he was dead, I finally confessed that he was not in vulnerable," he said.
The next year Daily competed in the Olympics in 2012 and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that I've dreamed about this all my life -- jumping on the Olympic games in front of the audience at home. There was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – "Proud" from Heather Smoll – which was accompanied by him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and still made him feel awkward.
Desert Island Discs is transmitted on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday from 11:15 p.m., British summer time.
Michelson's lost form remains on the Rider Cup chamber on Saturday
The American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Rider Cup, but he'll have to return his old shape if he doesn't want his record to be related to failure.
Michelson, who was participating in the two-year event for the 12th record, was left on the chamber by Captain Jim Fuhrrick for the Fourball and Foursom matches on Saturday.
Instead of being a major figure again in the United States team, the five-time major tournament winner spent his day as a fan and in training his impacts from a distance with the hope to correct his weaknesses.
48-year-old sportsman, who even at the top of his career has never been among the most lawful players, is not in optimum form for the difficult field of Le Golf National, where the long inequality field usually punishes every wrong strike.
And if the playground alone isn't enough anxious, on Sunday's ninth match Michelson will face the precise champion of British Open Francesco Molinari, who's in a team with a newman Tommy Flitwood and endeavors to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who leave four points before the 12th Single game make a strong start, it can turn out that Michelson's match is absolutely decisive.
Furic expressed confidence in his companion, although he could hardly say something much different.
"He fully understood his role today, beating my back, hugging me, and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furic said.
“He is confident in himself.
He is a member of the glory Hall and has given as much as in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing only two games.
I was expecting it to play more, but it just worked out, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf field and play, just like everyone else."
Michelson will improve Nick Faldo's records for the most games in Rider Cup, played on Sunday.
This could end his career in "Ryder Cup", which never approached his impressive individual achievements.
Michelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven equal matches, but Furic said his presence has other benefits for the team that are not measured with numbers.
"He's a funny, sarcastic, awesome, he likes to joke with people and is a great man for every team," he explained.
"I think younger players were having fun with him, especially this week.
He gives much more than just to play."
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the great frontiers can soon be melted.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows from personal experience that the great front of the single games from the last day of the Rider Couple, can be easily removed.
The Danish debutted in the 1997 Valderrama game, when the team with Captain Seve Ballisteros led five points before the Americans, but exactly on the final right was nearly captured and he barely succeeded in winning with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You continue to remind us that we had a great frontier of "Valderrama"; we also had a great front of "Brookline", where we lost, and on "Valderrama" we won, but very difficult," said Bjorn, after the team of Europe in 2018 won 5-3 sessions on Friday and yesterday, which led with 10-6 to Le Golf National:.
So the story has to show both me and everyone in the team that it's not all over.
Be ready for the attack tomorrow.
Get out and do what you need to do.
Nothing's over until you see the final results of the table.
We have a goal and she's trying to win this trophy, and that's exactly what we need to keep focused.
All the time I've been saying that I only think of 12 players in our team, but we're also aware of our rivals, who are the greatest players in the world."
An satisfying representation of the players at a difficult golf field, Bjorn added: “I would never have hurryed with the celebration.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will come out, and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you go out alone, then you test your entire capacity as a golf player.
This is the message that must reach the players: tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now you can turn your partner's back on your back, as he has to pass to the end."
Unlike Bjorn, the captain of the rival Jim Furic will want his players to represent themselves better individually than as partners, exclusively Jordan Speed and Justin Thomas, who took three of the four possible points.
The Furrick himself was on both sides of these great reverses on the last day – he was part of the Brookline triumph, and then a loser side, when the Europeans did the Medinah Wonder.
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to the question how Ben Crenshau, the captain in 1999, led his players in the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to make the same good start as you saw at "Brookline" and "Medinah".
When the advantage goes from one direction in the other direction, these intermediate matches play under a huge tension.
So we formed our composition and distributed our boys as we want to try to do the impossible tomorrow."
Tomas has been assigned to lead our counter-attack and to face Rory Macilroy at the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Yan Polter will meet the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
"I have chosen these players in this order, because I think that it gives us the greatest chances of success," Bjorn said for his choice for singles.
Germany retires the release of a new warship
The latest fregage of the German fleet was to be introduced in the operation in 2014 to replace the older battleships from the time of the Cold War, but this would not take place until the next year because of the incorrect systems and the mainly growing costs, local media reported.
The introduction in the operation of Rheinland-Pfalz, the leading ship on the brand of new fregats from Class Baden-Wuerttemberg, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, quoted by the army speaker.
The vessel was to join the maritime forces in 2014, but the problems that occurred after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, ordered by the fleet in 2007, will replace the older fregates of the Bremen class.
It is understandable that they will have powerful weapons, a set of aircraft and anti-board missiles, as well as some stelth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acustical signals.
Other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods – the latest fregates should be able to be used up to two years before they return to the ports of home.
The continuous delays, however, mean that the adventurous military ships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power beyond the ocean – will be old when they enter the operation, Die Zeit notes.
The accidental fregage F125 entered the titles last year when the German fleet officially refused to release the vessel in operation and returned to the Blohm & Vosss ship in Hamburg.
That's the first time the fleet returns the ship to the ship after delivery.
It is not known about the reasons for return, but the German media quoted a number of substantial "software and hardware defects", which make the military ship unused if it is sent to a military mission.
Software deficiencies are particularly important, since the sailing vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of the older fregates of the Bremen class.
Furthermore, it turns out that the ship is significantly overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and limits the possibility of the marine forces to add future superstructures.
It is considered that the 7000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is twice harder than the ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price of the entire project, including the training of the crew, also becomes a problem.
It is believed to have reached the incredible EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the latest fregates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's sea forces are swifting.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the German Parliament Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet is actually "is exhausted from ships capable of missions".
The official said that the problem has grown larger in time, since the old ships have been taken out of operation, but no new ones have been provided.
He complained that no fregage of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be included in the fleet.
The National Trest tracks the secret life of the sticks
A new study carried out in the Scottish mountains aims to determine how stickers use the landscape when they hunt.
The hopes are that the discoveries will bring a new light on the behavior of unique flying bowls and will help to manage future protection action.
Study by scientists from the National Trst of Scotland will follow the often encountered stickers, as well as brown arrows water nights in Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed on key places in the property to track the activities of the stickers during the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
The expert audio analysis of all records will set the frequency of the call sounds of the sticks and which types they issue.
The map of the location and report will then be drawn up to create a detailed landscape of their behavior.
Rob Duar, Nature Protection Adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will disclose which zones from the residence are most important for the sticks and how they are used by any kind.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management of the site, such as the creation of leathers, and the best way to maintain the mountain area for the sticks and other related species.
The popularities of stickers in Scotland and Britain generally decreased significantly in the past century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their asylums and lead to loss of accommodation.
The risk of populations may be of wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and certain chemical processing of construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, the sticks aren't blind.
However, because of their hunting habits in the night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a robbery.
They use an improved echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles on their flying trajectory.
NTS, responsible for care for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the sticks very seriously.
The throat has trained experts conducting regular research, asylum inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first in Scotland and the only special reservation for stickers in the property of Threave in the area of Dumfries and Galaway, which is a home of eight of the ten types of sticks in Scotland.
The estate manager David Thompson says it's a perfect territory for them.
"Here, in Threave, we have a great field for the stickers," he noted.
"We have old buildings, many adult trees and completed suitable accommodation.
But there are many more things about the sticks that are not known, so the work we do here and in other property will help us understand better what they need to do to prosper."
It emphasizes that it is important to verify the presence of sticks before the holding activities are carried out, as unwilling destruction of a shelter is possible to kill up to 400 female and young stickers, as well as to destroy the entire local population.
The sticks are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, torment, disturb or destroy their asylums.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee in the Trust to protect the sticks, encouraged the society to help.
She said: “I still have a lot to learn about our sticks and about many of our species, because we just don’t know what happens to their populations. ”
Ronaldo rejects claims for rape and his lawyers will judge German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo identified the claims for rape against him as a "fake news", saying that people "will become famous" using his name.
His lawyers will judge the German journal Der Spiegel, which published these claims.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping American Catherine Mayorga in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It's alleged that then he paid her $755,000 to silence the incident, said Der Spiegel on Friday.
In the Instagram video, turning to its 142 million followers, a few hours after the publication of the statements, the 33-year-old Ronaldo slaughtered the publication as “fake news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is a false news," the Five-time Goldball carrier said in front of the camera.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to accumulate popularity on my back, but that's part of the work.
I'm a happy man and it's all right," the football player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to judge Der Speegel's claims that call the “inadmissible publication of suspicion in the field of personal life”, according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Shertz said that the football player would ask for compensation for "moral damage in size corresponding to the burden of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
It is claimed that the incident occurred in June 2009 in the apartment in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the football room, where he claimed to have raped her analytically, according to the documents filed in the district court of Clarke in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell down on his knees and told her he was a "good boy" of "99%", but in the case he just surrendered to "one percentage".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that happened with her consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial agreement, because she felt "scared of revenge" and was worried that she would not "be publicly humiliated".
A 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the agreement because she continues to live with the injury of the incident.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was on the edge to join Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer moved to the Italian Grand Yuventus for the amount of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will "regret forever" that she lost car manufacturers
Great Britain "will regret forever" if he loses his world leadership's status in the production of cars after Brexit, the Secretary of the Business Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "restraining" that Toyota UK said to BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnastone, near Derby.
"We need a deal," he said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the delay of the border in the case of Brexit without a deal could lead to a loss of jobs.
In the Burnastone Factory – where models of Auris and Avensis are produced last year, nearly 150,000 cars were produced, 90% of which were exported to the other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Burnastone.
Other car manufacturers from Britain, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, says they'll close their factory for the Mini model in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks of supply chain in the cases of Brexit without a deal.
Toyota's production line is working on the principle “as exactly in time” and the parts arrived every 37 minutes from the suppliers both from Britain and the EU for vehicles manufactured on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be problems on the border, which, according to the industry, can lead to delays and lack of parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to wait more than one day to fill their inventory in the Darbisher factory, they said from the company, and that's why the production will stop.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's "Chess" plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We need to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success but also to be able to grab this opportunity," he said in the program 4's Today of BBC Radio.
"After not only Toyota's claims but also other producers, we are absolutely convinced that we should be able to continue to provide successful supply chains."
Toyota cannot tell how long the production will be stopped, but in a longer term, they warn that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Zillaris, who has worked in Burnastone for 24 years and is the founder of the Union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “I believe that if these jobs go away, they will never return.
The government speaker said: "We have set up a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
An extremely important meeting between Donald Trump with Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein can be "continued for another week", since the fight of the candidate for the Supreme Court, Bret Cavano reported the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein observes the work of special advisor Robert Muller, who investigates the Russian intervention in the elections, the links between Tramp and Russia's assistants and the potential obstacle to justice by the President.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Chief Prosecutor, or not in this way, threaten Mueller's independence, he has been feeding rumors for months about Washington.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to write the talks with Trump and the possibility to remove the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denies that claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting with him was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would "ne" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the hearing before the Senate's legal committee, which was witnessed both Cavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment - Dr. Christine Blazey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation by the FBI on complaints against Cavano, even more delaying the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's speaker, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Sunday in Fox News.
When she was questioned about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date may not yet be determined, but seeing all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court, I think it may also be delayed for the next week.
But we will see, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference from the White House of September 10th.
The leader of the show Chris Wallace asked about the reason.
Sanders replied that rare press conferences were not due to “demonstrative behaviour” of television journalists, although he said:“I can't say I'm disagreeable with the fact that they have demonstrative behaviour.”
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President has more sessions with questions and answers from each president before him," she said, in addition, without quoting evidence: "We have checked these statistics."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but "if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is far better than to talk to me.
We are trying to do this often and you are witnesses to practice it quite often in the past weeks, and that will replace the press conferences after you have the opportunity to talk to the President of the United States."
The Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with high-level guests.
The independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president may show why, with his eccentric and moments of strange behaviour in front of the gathered journalists.
Health Minister has contacted EU workers in the Scotland National Health Service on the fears related to Brexit
The Health Minister has writtenly turned to the EU staff working at the Scotland National Health Service to express the appreciation of the State and their wish to stay in place after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scotland parliament, sent a letter to less than six months before the EU's exit.
The Scotland government has already been engaged with costs for established procedures for EU citizens' status working in decentralized public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "In the summer the talks between Britain and the EU on the leave continued, and the decisions were expected during the autumn.
But the UK government also progresses in its preparations for a possible scenario without a deal.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain period for all of you.
Therefore, I want to remind myself how much I appreciate the contribution of each servant, no matter his nationality.
Colleagues from all the EU and beyond it contribute with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which is useful for the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would like you to stay here."
Christian Abercromby suffered an emergency surgery after he got a head trauma
Lienbaker of Tennessee State Tygers, Christian Abercromby, suffered an emergency operation after he got a head trauma during the Saturday meeting, when his team lost from Vanderbilt Commodores with 31-27, reported Mike Authority from Tennessee.
The senior trainer of Tennessee State, Rod Reid, told the reporters that the injury happened just before the half-time.
"He went to the sideline and somehow just fell there," said Reid.
Coaches and medical persons provided Abercrombi oxygen to the sideline before it was placed on the carpet and was taken into the dressing rooms for additional review.
Tennessee State's official confirmed in front of Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercromby was out of surgery in Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that “there are no details on the type/seriousness of the trauma” and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercromby, a second-year student with college scholarship, is for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday he made a total of five blockages before he left the game, which makes a total of 18 blockages for him in this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher herb warrant in buying real estate in Great Britain
According to the new conservators' plans, foreign buyers will be charged with a higher herb warrant in buying real estate in Great Britain, with additional funds to help the homeless.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
Increasing in the herb warrant will affect those who do not pay taxes in Britain
State custody expects an increase of over 120 million British pounds a year, which will be helped by homeless
Teresa May will announce today the decision by foreign buyers to pay a higher herb warrant in buying real estate in Britain, while additional income will go to help the homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters, promised more accessible housing and directed to people with high income.
Increasing the herb warrant will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain, while additional revenues will help the Government's efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The supplement – which is a supplementary to the current herb warrant, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second housing and property purchased for the purpose of dedication - may be up to three per cent.
The state custody expects the proceedings to increase by up to 120 million British pounds a year.
About 13% of the new buildings in London are purchased by people with citizenship outside the Great Britain, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for those who buy property for the first time to intervene in the property market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become “the ghost cities” because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new policy appears only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the herb warrant to help more young people own their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining high prices of property by robbing the land, but not using it, and asked Mrs. May to leave the quotas for accessible housing in order to fix the "happiness with the housing" of Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reforms, including control of rents and ending the exile "no guilt".
He also wishes to provide councils with greater powers to build new homes.
Ms. May said: " Last year I shared that I would like to devote my time as a prime minister to restore the British dream -- life of every new generation to be better.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be with open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not right for those who do not live in Britain and foreign companies to buy as easy as those who work hardly in Britain.
For too many people, the dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the distress from sleeping on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: “My country aim is to run the Scotland team. ”
Sunderland's manager Jack Ross said "the greatest ambition" in his career is to be a senior coach of the Scotland national team.
The 42-year-old Scotch accepted the challenge to restore the northeastern England club, which is currently at the third position in the First League, at three points from the first place.
He passed to the Stediam of the Light this summer after the last season was performed by St. Mirren back to the Scotland High League.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I wrote one game for B team and that was all," Ross told the Scotland BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up with the Scotland games of Hampdon, which, as a child, we watched with my father, so the national team always attracted me.
"But this opportunity would only be opened if I had a success at the club level."
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's managers are names such as Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Alderdays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canyo.
Aloa Atletic's former teacher said he did not feel anxious as heir of such firm names in a famous club, as he had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"To me, the success will now be measured with a positive answer to the question "Can I bring this club back to the High League?"
Because on structure, base and conditions, he is certainly at the level of the High League," he said.
"It's not easy to go back to the highest football level, but I will accept that I have achieved success here only if I manage to bring the team back there."
Ross was only the manager for three years after he spent some time as a assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months in Harts' coach headquarters.
Then he helped Aloa not fall into the Third Division and turned St. Mirren from the falling team to the winner in the Championship next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than during his career at Clyde, Hartlipool, Folkerk, St. Miron and Hamilton Academycle.
"I was really on the cross," he remembered the time he took Aloa.
"I really believed that being the manager was the best place for me, including before I was an active player.
It sounds weird because I was doing good, making good money, and I had some significant success.
But being a player is sometimes hard.
There's a lot of things you need to deal with every week.
I'm still faced with the same levels of stress and tension in work, but I just feel that being the manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be the manager and now, when I really do, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin throughout my conscious life."

Perfect beer time is 5:30pm on Saturday, reveals research
The summer heat increases the income of the fighters to survive British pabs, but has accumulated more tension for the chains of restaurants.
The pub groups and bars reported an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but the revenues in the restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, the statistics indicated.
Peter Martin, a business consultant CGA, which composed the statistics, said: “Because of the long suntime and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Championship, in July, there is a similar model as June, when the pubs reported to increase by 2.8 percent, but restaurants received even stronger impact.
The drop of 1.8% in the restaurant business in June just declined in July.
The pabs and drink bars reported the best results in their growth, compared to the lowering movement of restaurants.
The food pabs also suffered from the suntime, but not as much as the owners of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
In the pabs and bars, the sales of drinks jumped by 6.6 percent per month, while there is a 3% reduction in food."
Paul Newman, analysts of rest and entertainment, told RSM: “These results continue the trend we noticed at the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sale in the outside service sector.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a decrease in sales with 4.8% of the annual base may be particularly painful in addition to permanent costs.
The long hot summer could not appear at a worse time for food managers and only time will show whether the moderate temperatures we experienced in August will bring the desired rest."
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new discoveries, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the delay in the expansion of the marks.
Coffer Peach Tracker, analyst of sales in the pab sector, bars and restaurants in Great Britain, collects and analyses data on the implementation of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover over 9 billion British pounds, and is established in the industry.
One of five children hides a secret profile from their parents in a social network
One of five children — some only 11 — has a secret profile in a social network that hides from their parents and teachers, discovered a study
Study conducted among 20,000 students from high schools shows the growth of false Insta pages
The news has raised fears of posting materials with sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "core" profile that showed their parents
One of the five children — some in 11 creates a profile in a social network that keeps secret from adults.
Study among 20,000 students from high schools shows growth in false Insta accounts – reference to the Instagram Photo Sharing website.
The news raised the fears that materials with sexual content were published.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a cleaned "core" profile that showed their parents and also had secret profiles.
A mother who met on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager child, which encouraged others to rape him.
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of independent schools found that 40% of children between 11 and 18 years have two profiles, and half of them recognize that they keep their profiles in secret.
The HMC head, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's anxious that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Alyd Doyle will be the athlete's voice at the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland
Alyd Doyle was elected to join the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland as director without executive functions of the annual general meeting of the governing authority.
Doyle is a mild athlete of Scotland with most achievements and Chairman Ian Beatty defines this move as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead in sport, to benefit from its rich experience at the international level in the last decade.
"Aylid is rejoiced with great respect in the meek athletic communities of Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that the mild athletic in Scotland will benefit greatly from its attraction," said Beatty.
Doyle said: “I have the desire to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope I really can contribute and help promote sports in Scotland. ”
The American, who won the finals of 200 and 400 meters of the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, added to its four Olympic gold medals, and currently is a regular commentator in BBC, lost the ability to walk after he received a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I got a hit a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will show if I'm going to recover and to what extent.
It was an exhausting job, but I have achieved full recovery, I learned to walk again, and today I am doing movement training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertisement for feed pump comparing mothers to cows divided online opinions
The company produced feed pumps divided online opinions with advertising, which compares breast mothers to cows that are breast-feeding.
In order to note the marketing of the expected “first silent feed pump in the world suitable for carrying”, the Elvie company released a jokeful musical-video advertisement to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump provides to breastfeeders.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barrel, full of shadow, on the background of a song with text, which includes: "Yes, I do, but you don't see any tail" and "If you didn't notice, it's not vime, it's my breasts."
The song continues: “Pump, pump, feed the babies with them, pump, pump, pump, breastfeed your friends. ”
However, the advertising published on Facebook the company's website caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, and many claim that it reduces the “crowds” of the milk processing industry.
“It is a very stupid decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and born to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth," someone wrote.
Elvie Feed Pomp is collected discreetly in a breast suit (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is fully understandable that it is traumatic both for both mother and for the baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a mother-feeding pump that can keep their babies?"
Another one added: “So inadequate advertising. ”
Others protected the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she considers the song "exclusively fun."
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I would have bought one if I was still breast-feeding.
It made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a little rat, but I accept it as it is.
This product is brilliant," someone wrote.
Another comment: “This is a funny advertisement directed to mothers who are sitting in their workplaces or toilets, and they feel like “cows. ”
This is not an advertisement that commends or condemns the milk processing industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they were dancing with discreet pumps placed in their suits.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who feed feel like cows.
Elvie Pomp is, however, completely silent, no wire or pipes and gathers discreetly in a suit for breastfeeding, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even to go out while they crush.
Anna Balarin, partner and Executive Creative Director in Mother, commented: “The Elvie Pomp is such a revolutionary product that he deserves a bold and provocative market release.
With the drawing of a parallel between the breast and the cows we wanted to focus on feeding and all the challenges related to this, while showing a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that will bring the new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie pumps get into the lead news.
During the Sunday of Fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the designer floor, Martha Jacobowski, using the product.
Thousands of migrants have been secretly transferred to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrants' detained children rapidly fell, although the monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, partly because a sharp rhetoric and policy by the Trump Administration has made the accommodation of children with guardians difficult.
Usually most guardians are immigrants without documents who fear to risk their stay in the country if they want to recognize the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential guards and other adults of the family should provide fingerprints, and those data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a high-level official in the Immigration and Customs Service, witnessed before the Congress that the Agency arrested tens of people who wanted to become guards of uncommunicated minors.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no previous criminal records.
“Nearly 80 per cent of those who are either guardians, or are members of the family of the guardians, live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these persons," Albens said.
In an effort to address the registration of these children, the authorities have made new rules that require some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, as the previous standard, according to the shelter officials.
Many appear in a video conference conversation, not in person to present their case for a legal status before an immigration judge.
Those that are defined as inappropriate for allowance will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer the children are detained, the more likely to become depressed or depressed, which can lead to violent explosions or escape attempts, according to the shelter officials and reports that have come out of the system over the past months.
Attorneys shared that this concern increased in large facilities, such as this in Tornilo, where the signs that a child has problems were more likely to be ignored because of the scale of the place.
They added that the move of children into the “flash city ” without giving them enough time to prepare at an emotional level or to say goodbye to their friends, could make many fighting with.
Syria urges US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In turn to the UN General Meeting, the Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although civil war has been on eight years.
Mualem, who is also bound by Deputy Minister-President, said that foreign troops are illegally residering in the Syrian country under the pretext of counter-terrorism and "them will be taken relevant action".
"They must be downloaded immediately and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Muallem urged that “the war against terror is almost to its end ” in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been forced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "to fight in this holy battle until all Syrian lands are cleaned" both by terrorist organizations and from "every illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish and Syrians, the opposition of President Bashar al-Asad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the lands of the country desolated by the war.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said that the conditions are tolerable and can be returned, accusing "some Western countries that they have "displaudless fears" that incite refugees to stand away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to cooperate for these returns," he said.
"They're turning into a political matter something that's a whole humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for Syria's recovery until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition to stop the war.
UN diplomats stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large fortress of rebels in Idlib provides an opportunity for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a wide range of attacks by the Russian Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
Muallem stressed, however, that the agreement had "jassy time" and expressed hope that military action would be directed to the dżihadists, including fighters of Al-Qaida Front Al Nusra, which would "be destroyed".
UN ambassador Stafan de Misstura hopes soon to summon the first meetings of the new committee composed of the government and the opposition to create a project of the Syrian consensus of war and to make the way to elections.
Muallem presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to the "review of the members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no intervention.
Why Trump wins the second mandate
In this logic, Trump will win the re-election of the elections in 2020, unless -- as many Liberal viewers are likely to hope – his presidentship will not be terminated in advance because of impishment and scandal.
This would certainly be the most dramatic end of presidency ever!
At the moment, there are no signs of the exhaustion of the watchers.
Since 2014, the Primtime rating has doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News have a average of 2.4 million viewers during the Priimtime, compared to 1.7 million years ago, according to Nelsen, and the "Receiver Maddow Show" of MSNBC is at the top at the cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million viewers at the evening with great news.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it is something we don't understand," says Neil Bayer, an executive producer of the ABC drama "The latest candidate", where it is described as a secretary of the office, who becomes president after the attack on the Capitol.
Nel Skovl, who is a veteran-scenarist of comedies and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking In the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the elections in 2016.
The taxi driver told her she would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked: “Why? ”
Mrs. Scowell told me he answered her "When he was laughing at me."
There's a mess in chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that is shown on TV, the Washington stories can define the future of Row v. Wade, whether immigrant families can gather again, as well as the good state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the desire to be a informed citizen does not correspond to watching a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses "deep historical information" as a source of his book "Strach"; Paul Manafort's pilot jacket of the strauss skin for $15,000 ("the drill of arrogance" according to Washington Post), and the stressing descriptions of Stormy Daniels on Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I specially will never look at Super Mario again the same way.
"A part of what he does to make you feel like a part of a riality show is to give you a little bit every evening," said Brent Montgomery, the chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the Creator of "Pawn Stars" as regards changing participants and daily addresses (afflicting with the National Football League, praising Kim Cheng Un).
You can't afford to miss one episode because you're going to stay away.
When I contacted Mr. Flyce this week, at the northern coast of Kauai was sunny, 80 degrees, but he closed at home to watching MSNBC, while recording CNN.
It could not be separated from the TV, especially when Brett Cavano had to face the Senate's legal committee, and it depended on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we used to make all those freaks and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of the Western Civilization," Mr. Flyce told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be right."

Investments are inputed into the most controversial race in pre-congress elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives a flow of money, thanks to the restructuring of the Congress's districts and from there two titlers for the same place.
Recently, the district in Pittsburgh's suburbs indicates the conservative democrat Connor Lamb, who won his place from another district of partial elections last spring.
Lamb faces another titler, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is substantially represented with the new 17th.
The maps were reimbursed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court scheduled in January that the old districts were anti-constitutionally manipulated for the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has broken the financial dispute between the main funding institutions of parties, the Democratic Congress Committee on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Commission on Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb came to Pennsylvania after the difficult victory in the widely discussed partial elections in March for the 18th Congress County of Pennsylvania.
The position was taken by the Republicans for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county with 20 points.
Political experts believe that democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States considers the imposition of sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China, and then retires
Diplomatics note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with a little pressure by Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heart meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017, and also owned a hotel in Panama, until the partners fired the management team of the Trump Organization.
The representatives of the Department of State decided to revoke the leaders of the diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, due to "the recent decisions to avoid recognition of Taiwan," said Heather Naurt, speaker of the Department earlier this month.
However, sanctions were foreseen only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received some 140 million US$ aid to combat drugs in order to develop and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, including the cutting of financial assistance and target visa restrictions, would be tormental to the Central America State with its unemployment and the percentage of murders.
With progress in internal meetings, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic well-being, which serves to continue such a gathering last year, considered as a step forward in the efforts to prevent the inflow of migrants to the United States.
But by mid September, the higher governance authorities stated that their wish was to take place in the conference, thus effectively ceased any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now vice president Mike Pens announced that he would participate in the conference planned for the mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the administration has given to the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new strict communications or sanctions from Washington.
The speaker of the White House for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the debate details described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, wished to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
Study History
The next move may be the report of Special Adviser Robert Muller on the possible obstacle of justice by Mr Trump, while the report is now a significant evidence in the public register.
It is claimed that Mr. Muller is directing his investigation and whether Mr. Trump has conspired with Russia during his campaign at their attack against our elections.
If the Congress leadership changes, it will turn out that Mr. Trump will have to report to this body, just when he is ready to face the voters, and perhaps to the jurymen composed of his colleagues.
There are many unknown here, and I do not impress that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - neither the likes of him in Europe.
We all, on both sides of the Atlantic ocean, have to make these elections that will affect how much the fight will extend.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to perform a state revolt against Hitler until the West was confused and supported by the Czechoslovacians in München.
We failed and missed the possibility of avoiding the next years of the slaughter.
The course of history depends on such hollow moments, and the unpleasant democracy's march is rushing or slowing.
Now, the Americans are faced with a few similar hollows of the moment.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires the Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested that he secretly write down the president and speculated with the opinion that it was not suitable for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein announced that the Times history was incorrect.
"How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Cavano, requested by the FBI, is not full or fair - or if it is approved for the Supreme Court, despite the accusations of sexual persecution and false testimony?
And most of all, would we vote in the preliminary elections for the Congress if that would force Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail in these trials, democracy is waiting for her for a long winter.
But I believe we're not going to fail because I've learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, who was taken to Auschwitz from the same Nazi regime as ever occupied my messenger home.
She survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later sent me to light the candles for Sabat on that table, wearing swastik.
With a heritage like this, how can I not be optimist for our future?"

Graham Dorance from Rangers is an optimist for the conflict with Rapid Vienna
Rangers are householders of Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians after the impressive equality in Spain against Villareal earlier this month will give them a considerable chance to move forward by the League Group of Europe.
Injury in the knee did not allow Graham Dorans to play his first season match before the questionnaire 2-2 with Villareal, but he believes that for Rangers this result could turn into a tramplin to greater achievements.
"We have won an important point because Villareal is a good opponent," a 31-year-old football player said.
"We went into a game with hope that we could win something and left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but as a whole equality seems to be fair.
They were better in the first half-time, and we were in the second.
We looked at Thursday, another big night of our games in Europe.
I hope we can fight for the three points, this will be a difficult match because they have achieved a good outcome in the last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience, we can do our best and achieve a good outcome.
Last year it was definitely difficult after everything that happened next to my injuries and changes in the club, but now things seem to go in the rules of direction.
The team is good, and the boys really have fun, training is useful.
I hope we will be able to intensify all our forces to forget the past season and achieve the desired success."
Women worry about fears about their pension savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of what care they want to receive, few people discuss this with family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study share that they discussed with their husbands the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent have talked to their children about this.
"The people want a family member to take care of them, but they have not taken steps to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the Nationwide life insurance sector.
Here's what you can start.
Talk to your husband and your children: You cannot prepare your family to provide your care if you don't announce your wishes in advance.
Together with your advisor and your family, discuss where and how you want to get anxiety, as these decisions can be a crucial factor in the determination of costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you with the idea of how to pay these costs.
Your decisions, when you choose a financial institution for long-term care, may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with monetary value to help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your funds – if you have cash resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Cope with the legal battles at the beginning.
Appoint a healthcare authority so that you have a certain trustee to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Consider also the idea of a financial authority.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are unavailable.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parents need an emergency medical care and travel to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Exhibit these details in writing to be prepared.
"It's not only a financial dimension but also what doctors will be," Martin asked.
"What are the meds?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make up your plan."

His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are trying to attract witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities announced, expecting the number of dead to grow.
Because of the interrupted communications, the subsidiary organisations cannot get information from the Dongala regent, the northern area of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnet of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palo after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, which are located on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province central Sulavesi, located at the end of the tight beach edge of the west coast of Sulavesi, with the population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquakes and tsunami were hit by it.
Dongala is a regent, which spreads more than 300 km (180 miles) on the coast edge of the island of Sulavesi.
The regency, which is less than a province, is with approximately 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the foundations of the province's economy central Sulavesi, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Nikel's profit is also important to the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morali, on the opposite coast of Sulaves.
Palu and Dongala have been summoned several times by tsunami over the past 100 years, according to the Indonezian Recovery Agency.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Tsunami struck the west part of Dongala and in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic “Pacific Fire ring” and is regularly declined by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and waves of tsunami in the last years:
2004: A strong battery on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province Aceh in North Sumatra activated a wave of tsunami, which scattered 14 countries and killed 226,000 people throughout the Indian Ocean coast, and more than half of them are in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Thousands died on the island of Nias next to Sumatra's coasts.
2006: The Magnitude Rabbit 6.8 declined the most inhabited island in Indonesia, Java, by activated tsunami, which broke down in the southern coast, destroying nearly 700 people.
2009: Magnitude earthquake 7,6 hits near the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra Province.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: Magnitude earthquake 7.5 cuts one of the Mentawai islands and activates a 10-meter tsunami wave, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Tiny earthquake hit the regency Pidi Jaya in Aceh, caused destruction and panic, since people remembered the devastation of the death earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time no tsunami is activated, but more than 100 people were killed by ruined buildings.
2018: In Indonesia, the tourist island of Lombok killed more than 500 people, most of which from the northern side of the island.
The earthquake ruined thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporaryly in the worst.
Sarah Paylin's biggest son was arrested for domestic violence.
Track Paylin, the greatest son of the former Governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Paylin, was arrested for violence charges.
Paylin, 29, was arrested for domestic violence suspects, interference with domestic violence and resistance in arrest, according to the State police report in Alaska, published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female gentleman tried to call the police in order to report on alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Paylin was detained in the building for preliminary detention Mat-Su and under an unsecured guarantee of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, surely", when he was asked to plead, the media reported.
Paylin is threatened by a penalty for three offences from class A, which means he may be deprived of freedom for a year and pay a penalty of $250,000.
He's also charged with a crime from class B, which is punished by one day in prison and a $2000 fine.
This isn't the first time the Penalty Prosecution against Paleen has been charged.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is now considered by the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, intervention in reporting a crime of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of compounding substances in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claims he hit her in the face.
Sarah Paylin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 when she connected her son's aggressive behavior with post-traumatic stress resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds died
At least 384 people were killed by a earthquake, which collapsed the Indian island Sulavezi on Friday.
The magnitude earthquake 7.5 caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication network is broken, expecting the number of dead to grow in the nearby days.
The earthquake hit near the central Sulavezi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia – Jacarda.
In social networks, there are videos that show the moment of the collapse.
Thousands of people have gathered together at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami wave shore.
Federal Prosecutors want a rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist assassination in New York.
The Federal Prosecutors in New York want a death penalty for Saifulo Sayipop, suspect of the terrorist assault in New York, in which eight people died – a rarely encountered punishment that has not been executed in the state of federal crime since 1953.
It is claimed that Sayipov, at 30 years, used a truck rented by Home Depot to commit an assault in October at the Velloaley near the West Side Highway in the lower Manhattan, gasejing walkers and bicycles on his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused severe body injuries, in accordance with the intention of the request for a death penalty filed in the Southern region, New York.
According to the judicial document, both accusations may be completed with a death sentence.
Weeks after the assassination, a widespread federal judicial body sent a 22-point prosecution to Saipov, including eight murder charges related to a racket used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of violence and the destruction of the IPS.
The attack demanded "serious planning and intention," the prosecutors said, describeing the way Sayipov was performed as "scary, cruel and perverted".
"Sifulo Habibuleevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses of the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lory Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Early, Ernan Feluci and Alejandro Damian Panuco," said in the notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last South York region has been looking for a death punishment.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was accused of the murder of two drugs, but he was subsequently sentenced to life sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death sentence was executed in New York in the federal case was 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after the conspiracy sentence and spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed on the electric chair on June 1953.
Saipov, Uzbekistan, has not shown regret over the days and months after the assassination, according to the judicial documents.
He said to the investigators that he felt good with what he did, says the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he inspired the attack after watching the IDIL videos on his phone, the prosecutor claims.
He also asked in his hospital room to place the IDIL flag, told the police.
He claims innocent to the prosecutor's act consisting of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that they were "approximately disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death sentence instead of accepting a conviction for guilty and lifetime prison without the possibility of early release will only extend the traumatic effect of these events to all affected," Patton said.
The Sayipop Protection Team before he wanted the prosecutor not to ask for a death sentence.
Member of the Parliament of Conservators says that NAJGUL FARRAŽ should run the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Faraz was denounced to "mobilize the army of the people" today, during the protest at the conservatorial conference.
Former leader of the British Party of Independence said that politicians should "sense pressure" -- as one of the members of Teresa Mei's own party, he suggested that he run the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bonn, a conservatorial deputy, said in March in Birmingham that Britain would have "exited so far" if Mr. Faraz had been a secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge that Ms. May faces to agree with the deeply divided lines of the party was highlighted by conservators supporting the remaining which joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain its compromise plan "Chequers" despite the attacks of the supporting Brekzit, supporting the remaining by the EU.
Allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite the hostile reactions and insist European skeptics and layberists to choose between its package and the chaos.
Mr. Bon said to protesters with "Exit means exit" in Solichel that he wished to "flip Chequers".
He pointed out that Mr. Faraz had to participate naturally with the others and that he had to receive responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was head, we'd have left by now," he said.
The Deputy of Wellingborough added: “I support Brexit, but we must dismiss Chequers' plan.
Proclaiming his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be slaveful.
We want to create our laws in our own country."
Mr. Bon rejected the claim that the public opinion had changed since the voting in 2016: "The concept that the British had changed their opinion and wanted to remain is completely false."
The conservator's representative, Andrea Jenkins, also participates in the event, dividing the reporters: "I'm just saying, Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chequers" is not popular among the broad public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists who actually came out on the street and actually helped us to be elected.
Please leave "Chequers" and start listening."
In the open message to Ms. May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their position when they follow their promises. ”
Mr. Faraz said to the audience that politicians should "sense pressure" if they were going to change the decision taken after the referendum in 2016.
"It is now about trusts among us - people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to change Braxit and we've gathered here today to say "We're not going to let you get through this."
In turn to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to force our political class, which is on the edge to change Brexit, to feel pressure.
"We mobilize the army of the people of this country that helped us to win at Brexit, and we will never stop until we become independent, self-governmental, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, the supporters of the stay went through Birmingham before conducting a two-hour event in the center of the city.
A pack of activists raised flags with the labels “Conservators against Brexit” after the group launched this weekend.
Leiberst Lord Adonis seemed to have fun with the conservators about the security problems of the party's application when he was found at the conference.
"There are people who tell us that they can place the IT systems and the whole technology of Canada and more, and yet, for the immediate crossing of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a full farce.
There's no such thing as good Brexit," he added.
Warren said he would "consume" his candidacy for president
The state Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that he would "consider seriously the possibility to become president" after the elections in November.
Boston Globe reported that the representative of the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about her future during the city council in West Massachusetts on Saturday.

Gran Pri to Russia: Louis Hamilton is increasingly closer to the world title, after his team's instructions helped conquer Sebastian Fetel
Since Valtery Bothas graduated from Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the instructions of Mercedes' team will have an important role in the competition.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously alarmed Hamilton while defending his position in the first two bandages, giving Fetel the opportunity to attack his companion.
Fetel first made a pit-stop and let Hamilton deal with traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be decisive for the exit of the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit-stop on the next round and went after Fetel, but Hamilton managed to be ahead of him after a brave maneuver and driving "gum to tire", which forced Ferrari's pilot with no desire to release the inside of the track, to avoid punishment with the added time, after he already closed his opponent's way with a dangerous double defensive maneuver of the third band.
Forward his 21st birthday, Max Verstapen launched from the back lines of the starting grid and was seven after the end of the first round.
Then he even led a very long time of the race, since he decided to change his tires later than the rest, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly in front of Kimmy Raiconen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally he entered for a pit-stop in the 44th circle, but he failed to get enough in the next eight rounds and eventually Riconen finished fourth.
It was a tough day, since Walters did a great job all weekend and showed up as a gentleman when you let me go ahead.
The team has done an extraordinary job to win the first two seats on the floor," Hamilton said.
It was really a bad tongue of the body.
President Donald Trump seduced with Senator Diane Finstein on rails on Saturday because of her claim that she did not spread the letter from Christine Blazey Ford, accusing the claimant for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Cavano for sexual persecution.
During the talk of rails in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the statements given by Ford before the Senate Legal Commission, and instead commented on how the senate events show that people are "worst and disgusting and dishonest".
"What can happen and the good thing that happens in the Senate for the last few days, when you see anger, when you see angry people and evil, and disgusting and unfair," he said.
"When you look at the publications and the spread, and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Finnstein, did you spread from you?
Do you remember her answer... did you release a document, "Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't spread."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we spread... no, we weren't spreading," he added, imitating the senator.
Finstein sent a letter with details about Ford's statements against Cavano in July, which was distributed earlier in September – but Finnstein denies that the spread had happened from her office.
"I didn't cover Ford's claims, I didn't spread her story," Finnstein said to the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep confidentiality, and I kept confidentiality as she wanted."
But the denial by her side was not well accepted by the president who commented during the Ralito on Saturday night: “I will tell you that this was a very bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing defending the claim for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual crimes against three women, the president pointed out that democrats use claims for their own purposes.
"They are determined to restore their power with all possible means.
Look at the dishonestness, the embarrassment, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they've got to run over to return their power and control," the President said in the Mediaite.

The flight manager died to ensure that hundreds of people on the plane can escape from earthquake
The head of flights in Indonesia was praised as a hero after he died, ensuring that the plane with hundreds of passengers on board was able to fly safely.
More than 800 people died and many are unknown in a powerful earthquake that hit Sulavezi Island on Friday, activated by a tsunami wave.
The strong secondary shakes continued to defeat the area and many were trapped in a trap from the ruins of Palu.
Although his colleagues were running to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his position in a strongly shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Juffrey airport.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the track at that time, will be able to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he had crashed.
He died in the hospital later.
The speaker of Air Control, Indonesia, Johannes Syrite, said that this decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Ballicpapan in Calimantan to take him to a larger hospital to another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of death cases can reach thousands after the country's reaction agency announced that access to the towns of Dongala, Siggy and Butong is limited.
"We assume that the number of death cases will grow, since many bodies are still under the fragments, and many people cannot reach," the speaker of the Agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said.
The waves that reached six meters destroyed Palu, where there was mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying assistance and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, 35-year-old mother, shared before Sky News: “Each minute, the ambulance brings more bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
There are maroders everywhere in the minimarkets."
Ian Gelfand, President of the International Movement of the Red Cross in Indonesia, pointed out to CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is struggling to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy now, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian President Joco Widdo arrived in Palo on Sunday and turned to the country's army: "Please work the day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was slaughtered by earthquakes in Lomboc, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini reported that a person is unknown after a plane crash in the laguna
The airline that flyed with a plane that crashed in the lagoon in the Pacific now reports that one person was declared missing after he said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the drowning plane.
In the press, Air Niugini said that the Saturday afternoon they could not contact a man's passenger.
The airline added that they work together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the requests for more details for the passenger, such as age and nationality.
The ships of local people helped save passengers and crew after the plane crashed in the water while trying to land on the island of Chuk.
On Friday, the authorities reported that seven people were admitted to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital Saturday, as they are all stable.
There remains an unclean reason for the disaster and the exact sequence of events.
Both the airlines and the US military forces said that the plane landed in the lagoon shortly before the road.
Some of the witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the road.
The American Bill Janes, a passenger in the plane, claims that the plane was very low.
"This is extremely nice," says Janes.
Janes tells me that he and the others have managed to run through the deep to the cross of the water to get to the emergency exits of the drowning plane.
He shared that the stewardes fell in panic and screamed, and that he suffered a light injury on his head.
The U.S. military forces tell us that sailors repairing the port nearby have also helped in the rescue action, using a drowning boat to lead people to the shore before the plane drowns in the deep of about 30 meters of water (100 feet).
The Air Niugini Air Safety Network indicates that in the last two decades 111 people have died in flights registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
The analyst exposes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor has finished his statement on the case this Saturday in the re-process against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
The analyst Paul Rowlet from the U.S. Ministry of Justice witnesses for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to compose the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he received data on the location of several mobile phones showing that Telis was with Chambers at the night of her death, back to his previous claims, reported the Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford was standing before the court on Saturday and testifying that he was out of town on that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Telis was telling the truth, when he said he was in the Sanford truck the same night, Sanford said that "that's a lie because my truck was in Nasville."
Another inconvenience is that Telis said she knew Chambers two weeks before her death.
The cell phone records indicate that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett pointed out that shortly after Chambers Tellis died, he deleted text messages, calls and information about contact from his phone.
"He removed it from his life," Hale said.
The defense is planned to start with its conclusions on Sunday.
The judge said it was expecting the process to be presented to the jury later the same day.

Another black man?
New York Nanny judges a couple after release for a "racist" message
The New York Nanny judges a couple for dismissal because of discrimination, after she received a wrong message from the mother who complains that she is the next black man.
The couple denys being racist, comparing the desire to “extortion”.
Lyncy Plasko-Flaxman, mother of two children, was amazed when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was a black man when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"Noeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, the last black man," Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in the text message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Morris, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman felt embarrassed and fired Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the previous nanny, who was afro-American, did not do the job well and that she expected a Philippine, reports New York Post.
Ms. Morris received a reward for a working day afterwards sent home with a taxi.
Now Morris judges the par for compensation because of the release, requesting the amount of $350 a day for the six-month contract for which she was originally hired, although she didn't have a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you should not do that," she said to Post on Friday, adding "I'm sure this is discrimination."
In response to the request, the couple claims that they are not racists, added that the termination of Maurice's employment was a reasonable action because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after she was offended.
“Women sent me something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," Post's husband Joel Plasco said.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have offended, even if it was a mistake?
You're the newborn?
Think about it."
Similarly, Plasco claims that his wife was born only two months ago and was in “very difficult situation. ”
"Will you attack someone in this condition?
This is not very nice," the investment banker added.
While the trial is still in the process of review, the public opinion quickly condemned the couple in social networks, denying them of their behaviour and logic.
Publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not feel connected with a speaking bear, revealing a new letter
The daughter of Bond, Karen Yankel, born soon after the book was accepted by the audience, tells about the letter: “It is hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it's very fun, since we're aware of the huge success of Paddington."
She shared that her father, who worked as an operator for BBC before inspired to write a child's book about a little bear-toy, would feel optimistic to reject the book, added that he welcomed the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book “with mixed feelings” after his death last year.
With regard to Paddington, whom she described as “the important member of our family, ” she added that her father was secretly proud of the final success.
"He was a very modest man and was not self-reaching," she said.
"But since Paddington felt so real, it's like having a child that has achieved something: you're proud of him, even though it's not your business.
I think you've been taking Paddington's success somehow.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always accreditated the deserves of Paddington himself."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After boarding, her daughter was taken in an emergency to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nica, where doctors fought for nothing to save her life.
"Nad constantly called to say that the situation is really bad that he does not expect to survive," Mrs. Eden-Lapperus said.
"Then Над called me to say she'll die in two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I told her, “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be there soon.
I'll come to you.
The medicinal products given to her doctors to maintain her heart slowly cease to act and leave her system.
She's gone for a while before, and that's how it's over.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get tight."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapperus, who is still grieving about the loss of her daughter, is climbing on the plane along with other passengers who have no idea of the trial she's passing through.
"No one has understood," she says.
"I would have put my head down, and all the time my tears swept.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt this full sense of compatibility with Над.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Unfortunate women put cards to prevent suicide from a bridge
Two women who lost their favorites for suicide are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis's son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself when he was 18 years old.
“I don't want any parents to feel like I feel every day, ” she says.
Mrs. Davis, she's 45 years old from Lidney, says her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everybody knew him by smile.
They always said his smile lights every room."
However, he gave up his work before he left, and was in “truely dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, finds his brother after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I am constantly concerned that this will have some consequences. ”
Ms. Davis creates cards, “to make people know that there is someone to go and talk to, even if it is a friend.
Do not keep silence; you must speak."
Mrs. Humphreys, a long-year-old friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her partner in life for 15 years, just after his mother died.
"He did not share that he felt depressed or depressed, or anything else," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas – when the children opened their gifts, he neither looked at them nor looked at anything."
She shared that this was a terrible injury for them, but they had to deal with: “This opens a void in the family.
It's breaking us apart.
But we need to move forward and fight."

Brett Cavano's future is questioned after the FBI starts the investigation.
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wanted -- an investigation with limited length and limited range -- maybe we could join our efforts," Mr. Flake said on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee "depreciated" despite the confirmed over-party blocking.
Why didn't Mr. Cavano and his republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their adverseness is for the moment.
The preliminary elections are only five weeks later, on 6 November – if the Republicans are expected to be not well represented, their attempts to be elected in the highest court in the country will seriously affect their attempts to be elected.
George W. Bush called the senators, inviting them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush in the White House, and with his help, he met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI prepares his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where members are now 51 Republicans and 49 democrats.
It's still not clear if Mr. Cavano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pens to announce equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
Number of fugitives from North Korea "descends" in Kim
The South Korean Legislative claims that the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Chen Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Sug, quoting data from the South Korean United Nations Ministry, said that last year there were 1127 fugitives, compared to 2011, they were 2706.
According to Mr. Park, the stricter border control between North Korea and China and the higher amounts requested by human traffickers are key factors.
There's no official comment by Phenjan.
Most of the northern refugees eventually receive citizenship in South Korea.
Seul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have passed illegally the border from the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and passs easier than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), which divides both Koreas.
China considers refugees illegal migrants, not refugees, often forced to repatriate them.
Relationships between North and South Korea, which are still technically in war, have improved significantly over the past months.
Earlier this month, the public heads of the two countries met in Phenjan for talks focused on the delay in nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after the historic meeting between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Chen Un in Singapore, where they agreed to work for the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, the Foreign Minister of North Korea Ri Yong Ho accused US sanctions for the lack of progress since.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be confident of our national security and in these circumstances, there is no way to first unanimously disarm ourselves," Mr. Ri said in speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavano "hysterical" and said it was not suitable for service in the Supreme Court
The minority leader at the Congress Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Cavano " hysterical" and said he was too unbalanced to serve in the Supreme Court .
Pelosi commented this during the interview this Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I had no way to think that if a woman had reacted this way, she would be called "hysterical," Pelosi said to her response to Cavano's testimony to the Senatu's legal committee on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally rejected the claim that he had committed sexual harassment over Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they both were teenagers.
During his incoming word, Cavano was very emotional, and at times he almost shouted and felt when he discussed his family and his student age.
He also clearly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling the claims against him "gratesk and coordinated attack against the person", organized by Liberals, which are unsatisfied that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi emphasized that Cavano's testimony indicated that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court, as it became clear that he was prejudiced with the democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these allegations and the way he pursues the Clinton family and the democrats," she said.
Pelosi denyed when she was asked whether she would try to discredit Cavano, if it was appointed and if democrats received a majority in the Chamber of Representatives.
"I'll say it like that -- if he doesn't tell the truth before the Congress or the FBI, then he's undeniable not only to enter the Supreme Court but also to the court in which he is now," Pelosi said.
Cavano is now a judge at the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she is concerned about Cavano's potential decisions regarding the Law on Accessible Health Care or the case Row v. Wade, as it is considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Cavano avoided questions about whether he would reject certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, predictable man to enter the court and expect us to say, "Isn't it great," Pelosi finished.
And women have to control themselves.
It's a reasonable criticism, after months and years of frustration, and she can't accept it without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrs Steinham told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, and you?"
She continued, "I received a great help from a woman who was an executive director somewhere who shared that she also cried when she was mad, but she developed her technique, thanks to which when she was mad and crying, she said to her companion, "You can think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm mad."
And then it's just going on.
I thought it was brilliant."
The tears are allowed in expression of anger, partly because they understand wrong at the beginning.
One of my most clear memories of the previous work, in the office mainly with men, is as once when I climbed out of unexpressive rage, an older woman than I was caught by my neck - a frozen leader, which I was always a little afraid - and she dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy that they did it to you."
Patricia Schroeder, at that time a democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his campaign for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extra-marriage boat, called "Monkey Business", and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, she decided that there was no reason why to consider the idea of candidate herself for the president.
"It was not a good reasonable solution," she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted to happen was another one.
Someone called the situation Snow and the seven cows.
Since it is incorporated late in the campaign, it leaves with fund acquisition and decides that it will not stay in the race if it fails to collect two million US dollars.
The battle is prejudicated to a failure.
She understands that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would only give her $ 250.
"Do they think I'm receiving discount?" she wondered.
During his speech, in which he states that it will not continue with the official campaign, it is filled with so many feelings – thanks to people who supported her, dissatisfaction against the system which is so difficult to gather money and that you can turn to the voters, not delegates, and the anger of sexism that she felt.
"A man may think I had a nervous crash," Mrs. Schroeder remembers how the media reacted.
"Someone may think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they'd write on my grave plate?
"She's crying?"
How the trade war between the United States and China can serve Beijing
The first shots in the trading war between the United States and China were deaf and while the battle is just getting a speed, one break between the two countries will benefit Beijing in a long-term plan, the experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the first warning chain this year by taxing key elements of China's export, including sun panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest escalation of tension appeared this week with new bribes that affect the production of 200 billion US dollars (150 billion British pounds) with effective taxation of half of all goods imported to the United States of China.
Every time Beijing returned with new bribes with five to ten percent of American goods for $60 billion.
China has declined to reply to every hit of the United States and soon the second largest world economy is not expected to ignore this.
To make Washington give up means to submit to the requests, but bringing a head publicly to Washington will be too shameful for C. Dinpin, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays his cards correctly, the pressure from the US trade war can help in a long-term plan of China to reduce mutual dependence on both economies.
"The fact that a hurried political solution both in Washington and in Beijing could create economic crisis conditions in one of the two countries is actually more dangerous than observers have recognized before," said Abigail Grace, a scientific collaborator on issues related to Asia to the Expert Group of the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, said Foreign Minister
Syria announced that she was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asked for assistance in the renewal of the country desolated by the war, for more than seven years.
In turn to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem pointed out that the conditions in the country improved.
"The situation today is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas desolate by terrorists to restore them to their normal condition.
Now there are all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country that they have been forced to leave for terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily and nutrition.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome any aid in the recovery of the desolate country.
However, he emphasized that no conditional support or assistance will be accepted by the countries financed by the rebels.
Europe won the Rider Cup in Paris
The European team won "Ryder Cup" for 2018, conquering the US team with a final result of 16.5 per 10.5 of "Le Golf National" in Paris, France.
Thus, the United States has six more European land losses and has not won the Rider Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned its championship crown to the tournament after the team led by Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn reached the necessary 14.5 points that guaranteed the victory of the United States.
The U.S. star, Phil Michelson, who presented himself weakly through the majority of the tournament, sparked his first hit on the 16th hole (with the "par" 3) in the water that lost his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golf Molinari was presented greatly in all rounds, as he became one of the four players in the history of the tournament that reached the balance of 5-0-0 since the race was held in the current format after 1979.
American Jordan Speed lost categories of 5+4 players in the European team who are at the lowest place in the rankman – Torborn Olesen from Denmark.
The leader in World Ranger Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 of Ian Poulter from England, for whom this is probably the last part of the Rider Cup.
Spaniard Serchio Garcia, a veteran with eight participants in the Rider Cup, became a European with the most winning points in the tournament for all times, and this year increased his assets to 25.5 points.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't stand up today.
It was a tough year.
I am extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believeing in me.
I'm so glad I can pick up the bunch again.
The team is most important in everything and I am happy I have been able to help," said the excited Garcia after Europe's victory.
He's transmitting his colleague John Ram, who beats the American legend Tiger Woods with 2&1 on the singles on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, but I grew up while watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and his overall balance of Ryder Bath is already 13-21-3.
A strange statistics for one of the biggest players for all times, he won 14 large titles – the indicator that only departs from Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team experienced difficulties throughout the weekend, except for Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed a high-class golf all day of the tournament.
The US team captain Jim Furic shared after the disappointing representation of the team: “I am proud of these boys, they fought.
One time this morning, we pressed the Europe team.
There was a fight.
I'm taking off Thomas's hat.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players showed up very well.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the Association of Professional Golfers of the United States and our Reider Cup Committee, and we will only look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You can't take off your opponent's hat.
We were just overplayed."
New for the redflow: Concentrations are reduced in Pinelas, Manoti and Sarasota
The latest report of the Committee on Fisheries and Wild Animals in Florida shows a principle of reducing the concentrations of redflows in areas of Tampa Bay.
According to the Committee, there are reports on conditions for the breakdown of growth in the district areas of Pinelas, Manoti, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – this shows the decrease in concentrations.
Water sections with excessive flower of the redflow are spreading about 130 miles from the northern district Pinelas to the southern district of Lee.
The particles with hydrocarbons can be seen 10 miles from the shore of the Hillsboro District, but are less than last week.
The redflow is also observed in the district of Pasco.
Over the past week, there have been moderate concentrations in the coast zone or a little more in the district of Pinellas, low to high concentrations on the coast of Hillsboro, high concentration preconditions in the district of Manoti, predictions for high concentrations in the coast or within the district of Sarasota, predictions for moderate concentrations in the area of Charlotte, high concentrations in the coast or in the area of Lee, as well as low concentrations in the area of Collier.
Continue to receive information on breathing roads in the districts Pinellas, Manoti, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
The last week, no reports on breathing roads in Northwest Florida have been received.
