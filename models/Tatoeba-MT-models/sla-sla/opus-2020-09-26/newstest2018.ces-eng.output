Civil rights movement issued travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for Colorful Persons (NAACP) has issued warnings for colored people traveling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory principles of State and racist attacks.
“The travel recommendation of NAACP for the Missouri State, with the effectiveness of 28 August 2017, calls on the African American travelers, visitors and residents of Missouri to take more attention over the country as a result of a series of disputed racial motivated incidents that are currently happening throughout the country”, states the Association declaration.
NAACP indicated that this step was made up on the basis of the current laws of the Missouri State that disrupted the defence of racistly motivated acts against the court, as well as in the consequence of the proceedings of criminal authorities which are unduely targeted for minorities.
“There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by police just because of the color of their skin, they are attacked or murdered," President NAACP for Missouri Rod Chapel said for Kansas City Star.
"The largest amount of complaints has yet been grossed."
It is the first warning of its species issued by the organization for the US State.
Among the incidents that the organization quoted were racially motivated toward the students of black skin at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in controversial circumstances at the beginning of this year after his gasoline ended his travel over the state and the police put him in custody without accusing him of committing a crime.
The Road Recommendation also notes the recent declaration of the highest State representative of Missouri, which states that the black skin drivers have 75% higher chances to stop them.
“ The purpose of the travel recommendation is to warn people and warn their families, friends and colleagues from what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be prepared - they should ride money with them for the eventual salary or warn their relatives that they are going to travel by the state."
According to the current numbers of the FBI programme to report hatred acts in 2015 in Missouri, hundreds of cases of hatred behaviour, which brings the state to the sixteenth place between all States.
The travel warning is also an answer to the new Missouri law, which disrupts the complaint of the company for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The American Union for Civil Freedoms (ACLU) issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after the States approved the immigration law which allows public actors to detain people on the basis of violations of this law, which is to improve racial profilation according to ACLU.
The Road Recommendation is usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but recently, the advocacy groups have taken action in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family is not calm even after 12 years!
The Sally Anne Bowman model is murdered.
The girl from Croydon was killed by boss Mark Dixie in 2005 directly at the restaurant she worked in, he planted her stabbed wounds.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex together and smoke marijuana, followed by killing her.
Then the killer sat in the nearby cafeteria and watched a careful criminal work to search for the crime scene.
Dixie, former chef, was convicted in 2008 to abduct freedom of 34 years for murder and rape of Sally's model.
He confessed only the attack of a youth, and his lawyer claimed that his client found a girl dead on the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed Sally and her ex-friend Lewis Sprotson had a fateful night arguing.
The killer said, "He was really angry, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"Even attracted attention to the taxiers," he claimed fakely.
The girl, according to his testimony, was supposed to defend herself, but what she could, of course, was in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her on the street.
Dixie's version was proven to be a lie and accused him.
After Dixie's confession, he talked about his enthusiasm and taste for a girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to burn a marijuana.
Before the incident Sally and her ex-girlfriend, they had alcohol and took cocaine, he said to the police himself, Dexie.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally began screaming for help, so he attacked her back and put his hand over her mouth," added the Mirror Linda.
And after twelve years, the family faces other attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
He was damaged four times in the last six months.
There are so cruel people on the loose who dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," said the Mirror mother of the dead girl Linda information about the disappearance of urna with ashes.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators are worth tens of thousands.
"Chees are not pruder or conservative," said Martin Rjaz, who operates the Prague Botique Intimity.
You can find design and luxury erotic devices in it.
Including those from the Czech designer, Anna Marresh.
It started a little bit, about twelve years ago.
Martin Rja and his friends went on a cycle by Morava.
One of them brought not only a bike, but also a box full of extraordinary vibrators.
"Various dolls and dolphins, and all of it was green and yellow and just different," he tells me about lunch.
His friend and another associate decided to cooperate with the German manufacturer of the Fun Factory design devices, which fascinated Martin, so he offered to help with marketing.
When a colleague left so he could devote to another profession, he replaced him.
Today it operates in the Prague Benedict Street Botik Intimity, where it sells erotic devices in the way it usually offers luxury purse or shoes.
Why not?
It's also design objects.
Wait, wait, you're talking about this at lunch, you think?
Oh, come on, don't be such Puritans!
The Berlin shop Fun Factory, which proposed a recognised designer Karim Rashid, served as inspiration for Botik Intimity.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than all of them used to here.
No covered exhibits, all made in a beautiful, decent style, products exposed rather as in parfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zebenka began to consider how to understand the Prague trade, where he should be and what he should be called.
The name Intimity loved both of us.
"It's intimately related, and it's also, it can be said gentle," he says.
It followed the purchase of the Internet domain and searching for a suitable space that went parallelly with various interior visualizations.
Finally, the variant conquered that placed the trade in the garden of luxury and bedrooms of the duke of the bed.
Dagmar Stephen made it from the FormaFatal Study.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, he didn't seem perfect, because he wasn't on the main street, but he was sitting in the name of Intimity.
He's intimate.
He's in the street next to the main, so no customers are occupied," Martin Rjah commends himself.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to make a trade that would be different, with marked goods, in the environment where women who are mostly our customers feel good.
And not that they're ashamed of getting into such a store at all.
When I walked into the botique of Intimity half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Besides, I didn't even feel like I was going to a erotic store.
At the door, I was surprised by the clean elegance of the interior that I know from the botiques with fashion.
Although there's only a woman's service in the store, not to ask women for help, it doesn't mean that a man's leg would not come here.
Most of the gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriend.
"Man usually can't estimate the right size and choose more," Martin smiles on a frequent error.
These are the prejudices, the experienced cliché that women need some big help, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith chooses an unnecessarily big vibrator.
Likewise, men choose mostly black underwear, where the woman usually draws more to pink color.
Absolute bestseller is currently a product named Satisfyer.
From the expression in my face, it must be clear that I don't know what it beats because Martin explains immediately how it works.
It's such an intact clitoris stimulator.
Adolescent need to get admired over what serious tone is given to me.
It's like it doesn't work.
And it doesn't really feel like it.
It's at a good price and has a perfect user reference.
We didn't believe he'd be accepted so well.
It's about some last revolutionary news.
The first revolution caused a vibrator in the shape of the sea horse.
He made sure that women were more interested in designing such products.
The second one was a Vibrator for We-Vibe pairs.
He totally ruined the tab, which some men can persist, and that they see competition in erotic helps.
"They're doing different options," he continues.
With one engine, two engines, remote control.
That's the favorite category.
In loving connection, a woman can have a controller in her hand and determine the intensity of vibration.
On the contrary, a certain failing is a category of applicants.
Well, at least with us.
The Czech women seem to prefer multi-specific aids and buy classic vibrators, even though they use it only externally.
In Western Europe, especially in younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It's hard to say if a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I guess it'd be a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin considers.
"We also have helps for them, but limited." Most of all, the masturbator is sold, in this case from the producer Teng.
Because it doesn't seem like anatomic imitation of vagina, but "as a shower gel or an egg or a futurist object.
It focuses very much on functionality and experiences in use.
In Japan, it's completely different.
It makes me amazed.
I thought the Japanese would suffer a lot of erotic.
"It's the Internet reality," I'm explained.
The usual is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more connected to being used by women.
In Japan they are absolutely normal for men, and they are the tabu for women." Only for interest -- what the Japanese Tenga mark, who is represented in the Botique of Intimity, sells in the world, still forms about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and the Czechs aren't stricken.
On the contrary, we are a whole nation.
Certainly unlike countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical trading client moves between 35 and 50 years and "with some experience with sexual life, however, with some helps.
It comes for something nice, better quality, to complement a partner life, or to herself." To come back, Martin Rja and her business partner, the Deenek Sebelka care to make sure that each product is perfectly functional.
We also don't want to go into the type of bondage and latex, because we don't have room for it, but it's not exposed here.
Such things could reflect those we're trying to target.
Which are people who always had a shame in the sex shop to go because they were afraid to look at them like that.
Many of the products exposed on the cheeks are really pleasing.
It is also given by the selection of represented renowned marks.
Some of them even obtained design prices, including Red Dot Design Award.
The first assessment was mentioned by the sea horse "and it started a change throughout the sector.
It began to drop out of cheap materials and to work with healthy inconvenient, other designs, different colors...
It is pleasant that some are behind the design of Czech Republic, even though the popular designer Anna Maresh.
I have to say, I'm pretty nice to surprise how many people have been buying these design things with us from Anne Maresch, even though they are relatively expensive.
There are customers walking directly for Venus's bullets from Anne Marresh.
She took a really huge piece of work by representing exactly what we are trying to present in the Czech Republic and abroad -- that erotic helps can be done differently, nice, with a story.
Anne's story started as a schoolwork.
Now it's a complete product, which is also made in us.
I wanted to have the production process under control, and I also wanted to know from what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Because it's not a huge robbery, but a small series, it's certainly more expensive than a big series.
Maybe I'm going a little against the stream, but it seems important to keep development with us in the Czech Republic.
It could be calm that in a few years we will not be able to produce anything," Anna later describes the situation that agrees with Martin that our company is increasingly open.
It is not met with a negative or rejective attitude.
They say people are mostly disappointed.
"But then they start smiling with you." Anna Marresh currently has a vibrator in her offer, for which you can have a personal message, and this year she also plans her own librarian gel.
In the next year, vibration eggs and other news should be acquired.
Borders of healthy sex
I'm wondering where the border of what's okay.
Anything Martin Rjah would not sell anymore?
It's so hard to define.
Whatever normal comes to one, another may seem completely abnormal, so we're rather defined as a sort of marking producers.
None of them get into some extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have the last question: What was the most crazy demand they got?
Just now a week, an e-mail came, in which a lady asked for a masturbation help for her friend with a long 20 centimeters.
So we had to write that, unfortunately, we didn't have anything like that.
It's still the question whether someone was kidding us," Martin measures me with a suspicious view.
And that happens from time to time...
The morning for Carl Gott.
After two cancers Alzheimer!
His friend Karel Christmas is fighting serious disease.
Carl Gotta's best friend is fighting the disease that will steal all the memories of people.
"Yes, it's unfortunately true," confirmed the sad information of the Lightning himself a singer.
I know about my illness, and I'm still doing it very well in terms of the circumstances.
"I'm taking medicines that have leading diseases to slow down," he added with thanking the closer for his support.
The whole grown family came up to make Karl easier.
Eva's wife is trying to be home as much as possible, her dad's home to the White Mountains are coming from the first marriage of Zuzan and Teresa, the old son of Karel, Karlas.
The generous fought the cancer twice, and he gave his experience to Slavic to support him during his difficult treatment.
He's got sixty chemotherapy behind him.
He was able to return to the tennis course and to ski conventions after them.
"Astrologist foretold I'll be here by 90," said Karel Lightning.
He's a warrior.
They still want to sing.
"I repeat the words of the song so I can not forget them," said Karel.
The same sickness has already been fighting in the Constitution as well as the actress of Flower.
Do you have an Alzheimer patient in your family?
Look how to treat him.
The Chile Parliament has cancelled the ban on interruption, the law shall judge the ES.
In Chile, the absolute prohibition of the artificial interruption of pregnancy is still applicable, so it shall not be carried out for health reasons.
"I hate that the legislators filed a complaint to the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we've been dealing with in Parliament for over two years," complained Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and at the end of August should receive a new president, who is a close opposition according to AFP.
The Act of Absolute prohibition of interruption, launched by President Michelle Bachelet, approved the Senate on July 19th.
The right opposition then announced that the law would attack in court, because it is according to it that he violated the right of a unborn child to live.
The voters postponed the proposal for the law last month until the mixed parliamentary committee analysed it.
In Wednesday, the messengers approved the proposal and reconstructed the Senate after them.
According to the new legislative adjustment, a criminal artificial interruption of pregnancy should be ceased in three cases: if a woman's life is threatened, if the fetus does not have the hope of survival, or if the pregnancy has emerged from rape.
Similar exceptions existed in the Spanish newspaper El País in Chile since 1931, that is, even before women received election law in 1949.
The absolute ban on interruption in 1989 introduced the right dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the president's office.
Chile is one of the small world countries where absolute prohibition of interruption is paid.
These are Nikaragua, the Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in Salvador, there are about 20 women behind the nets, who deprived up to 30 - year - old prison penalties for interruption.
In many cases, human rights protections were based on a spontaneous abortion, which the court called murder.
Is there anything else holy?
The target of Trump's White House is now the Statue of Freedom
The unlawful sign of the modification of the regime is the criticism of the statue.
The Americans could talk about this as well as everyone else - see carefully implanted shopping of Saddam Husain's statue on the Baghdad Square of Firdos in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key employees of Trump's regime, surely knew what he's going to do when at a passionate debate with CNN Jim Acosto on the topic of president's proposals for the drastic restriction of legal immigrants with a symbolic axe on the Scoff of Freedom.
It's nice to add that Miller didn't attack a statue like that.
For that, the crowd of the boat owners and imitators of the Freedom Statue.
However, he attacked her meaning, in particular the fact that in 1903 a poem with the famous poem Emma Lazarus was placed on the basis of the poem after the completion of the monument.
Miller punished Acosta by saying: “I don't want to go into history here, but the Socha of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that throws light into the world.
The poem which was also placed on the basis, and which you refer to is not part of it."
Miller's actually right, but as he said, it's not about history.
It is not only the poorest of the poor, but the poorest of the poorest: "Let me come, whoever falls, who is poorly breathing, who can hardly breathe in the middle of the towns."
And just in modern times, we can watch these "poor worms" on our screens.
Miller didn't try to criticize poetry - he wanted to explain that these people weren't welcomed in the United States.
This conflict on the importance of the statue is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict on the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends who after her death seeked to plant a plaque with poems on the basis of the statue, knew quite well that she was letting her into a high political game.
The Socha was to express the connection of the French and American Republican government by representing a classical theme, i.e. women's flexibility of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem there is no woman's abstract character, but she has her own voice.
It also has a very different name: Mother of exilemen.
The merger of a poem with a woman's imagination is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way as Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right player has long been trying to reproduce this meaning.
A famous commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jan Baptist in the case of Trump's approach to power - in 2010 argumented that the Socha of Freedom does not actually bring anyone into the country, but represents the early non-constructiveism, bringing an American flame to the rest of the world: “Socha of Freedom is moving forward.
He's carrying the bay of freedom from the United States and offering it to the rest of the world.
The porch should not light the way to the United States."
Limbaugh's embarrassing the important thing.
The significance of the statue depends on the angle of the view.
Emma Lazarus describes a statue from the view of an exhausted and damn traveller, who many times after long and scary swimming across the ocean comes with hope in the heart to the new country.
It's literally the view of the world of the eyes of people who are looking for refuge and the chance of a better life.
From this perspective, the statue of hope expresses and listens to their needs.
And of course that's the perspective that Miller or Trump definitely won't recognize.
Their porch should not light the way, but enlighten hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championship in athletic 2017: Neil Black sings praise on the Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time the British team had only two Scots members
The Director of the Athletic Federation of the United Kingdom Neil Black stated that a strong squad of 16 Scots in the World Championship Team would be a “great benefit for the team”.
For MS in London 2017, which begins on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes was selected.
Black believes that in Scotland “there is something special ” and British athletics can learn from the Scotts.
"We try to understand and adapt - we will work on it," said Black.
"I talked to people from the Scotland sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The representatives of the Scottish athletes think it's got to do with what they did.
British athletics: It has to do with what they did.
People in the streets also think that.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will seek medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle was elected as the captain of the team.
“Eilidh is modest.
Her initial speech was amazing," said Black.
“A few athletes, whether Scotts or the athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with a sense of huge pride and motivation.
Yourselves and unshoved feelings with which Eilid spoke were unrepeatable."
The silver medalist of Commonwealth, who will compete in the run through 400 m obstacles at its fifth world championship, stated that it was "incredible" that there were 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record of 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The runner on the highway, Muir, only fixed five British and two European records in the last year.
The MS will take part in the run at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who runs a 1500m track. In this year's season, the British team races and the Annual Games won.
Doyle remembers her first championship, where she was the only other Scotch member of Lee McConnell's team.
The captain of the team led her to “very proud ” of the fact that her colleagues had not only reached the team but in many cases, they would also attack the part of the final and medal.
"The unusual position of the captain of the team is that I was elected by other members of the team. It was a great honour to me, but awareness that I was elected by the members of the team is satisfying," she added.
"I am apparently very proud of all the Scots who entered the team.
It proves where we moved.
They're athletes who'll think about the front places on the stage.
And my introduction speech?
Yeah, I think she did.
I only noticed that we can be proud of this year’s championship because it is going on homeland.
It is important to use the support of domestic fans and to rejoice with the fact that we are back on the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance to race and I'll enjoy an incredible atmosphere."
Critical blocking on Facebook: Do not claim public function unless you face the criticism of the voters
The father of our country knew about his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers didn't take long to start criticizing him for anything, starting in the country's policy and ending with his political views.
Yes, this criticism didn't leave him cold.
But he didn't try to keep the criticism shut.
Because in 1783 Washington said: “Free of speech can be taken away from us - and stupid, and we will be guided as sheep to defeat. ”
That brings me to Maryland is the governor of Larry Hogan who needs to work on acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted contributions from at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, the American Union for Civil Freedoms has sued him for those acts.
The Officers of the Governor of the Prosecution rejected as reasonable, and many views of the type “who cares about it” appeared on the Internet in comments.
"It's just Facebook," many users said.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it's about people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, it is an incredibly popular Republican governor.
He can praise the second highest favorite of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not creepy.
As it is evident, his state is sure of its own and strictly respecting the principles.
It turns out that he is also reversed in using Facebook as the main means of connecting with his voters - except that there is no publication of the first photo with the gola head after the chemotherapy graduation.
Blocking the people who welcome the Governor's website - which is a public forum, marked as official and managed by his employees paid from the money of taxpayers - is inadmissible and endlessly dangerous.
In an interview for Washington Post Hogan's speaker, Amelia Chasse defended the governor by blocking comments from the position of modifying contributions.
However, the image of Internet trolls, spamers or angry people is too easy.
Washington Post confessed a few real people to delete their contributions.
And they are also - real people who speak to their chosen leaders; teacher, businessman and pastor, no trolles.
As they all said, their comments were polite and respectful, not creepy.
The shepherd quoted the Bible in his comment by appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani's lawyer, Md., asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hated.
"I commendably noted that I was disappointed by his insufficient response to hate crimes and other current reports," wrote Washington Post in the section with comments.
"I don't like the idea that once a number of people comment on the same subject, some people are marked as promoting so-called collective efforts, instead of being recognised as a larger group of interested citizens."
What governors called “concentrated spam interest” would probably be called “defense. ”
The modern Facebook era allows us to manage contributions by blocking criticism or erasing negative comments.
It's much more comfortable than in the past, when the same procedure would require sending employees to the streets where they would collect and burn all prints with critics or arrest or shut up the protestants.
And that's exactly what's going on, just in a digital form.
Hogan is not the last public factor to be criticised for shameing Facebook and other social media.
The President Trump faces a complaint by the Twitter users who have denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
President Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first supplement in Alexandria, according to district judge James C. Cacherise, where she prevented access to one of its Facebook sites.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) from Kentucky also waited for a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington times, the low price of the mail was practically the same effect as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily press was fourfold, and his position of leaders had doubted many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People who wrote under pseudonims such as “Juricola, Valerius, Belizearius ” and “Portius ” wrote letters to the newspaper and questioned Washington’s decision.
According to historical documents collected by people within the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions criticizing his opinion on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with British.
But he didn't shut them up.
Freedom of speech, disagreement, and intimidation is in the foundations of our nation.
And the real leader must accept it.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, consuming more data in abroad than home.
They use more of their tariff than home in the foreign of the Czech Republic.
Most frequently they move in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season is the Duke of Croatia.
However, on vacation they have more time to browse on the web, but mostly they do not have the possibility to join Wi-Fi.
Beach, bathing, and a smart phone in your hand.
This looks like a typical Czech holiday in Croatia after customers can use the services of local operators for home prices.
It comes from fresh O2.
With the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers in abroad have more data available within the breakfast than home.
It is not surprising that in Croatia, where the minimum of ours rides over the winter, consumption of data increased even 50 times in this summer season.
In the second place in the staircase of the data consumption, Italy was placed.
Most of the minutes the Czech Republic will call from Germany, where many of them work and during the summer.
Croatia will visit 800 000 Czech travel offices annually according to the data of the Association of Czech travel offices, thus our most popular holiday destination.
But people exchanged a book for sharing experiences with a mobile phone.
The record was this year's July 7th.
"The data transferred would include tens of millions of photographs," the director of the mobile segment in O2 Silvia Cieslar detailed.
Although Croatia is running in the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users is moving in neighbouring countries.
The first place is Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is up to fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria on foot tourism and active holidays for which we don't have so much time to browse on the Internet.
"In addition, through Austria, the Czech Republic is heading right to the Adriatic," Cieslar explained.
While the operator recorded with data after the release of roaming fees, high inter-year growth, the telephone growth is much lower.
The number of minutes caused in the Roaming increased against last year twice.
With a huge intensity in front of other countries, Germany is prevailing here.
"The roaming calls are rather used by business customers on workways," said Cieslar.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for a home atmosphere at Renaissance Club
The former golf unit Ronan Rafferty will hope for a comfortable atmosphere in the Renaissance Club in the Scottish East Lothian administration area, which hosts the 25th year of Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year at the nearby golf field Archerfield Links on his way to the final, was subjected to Paul Eales. This year he will perform the role of the ambassador of the tournament in representing the founder of the club and the CEO of Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club grows slowly in front of me, and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty," Rafferty said.
"The players will be able to love the first-class quality of the field.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a zealous defender of this game and is proud of his success.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
The English Eales will first defend the championship, despite the victory of the European Tour and European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about it," said the Southport golfist.
"I had no opportunity to defend my victory at Extremadura Open, because a year after my victory the tournament was canceled.
Return to this part of the country is magic.
It's a beautiful golf place.
I remember last year when Sharon and my wife meant a victory really much.
It was a beautiful time I would not forget."
Gary Orr returns to the homeland, which joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years from the region of this year.
This event will be his first participation from Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I'd always like to play on homeland," said Orr about Helensburg.
“You want to make you feel good and feel a lot of pressure.
I was really happy to play again, and I think I'm doing well.
I'm pleased with the result of this."
The three players will also join the former winner Masters Ian Woosanam and the winners of the senior tournaments Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former captain of the Rider Cup Sam Torrance are among the six Scottish players on the field; others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The tournament is free. Parking is 5 pounds per car with one passenger and 10 £ for a car with two and more passengers.
All profits will be devoted to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian land of gold
When Bardina Degei's cooking dinner, she doesn't use the blanket.
In fact, he's rarely used a pin.
In its wooden chat, which is located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian Province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the language of local "nota" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour of potatoes, he'll taste it with his unlawful hands.
Bardina sits on a dirty land - the house is not equipped with furniture - where he also performs his daily work, such as washing laundry in a scratched water from the nearby upper upper upper.
The bottle in the room without a roof supplies the toilet.
As the youngest of four wives of her husband, no field was assigned to her.
Polygamia is common here.
Work by late night is a danger: most men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol.
"No one will be allowed to travel around the village after five hours," Bardina says.
It is a rare view of everyday life in Papui, a former Dutch colony, which was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in a form of public rising hands before the occupiing army.
The current movement protesting against the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakart government, which controlled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights observers.
In 2003 the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua - the independent Papua-New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is so far away and devastated city where you get after a 90-minute flight from the main city of Jayapura province to Nabira, and then a 5-hour stomach riding.
A massive transport is not working in this place.
The city with 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses covered by bambus fences, roofs of waved blades in shadows of gray and cutting color.
There were only very few Indonezians, journalists, and practically no strangers.
Before the arrival of Christians, local inhabitants worshiped the god named Uga Tameee.
And that's not all.
"We were not used to wearing these dresses," says Bardina, pointing to its colorful, hand-watched turbine, dark shirt and a glowing dress.
"We used to wear only leaves."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the inhabitants live under the limit of poverty and the child's mortality and literacy is one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, it is an Indonesian land of gold.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, which owns Freeport McMoranan from US Phoeenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province about the size of New Jersey, which is home of about 153.000 inhabitants.
Only in 2015 Freeport carved gold and copper worth $3,1 billion.
Furthermore, Papua supports the production of wood in estimated $78 billion.
These wealths, however, are the source of suffering and the guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
From the investigation carried out in 2005 by New York Times, Freeport paid for local military factors and units about 20 million dollars between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
Papuans calling for self - control threaten this golden ghost and are therefore severely oppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuas have been killed since 1969 and thousands of others have been raped, tricked and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass murders in the tribe area of Papua during the 1970s were equal to genocide, as said by the Asian Commission for Human Rights.
Only last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peace protestants in the region.
In Will Lose Everything, the report of the Brisbane Arcydiecésis of 2016 describes the cruelities that happened last year, as an extrajudicial execution, torture - according to the further report is particularly popular rape and execution by electricity - and brutal depression of peaceful demonstrators.
"It's difficult to calculate the number of victims because incidents happen every week," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonean researcher of the Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation has embarrassed the fact that papuanic resources are attracting colonists to Indonesia.
Of 3.5 million inhabitants in this province, 83% report to Christianity, but demography is changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indian islands - Java, Bornea, Sumatry and Sulawes.
Javan canteens sell roasted chickens and gado-gado, or mixtures of vegetables with nut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
"The Imigrants began selling chickens and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuanci," explains the 14-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Panya and moved to the capital of Jayapura.
"The original inhabitants of Papua - Mother-Mama (Women) - so they lost their job."
Indonezian President Joko Widodo, named Joku, promised the solution to inequality and violation of rights in 2014.
The former carpenter also secured his way to the Presidential Palace in jacket 27 of 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But in Papua, it has changed very little, and local people feel betrayed.
"Our heart was broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with hope that he will hear our calls for justice," you said.
The fact is that only two months after October's inauguration, Paniai experienced a huge shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at the campfire in the city of Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers came out of the sher of the night.
Two of the surprised children told them they should turn the lights on.
One of the soldiers said that the rise and tone that had been denounced and later returned to four other soldiers, the local pharassman Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the troops in a subcutaneous state persecuted a group of children and beat them with their weapons, introduced victims and witnesses of events.
One of the soldiers then fired a group of children.
One of the children, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so strongly that he fell in a coma.
A few hours later, someone burned the nearby building of the Election Commission, and the next day things were still out.
About 1,000 young papuan men and women gathered at the football field in front of the local police station and military command and demanded justice.
They came with the ceremony hunting ports and performed the dance of the wait - running in the circle and imitating the singing of the birds - the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants started throwing stones into buildings.
With a degree of tension, soldiers were ordered through the radio: “If the crowd trys at least three times to resist, you have the permission to shoot,” said the TIME week in an official document whose content has never been published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of Enarotali Kego Koto, recognized the danger and invited the inhabitants to divorce their homes.
However, no one had taken care of his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," said the TIME week on the veranda of his painted wooden house.
Kayame does not know who was the shooter yet, but according to his words, a bullet belonged to one of the present soldiers.
"There were a lot of people all around, and there was a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the local inhabitants, Alfius Youw, said his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, was hit three times immediately.
"I ran to the body to make sure that it's really him," she said to TIME's week with a twisted voice, Yohanes, who, as many of the Indoneans, uses only one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
Papua’s police inspector, General Yocie Mende, informed journalists that his officers only “secured” the station that was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten us with death," said in 2015 the press spokesman of the Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many have equipped their injuries.
The murder report argued the Jakart media next day.
Three weeks later, he gave Joku a passionate speech in Jayapur and expressed his understanding for the families of victims and promised that he would deal with violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that he can never repeat itself," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of National Security, Wiranto, announced that it would introduce an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve the violent acts that have occurred in the past.
But almost immediately the excuses began to be answered.
“The majority of violent acts have been committed a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s of the last century and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be a simple task," he said.
However, in the 5 June talk for the TIME week held in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he was not planning to take any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that “all cases will be presented to the court. ”
Wiranto, accused by the United Nations of “human crimes” on the basis of more than one thousand dead in the independent elections of 1999 in East Timor, stated that 11 cases of violations of human rights in Papua have already been dealt with, including the incident in Paniai.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Paniaa welcomed his claims with untrusted confidence.
"In the last three years, I have been asked a total of four times, but I have not yet waited for anything," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many inhabitants of Paniai who are afraid of the incident to speak.
He said he was beaten by members of the army after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After the funeral of the bodies, the army began looking for me," he said.
And the shooting's not going on yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot the villagers in the neighbouring Deiyai.
A fight in which one person died and another 17 had been injured has occurred between the village manager and the construction company who refused to provide help in transporting a man in a unconscious hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned in fishing in the nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
The anger of the villages protested in front of the company building.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing stones on the people and their answers were a warning shooting.
However, local inhabitants claim that the mobile brigade (Indonezian paramilitarist police) started shooting in the crowd and killed one person.
"The panic occurred, we were afraid of retaliation," said for TIME 29-year-old Domingu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was witnessing the arrival of the injured.
"I haven't left the house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament required punishment of participating police officers and withdrawing the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only enlarges the separation of the domestic people of the tribes of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in central highs.
Many of them joined Papuai (OPM) - the army of rebels who protected the rights of the Papuas by attacking and kidnapping Indian police officers.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai, not from Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the army has arrested in recent years and deliberately detained thousands of Paniai’s inhabitants, all under the implication of “the provision of national sovereignty”.
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known as “thragic and forgotten place”.
Oil comes into the fire with poverty.
That little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the local.
And the bread is still unavailable.
These inhabitants grow their foods — especially sweet potatoes, fruits and leave vegetables.
Women work on fields; each of them process four or five potatoes with sweet potatoes.
Most harvests are intended for the needs of the family, the rest sell on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potato costs only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabir Airport opened more airways and new immigrants began to stream into the country, economic inequality has increased between the birth papuans and immigrants.
There are so few jobs that usually include more educational and wealthy immigrants.
Papuans have rarely needed capital and education so that they can get into business.
"Young people move from villages because of lack of job opportunities and money," said John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
With the isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
It also contributes to strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudia and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from the papui, because of the “deficiency of collaboration with the authorities”, despite the fact that they received such rare authorization for filming.
Phelim Kine, representative of the Director of the Asian Division of Human Rights Watch, promised Joku in his election campaign that he would not cancel the strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development.
“The foreign journalists who work in the rebellious eastern areas of Papua and the Western Papua are in danger of a great risk: no recognition of visas and classification on the black sheet”, he stated in the statement.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesian in Papui is significantly limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the United Nations Human Rights Council on the investigation of “different and extended violence” in Papua, including the shooting in Paniai.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
The speaker of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, charged the charges when he declared to the journalists in Jakart that “in Indonesia still applys the democratic system and the media are free, so it is difficult to mask evidence of human rights violations.”
Local people call after the participation of foreign governments.
When the Netherlands official delegation, headed by a human rights envoy, Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on 4 May, local people called on the source that also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous, the password "We want freedom".
For 2019, more elections are planned in Indonesia, but the papuanci claim to not vote Jokow.
"Joku is a man who has good intentions, but is surrounded by people connected with the shooting in Paniai," said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jok to know that the inhabitants of Paniai -- except that they live in constant fear of the robbery army -- are struggling in poor, poor education and the health system.
Gobai claims that the inhabitants of Paniai, as well as the other Papuaans, consider their voice “long, ” which he must pay to Jok.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family victims of the paniai shooting continue in the last symbolic act of opposition: they bury the bodies of the victims on the land against the police and military station.
Notwithstanding that justice will never be done enough, at least he will not let responsible persons forget their crimes.
"He was killed by a member of our family," Yacobus said with a closed head.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy caught a huge carriage of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy detained a yacht in the Pacific carrying 1,46 tons of cocaine worth approximately $256 million.
The shipment was heading to Australia.
The four-member crew of the ship was arrested, apparently formed by people from Lithuania and Latvia.
The yacht, named Aphalina, plunged out of South America and the police dragged her to the port in Nouméa, metropolis of the French Overseas Territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific.
The Australian Intelligence Service stated that in collaboration with its international partners, it would seek to determine exactly where and where drugs were going and to reveal the "Litva syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for measures that have prevented a large quantity of drugs toward Australia," stated its executive Director Col Blanch.
Drugs were destroyed this week in Nouméa.
Australia is an attractive goal for their smugglers because of high street prices.
The country also faces a growing number of people who suffer drug addiction.
The current interference is not the first in the past.
Last month, three men were accused of the transport of a large number of drugs from the United States to Australia who tried to pass through the Pacific in a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirsty, they need to be reminded of drinks.
This may be a problem in senior homes, so that a doctor from the Gueriatric Clinic General Faculty Hospital in Prague of Paula Madls could be infusions of physiological solutions that squeeze a thin needle under the skin.
But for now, they only apply in health facilities.
The older a person, the more water in his body falls.
"And also he loses the feeling of thirsty, so seniors generally take less fluids and very quickly dehydrate," said Madlowa.
Two litres should drink for sure.
"But getting into an old man so much fluid is a big problem," she added.
In the elderly homes she often does not have a doctor.
In hospitals the dehydration of infusion usually deals with.
"I think that there should be a progressive way to get subcutaneous infusion," she said.
In a day, old people can add up to two half-litre bottles of physiological solution.
Insufficient fluids can cause malnutrition, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration is shown as a total loss of self-sufficientness.
"The old man one day says he can't get up from bed, speak confused," she added.
In the case of neglect, it may occur to the brain event.
Blood is collapsed and consumed in the brain, and renal failure is also threatened.
Lieutenant patients should not be covered by the feather, maximum cotton.
The problem may also be the one-time fought.
"It's medically more difficult, but it'd be ideal for the patient to discover and let the skin wind out," the doctor said.
In Dubai, the Torch burned twice
In Dubai, on Friday, there was one of the largest habitat clouds in the world. The firemen had to evacuate all inhabitants of 337 meters high and 79 floors.
In the last two years, it's already the second fire of this height building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch (Porch).
All the inhabitants of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries.
"We slept and awakened the alarm. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said Reuters Gerogue, one of the inhabitants of the cloud.
The Dubai civil defense indicated that firemen were able to get fire under control around the fourth hour of the morning (0:00 GMT), which continued to cool the building.
Government representatives added that they provide replacement accommodation for persons with disabilities.
The incident could rebuild a debate on the safety of materials used to cover high buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation that started the conduct of the Torch cloud after the fire in 2015 showed that the most damaged decoration and external panels used for decoration or isolation were damaged.
The British police stated that the isolation system and the opposition of the London Tower could contribute to the rapid spread of fire at the June fire, where nearly 80 people died.
The results of the survey showed that more than one of the five passengers to the United States are delivering prohibited objects to the aircraft board.
The survey among passengers has proved that more than 20 percent of them were conscious or unconsciously pronounced the prohibited objects through the control position of the US Government Agency Transportation Security Administration on the aircraft board. At least six percent of passengers entered the aircraft with a knife or other acute object.
Less than one percent of passengers claim that they lately discovered that they traveled with guns, ammunition or explosion.
The results of the research carried out by the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - and which answered more than 1,000 questionnaires - showed that there is a greater probability for younger passengers to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they tried to travel consciously with the subject prohibited by TSA, 19.7 per cent of passengers with several thousands of hours flying compared to less than 15 per cent of the members of the generation X.
Among the most common TSA objects belong to food and alcohol.
More than three per cent of the respondents were consciously exposed to a sharp subject, while 2.2 per cent of women questioned and 3.7 per cent of the questioned men also admitted that they deliberately placed drugs on the deck.
The company stated that it was conducting research among passengers around the world so as to determine how many of them were accidentally carried out by uneligible objects through airport control and how intentional they did.
It is not surprising that most people who have transferred uncertain objects - whether conscious or unconscious - travel with a plane very often.
As the company emphasized, the TSA Directive is rather complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what fluids and how much they can carry into the plane.
So it is not surprising that TSA has taken the largest amount of forbidden liquid.
For a certain time, people thought that TSA would put books in the same way as the trapped goods.
Transportation of liquids is allowed within the country's flights, not international.
Chief of EPA Scott Pruitt on the delay of planned directives to reduce the emissions of Obama's administration
Once the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by 15 States, its chief Scott Pruitt revoked its previous decision on the delay in implementation of the plan of the former Obama administration on the reduction of carbon emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes within his plan, responding as fast as the previous government needs of national environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention a legal challenge filed against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
This applies to the last term fixed on 1 October when the States should begin to comply with the 2015 Regulations to reduce the quantity of land ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that the agreement would be postponed by one year and ordered a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “related local decisions or threatening economic growth”.
Pruitt, who had positioned the State Prosecutor of Oklahoma for a long time before the head of the EPA President Donald Trump, served as a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt repeatedly moved or reversed the regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industry.
The sudden median turn is the biggest legal failure for Pruit's regulatory agenda.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the executor of the EPA has exceeded its authority in attempting to dismisss the involvement of Obama's administrative plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce the eradication of methane.
In the statement issued on Wednesday night, Pruitt proposed its version of ozone standards and strengthened the commitment of the EPA to cooperate with States through complex processes and to implement new standards within the given time frame.
"As the government of the previous administration, the EPA often did not fulfil the terms and waited for it to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing with the alignment and further setting of plans," Pruitt said, who, in his previous position, filed more than a dozen complaints on the EPA.
"We do not believe in regulation by means of a judicial dispute and fulfilment of the term we take seriously.
We never joke about our statute and authority that comes from it."
However, the statement of the EPA states that Pruitt may at a certain point use “the possibility of delay and all other legally available authority” to ensure that the regulations will be “based on healthy policies and the most available information”.
The Republicans in the Congress are pushing the wider ozone rules.
The budget of the White House approved last month seeks to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 for at least eight years.
The measures still have not passed through the Senate.
The New York General Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who was headed by the coalition of the States that sued the EPA this week, stated that the group would not permit legal pressure.
“Return in the EPA opinions - following our judicial victory - is an important victory for the health and security of those 6,7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
The ground ozone is emerging when normal damaged substances released by cars, electrical power plants, oil raphineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people and thousands of early deaths every year.
Public health defenders and environmentalists have a sudden change of Pruitt with thanks.
"It is anxious to develop the pressure to change the mind of responsible persons and protect the air we breathe," Lori Ann Burd said from the Centre of Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to struggle with the ideological dragging of Trump's administration, which is trying to help pollutants and special interests."
He poured man with acid, but he's not dangerous in court.
You never know what can happen to you.
In one moment, you're home with your family and you laugh, and in the second, your whole life will suddenly change from bases.
And the worst thing is you can't do anything about it.
Similar destiny met Andreas Christopheros from Great Britain, whose face slipped with an unknown attacker who was finally released from guilt.
The information introduced the Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone knocked at the door at Christopheros.
Andreas lifted up to go open.
He thought there was probably a courier outside the door that was supposed to deliver Christmas gifts for the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise was waiting for him.
The man he never saw in his life, right after he opened without warning, he poured acid by saying, "This is for you, buddy."
That pain was irrelevant.
The clothing fell apart on me as nothing and I felt just an incredible pain on my skin," said Andreas.
The family quickly transported him to the hospital, but there his neighbours learned a terrible message — according to doctors, he had no chance to survive.
A few weeks since the incident, the doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would suffer the infection that threatened to break into his wounds.
His injuries were very serious.
Of ninety percent, the face was affected by the doctors trying to gather through the skin of other parts of the patient’s body.
The great complications for Christopheros have become the loss of eyes.
It's probably the most toughest thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his suffering.
Today Christopheros has twelve surgeries that are not the last.
The damage affected by the victims of acid attacks may require hundreds of surgery and years of treatment according to plastic surgeons.
Even after difficult and long-term treatment, the victims of the tissue have blinked for the rest of their life.
"Something people do not recover and fight deformation and imprisonment throughout their life," said Professor Peter Dewulski, speaker of the British Association of Plastic and Estetic surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
With regard to the attack, Christopheros is sure the unknown man had to mess him with someone.
He believed that the man who sexually abused his closer person was a vengeance.
The police investigated the whole case properly and searched the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years of prison.
However, later, the verdict of Christopheros’s family was significantly changed.
"Three judges finally concluded that the penalty should be cancelled, for a man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
In the past few years, the number of attacks with nutrients has increased significantly.
The Ministry of Interior expressed the problem by planing to establish new guidelines for the public representatives on the classification of cereals.
They should be included in dangerous weapons.
However, victims of similar attacks do not surrender.
They require the Government of Great Britain to prosecute stricter and longer penalties of withdrawal of freedom to people who attack their surroundings with acid or other fertile substances.
They also require close controls of sales of dangerous substances, which are often common to obtain in different trades, as these are various cleaning means.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai burned a celebrity of the Torch, which belonged to the largest housing buildings in the world.
According to the Dubai civil defense, the inhabitants of the 80th floor building were able to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to the speaker of the Dubai police, fire was fired on the ninth floor and spread up.
However, according to several inhabitants, it was the opposite.
"It started in the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another employee quoted by the Reuters agency, the fire exploded in the highest floors and spread down with dropping hot ruins.
We slept.
We were wakened by a alarm, people screamed.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us some ten minutes from the 50th floor," he described the events of the mercenary George.
Another CNN Witness estimated that the flames caught about 40 apartments.
The fire was destroyed on the ground at least two cars when the burning parts of the building hit them.
About two hours later, civil defense reported that the fire was under control.
The cause of his creation is not yet known.
According to witnesses in surrounding buildings, the stream went off.
A large fire damaged Dubai the Torch also in February 2015, destroyed over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
Even then, no one has happened because the inhabitants were able to evacuate in time.
Mrakodrap The Torch was built in 2011 and then became its 352 metres highest housing building of the world.
The record took him away next year, another Dubai Clacodrap.
Culturer had 14 doping substances in the body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, the sample of 30-year-old Ippolita appeared by a pasterous collection of unacceptable funds - from steroids through diuretics to medicines for Parkinson’s disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix didn't help him with the title, finished fourth.
Culturalist is now in danger of a four-year distance and a criminal persecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, the Italian ragbist Davide Vasta was positively tested on 11 doping substances, which was recorded by then in captured sportsmen.
The third player began to take steroids a year before he fell in culturalism.
Lucka Vondrackov in Czech Republic.
She hugged herself with a former lover!
The Lucka Vondrackov has barely entered the territory of Czech Republic, in one round.
And he also draws attention wherever he comes.
The last time she had fallen in her arms her former lover, Michal Long, with whom she lived for three years.
The actress was 12 years old and already wanted a family.
Lucia was only 19 years old, and she certainly didn't want to hang her career on the hill.
So they went away, but friends remained today.
Which also has been made at the press conference TV Prima, where they met after a long time.
It's a coincidence that both of them got in a blue color.
They did not notice themselves at first, but then they got closer, and Lucy laughed at Michael’s jokes when she caught her stomach.
Then they hugged themselves, and the photographers were willingly posted.
But their meeting was not a coincidence, because they will play together a lover couple in a new series of Prima Captain Exner.
The Islamists have received for life in Britain for the preparation of the assassination.
On Thursday, the British Court sent four members of the Islamic Cell called the Three Musketeers and the prosecutor planned a terrorist attack against the police and the army.
The four men, of whom two attended the training camp in Pakistan, were convicted for similar acts, were arrested last August.
The officials thought that they were going to attack directly.
In the car of one of the men, the security agents found partially finished a tube bomb, a knife with signs that in Arabic mean "unbelievers" and a gun design.
This happened at the time the MI5 Secret Service agent placed a hearing device in the car.
"The recent assassinations showed what horror the defendants could cause if they were not stopped," said the prosecutor of Sue Hemming.
Three sentences aged 28, 25 and 33 may be asked for release after twenty years.
The fourth sentenced, who is 38 years old, can do it after 15 years behind the nets.
The men during the trial in London declared they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car was set up by MI5.
The court also heard him, but then the claims of the accused rejected.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
They measured 38.3 °C in Hodoninia.
The Tuesday temperature record 37.3 degrees of Celsia remained on the score only two days.
With 38.3 degrees of Celsia, recorded in the Watch Tower in Hodoninia, it was overcome by the Thursday, which has thus become the warmest day of this year.
The workers of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute confirmed it.
On Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records on Thursday.
On Tuesday, the records were overwhelmed or compared to 35 of 145 meteorological stations measured over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term stations recorded records of record temperatures.
For example, the Quarter Temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In the Lednica in Brzeclavska, 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tens of degrees and the current 37.1 degrees in Pogorelica exceeded the record by three dozens.
Both records, just as the Warden came from 2013.
There was 10 degrees less in the west.
High temperatures appeared mainly in the south and east of Morava on Thursday.
After the Watch was the biggest vedro in Dyjakovice in Znoyemska and Brode over Dyja in Brzeclavska, where the mercury rose at 37.8 degrees, but the record did not overcome.
On the contrary, for example, in Western and northwest Czech Republic, the fourth highest temperatures were only approximately 22 degrees of Celsia.
"Thermorrhagic temperatures have started to grow there until now afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current vedro in Czech Republic will be gradually discharged, and more significant rain can come on Sunday.
Most of the places of Morava, however, will remain high temperatures on Friday and southeast of Morava and Saturday.
China's missing tourists.
Beijing for visa policy is losing billions.
China has been trying to apply its influence after decades without the use of forces.
They make $10 billion annually to support language schools and to build universities in abroad, push their entertainment industry to foreign markets and try to attract Western tourists.
But that's not Peking.
The public media speaks of the plan to make the tourism a force of economic transformation and modernization.
However, the number of arrivals has only increased by 3.8 per cent last year and approximately 80 percent of the tourists came to China from Hong Kong, Macaaa and Thai-wan.
It is done, inter alia, that, despite all its global aspirations, China is not welcomed by a foreigner just with open arms, evaluates the situation in the world's most poorest economy professor Christopher Balding university in the article for the Bloomberg Agency.
The example that speaks for everything is Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa contact with China, the citizens of those other people must take care of visa.
The Chinese authorities in the United States are therefore comparable to the celebration of the new year in China.
Visa costs $140, but if a person doesn't want to wait for a long hour in front, he has to pay 100 dollars and more for additional services.
Such restrictions build significant economic obstacles.
Study Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for visa reduces the number of visitors by 70 per cent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited the landscape of China, while Hong Kong, who participates in the gross domestic product of China, shared less than three percent and lives there less than one percent of all inhabitants, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often enhancing this problem itself when the tourist movement uses its political goals, for example, in disputes with Thai-wana and South Korea.
When China restricted the transport to South Korea on the south Korean anti-rake system, the South Koreans repayed it and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 per cent annually, while Japan increased by 85 per cent.
It all affects macroeconomic stability.
According to the recent published report of the US Central Bank, Fed could have left China up to 190 billion dollars as a result of foreign roads, while China, as part of the sale of currency to tourists, receives about $35 billion annually.
According to the official numbers on the development of the payment balance, China had a 217 billion deficit in the tourism last year, which is equal to 44 percent of the entire Chinese stay in trade with goods.
Thus, a small number of tourist countries who are anxiously protecting the dispensation of capital are injured by a very painful wound.
However, the height of the appointed factors are only one manifestation of more general restraint against foreigners.
In many places of China, almost no one heard about immigrants.
In 2013, less than a million foreigners lived throughout China.
More of them are available in the United States, and some individual cities.
Even Japan, which is not a cross-cross immigration, has a double.
A variety of scientific work shows that immigrants usually restore economic growth, business and innovation.
But you can't find them in China.
Solving these problems will be politically difficult, but the step offered is to simplify the visa apparatus.
Other Asian countries, in particular India and Vietnam, have recently developed great efforts to simplify and ease visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
They multiplied poisonous plazas in the Pluzzi zoo.
The flourishing Kingdom of poison may enjoy three rare, deadly poisoned plazas.
At the exhibition, the visitors will see only all nine freshly born Turkish serpents.
This species lives in the northern Anatolia, even at a height of 2,000 meters.
"It also grows meter lengths," the speaker of the Zoo Martin Vobruba described.
Youths of the other two species, mortals and red cobris, while they will gain strength in the garden of the household.
We can't tell when people will see them.
"We wouldn't want to lose them," the nurse Miroslav Dog said that it might take a year or two.
The Australian serpents came to the world eight, they're descendants of a pair of breasts from the population in Sydney.
"The only person visitors can see in the exhibition belongs to the mortals from the area of Perth," said Vobruba, with the fact that in human care the mortal is necessary to winter 6-8 weeks at the temperature of 13 degrees of Celsia.
The per cent success carried out the snow of the African swimming red cobris.
The pair in the Pluzzi zoo lied out of four eggs of a total of four young men.
"The incubation lasted 65 days," Vobruba supplemented.
This kind in the nature of his victim is shaking poison, up to four meters away.
He's looking at his eyes, he can cause a lasting blindness.
Youths of all three species are feeding in the zoo with mice holates.
In 40 days in the garden, they still expect to lie in the young ones from the mamba's bed, the eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to an unchecked telephone interview rescription, Trump is creating pressure on Mexico for paying for the border wall
The U.S. Journal of Washington Post published a copy of President Trump's phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a telephone interview from January 27th with Mexican President Enrique Peña Netem, Trump urged him to stop publicly reporting that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The American President commented to him that he publicly condemned the construction of the wall, allegedly saying: “You can't talk like this in the press. ”
In his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern borders and announced that he would pay Mexico for it.
In the public, his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbul also escaped, revealing an intense exchange of views.
The President Trump told Turnbullo that the US surveillance agreement on refugees to Australia was "funny" and "bully" and insisted that if he agreed with this agreement -- which took up to the governments of President Obama -- would look like a "drog" after he proposed a ban on the entry of refugees to the United States.
The Trump call ended after explaining to Turnbull that “this is my most unpleasant call of the day. ”
Tusk reconsidered at the prosecution for Smolensk.
"He has nothing to worry about," said the brother of the dead president, the President of the Government of the Right and the justice of PiS Jaroslaw Kachinski, on Tusksk.
"I have nothing to worry about, Caczynski will not scare me," said Tusk and read the current leadership of the country that he is trying to abuse justice against political rivals.
When he left the office of the prosecutor, he waited for Tusk on TVN 24 crowds that scandalded Donald Tusk! and wished for a politician for 100 years!
Tusk thanked for his support and assured his conscience: "I have nothing to fear, and Kaczynski will not scare me."
The prosecutors have no doubt, but it does not doubt that justice has to serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against the rivals, opposition or people who do not like, and I fear that I belong to this group.
He was on the interrogation twice.
Expreier was interrogated in the prosecution twice, this time the interview was to be questioned about the surveillance of the victims of the Smolene disaster.
Furthermore, it came to replace the bodies in the trunks.
The families had been prohibited from opening the canvas, and there had to be some reasons for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal because he would burden the Polish-Russian relations.
"By maintaining good relations at all prices, despite such a terrible event, it should serve to make Donald Tusk a very important one in the EU," Kachinski claimed in the Catholic TV Trwam.
He added that the eventual conflict with Russia would disturb Tusk's chances to gain the most important chair in the Union from which Poland has absolutely nothing.
He also said that he warned the German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it could go differently with Donald Tuska, but she didn't know.
Tusk has taken an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecution in April 19th.
He didn't speak as a suspect at that time, only as a witness.
However, many of his invitations to interrogation considered part of the obvious efforts of the Polish government and the Chief of PIS Kachinian to discredit Tuska as a political rival by connecting with various scandals.
The prosecution is subject to the Ministry of Justice in Poland, who fulfils the role of the prosecutor General.
The invitation to interrogation came instantly after the election of Tuska by the head of the European Council, which the Kachinski tried to prevent in vain, inter alia when he visited Merkel in Warsaw.
At the EU Summit against the extension of Tuskov's mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Sidl protested alone.
In this case, Warsaw also left Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban.
Barma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote everywhere?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will vote newly on the composition of the Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013, the Czech Republic opened its representatives.
It's gained from a statement that adjusts the delivery of voting tickets to a foreign country.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its update, currently in the commentary procedure.
Four years ago, the Members of abroad voted 10,000 Czech citizens.
"Since the last amendment of the declaration in 2013, some changes have been made to be taken into account in these lists," the Ministry justified its procedure.
"In some countries there have been new representatives, some authorities have been closed, if possible, there has been a change in the level of representation," the material says.
The statement shall contain two Annexes, first of which the representatives of the authorities to which the paper voting tickets are added.
The representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia, belongs to this group of authorities.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a voting ticket in the press version.
Their list is just changing.
For example, four years ago, Czech embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe could vote in Czech embassy.
Both embassy are closed today.
Czech Republic has cancelled its representation also in Malayan Bamak and Japanese Kjot.
It won't even be the general consulate in Donec.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 for the Eastern War in Ukraine.
News are on the list of the embassy in Kenya Nairobi, the Senegal capital of Dakar and the Zambian Lusace.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, Czech Republic has extended its representation on the General Consulate in Iraqi Irbil and Cheng-tu, the capital of the Chinese province S'-chuan.
The voting tickets will also be available for registered voters in the Czech embassy in Barma and Cambodia.
The Czechs in abroad had the opportunity to select Members in the election rooms at representative offices or consulates so far four times.
Before each election, the State Electoral Commission shall determine the country for which candidates are voted in abroad.
It was the first time in 2002 when it was decided between the South Sea candidates.
In the next two elections, the Czech Republic voted abroad among the Southern candidates.
In 2013, the Mediterranean County was elected as this year.
The number of Czechs voted in abroad is stablely increased.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3800 people came to vote, in 2006, about 6700, four years later, 8222.
The preliminary elections of four years ago were delivered to the embassy of 10.571 voters.
Massacre on Moore's Ford: Activists remembered racist lenching
Ford Mercury, 1948, traveled around the observing inhabitants of Monroe, Georgia and kadrcal towards the Moore's Ford bridge.
However, before the car with four black skin passengers and a white driver reached the bridge, a group of white men with weapons came to him.
The leader of the group - a medium-age man in a stripped suit - pulled a long way out of the cigarette and looked at the front glass of the car.
Inside the travellers were shaking with fear.
"We want it -- and Roger!" a man shouted.
"Give it to me!"
Silence will interrupt the yelling of a young black man who is pulled out of the seat of a colleague.
Fortunately, this scene is just a reconstruction of events that happened on July 22th.
But when one of the men throws through the Roger's neck the waist, the public will breathe with excitement.
Since 2005, Moore's Ford returns to the Moore's Bridge regularly a group of activists reconstructing the fate night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of Kukluxklana.
No one's been judged for murders so far.
"It is a miracle that in all these years, the only person was not arrested -- even though we still see them in our community; even if we know their identity," Tyron Brooks was heard, who helped to reconstruct the event.
"It is a blur in our history and burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of Georgia State and a lifelife warrior for civil rights.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic challenge to do. Every year the community of Monroe reminds that justice was not done enough.
"We demand judicial prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace in mind and reconciliation, but justice first," said Brooks.
"The process of healing and reconciliation cannot be launched until then."
The Judge doctor covers one of the victims of lynching at Moore's Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI's records that received the NBC News report, the lynching should have attended up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts.
However, no one has been prosecuted before.
Although suspects remain for decades in freedom, civil rights members say that both causes of lynching - politics and sex - were known to all the inhabitants of the city.
In April 1946, on the basis of the decision of the Supreme Court, the inhabitants of the black skin of the State of Georgia received the first right to participate in the elections scheduled for the summer.
And just during the summer elections, according to the FBI, a farmer of black skin Roger Malcom had to beat the land owners of the white skin of Barnett Hester -- allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, he was trading that Hester was dealing with Malcom’s wife Dorothy and brought her into a different state.
According to the statement of the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the significant land owner of the white skin Loy Harrison for Malcoma bail at $600.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
When they returned from prison, just before they entered the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects set them up.
"As it turns out, he planned murders and organized Harrison," said the FBI.
"It is also obvious that there has been a secret agreement between state and local lawkeepers who have not only participated in lynching but have also removed evidence and hid the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks spoke more shortly about the whole matter.
“It was a massacre for election law”, he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all the local inhabitants of the black skin: "This is how you get if you register and go to vote."
The annual reconstruction of the event at the Moore's Ford is organized for nearly ten years of Cassandra Greene.
Her presentation is imaged, bound and precise. It shows a deeply rooted racism that many would like to view as extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction is not easy and even harder to turn your eyes away, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching, because we have to face the uncomfortable feelings that are hiding in each of us," said Greene.
"But there cannot be a relationship between us unless you hear what I had to go through."
The main tests of this year's reconstruction began in June and immediately the first day, approximately 30 players - twenty white people, the rest of the black - included in the room where Greene met them with a very carefully planned show.
Wade Marbaugh is executing an assistant director.
Many years he played the leader of Kukluxklan, but according to his words, the role is exhausting.
"I feel bad about it because it resists who I am," said Marbaugh.
"I think it's very important to remind this part of history regularly, because we never want to return until that time."
Herci Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play the role of Roger Malcom, in the course of Barnett Hester, are practicing their roles.
The show begins with a fight - Malcom argues with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get out of my land n-e!"
Rascona can't be.
There's a fight.
At that moment, everyone (but at least every black skin actor) will explode in a laugh.
Greene's laughing at all.
"What's going on?" says Rascona.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," answers Greene cheerfully.
"I just don't think that the white men then said 'n-r' in such a tone."
"Exactly," one of the black skin actors squeezes.
"You have to give greater emphasis on R."
Energy in the room is suddenly better; enemy will replace the sense of conjunction.
Everybody wants the show to be authentic, just so it could be done after four victims of a massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
Rascona this time emphasizes the right words to N.
No one's laughing now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Screaming, shooting... and incoming silence.
A woman dressed in black stands above the bodies of the actors and sings a sad song Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
With every word, it feels sad in the room.
There's about a dozen watchers on the background of all this, wearing sweats and tears out of the eyes.
There are almost the same number of blacks and white people in the public.
One couple landed from New York Ethacy, many watching from the nearby neighborhood.
Each of them endures the local wet climate nearly eight hours and Brooks leads them to Malcolm and Dorsey’s graves in the crowd.
Until this time the murders could have been viewed with a distance, but now, standing in the same place where there was linching, the atmosphere is scary.
With the last words of the song, Greene will call on the crowds watching body inspection.
Children kneel to the heads of the victims, watching false blood and immediate bodies and whispering in their ears.
"They're not dead," a little boy's screwed up.
He's running out for a few minutes, and Greene's gonna thank the public.
The heroes clean up the rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw's hugging Marbaugh, a man in a suit who played the leader of Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona will hug his two friends-heroes and cry in their arms; finally he's emotions.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
“We know that the role is about you.
But you had a reason for that."
Later that day, he will meet the public with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple talks about a black couple show they met today.
Denise Duplinski barely found words that would express her feeling of present show.
"It's hard to listen to these ugly words and to look at these ugly acts... that do people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said to reconstruction.
"I am forced to realize that the lynching is still a topic," she added, "he's just called police fight."
On the other side of the room, Tyron Brooks is sitting in the courtroom, enjoying dinner and talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he has already planned a show for the next year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring, because it describes the fear we had to experience - but it is also a moment to think," he said.
"If we do not learn from who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are convicted to repeat it."
I love the instructions to use.
A friend of mine says the instructions for use only reads scrabs.
I don't agree, on the contrary.
It's one of the modern forms of art, often direct surrealism.
With nostalgia, I remember a long time ago, where the instructions to use anything was rather a rare indication.
So maybe my first gramophone had only one paper on which the hieroglyphs showed the involvement of some parts, they all had some secret marks.
After years, I got something wrong inside, I offered that letter to the shaman who wasn't afraid to scratch the backboard.
He advised me with a slipper, what the paper with a labyrinth charm is appropriate for.
Yes, it was a common help on the chronic depletion of the toilet paper.
He gravely found a disconnected wire and allowed me to listen to the expensive vinyl cookies again.
The new time has brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit sealer, where he just sticked to the overwhelmed grep, required about ten pictures.
Especially a draft with a description of how to put one part into the other.
The adjustment was two parts and the other procedure was simply not possible.
To give it again, it required significant efforts with the need to break certain plastic parts.
My despise of the instruction ended up at my seat Leon mark.
The year of production, 2003, had a book with the instructions of tiny repairs, including the exchange of blinkr lamps.
It was easy.
All three steps and the work should have been done.
Unfortunately, the author of the instruction noted that while the lamp on the right went to actually switch in three steps.
1. Seal the cover.
2. Strike out a screwed light and screw up the new.
3. Move the cover.
The lamp left had a problem with the location of the battery.
At first, I thought that by putting the right upper upper end in the car's burst, I would look at a screwing screwing, which would easily remove, and then I'll be running points 1-3 of the savings author of the service book.
It's a lave mistake.
The shelter had no place, no space for the sharp hand of Ashes, as well as the obsessive Slezan.
I lost half an hour of my life, totally without any success.
The condition was still strengthened by my wife's entry into the garage, which led to the screaming and words that heard from my mouth completely exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked me without me.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, however, if I missed vulgarian terms, there were only two publications left.
I'm changing the light.
"And why does it take you so long?" she cried the sentence that in the long-term bond could be her last.
I slowly explained the problem, with the main emphasis on the procedure of torture of the author's instruction, where the blessing of the burned iron on the hand, which was written by her instructions to never write anything again, was just an introduction to the broad scale of the instructions of Kladiva to the witch, including his commission burning on the top of the Losin castle.
"What about unmounting the box?" the woman thought the battery was mounting.
In a clear desperation, the step of 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that's the day a colleague called me, who was just talking from a collapse situation after the control of two officials of the State Office for Medicines Control.
I know him as a balanced colleague who experienced possible and impossible in the field and who can interpret wild stories by an unexpected voice.
"Pretend that I've got a penalty for not hanging instructions for washing my hands," he told me with a weak voice.
I gradually embarrassed the whole problem that was involved in the washing of the patient's toilet on the toilet has no picture instruction that wash his hands.
His arguments by the Commission Officer that adults can wash their hands usually and that no need of icons to manage the common activities of the decent people, had no healing effect and cost him much money.
"It's not just like that," she told him.
He understood that the simple slip of the hands of the liquid water is a primitive act at the cromanian level that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
Therefore, it is necessary to be informed that water is needed to be released from the cocktail.
The whole process has a total of 11 points, but at the end, there is a joyful finding that a man washed his hands exactly as he orders the boarder from the CCL.
Finally, I have to state that I have inspired myself and prepare a detailed plan for the toilet activity.
In the matter of defection, the procedure is united, there is no problem in urging, in view of certain differences in both genders, it will be necessary to expedite the instructions two.
The problem is that the icons remain, because the creation of a perfect procedure also means a precise graph of all anatomic details, which could awake a certain turmoil visitor in the toilet, despite the fact that he can finally find out that he has erased the corresponding opening through a completely mistaken process throughout his life.
Pearson will release another 3,000 employees and reduce dividend in trying to restore the trade
The British Education Group, Pearson, said on Friday, that it would release another 3,000 employees and reduce the temporary dividend by 72 per cent in response to another restructuring programme in order to change the business model.
Another wave of release, which, according to the statement of the executive director John Fallon, occurs at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, follows the previous decision of the company to release 4000 employees in the framework of the previous restructuring.
The Pearson announced a plan to reduce costs for another 300 million pounds (394 million dollars) in May under the third programme to reduce costs to resurrect the decreasing trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its share in the Penguin Random House of Bertelsmann, stated that the view for this year remained unchanged after one-percent increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Attack to the convoy in Cabul: NATO soldiers were killed in suicide explosion
Self-suicide assault attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan Cabulu.
Five soldiers and interpreters were injured, as stated in the statement of NATO.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians also died in the City District.
This month, the Afghanistan bomb attack -- on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in the explosion in the heratic mosquito.
On Monday, a suicide attacker killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO, in its statement, stated that the Tuesday explosion occurred after the patrol was attacked by “local person with an explosive device.”
The statement further states that all injuries of soldiers are out of the risk of life and are located in the US military hospital at Bagram Air Base.
According to the rapporteurs, the increasing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the area of Qarabagh is a significant source of concern to the NATO allies in the neighbouring Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at the first half of 2017, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan, with 20% of the victims died in the capital.
At the end of July, the bomb was killed in the car at least 30 people in the Shia Cabul county.
The Taliban signed up for the attack.
On May 31, he killed a large explosion in the center of the city more than 150 people, which is the most deathly military attack in the country since the American units launched the Government of Taliban in 2001.
Violence undermines such a doubtful situation in Afghanistan, and President of the United States Donald Trump considers the increase in the number of American soldiers that should help military units and police officers in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, suicide attacks he was exploiting in recent weeks with public confidence in the government, its regulation, and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanien.
In response to the complaint, the EPA revised its decision to dismiss the smoking rules
The American Environmental Protection Agency has cancelled its decision to delay the law of Obama's administration, which ordered States to reduce emissions, just a day after the agency sued 15 States.
The EPA announced its decision on the submission of Ozone Standards 2015 in the middle of the night, in the words of the Agency's obligation to cooperate with the States.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and we will hear their views," said director EPA Scott Pruitt.
Pruitt notified in June the EPA's efforts to reduce ozone standards - which measure real air pollution in specific areas of the country and on the basis of measurement determine the limits to be met by October 2018.
The group of 15 of the majority of democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit on Tuesday with reason that the negotiations of the EPA were illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump seeks to avoid many environmental regulations proposed by the former President Barack Obama -- according to Trump's words, in an effort to compromise economic growth.
However, the efforts of the new government have begun anti-contracting by democrats and conservative groups that fear the impact of emissions on public health.
EPA on its websites states that breathing air with the ozone content “may reduce the function of lungs and increase respiratory symptoms”, such as astma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnar got a wound and bleeded!
This, in our relatively new singer, you may have already registered in June this year, when this almost unknown singer has arranged for the Czech relations of monster action to which he hosted the front personalities such as Master Karel Gott, Lucia White, Simona Krain, and a number of other, and no other acts had been modified by anyone other than Leoš Maresh.
The purpose was simple, to appear to the public and to introduce his musical video to Sara’s song, whose baptism was just appointed.
But few already know that the filming of a video that took place in Russia was not without problems, and Ladislav Bubnar himself must have been treated.
It was his first big film with the stars of the Russian national ballet, and it didn't go without a real embarrassment.
Sara's song is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the dramatic scene, in the video of the singers' juice, he was supposed to mark a fack hit.
At one point, however, he hit him so strongly and directly into his nose that a young singer had to be treated by a doctor.
"It was a wound, I didn't expect it, it came from my nose immediately," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers said the situation was unfortunate, and Ladislav did not respond in time.
Fortunately, the injuries were not so serious that it affected the continuation of the next film.
The video of a young artist we're bringing to you now, and you can record the scene with a hit.
The unsuccessful blood version, however, was not preferred to be used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasil Lomačenko talked about the possibilities of mutual duel
Vasil Lomačenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could emphasize the most stressful boxing game in a lightweight, first met at the Tuesday meeting.
Each of them was located in a separate room in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, while Garcia - unbelievable champion in the lightweight World Boxing Council - went down to the hall where Lomačenka welcomed the champion of the World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against the former four-fold world champion Adrien Broner in the Saturday match at Showtime, both boxers got on the list of five best boxers in a lightweight.
Garcia dragged his right hand and said, "How's it going, champion?
Good luck."
Lomačenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN on Saturday at 19:00.
Boxers are posting for photographers and the Lomačenka manager Egis Klimas adds that the potential fight of boxers would be a "perfect test".
"I'm a former champion in the feather weight," Garcia adds.
“For the fight with Broner (67 kg), I had to pick up, but I'm not so big.
I'm small at my 63 pounds.
I'd like to go back to the category of light weight.
Lomachenko has to pick up again to get a light weight... then we can fight.
The fan wants it.
Why don't we do it to them."
Lomačenko agrees.
"Box would be good for this game."
Climas raised a request for a payment for view - which is part of his strategy. Lomačenko should graduate his debut in light weight at the end of this year and next year to struggle with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), which also expressed interest in the fight against the duel of Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who struggled on 23 September on the title in a light weight in the arena Forum.
"The fight should take place in the style of paying for view, that is what the fans ask," Garcia said later, who expressed that there was an open opportunity to send the game through the TV station that came with the best offer.
"We are the main attraction.
No one else will draw such attention to himself.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said he recognised Lomačenka as a “awesome boxer ” and could take part in his Saturday match.
But Lomačenko didn't get Garcia's gratitude to collapse when he said that the champion of three divisions from Riverside seemed "very slow... excuse Mike, but you're talking about knockout."
Garcia said that his goal was to show strength and then box.
Boxers indicated that they felt a growing tension in front of each other's duel.
"You will not just forget this game.
There's no other match that will pay attention.
And I will be very pleased to put in the fire," Garcia said.
Lomačenko said, "I was waiting for the best boxers and this is Mikey."
It'll be a great game."
A young couple 12 years ago disappeared without a lead.
They found their car now on the bottom of Volha.
Two young Russians Ilja Žirnov and Kira Čerkasov have been missing since December 2005.
There was a huge search, but no success.
And the police finally finished the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they wouldn't know what happened to the couple.
After 12 years, a sad end of the story came.
The wreck of their car found a laic diver on the bottom of the Volha River in Cheboxara, Čuvaška.
Just because of the documents left in the car, the police were able to identify a few.
The documents survived the entire decade under water, and without it, the police would take much longer to identify the identity of the founders.
A couple was last seen when Žirnov borrowed a car from his father so he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver that the car discovered remains anonymous.
He announced his finding to the Cheboxar police, which next day pulled the car to the beach.
The investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident caused by a frozen road running around the river.
However, the investigation continues, and further details will be published after it is completed.
The latest results of tests to determine the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of asylum asylum tests in Sweden, who were subjected to new methods of assessment of their age, show that over 80 percent of people were questioned as old as 18 years old, but not everyone believes their precision.
Swedish Forensical Medical Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) began new tests at the beginning of this year.
The purpose of the method is to better assess the applicants in the context of the assessment of asylum applications. The measures have been approached after the Swedish migration age Agency (Migrationsverket) has been criticised for failure in determining the right age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date today, the Sweden Migration Agency has submitted 6880 cases to investigate, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests carried out from half March to 31 July 2017.
80% (2002) was assessed as aged 18 years, while in other 25 cases, the Forensic Medical Agency considered that the questioned was “possibly older than 18 years old”.
In other 423 cases, it was decided that the question was “may be 18 years old. ”
The tests shall only be accessible if the age of the questioned one is disputed.
According to Johan Gçransson from the Forensic Medical Agency, the results are corresponding to the previous month.
"In addition to the last month, statistics are held in captured railways and numbers are very similar," stated the Local.
The high number of applicants whose age was estimated for age of 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum applicants lie about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases, “the questioned person is 18 or older”.
The Svenska Dagbladet newspapers investigated 581 public cases and found that in 243 cases, the questioned man said he was 18 years old.
Criticism was also awaited by a medical method of designing age, which includes the rentgen of wise teeth and the MRI scan of the knee joints, which are then assessed by dentists and rentgenologists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus from the Karolin Institute, who is also dealing with the assessment of the biological maturity of people to determine the age when the concerned is a puberty.
"I had a reason to think about this problem and I don't think that these types of measurement of age are correct.
The biological age assessment is very uncertain in a certain sense.
If we can't determine the age with precision, we should not pretend to be the opposite," said the Metro newspaper.
The Forensic Medical Agency of the Agency’s Gçransson defended the decision by saying: “The risk of the wrong assessment of the child as an adult is generally possible.
The highest risk is the fact that the questioned person is closely under the limit of 18 years, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all questioned."
Trump threatened to call the president of Mexico.
The American President Donald Trump, in the January call to the Mexican President Enrique Penya Neta, threatened that he would not meet him if he would publicly say that his country would not pay for the construction of a wall between the United States and Mexico.
Trump in the interview said that financing would be arranged somehow, even though he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump spoke with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbul.
It comes from the receipts of the interviews published by the American Journal of The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made a wall on the southern border for mexican money one of the main promises in his last year's electoral campaign.
Right in the first interview with the Mexican President shortly after his entry into the function of Trump Peñu Neta, he did not diplomatically care for being critical to his plan for building the wall.
He emphasized the South Neighbour as a growing political problem and pushed the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government will never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this to the press," Trump repeatedly said in an interview of January 27th and threatened to interrupt contacts with the Mexican President if he would continue to issue an objective statement.
They say the financing is going to come up with something, and it's finally gonna work well.
"But if you say that Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to see you anymore, because it's unacceptable for me," said the American Day of Trump.
The wall has marked the least important thing we're talking about, but politically it may be the most important thing.
The executive command for the construction of the wall, Trump, issued shortly after taking power.
Mexico's construction and funding of a wall length of 3,200 miles [200 km] denied, and the relations of both countries have been exploited.
At the end of March, Trump said that the project would be paid by the United States so far.
Trump eventually first met with his Mexican proteager at the June Summit of G20 in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also informed Trump's telephone conversation with the Australian Prime Minister Turnbul of January 28th.
The Chief of the White House called the conversation a funny one.
This conclusion has led him to the exchange of views on an agreement under which Australia will provide asylum to the Central American refugees in exchange for the United States to accept international facilities in the Pacific Island States.
The Trump first considered the deal a fool, but later he came to it.
"Certainly you can tell that this is not the agreement you made, but you will have to stick to it," Trump Turnbull said.
In some passages, a telephone conversation with Turnbul was almost vital, for example, when Trump appreciated as a good idea of Australian refusal to accept refugees in boats.
"You're worse than me," he joked Trump.
But suddenly, the tone of the conversation was sharp.
"I hate the acceptance of these people," said Trump.
I assure you they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They will not be great people who will go work for local milkmen," he said.
In the interview, he also stated that a fugitive could become an assassin from Boston in five years.
Trump led at the end of January, that is about a week after arriving in the White House, telephone interviews with a number of world states, often a few during one day.
The call with Turnbul finally marked the least pleasant for the whole day.
Before he finished, he emphasized that he had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier.
They fixed Rana's killer before the crowd.
Her father was watching.
The execution took place in the Square in Jemen Sana.
Muhammad al-Maghrabbi chose his victim a little Rana Almatari who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrab kidnapped a girl, took her to his father's house, raped her and strangled with his holy hands.
Then he raped her body, and then threw it near the mosquito.
The violent death of a little girl affected the whole country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the first row of the thousands of heads of the crowd that gathered to become a witness to the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrab was convicted under the law of chario.
The father of the victim after the execution told the media his feelings.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day of my life.
Other family members were also present, together with the crowd, yelling the password "Let Justice live."
The rapeman brought the police van from which he was pulled out.
The cops put him on the stomach.
One of the members turned their weapons against him and fired from the immediate nearby.
The present crowd celebrated every shot that was burned.
Mr al Almatari told the MailOnline website that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"The justice, Allah and the law of the chariya have won," he added.
I stood at the Sana Liberation Square waiting for my daughter's murder.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ranni's small body and buried him in the nearby cemetery.
I and my wife Jamileh are grateful that justice has been done.
The police were afraid that the crowd gathered on the square would fall into hatred madness, the killer's falling and lying.
The execution was ordered by a court, which is under the control of the Shiit Hucies.
But originally Magrabi was convicted to 100 wounds by bull, but his act raised such a rebellion that the judge decided for death penalty.
Al Magrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27th.
Ranna's family knew him well.
When the police were searching his house ceiling, they found evidence that the man was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
Even the animal would be more mercy to the Wound.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injuries that ran Ranna's body were scary," he said to the media.
"The morning disappeared afternoon, and that day we reported it to the police, we told the newspapers and all our television stations, the posters with her photo were hanging everywhere," he continued.
Everyone believes the police got a tip from the killer's parents who suspected their son of awful crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after she learned that her daughter's body was found.
The wound was playing out with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went to see where she is.
We've been looking everywhere, but Rana's gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we looked for nothing.
The inhabitants of Jemen were distracted by crime and began to gather themselves in front of the police station where al Magrabi was held and demanded immediate punishment.
The deputy of the Ministry of Justice read the record of the investigation to calm them down.
The accused, according to everything, did not show regret.
Just before his punishment, the police read his sentence, but the convicted one looked at his executive.
The whole event was recorded for national television, but there were many records on the Internet that the crowd had taken.
Governor of the Western Virginia announced the change in political party
The Democratic Governor of the West Virginia Jim Justice announced at the meeting of President Trump on Thursday night that he was moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, democrats have turned their back to me," said Governor Justice.
"I tell you today after a long prayer and thought... today as the inhabitant of the West Virginia, I tell you that I cannot continue to support you from the position of a democratic governor."
The crowd of observers exploded in joy.
"I will sign up to the Republicans tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you, it's time to jump into another game."
Trump has already promised people to meet in the West Virginia.
Trump won 42 points in Western Virginia and Justice did not support the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the country in the magazine Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a great property from his father and owned a few coals down.
The value of his property is estimated at $1.59 billion.
At the same time, on Thursday night, the Republican National Committee issued a statement in which it stated: “The passage of Governor Justice is another injury to the democratic party, which puts obstacles to our way rather than to raise our country. ”
"For a democratic party that has only 15 governors and controls at least the legislative authorities in history, it is the most recent notification of Governor Justice for the already posed party without a leader who seeks to find a positive and unified report," said President RNC Ronna McDaniel in its statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe commends Russia's "free" apology for doping scandal
The former excellent sportsman Sebastian Coe commended Russia on Thursday for a sincere apology for the doping scandal, but repeated again that it has not yet been the right time to return Russia to the sports world.
The Russian athletic chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the opportunity of the IAAF Congress - which took place at the evening of the MS at athlete - that the expulsion of his country from the sports world was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized “all the athletes who thus lost gold and silver medals. ”
Despite its comments, the members of the IAAF Congress voted for the reservation of the ban which entered into force in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report revealed that Russia supported the doping of its sportsmen.
"I think we were witnesses today very sincere answers and presentations," President IAF Sebastian Coe told journalists.
"All members of the Council and the Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia confessed its mistake and worked out of all the powers to fix and restore the right function of the entire Federation."
Coe said he was also “happy” that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has been very successful and we have gone to another degree, but the Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis headquarters to preserve the penalty that was thrown into Russia," Coe added.
"We have to do everything we can to stabilize the situation in the nearest months.
Our efforts were always to separate honest athletes from those dishonest," he finished his speech.
The MS athlete starting on Friday in London will compete under the neutral flag of 19 Russian athletes who fulfilled strict rules of IAAF.
The Chief of the Crisis Office IAAF Rune Andersen said Monday that Russia must still meet several criteria before it is allowed back.
The drug presence tests are still unsuitable and the exclusion coaches continue their activities, he told the reporters in London after the IAAF Council was completed.
The CzechTrade State Procurement received Francesco Savova, whose State is pursuing.
The public procurement of the CzechTrade State Proportion Agency has obtained the publication of the Young Front Front Františka Savova.
The officials gave him 100 per cent of the points in all quality criteria.
They had no problem with the Czech State pursuing Savov for tax fraud and asking for his publication to Czech Republic.
The exporting agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of CzechTrade issued a public procurement in April for four years of editorial content for BusinessInfo portal.
The total procurement of 30.8 million crowns has been obtained by the issue of the Young Front of Undertaking Entrepreneur Františka Savova.
In 2014, the Czech Police has accused it of tax escapes and has been prosecuted to escape.
Savov fled to Great Britain and Czech Republic is asking for his publication.
On the case, the server has warned Currently.cz.
The procurement was to decide from 60 per cent of the price offered and from the remaining 40 beauty competitions, thus the quality of the project.
The second criterion has been significantly helped to Savov's company.
According to information, Dotik.cz received 100 points in all partial criteria of quality.
As a result, it was moved before another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with 404 900 crowns a month, VLM offered 324 350 crowns.
Unlike the Young Front, however, the estimaters in all quality criteria received sub-mediate evaluation, totally 62 points.
The Tendru's consultant company BDO Consultants and digital R-Media agency, which falls like the server Currently.cz under the Economy issue.
The VLM issued a number of objections against the result of the tend with the view of its assessment of nza unfair and insufficient reasons.
After their refusal, it decided to attack a competition at the Office for the Protection of Competition of UOHS.
He believes that the CzechTrade was in contrast with the law.
"The applicant is convinced that the contractor has made a decision to choose a supplier of a public procurement on the basis of the criterion of the subjective evaluation, a clearly favourable participant of the Young Front, a.s.s., on the cost of the proposaler and other suppliers," the proposal for the start of the procedure submitted to the UOHS this week, which published by the server Currently.
According to the Director-General and Chairman of the VLM Michal Clima, the pointing of the selection committee appears to be an incredible and 100 per cent evaluation of the Young Front Project in all its members as exceptionally suspected.
"Each independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors unlikely and suspected," he stated for the Current Climate.
ChechTrade has not yet spoken to the situation.
The CzechTrade Agency does not in principle comment on public procurement before they are closed.
All information on you mentioned orders are published in the Profile of Providers and Public Procurement Reporters in accordance with the law.
"When the contract is complete, the full written report will be published, however, during the duration of the procurement we cannot express ourselves to its progress," said for Dotik.cz the median representative of the agency Stephen Long.
The young front responded by a statement which considers it extremely problematic that the issue of the Economy has affected the Article in Current.cz to the competition where it has its own business interests.
However, this fact was stated in the mentioned article.
In the tender, it could have helped her that she was the one who provided BusinessInfo editorial service in the previous four years.
The procurement was first confronted in 2013, when the Ministry of Industries and Trade led Martim Cuba ODS.
France Savova blames the taxpayer police in connection with the excessive VAT calculation of its companies, which caused the Czech State a reported damage to up to 770 million crowns.
Czech Republic has been asking the United Kingdom for its publication since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of his criminalization of the ANO Andrej Babish movement, under which the Mafra issue is affected.
The London Court rejected the appeal against issue last year, but the entrepreneur renounced.
"From our views, the case from last year has not moved anywhere; from Britain, we have not received any understanding in the case of acquiring a judicial power until now," stated the speaker of the Prague city's state representation, Stefan Zenklová.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savov in the company Harvestor Limited with a seat in Cyprus, which controlled the Chescobudia beer Samson, and in the Cyprus company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, which purchases threatous assets.
Heavy Machinery Services, before Legios, owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also connected with the withdrawal of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The engineer walked through the walks and the park, ended up in bullets.
The engineer attracted his attention to the unreasonable ride along the streets, walks and park roads in Ušovice.
When the patrol began to pursue him, he decided to go to the position.
"Police officers with increased caution persecuted the city when one of the sideways behind the Marian Lazens failed to manage and went into the field where he crashed," said the police spokesman Daniel Dvořák.
In the end of the accident, a rescue helicopter had to be arrived, which transported the injured engineer to the pulse hospital.
After that, the police found that the engineer of no driver's license, the registration marks on the motorcycle were disconnected, his production number was removed and the product label itself was removed.
It's so possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to another investigation.
"The respiratory test was excluded at the site of alcohol in the driver, but the test was identified by a positive result on the substance of metamphetamine," the police speaker added.
How the financial rules of football affect Neyamara's movement to Paris
The rules restricting the financing of European football clubs will no longer interfere with Neymar's recording from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalization for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by a organisation of EUFA which supervises European football teams and has the power to ban the teams' participation in the prestigious Master League.
The rules of financial fair play (FFP) which introduced the EUFA in 2011 determine that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's offence was not financed without great losses.
Barcelona paid EUR 222 million only for buying Neymar from its contract and Neymar would require a few dozen million dollars a year.
It follows several financial conditions of Neymar's transition to France.
Since the PSG team is financed by a wealthy catarian family that is rich in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neimar into such a star football family.
The clubs may spend a huge amount of money on the purchase of players, but on the other hand they must prove legal income sources, which enables them to cover direct costs of trade activities related to football.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini after reaching the chair of the Director of EUFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs that owed new aids are cheating and risking bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to provide them.
In 2011, the FFP rules transmitted its attention from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model Roman Abramovic used with Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and wasted the horent sums for players y to build a global mark - suddenly was not so useful.
During the current three-year testing period ending in 2018, clubs can demonstrate the loss of EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Alexander Cheferin is determined to defend the ban on excessive expenses.
"The FFP rules are still valid and we are determined to strengthen them in the future," stated last week for the Associated Press Andrea Traverso, who monitors compliance with FFP rules.
Although the PSG has paid the amount for the purchase of Neyar in one-time payment, it can disburse the amount for the purposes of the accounting at the time of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be distributed to EUR 44.4 million annually for five years.
The first wave of the highest sanctions of FFP affected PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, which owns Abu Dhabi.
The PSG has paid a penalty of EUR 60 million (82 million) which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and the order to reduce the men of the Master League to 21 players in the season 2014-2015, instead of 25 players.
EUFA takes care of teams that can try to circulate financial regulators by increasing their income through club owners.
Therefore, even though the Katarian company is sponsoring PSG as soon as funding exceeds the value of the standard market rate, the EUFA has the right to prohibit the calculation of the amount.
In 2014, the EUFA decided that the amount of the funds granted by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
The part of Neymar’s revenue in PSG could, according to some reports, be retained from the MS organizational committee in football 2022 in Katar.
However, the PSG and representatives of MS 2022 in Katar denyed the fat that Neymat should become Ambassador of MS in football and that such maneuver would easily be revealed by UEFA actors.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that EUFA will closely monitor any attempt to circulate rules,
According to the Tuesday statement of dedicated persons, EUFA has not launched any investigation in the case of Neyamara's transfer to PSG.
The source of this report wished to remain anonymous, since the PSG situation was not authorized to comment, the Agency The Associated Press stated.
The latest published accounts indicate that the PSG concluded 2015-2016 with a net profit of €10 million and EUR 542,4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neyamara's arrival to be an enormous opportunity for sponsors, marketing and sale of dresses.
The contract's signing club promises to increase the rotation by 30 per cent.
The representatives of the Spanish League, apparently concerned about leaving one of the biggest stars, were trying to wipe Neymar's departure, argumenting that PSG would violate FFP rules.
"It is a clear case of the ‘financial doping’ club and the state," said President La Ligy Javier Teba for Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the PSG Club by the caterian syndicate.
Arsenale Arsene Wenger, whose club owns an American sports magnat, shares the same position of La Ligy on the financing of the club.
"It is the result of property that has changed the football world from bases in the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as the owner of the club becomes, everything is possible.
Following the rules of the financial fair play is very difficult, because the State may have various interests in the participation of such players in its club."
The Spartan Customer of Russia: Changes are painful, but we must believe.
Sixteen thousand applause fans on their feet.
Tomasz Rosic is going to the square.
The same scene as the Sunday fight against the Bohemians.
The Spartan customer was moving against the Red Star game, inventing a few goloves, but his colleagues did not go to the black.
The Summer Team, pumped by new multi-million forces, thus after the introduction of the two fights in European cups ends.
Was it hard to do anything else with the fight after the Belgrade Gate?
After an incassed goal, four were needed to be shot, which was hard for us.
At least we wanted not to lose, to raise our self-consciousness, so that we should go from something to other matches.
We had some chances.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why didn't Sparta get into the fight so long?
The game is so worked.
The combinations of the rival were much better than ours.
We didn't get to anything. We shot halfway after time.
Of course, that's very little when you have to win for two or three goals.
The second half time was much better, in the final third, we were able to play with them.
But you have to push the rivals more frequently into such positions.
Is the problem with a large number of changes in the system?
Of course, it's one of the pains when new men are formed.
We only played three competitive fights, and the composition is still changing.
It's about the coach to find an ideal one to sit down.
Is it encouraging for you that you've already played parts of two matches after you?
They're still just parts of the wrestling.
I don't know how my condition will evolve and when I can finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have happened in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise we can't.
It's the same thing as injury.
If you don't believe, you can't come back.
Sparta has somehow decided, we must be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be worse.
The fans came again in a large number, but they went out in distress.
What can you tell them?
There was a wonderful visit again, just like with Godmaka.
I'm so sorry that we can't make them happy with a better performance.
To show something they're coming for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember these visits when I played here 15 years ago.
Can the season without cups be at least a benefit for the league?
So far, we fight ourselves, we play, so it's not such a benefit for us.
For a extreme tax escape, the businessman has to stay ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of the entrepreneur of Jiri Toman, who is going to take a significant amount of taxes in prison for ten years.
The numbered damage is 645 million crowns.
Toman claimed in complaint that the jurisdiction has violated his fundamental rights, the determination of the courts in Zlína and the Olomouc is incomplete.
However, the constitutional judges indicated the complaint as unreasonable, CTC found out from the court database.
The ES is not another appeal court.
"It cannot be the fourth instance to assess the effective or legal doubts that the general courts have reportedly committed unless they constitute violations of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution states.
Toman was judged as a fugitive.
The verdict is authorised since November 2015, when the Supreme Court of Justice in Olomouca confirmed it.
At that time, Toman was in an executive detention in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was located even during the U.S. decision.
The penalty stored is on the upper limit of the legal rate, which, according to the verdict, corresponds to the injury caused.
The Supreme Court has identified the case as a extreme tax escape which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man worked in 2005 to 2008 as Chairman of World Services.
The damage of 645 million crowns only occurred from January to July 2008, the total escape according to the expert exceeded a billion.
However, for the processing reasons, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the entire amount.
According to the lawsuit, the World Service did not include in its tax confession all the invoices.
Instead of monthly VAT and consumption taxes, at least tens of millions of crowns paid taxes in only hundreds of thousands.
World Services and some companies with which the company has been dealing have a relationship with the businessman Radomir Elector, whom justice measured to machinace with VAT in the 13 years of prison.
The Constitutional Court also rejected his complaint.
The series "The Summer of Unlife" and "Comrade Detective" play the Nostalgic Strune
This iteration of the story is nostalgic both for figures of the famous 80s; and for the filthy 1990s (when the genius David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the MTV comedial scope "The State"); and of course even for the modern era, in particular 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd took place on larger projects.
As a cultural artefact, it is a light parody and at the same time the body of our modern facebook era of permanent memories.
But it looks like someone's breathing.
The series “First Day of Camp ” worked surprisingly well - not only thanks to the absurd humor (e.g. a story of a talking bowl with vegetables that H. Jon Benjamin talked about).
The authors distracted from the main funny point - actors of the mid-year-olds who play adolescent burned children - and couldn't have been so distracted from the previous events.
The continuation of “Ten Years Later” in which adults play not so much on the emotional level and satira is a sporadical place, including a parody on thrillers of the 1990s as “Ruka on the wheel”.
At one point, the character will be found in the bunch of apple Powerbook, the wheel brushes and the “spuss of other things from 1991.”
Many of the main stories lines are repeated.
The goodhearted Coop (pan Showalter), now a writer, has not yet moved over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not speaking of a crazy confusion that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), inspired by George H. W. Bush (very well-obsessed by Michael Ian Black).
As always, they're the best part of the French lots of side stories.
Especially fun is to watch forever a young Rudd with long hair alias the character of Matt Dillon from the Youth movie, whose once respectful character of Andy is now an old paprika.
France could start the moments of random madness, such as returning the Seven Up series until it reaches what I assumes to be logical: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when the entire group in the last scene turns out at the Prime Minister "The Year to Live".
"Comrade Detective" at the same time calls for another type of nostalgia: revivalism of the cold war to the series "So normal Americans", "Atomic Blonde: No regret" and even the series "GLOW", in which the eastern and Western wrestling scenes are facing.
The Creators' commission of Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka in directing Rhyse Thomase is to be a television inspection: a drama of two Bucharest police officers from Romania in the past 80th century who fight for truth and atheism in the way of marxism-lennism.
The main roles of Gregor and idealist Iosefa - are Florin Piersic Junior and Corneliu Street, which were acquired in the English language Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more.
In some jokes, you laugh (such as police watching chess on TV - parodie to American football).
The series offered its voice to many famous actors -- among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny.
"Comrade Detective" is too focused on an incredible propagandistic drama -- which includes also a killer with Reagan's mask -- and that also looks like it.
Six long episodes are too distracting and comedial moments are not enough.
In a shorter track, the propagandist satira in "Comrade Detective" could work, for example, in a scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Ambassador, in which two fat hamburgers swallow hamburgers on a large crowd.
The clear message for the imaginary communist population is that the Western culture can transform everything into food and orgy.
The idea of Romanian creators was not wrong: we do so with our own culture as well as theirs.
The Russian athletes have not waited for the ban on IAAF.
The International Athletic Federation of IAAF at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on russian race triggers for the State supported by the Doping Programme.
The voting in the history of the world championship, which begins Friday, was very clearly expected.
In order to extend the ban, 166 delegates were expressed against only 21 votes.
The main reason for rejection is, in particular, the fact that Russia cannot meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as the head of the Special Investigation Group of IAAF Rune Andersen said before the Congress.
His group recommended that the ban continues.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been heard and coaches still work in the country.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency RUSADA is not yet fully functional, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
RUSADA, however, can be tested under the supervision of foreign experts and the British antidoping agencies.
"Although progress has been made, there is still a lot to do," IAF President Sebastian Coe said.
The Russian Athletic Federation was suspended in November 2015, so Russian athletes lost, inter alia, the last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the prohibition of the coming MS, 19 Russians who have already proved that they have been tested for a long time outside the Russian anti-doping system.
But at the championship, they won't be able to run in national colors, and in the case of winning, they won't play Russian hymna.
The Bank of England shall maintain the interest rate of 0.25 %
The Bank of England should, as expected, notify that the interest rate remains unchanged, following an uncertain economic growth and the degradation of the inflation that suppressed speculation on rapid growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will continue to remain "in the background" in relation to maintaining the interest rate - despite the expectation of family budgets.
Political actors of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Banks of England voted six to two to maintain the interest rate of 0.25%. The results of the vote for the increase in interest rates have supported the inexplicit economic growth supported by weak growth.
In its annual inflation report, the bank predicted an increase of 1,7% in 2017 and 1,6% in 2018 and warned that the reduction of family budgets will continue. The Bank expects the inflation to increase at the autumn to 3%.
At the same time, the Bank indicated that during the next few years, the inflation resulting from Brexim should be increased, and also indicated that the rental from movements should increase more on the financial markets than was expected.
The members of the Committee also voted for the withdrawal of a part of the mammal package, whose task was to support the economy, and which was introduced in practice a year ago as an answer to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the Plan of Termed Finance, which will offer cheap grants to banks, even though the Bank of England stated that, in contrast with the planned 115 billion £, would now offer less than 15 billion £.
Just before the decision, the bank declared: “MPC predicts that a gross domestic product (BDP) will be reinforced in short term with the pressure on real household income and burden of consumption.”
On the topic of the rate, the bank stated that it would be necessary to “track the removals of money policy” to calm the inflation, which is “to a higher extent” than the markets are expected.
The markets currently predict the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and the next increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any growth would be “free” and “limited”.
The Bank has reduced the forecast of growth for this year and next year in comparison with 1,9 % and 1,7 % of the forecasts in May.
The estimated growth in 2018 of 1.8 % remained unchanged.
After the estimates were published, the pound dropped against the dollar and euro.
The pound dropped by 0.5% to $1.31 and by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to preserve an existing condition came after disappointing growth buried the hope of further growth - the GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter, compared to 0.2% of the previous three months.
Increasing with high probability will remain to 0.3% in the third quarter, although by the end of the year, it should be slightly increased according to the statement of the bank.
The latest inflation report is an unnecessary comfort for households affected by rising inflation and miserable increases in payments. The Bank stated that the situation will be worse before growth.
The report further states that monetary policy "can't prevent" the reduction of income in the coming years, but it is expected that the wages will be "explicit" to the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also increase due to the great interest in British goods through a weak pound, which compensates a lower percentage of consumer expenditure.
This decision came a year after the rates were reduced to 0.025% last August in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, which resulted in the decline of libraries in August.
The Bank estimates that the total unification of prices and economics will take at least four years.
Before the decision of the Bank on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates along with an increasing inflation that increased the pressure on household. Three political actors demanded 0.5% in June.
The inflation last month fell back to 2.6% of June 2.9%, even though the bank said that it was expected and that the inflation should rise again during the next month.
The Bank stated that the crossing relative to 2 % of the target was “in full” as a result of a weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “In view of the recent fall of swap rates, it appears that competitiveness at the hypothetical market will only rise as soon as the creditors begin to compete for procurement with a good view at the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who are ending with existing contracts and renewable mortgages - in the offer there are options without fees, as well as low rates they gain in love."
NHS prescribes controversial HIV medicine to 10 000 patients
Patients will have access to “transformative” treatment for HIV prevention from September on the basis of the decision of the Supreme Court on the financing of NHS.
The English National Health Service (NSH) announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) which is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in highly risk patients to 86 per cent will be offered through medical services of approximately 10,000 patients within the three-year test period.
NSH agreed to fund the test period after the appeal court supported the decision of the Supreme Court of Last year, expressing that NHS has funds for the REP despite the statement that the medicine should be financed by local authorities.
The decision notified on Thursday was adopted by the NHS of England from the mouth of General Director Simon Stevens as “significant intervention”, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as“decisive moment”.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first patients to be accepted. Other clinics will be joined in October and will be fully implemented throughout England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure of prophylaxis (PREP) is HIV medicine given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests show that PREEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among the victims who are in danger.
Pre-sex pre-experience PrEP means that enough specific medicines are available in the patient’s body to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Among the tested patients include homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and people with HIV positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics shall identify eligible participants who sign the consent of the testing, including men, women, transsexual people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered in GP in Great Britain can also enter their local sexual health clinic and take place in potential participation in testing.
The programme will come by taxpayers on 10 million £ and the NHS of England signed this week a treaty to distribute drugs after obtaining an international public procurement.
The test period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PREEP, its target, use and implementation in a large extent.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should complement and fully expansive and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another million in an over 30-year effort to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health."
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of NAT (National Aids Trust) said: “We are witnesses of a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PREEP is administered properly and in danger to patients, it will offer an opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
NSH will offer from September to patients who are exposed to the high risk of HIV infection a new powerful instrument that is individually controlled and is not required to speak to a partner, which will lead to improve the quality of many lives.
We are pleased to accept this declaration."
Ian Green, executive director Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “Priority number one must be a rapid layout of tests throughout the country; we must ensure its availability to each patient.
Now we have a test medicine of PREEP and we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people who are threatening the risk of HIV infection."
Shadow Minister Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “The beginning of the test period is a welcome and long-expected change after months of delays and retention from the government.
The evidence indicates how transformative this medicinal product can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life threatening infection.
The following tests will bring us a step closer to the full understanding of the benefits of PREP.
Now it is important that we start the tests as soon as possible throughout the country and protect people exposed to HIV and thus end the spread of HIV in society."
Life on high foot: inter- floor and smart design transformed this small apartment to Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, former banker with estate passion, exchanged a large house in 2014 in Knightsbridge for an apartment at Earls Cour.
It is located in the first floor of the smart terrace of Queen Anne - and is a visible display of modern design that uses for the maximum available space.
"I lived with my ex-husband in a much bigger house in the Knightsbridge quarter," said Joanne.
“I looked for something more reasonable.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court and I had the same height of the ceiling.
I fell in love with him right away, and then the same day I hung up on him."
Since then, an apartment of 1,000 square meters has passed complete renal.
A single room apartment with complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add deposition spaces and inter floors to use the high ceiling.
"I wanted a high ceiling, big windows and a lot of light.
These were my requirements," she said.
To this end, she hired Erphana Azadi from the Design and Design Study, Duck & Shed, with a headquarters in Notting Hill, and used a nearly four-metre ceiling to create a home, which was not just a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling didn't reach such a height that two spaces were arrived over itself - the challenge for architects was to create a cross floor on which you could walk straight.
Erfan had to incorporate his creative thought.
"The steel structure is entirely complicated," he explained.
"We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk straight.
It was not only to build a simple platform, but also to fix the steel structure so that it would be at the right height above and under the ceiling."
This arrangement enabled Erphane to design two full-time rooms on it - and at the same time add to dramatics.
In the interior, he looks at the beautiful living room of an old copper window frame in the design of Retrouvius.
The mirror furniture in golden color, silver lines and retro luster Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in dramatics, space and lighting.
The short hall is mirrors on both sides and looks so long.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
The input doors are located in storage spaces covered by the mirrors to store appliances and glass.
The benefit of the living room, which offers the impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen if it is not used.
The compound kitchens are nothing new.
However, what is unique in this solution is a folding door.
“We had to solve the technical site”, says Erfan about the exhausted breathing doors.
"The doors are protected by the contrary to be very easily disconnected."
Thanks to smart use of space and storage spaces, Joanne has received more 16 square meters, second room and better placement of the apartment.
"When it comes to this, what you sell is a dwelling area - or appreciation of your property," said Erfan.
"The real merchant will calculate its price on the basis of the housing area when entering the apartment."
In this case, the housing area has been improved in preserving quality materials that provide a luxury appearance.
"The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional relationship with your home," Erfan added.
"You don't like the divorce of electricity in the walls.
Yes, they're important, but your hearts don't get."
As it turns out, the quality design and acquisition of the living area can transform the ordinary apartment into a special work.
And just like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States are disturbing.
Cultural and political disturbance between blue and red countries is deepening.
California announced the prohibition of its citizens' travel to Tennessee and other seven States.
The Tennessee state repayed her and announced a legal ban on the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, it is not a prohibition in full meaning, but US citizens can travel free after all 50 states.
It is that California has forbidden the public money to travel its citizens to eight other countries, such as Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strong for LGBT and any disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle considers discrimination.
However, Tennessee has accepted the law on the discontinuation of conscience, according to which a psychotherapeu who has a moral problem with LGBT therapy has no obligation to provide it to them, but he is obliged to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have adopted laws under which religious charity organisations that have received children from their mothers after birth to adoption do not have the obligation of these children to adopt the same sex couples.
For the purposes of these laws, California has prohibited the financing of its citizens' journeys to eight states of the Union from its resources.
In practice, it means that California professors must not have ways to scientific symposies, for example, in Texas, paid from their universities, because they are co-financing by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel at tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with financial support for their schools.
To travel, either federal grants, but it is absurd that the federal government funds the ways of citizens from State A to State B, or private sponsoring.
The State of Tennessee came to patience and his parliament adopted a law with a resolution that he also dislikes California's high tax policy, high state expenses, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still in California does not qualify a travel embargo.
He's recruiting them as an inventory for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to each country of the Union, which would order a similar ban on travel for any reason.
At the same time, he invited Parliaments of all States to stop this madness.
The facts, now a comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of it is constitutional, nothing is constitutional.
States have the right to adopt the laws on the remedy of conscience and to decide what their money will go and what they cannot do.
Secondly, what's wrong with your conscience?
If the messenger has a religious problem to sell pigs, why can he not offer only beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why do you have to make him sell pigs under the penalty when the messengers offering pigs are enough?
In Colorado, one baker faces anti-discriminatory lawsuit and high penalty because he refused to bake a cake for a homosexual wedding.
But he refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why don't you punish him and leave him alone and do the cakes that you can't order in hundreds of bakers of others?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the Federation are guaranteed, but individual States can have internal, domestic policy in the powers not federally adjusted according to their preferences, i.e. according to their people's preferences.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California may be California and Texas may be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states also to be California!
Fourth, members of the LGBT communities once legally strive for tolerance to their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community are governed by the rule of life and let them live, which should be followed by all reasonable people, but some activists do not seek tolerance against themselves and others, but on extreme intolerance against others.
For them, no one should ever show moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with LGBT’s lifestyle, and if he does, he should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is total.
They're new enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I don't know the situation in the American history where the States have done this for political questions, except for the case of one.
Even at the time of the fight for civil rights of black people, where North and West were on the side of integration and South on the side of segregation, the States did not sanction themselves.
This was the only case in the 50th century, the political cause was slavery, and it was declined to the northern war against the south.
Of course, this will not happen now, but the situation is toxic.
Cultural and political disturbance between the blue democratic and red republican States is deepening and the United States is mentally dissolving.
Unlimited agitation.
The criticist Putin got a fat penalty.
The Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalnyj received a penalty of 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules before presidential elections, which will be implemented next year.
The court sentenced him for calling on people to participate in unfavourable demonstrations.
In the last two months, Navalny organized two major anti-governmental street protests and announced that he wanted to serve as head of the State in March next year.
The official head of Kremlu Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but generally expects it to do and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house in the morning and took him to court.
He had given him a penalty for calling people on demonstrations through videos located on the YouTube website.
The penalty is three hundred thousand.
"We'll take them out of the judge's salary later," a critician of Kremlu was joking on Twitter.
The Russian Electoral Commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential elections because he was previously convicted of fraud.
Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, however, considers the relevant judgment politically motivated.
The penalties of 300,000 rubles, let's cover 25,000 rubles of the court on Thursday, also put two members of the Naval Pre-election Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalny entered Russian policy as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant personality in a broken opposition scene.
The officials are trying to defend Naval's campaign all the way.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year-old conditional punishment for stealing a forest company of Kirovles.
In May, the verdict confirmed the appeal court.
The judgment is so powerful that the Naval's laws prevent the candidate.
Brothers fight for an empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the establishment of an empire of their Italian family, are dragging over one of the most expensive Victorian property in value of $500 million.
Former director Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis stays at the Toorak government, only three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has reached a dispute about shared property and business assets to the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave family business in 2014, but a sharp dispute is constantly condemned before the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna owned a total of 38 real estate worth over a half billion dollars. The first shop bought the family in 1973 at Smith Street, Collingwood.
The family founded Westco Jeans, which grew up into a chain of 160 stone stones.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company over $85 million.
For the money, another property was purchased and the portfolio of the De Lutis family now includes offices, building lands in Brunswick and Sorrent, the apartments on Gold Coast and Mt Buller and the suburb centre.
Paul has approximately one third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who is according to Paul’s words “significant force and dominant personality” of the De Lutis family, owns less than two thirds of assets.
The judicial records state that Colin owns 316 million dollars, while Paul manages property for $176 million.
For Paul, the problem has just become the division of property and funds.
"Colin's proposal made out in my eyes significantly for him," Paul wrote in a vowing statement at the court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts of peace, the first meeting of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers now also compete to who will control the existing business - from which Paul, according to his statement, cut off Colin.
Colin resists that it's not true and accuses Paul of the wrong loading with some property.
In the previous vow declaration, Colin stated that he believed in a good solution to the conflict.
"My Italian origin tells me that the family is the most important thing," he wrote.
The costs of the judicial status are rising. Stoss of pages of oath declaring, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer flood lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC and both parties.
Mrs. De Lutis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and cupcakes since the 50s of the 20th century and in the 70s they bought a trade in Brunswick.
For the money obtained by stopping property, they bought property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when we founded Westco “in the last high school year, Paul was still a small, approximately 10 - year - old boy. ”
Anna De Lutis said that, along with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to sons would take place for good.
"Luigi often said that he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
Another two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the group of De Lutis family. Colin said that Mark was compensated with a amount of $10 million on his departure and Luke's amount of $26 million.
Paul, Luke and Mark said: “They were not satisfied with the conditions of their financial compensation. ”
Colin has been back since then, despite the fact that he is a former member of the AFL Club, as he stated in his autobiography of 2015 Eddie McGuire, a famous television person and the best friend of Colin.
Fairfax Media contacted Colina and Paul de Lutisov and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin answered through a text report in which he stated that, given the fact that the dispute is resolved before the court, “I have nothing to add to.”
"It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to deal with the whole matter before the court," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, in one of the statements at the Court of Justice, Colin stated that he was trying to adapt his brother's requirements.
"Our father would be very unsatisfied if he saw our current situation," he said to himself and added that "he still hoped for a good solution."
On Friday, all hopes were out of sight.
"Our disputes will be resolved in a rapid trial," Colin wrote.
Cheese in Czech Republic.
The teachers shower the kids.
The MHD drivers are facing water and summer clothes.
In the mother school at Chodovca in Prague 4, where about 35 children are now going out, they only go out in the morning.
The school is after the reconstruction and the planted trees do not provide a big shadow yet.
There's no pool there, but the teachers shower the kids in the mist.
Afternoon, children remain in classes where threads and curtains are withdrawn.
The air is trying to cool clean air because they don't have air conditioning.
It's also difficult for teachers and cookers.
"The temperature, which is in the interior and outdoor, exceeds the hygienic limits for maternal schools, so we should not even have an open operation in this period," said Miloslava Makovicová, Director of School.
There's a glass corridor in the school where temperature is moving about 40 degrees.
We wind in the morning after 6:00, they close the windows, and we have the south sides of the frogs that we protect ourselves.
"But it won't help much," she added.
Better conditions are in the forest school on the Plaza in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have grown trees on the land, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful peanut, underneath it is a table, and there we do various things," Barbora Compan, director of school, wrote.
The teachers try to go to the forest with children, where there is more cold.
The baby's wet caps and the program has different water games.
"We have a hand-pressure dilutor used for flowers, and we use it to shower children," said Compan.
Also, the Maternal School Director at the Novoborska Street on the Prague Prosecutor Jitka Vilimovska said that the teachers of children are trying to keep them in the shadows and diges them with water.
"We have a relatively grown garden, so they are under the trees," she said.
He's going out in the morning and then after 15:00.
Every child has to have a head cover.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
For example, they can choose little salt tea or red juice and have water drinks in the garden.
They also eat vegetable salad and always fresh fruits and vegetables that parents sometimes produce.
"Maybe here today, one mother brought about a 10-kilometer for children," added Makovic.
The drivers get water or summer same.
The Prague transport company DPP shall provide them water, ion drinks or summer same water during hot days.
Tramway and bus cabins are air-conditioned in most cases, said the speaker DPP Aneta Rigková.
They are air-conditioned in addition to the cabins of some tramways even in the passenger space.
The tramway railways of high temperature haven't really hurt yet.
There's been a small damage in the Hostevar screw.
At current high temperatures, we are primarily concerned that drivers have enough drinks.
"The cold drinking water is available in all the sequences, sequence points and carriages," said Range.
In the carriages and in some places of discharge, employees are available with so-called contemporary producers of cold soda.
The drivers also receive filthy protective ion drinks.
"They can also use summer uniform that increases the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts," the speaker added.
Hot and dry weather of the last days has increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters throughout Czech Republic liquidated 108, thus doubled the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday over the day the temperatures in the Czech Republic slipped over 35 degrees of Celsia, he employed firemen mainly against fire.
"They reconsidere fires in the natural environment and those associated with the harvest work," Nicole Zaoral said speaker.
A relief to the firemen did not bring evening weather change when the storms and inflammatory crashes were hot in a number of places.
In connection with the storms, firefighters were heading to 236 hits.
It was, in particular, to remove the trapped trees and branches.
"The most interfered in the Mediterranean County," continues Zaoral.
However, firefighters needed help in Stvolinks in Chescolips, where 60 people from the child’s camp were evacuated to safety because of the storm.
The tropical temperatures also gave work to the Prague saviors.
On Tuesday and on Wednesday night, the ambulances were driven to ten cases of poisoning with carbon oxide.
Therefore, people should let their heaters check the water, warn the saviors.
Carbon dioxide is colourless gas without smell, which is released when imperfect burning.
The symptoms of poison include disorder, vomiting, headache, and feelings of disturbance.
In the event of suspicion of poisoning, it is necessary to leave the frozen room.
Trump's new head of the office plans to limit the president's media diet
Many tried it before him, and they always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
The Portal Politico stated that the new Chief of the White House plans to limit the flow of information from President Trump - including television reports - in the hope of maintaining Trump at the level.
Here's a part of the reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the new Chief of the White House John F. Kelly met the first day in his new function with the employees, he shadowed the key problem of Trumpov White House, who is going to fix: the wrong information that is getting to the president's hands.
Kelly informed employees that he must personally approve all the information - whether on paper or speaking word - because the president can decide better on the basis of the correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors have broken their teeth in the media.
Trump's relationship with the media is dated for decades back - and now, when he sits in the White House, his custom to watch television news is even stronger.
"If Trump was distracted as a candidate by honour reports, it was appropriate to show him that in a positive light a lot of other media that was easier to persuade," said in February for Politico Sam Nunberg, former campaign advisor.
Tara Palmeri of the Politico Portal then wrote that “the key to keep the Trump Tweets on the ug - at least according to the words of six former organizers of his campaign - is to ensure that Trump regularly monitor the media that praises him. ”
Okay.
However, the idea that Trump's tendency to publicize his views on Twitter was once “controlled ” is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organisations know something they don't know about -- that Trump's tweets would be more disturbing if someone didn't check them.
Tweets that Trump never sent will never be known with great probability.
If his employees succeeded to keep him at least several times on the urge, then their efforts have failed.
Nevertheless, no one has yet been able to regularly prevent Trump to initiate controversial topics.
The part of this problem is that in the White House, which consists of competitive fractions, people are regularly trying to strengthen their agenda by improving the Trump materials - which can but cannot be reliable - which support their view of the world.
The Political Portal, which covered the problem from all parties, published a report on the inclination of advisers to present doubtful information to the head of the State in May.
This is an example of such information from Shane Goldmacher's reporter:
"The current and former Trump officials argue that the president is often very angered to the negative news from the media, especially the information release reports, and strives to find their origin.
This situation happened at the end of February, when someone embarked the president's copy of the article from GotNews.com - the web site of provocator Charles C. Johnson - who accused the deputy chief of the Chief, Katie Walsh of being “the source of many escapes of information” from the White House.
Regardless of the fact that Johnson was forever pronounced from Twitter for disturbance; or that he did not submit his claim with any evidence; or that he had already published false charges in the past and later revoked them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the Chief of Reince Priebus and the Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, “they tried to implement the system to manage and document information that President Trump will receive”.
Would it work?
Kelly now, three months later, is trying to build up the same strategy.
Maybe it turns out he's a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness just won't be lost, and his assistants still compete for power.
These unchanging factors of Kelly's mission are definitely burdening.
Tourists are negotiating the array and return to ‘Millionary quarter’
Several of the most prominent owners of homes in the West Midland County are re-employed with determined tourists who negotiate with local authorities on the right to retrieve the fields behind their neighbours.
Tourists parked 20 caravans on the field in a flowing street in Solihull, which is called “millionary quarter”.
By bringing horses, children and the army of the caravans, tourists return after they were shown in May, and they did not heave a ditch that was excavated on the basis of the regulations of the authorities to prevent their invasion.
A tactical group found spaces in the defense and broke into the caravan fields with unprotected space that served as a trip.
The angered inhabitants of the quarter attacked the Solihull Administrative Council with the fact that they are not able to solve the problem.
One of the inhabitants who wished to remain anonymous said to it: “They took the place on Monday night after they were moved on the street of Bentley Heath, where they were throwing stones after other people.
The Administrative Board should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they're back.
The other people arrived last night, and there's probably more of them coming today."
She added that : ‘Birmingham Administrative Board knows how to initiate this problem. For the protection of parks uses judicial orders.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I do not want to keep taxes until the Board of Administration with Tourists is dealt with."
Another anonymous inhabitants said, “It's ridiculous. We just recently watched the last tourists leaving and now they're back.
And this time there are more of them, and this time they brought their horses with them."
The press speaker of the Solihull Administrative Council said: “We are aware of the unauthorized residence near the streetsbrook Road and in cooperation with the local police we take the necessary legal steps to address the whole problem.
In order to accumulate as much evidence, it is necessary that the most local inhabitants announce any uncommunicable or illegal conduct of the police number 101.
We'll get a total picture that we'll present in court."
The husband of the euro ambassador hit the car in Brussels.
He was brought by a government special.
The government special transported the wounded Robert Žitnjanski to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
The airport was waiting for two ambulances, and he was under constant control of Slovenian doctors.
A long planned flight went around without complications.
Robert Žitnjanski, according to TV, had a serious accident in Brussels in early summers.
He said he was hit by a car, and he's been in a serious state since.
After transportation to the country, he was transported to a specialized workplace of one of the Brothers’ hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of the Slovenian European Ambassador Jana Žitjanska of NOVA.
She didn't want to speak to the incident.

The Italians in the fight against NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy noted that it would prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships that are coming to the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean Sea if the NGO does not sign new rules governing their operations.
"If the NGO does not sign new rules of behaviour, it will be hard to imagine that they can continue their operations," the Minister of Inland Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
The warning came the day after the Italian authorities captured a ship of the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet for suspicion of trafficking with people, which makes it significantly easier for illegal immigrants.
The rescue organisation, which works in the first year, refused to comment on the whole matter because of the charges of the Italian State Prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosiose.
“They are and will always be the priority number one to save human lives, and we are very sorry that we can't operate in rescue zones at present”, said the organization in a statement on social networks.
"All current charges can be commented only after collecting all information and assessing the whole situation."
The Italian authorities have been watching the Iuventa organization Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on the ship handed them directly to human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting took place according to the report of the plaintiff only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya. The progress of the meeting was published by the Italian media.
The ship's crew is suspected of violating the law and circuating the Italian coastal guard, which is observing rescue operations in this area -- from humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Behaviour establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on the ship, such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organisations that participate in rescue operations have yet agreed with the compliance of the Code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activ Open Arms.
The last appointed organisation on Thursday stated that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable, since they are not representing any "essential change or obstacle" concerning rescue operations.
For example, the adoption of a new code of conduct also rejected the Organization of the Medicines Without Border (MSF), which is the holder of the Nobel Price.
Meanwhile, Minniti has heard that the rapid decline of immigrants in the last few weeks that are landing in Italy in the context of rescue operations suggests that the effort to strengthen guards at the coast of Libya and collaboration with local mayors is fruitful.
"In the last days we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He also disclosed plans for further meetings that will be implemented this month with Mayors of Libya on the topic of economic development initiatives, as well as representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants left by these countries in hope of achieving Europe.
The unshy Mesarosh: She had a sillicon and a cellulitis!
Hot summer days are completely encouraging to take on the necessity thing that covers the most intimate parties.
Just Dominica Mesarosh is doing it the opposite.
On the afternoon meeting in the Prague zoo, where the actors, moderators, singers and all those who have anything to do with TV Prima, were just hamming, her body went into a mini overall.
And only a few regular movements, and the model showed everyone its silicones, but also the ass.
Overall cut himself between her halfs and quit so high that she had to keep adjusting it.
The attention of the gentlemen and the present photographers was definitely not necessary.
Michelle Carter is sentenced to send text messages encouraged to suicide Conrad Roye
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to take away the freedom of two years for inciting her friend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter will stay 15 months away from a two-year penalty behind the nets and then spend five years on the conditional release.
Carter was convicted in June for an uninterested murder of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Roy’s father confessed on Thursday in court: “The whole family is broken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free until the decision was made.
She was threatened by 20 years of deprivation, but her lawyers argumented that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
She was dressed in red pants and cream bloise, and Carter stood at the pronouncement of a judgment in the place with tears in her eyes, scratched hands and eyes on the ground.
"It was killed by Conrad Roy," the judge said.
“She finished his life to relieve herself.
She couldn't accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She has not shown any regrets."
However, the legal representative Carter said that these were “the unfortunate circumstances he regretted. ”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “her age or level of maturity or even mental disorders have no significant impact on its conduct. ”
The plaintiff read Roy’s statement to Lynn Roy's mother: “It will not run away for one day so that I will not mourn about the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I care for his sisters and we will endure the enormous pain that we will take with us forever," the statement stated.
Roy’s sister Camdyn Roy confirmed that she was “prosecuted ” to know that she would never attend her brother’s wedding and never be aunt of his children.
"The loss of a man I've seen since my birth is the pain I'll take for life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that would affect a person to help suicide another person.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found on the car seat in 2014, poisoned with car oxygen.
The case attracted the attention of the entire nation after Carter's text reports were published, which triggered suicide.
"Maybe, jump out of the building or stab, I don't care," the text reports, which Carter sent just two weeks before his death, when Roy was on a family vacation.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote to him, "You have to do this, Conrade" and "You just hit the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz stated that Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to keep any comments in the press.
The case has raised many questions.
Amanda Knox was convicted to kill her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago the accusation was released.
Miss Knox (30) published the statement in Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison.”
Audi will adjust up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to acute response
Only a day before the notification of the Audi car manufacturer BMW stated that it would offer its customers an update of the software in more than 350 000 vehicles.
The President BMW said that the company believes that “there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions” in response to European cities - including Mnichov, which is the BMW seat - which considers the ban or restriction of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he would adjust three million Mercedes cars throughout Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies has called this decision as a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have promoted largely the use of diesel atuomobiles in Europe and the United States to meet the CO2 emissions regulations.
However, the acid oxide that releases diesel engines is considered to be carcinogen and can cause astma.
At the same time, car costs are increased to install gas neutralization devices issued by diesel engines, which reduces the competitiveness of cars.
While German car manufacturers face careful examinations, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces charges for dismantling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The company is trying to avoid Volkswagen's errors, which, in an effort to fulfil the emission limits, installed software in its cars, which reduced the amounts of emissions issued during the testing, but under normal conditions, the software was deactivated.
Several higher representatives of Volkswagen were accused in the United States and others were investigated on both sides of Atlantic.
Last month, the former leader of the thermodynamics of the Audi engine development department would be arrested in Germany.
The former Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio manager is the Italian nationality and therefore does not apply extradictions to it, so he can face the trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi has been involved in a criminal investigation of the German police in the Volkswagen car after the authorities accused Audi of the installation of the European emission limits - and extended the charges Audi faced in the United States.
Inclusion of the car Audi in the investigation may have a mild impact on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer constitutes an indirect share of Volkswagen profits.
The aircraft landed on the beach.
The man and the girl died.
There was an accident on the Beach of Praia de Sao João in Costa da Caparica, about 30 miles south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses to the SIC Noticias television channel said that the plane flew directly over the people who burned on the beach.
Some people from the beach reportedly fled from the danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape from the machine.
A 50 - year - old man and an eight - year - old girl died on the beach according to local media.
"The plane crashed and they were dead at the scene," local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias described.
Their nationality is not known yet.
There were two people on the plane, both of them out of the accident, and the police took them to the interrogation.
D11 or not to set the road.
And are the roads in the Czech Republic at all final?
I'll give you a puzzle.
It's not delivered, even though it started to be in 1978.
Even if it's not delivered, it's always fixed.
And it can't continue to happen, even if it has a building permit.
What's that?
Yes, a castleway D11.
The construction of her next segment has stopped the movement of the Children of the Earth for at least a few months.
We get a highway on the east, like when the salad is shaving.
They'll hide the wheel, and then they'll just see when and if we ever get another.
But we don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the ride time and we want to get trucks riding to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
The infinite flows of trucks are going directly through the city of Jarmir or the Invention, which is not how to round reasonably.
But so far the last part of our dreamed road was carried out in 2008, that is, before the unbelievable nine years ago.
Since then, no knock.
Therefore, when the remaining four miles of the unfinished segment to the castle of the King and the other sections of Jarmara began with archaeological explosion that it began at the end of this year, you could hear a loud blowing of scratches in Eastern Czech Republic.
No one believed it again.
Last week, it turns out it won't happen this year.
And maybe not next year.
The movement of the Children of the Earth-Club for sustainable transport from Brn has given a disadvantage.
The children of the Earth repeat their D1 tactics.
The decision on building authorisation has been attacked throughout the range.
In the departure, they require review of all already issued mandatory opinions of all relevant authorities.
For example, the castle magistrate, the Ministry of Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Defense Office.
So for now, we're going from D11 near the village with the pronouncement of the Hill.
So we're going down, we're just going down the road, and suddenly we're standing on the side road, and we're preferred to then get into the colony.
The worst is that you see similar stories all over the Republic.
Scary, constantly tight journey to Benesov, D1 or D8.
Everybody has a funeral.
What do the Children of the Earth require?
What is the crucial part of the problems of building communications in Czech Republic?
And why is the road network practically incomplete in the current system?

Levandule from Provence threatens climate change
Levandule became a symbol of Provence in the southeastern France, but now they are threatened by climate change.
Levandul is being taken from dry climate and harmful insects, which causes fear on the faces of researchers and farmers who are looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, agricultural research institute of CRIEPPAM in Provence, stated: “The planting of levendules in Provence is in danger because the plant has been exposed to climate change over the past few years, which brings less collisions in spring and autumn.
This affects the life of leanduli.
They are also guilty of cyclades and squirrels transmitting microbacteria, which are good in dry climate."
There's a lot in the bet.
Levandule attracts tourists and oil that are made of them is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, unexpected and often weak plants are growing.
The amount of oil obtained from these leandules is obviously smaller."
The possible solution may be more effective distribution of water and slowing out of soil, but also the scratch of leandula protective mixtures of crop and water and the nobility of more species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of the journalist stresses increasing threats in Mexico
Workers of the Riodoce week regularly meet each Wednesday to discuss the news about the disturbances in the area of Sinaloa for the participation of organized criminals, corrupted officials and unconsulting drug wars.
But today, under the effort of recent events, it is especially due to its own safety.
They find it important to change their habits.
Two people deserve to talk about what would be safer: taking their children with them to the office that someone attacked in 2009 with a grenade, or leaving them home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the black table: opponents, neutral and allies.
They ask journalists to introduce names to each word - there is no need of evidence, just use imagination and prediction.
Selecting them from something - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose task is to cover offences.
Violence is not arising and the body is being accompanied across the country; the journalists are constantly received: according to the Committee for Protection of Newsmans, at least 25 of the entry of President Enrique Pen Net to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and 7 have been killed in all seven States this year.
Among them is also a co-based Riodioce periodic, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books about violence associated with drug trafficking.
His loss is sensitive, even though his presence is all-progressive - the large photo of Valdeze with the title “Justness”, which shows the mediator, hanging in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years of age, have a shirt with a picture of Valdeze with a smile on their face, the glasses on the nose and the Hats of Panama.
The meeting is about two months after his death; the journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, two suspects have still been sued by the Committee for Protection of Reporters.
Most of the thousands of murders that happen every year are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime.
The reporters in Riodoca insist that they will inform the violence that is happening in Sinaloe; even though they are destruction by the sadness and the territory that is currently very betrayal.
Without the information about the slaughter and without the vision of justice, the security meeting is implicated, says Ibarra.
"It is a worm to waste time for such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, we can't trust anyone."
In the morning of May 15, Valdez left the centre of Riodoce in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to run a few blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, all due to the name of the article - which can be translated as the Twelveth River.
The shooters then entered his car and broke him near the scene.
Valdez died at 50 years of age.
He left his wife and two adult children behind him.
Looks like the news is rapidly spreading in Culican.
In Valdez's case, however, there is suspicious silence.
Since the last year arrest of Guzman and his January issue to the United States, Sinaloa became one of the most bleeding battlefields of the country, as the competitive fractions try to fill an empty place.
Every day, a number of people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi, and the cemetery are full of two - floor mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word “premire” is thought that one drug cartel controls the coastal state with precious ports and important routes traveling to the United States of Drugs.
Despite the fact that Valdez was confidently familiar with the risks of his job, Ismail Bojorquez (60), the co-founder and director Riodoce continues to wipe out of protecting his friend.
They believe that two doubts contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the competitive drug cartels who led war with the sons of Joaquin Guzman.
The peace could have angered sons; suspects of the gang bought all the copies of the papers at the time they landed on the boards.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after taking other newspapers, in which the same story was published.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is viewed as an important milliman in the fight of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He was able to survive so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In the Noroest period, he was practically veteran when he decided to sell his shares worth $50 and build together with five Riodoce colleagues in 2003.
In Sinaloe, “the press was impossible to operate and not mention drug trade,” said Bojorquez.
In time, Riodoce won a good reputation for courageous and true news; the newspapers began to make good.
The journalists loved to look for problems and publish texts without censorship - the reader fascinated reading stories that no one else dared to give.
Eight years after the establishment Riodoce won the prestigious appreciation of Maria Moors Cabot for the Latin America report.
The same year, Valdez won the appreciation of the International Freedom of the Press Committee for the Protection of Reporters for his courageous report on mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly confessed that he was afraid.
"I was afraid of my life," he stated when accepting the price.
Trading drugs in Sinaloae is a “life style”, Valdez said in October last year in a Rompeviento TV interview.
"You must take the role of a journalist - or play stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me, "What have you done in the face of death... why didn't you say what's going on?"
The employees of Riodoce missed Valdez. The man was known by his jokes and unacceptable language. He was a good friend who loved giving advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relyed on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar across the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: did this routine blame his death?
His death also raised questions about its own assumptions - how to do his job as best and remain alive?
"They don't like to interfere with their wives, children, clean stores, secret landing areas."
"These things were prohibited," said Bojorquez.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-conservation.
You must trust your instincts.
If you feel like something's not going on here, get your hands off.
The problem is, said editor Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that “the smell is a sense that can be mad... and then the matter with Javier. ”
The old rules according to it, like others, are no longer applicable in Sinaloae - as in the countries Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other countries, which are the home of the toxic mixture of lucrative trails, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The land is constantly changing.
There are no mobile phones allowed in the room where Riodoce employees are meeting; because a few days ago, a spyware was discovered, which was purchased by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Two policemen find a relief in front of the building in the shadows of a nearby tree.
They were elected to protect the offices of Riodoce, located in the fourth floor building in the Culiacan town.
The journalists fail to see if these cops are not part of them 50 percent of the lawkeepers who are corrupted according to the government's statement.
It's been a few months since the journalists last went to the mountain areas that basically control drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week.
First of them is the murder of a former boxer brother Julio Cesara Chaveza in Sinaloe.
They are also dedicated to suspected government expenditures that took place in the country's hometown governor.
Recently, several kidnappings also occurred in one of the most luxurious restaurants of Culiacan, just a block from the office of a state representative.
No one officially announced the identity of abducted persons or the circumstances of kidnapping, so the journalists were careful when they were going to write about what everyone in town knows: that it is the favorite destination of drug dealers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from the public records that this restaurant was registered under the name associated with a certain policy, a member of the Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene for almost the past century.
Several governors of PRI have recently been accused of corruption on high posts.
Villarreal asked the journalists to write about the previous incidents that happened in the restaurant, including the incident in which one of the sons of Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman escaped the military invasion unit.
A month ago, readers would read about this subject in Valdez's series, which was the best source of information about kidnapping.
"Waldez would definitely solve the case," Villarreal (46) said, named "El Flaco" for his thin figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their back to us."
Valdez's office has turned into a store of tags and labels for protests against killing journalists, and the employees certainly did not expect them to be activists in the press representation.
The journalist Miriam Ramirez caught several signs and left the next morning to show to the office of the State Deputy for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared only three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacan.
The government claims that the DNA analysis is about Adame.
The activity of journalists is graduating around the country, many of which organize protests and screw up on railways and buildings "SOS press".
The director of the Bojorquez newspaper is the day to visit Washington, where he is trying to gain international support and reach justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloy, the day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez accused the authorities of monitoring journalists and their murders for reporting the truth.
Meanwhile, she asked for a transfer to another department of fear that her anger could threaten her impartiality.
Valdez repeatedly stated that the Mexican journalists are “occupied” by organized crime, corrupt officials and an indifferent public.
In his last book, Narco-journalism, he wrote that journalists die not only by hands of drug cartels but also for ordering politicians and security forces that cooperate with organised crime.
The media overseer group Articulo 19 accused of more than half of all attacks against police and public officials.
"In Mexico you will die because they want to shut you up," said Ramirez.
Murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of Marie Elizabeth Macias, who happened six years ago at the northern borders of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found together with a message that reportedly signed Zetas' cartel: “This is what I have done for my news. ”
With the heads cut off, the keymap and the listeners were lying.
Some branches decided to terminate activities, such as El Norte's newspaper with a seat at the northern borders of Chihuahua in response to the March murder of rapporteur Miroslava Breach.
Others continue, as did El Manan of Nuevo Laredo after their director was killed in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed drug cartels on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled from their homes or even across the border.
It's a hard decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, just as to get rid of the feeling that someone persecutes you all the time.
And the journalists are persecuted and killed, for example, in the case of Ruben Espinos, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in the apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape from Veracruza.
For those who have decided to stay and not give up their work, it is a great risk every day.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet once, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is headed to hell, so I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday midnight and Riodoce employees sit on a walk outside the office - the latest issue sent to the printer - drinking beer when the phone starts calling at once.
They find out that 19 people died at the shooting of the gang and the cops near the beach resort in Mazatlan.
The war is graduating, just as many messages left in this area have been promised by the members of the syndicate.
The journalists publish this news from a mobile phone on Riodoce’s website.
It will not run any day and the introductory title will change again.
The sounds of the police siren indicate another shooting.
Bojorquez puts a light look at the police patrol to make sure they're careful.
If they're afraid, they don't show it.
Under the huge portrait of a fallen co-based co-based one of their periodics - whose mediator is an excuse slog for all Sinaloe - all employees of Riodoce follow his steps.
"How could we think of leaving," Bojorquez said, "if the same day I was killed by Javier, one internist asked me to send her to the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first, it looks like a statue, whatever scary.
Researchers have now discovered the conclusions of the first discovery of an amazing creature of the size of a nosorogue, whose perfectly preserved remnant -- which the experts called “Mona Lisa dinosaurs” -- found a Canadian miner.
The remains were maintained so high that the experts were able to determine the red brown color of his sloppy skin and stated that the dinosaurus had a “probling past”.
The article in the Current Biology stated that it was “the most preserved of the ever found defensive dinosaur and one of the best types of dinosaur in the world”.
Camenelin is a new species of Nodosauridae. Dinosaurus lived in the period of Crida, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition was literally shocked by researchers who described it by the words “incredible. ”
The converted biologist according to National Geographic is the best stored by its species yet.
The foundation stands behind Shawn Funk, who discovered the stoneline on March 21, 2011 while floating in the bottom of Suncore Millennium near the Canadian Alberta.
He ran into something that looked like a foreign object and decided to examine it closer.
The stonelin was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working on the discovery of the animal from a huge piece of the country of weight of 1100 kg.
After the work is completed, the dinosaurus is ready for discovery.
“Let's just close your eyes and you'll believe he's sleeping," said Caleb Brown's manager and the Natural Museum of Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exhibited.
“It will certainly be recorded in history as one of the most beautiful and most inspired species of dinosaur - Mona Lisa dinosaurs.”
By study of his skin, researchers found that this bilogist - although he was covered with armor and reminded the walking tank - with great probability faced a serious threat by mass-feeding dinosaurs.
Hardly armed dinosaurus used red and white camuflage to protect against predators and used a masking system that uses many animals today.
Experts say that it made him better connect with his neighborhood and avoid enemy. The masking system suggests that he was the favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
Reports about 110 million years old dinosaurs members of Nodosauridae first appeared in the newspapers in May. Currently, it is available to see in Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named him Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technique Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7000 hours with a careful discovery of fossil.
Thanks to the incredibly preserved state of fossil, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists could document patterns and shapes and armors throughout the body.
They discovered the method of masking that animals are usually used in today's defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, findings of researchers are surprising because Borealpelta's size is far more than today's animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that the dinosaurus was such a quantity of predators that evolution has given the advantage of masking before confrontation.
Many of the current animals with masking - a bunch of deer, zeber and or belt - are much smaller and vulnerable as a beneficiary, which suggests that nosdaurus had to fight for his survived literally.
“The presentation of a huge and severely armed dinosaur illustrates the dangers represented by predators during the creed period,” said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic ingredients contained in the shoes also revealed that the skin dinosaur was probably red brown.
Researchers continue to study the animal and look for other knowledge of his life, including the stomach content to search for its last food.
They believe that the dinosaurus fell into the river after death and was taken to the sea where he drowned on the bottom.
In Alberta, at that time, there was the same climate as today in Florida and rivers and the oceans have been dragging far away into the inland than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is truly amazing in the fact that it is fully covered in the perfectly preserved sloppy skin and is also preserved in three dimensions, and so we can see its original size” said Brown.
“For these reasons, the animal looks practically as at the time of the crystal.
You don't have to use your imagination for his reconstruction; you just need to keep your eyes on a little bit and it seems like he's just sleeping.'
During the period of creed, giant terropods, massive dinosaurs moving on two feet.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived a few million years after Borealpelta, this armed dinosaurus could be the favorite harvest of his equally horrible ancestors.
It belongs to Acrocanthosaurus, 11.5 meters long monster with weight over 6 tonnes.
Researchers whose latest findings were published in the Current Biology magazine believe that Borealopelta’s body was floated into the sea after he was mumified in the blade.
The foundation stands behind Shawn Funk, who discovered the stoneline on March 21, 2011 when Suncor Millennium floating in the bottom of the Suncor Millenium near the Canadian Alberta.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved fixed dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, which is also complete from the squirrel to the chicken.
The animal reached a diameter of 5 meters and weighted up to 1300 kg.
He had two inches out of his shoulders.
The researchers believe that this biauclayer was scattering the territory of Canada today until he ended up in a river that floated him into the sea.
His submarine grave kept the body in perfect condition.
The fossil remnants of this species are also maintained to the extent that the floating plates around the skull continue to cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “the finding of this preserved individual can be compared to the winning in the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the shocking finding seems to me.
The fossil remnants of this species are also maintained to the extent that the floating plates around the skull continue to cover the remains of the skin.
His right front leg is lying on his side with his fingers headed up.
It's easy to count the shoes on his footstep."
How did one activist know the answer to the question: Whose Streets?
9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell shakes all over the body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a relative from St. Louis sat on bed in Airbnb room and went through contributions on Facebook on her phone.
She ran into the contribution of some high school student.
"The police just shot an 18-year-old young man whose body is still lying on the street," he said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote her this contribution, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user @TheePharoah constantly retweeted her contributions to the wall.
Rapper from St. Louis published on Twitter his contributions to the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old young man who was shot by a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a picture of Brown's body, which lies without control on the street, where no one drove it even after four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She dropped her phone to come back to him tonight when she watched Tweets about people who were gathering at Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed that he was a victim's father and had a sign in his hand “Ferguson police killed my unarmed son! ”
She was watching live news - one of the cops stood in front of a group of protesters, holding a lead in her hand and on the second end of the screaming dog.
In another video, another cop said, the gun he was heading for the crowd and yelling, "I'll kill you all... animals."
"It's not normal," Ferrell said.
"This is not the type of murder we used to and which we can call normal.
I smelled a ghost skin all over my body.
"I was angry and I cried."
She immediately ordered her flight back and traveled home on the other day.
After landing at 11:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson during the next three years describes a new document “Whose Streets ”?, which will be introduced to the movies of August 11th.
It's a story of survival and protests, love and resistance, strength and intimacy told from the view of people living in the community who go to the streets and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell introduced a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a flower suit and the same flower wheat - about the theme they've discussed before many times - "on experience with blacks".
"Do you remember how I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed?" he recalls a conversation.
"We're just going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old young man and that's not right."
"It didn't seem to have it with me," Ferrell later said.
“ Today's events are the superiority... that happened in the past.
She must have known and seen it in her own eyes and grown up in it.
She needed not only to develop in activism and organization, but also to know the difference between different layers of experience with blacks and what we have to do to free ourselves.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which she does not live on her own racism, it is no way different from the other black-woman.
I feel that if I protected her from this experience, I would only harm her."
After arriving in Ferguson, it was the first stop of the South Florisant Road road, opposed to the police department, which became the base of activists expecting the words of the officer Darren Wilson about his possible participation in the incident.
Here, Ferrell and her daughter met a local entrepreneur who was preparing for the rest of the food.
Together, they prepared food to the bags and helped to distribute it to protestants.
In the eyes of Ferrell, a new type of activism began to be born slowly.
"My activism turned up on the feet after August 9th," Ferrell said and added that at the high school of the University of Missouri-St. Louis was the president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and was trying to establish health care and food in the black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, Ferrell introduced the later director of the document Sabaah Folayan during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Fararar wanted "only documenting" events.
But Ferrell thought: “You are working on the document or trying to find a story that could be used? ”
Such skepticism has been invading into the community through many people, often white people who wanted to earn for pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in a recent conversation: “We heard that the voices of people who are born and grown in Ferguson are very often ignored and that we wanted to change. ”
Folayan has already been cooperating with Damon Davis, a recognised local artist dealing with the subject of prisoners in the death cell.
His participation in the project also invested Ferrell, along with the six other local inhabitants followed by the Whose Streets team in the years following the murder of Brown.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but this is our statement," Davis said.
"It was important to me -- how these people will be represented -- because in the same way I will be represented."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - trying to show that the movement “not about the rescue leader but the communities' combining”, Folayan said - it was the most open to film participation.
The document "Whose Streets?" describes a very personal perspective of Ferrell's life, as she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face at the first moment she saw the final version of the document.
"But I realized that to do this job and foster black people, I have to open myself."
The story of Ferrell is also emphasizing the role of a central black woman in a broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created in response to the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media campaigns under #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves strangers.
"Black central women in the leadership positions in the end are behind the remaining movement," Ferrell said, "because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black central women must bear the weight of these events."
Folayan agrees with this expression and adds that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a lot of central black women. ”
However, it insists that “this is not just an affirmative matter” and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of her opinions.
"It's the one who was the force and the source of energy," she said.
“that she was in the front lines not a coincidence, because life on these crossroads in the skin of a black weird woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy in front of the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the television station cameras have cleared their position, but the heavy racial bonds between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell has a two-and-and-a-half condition for blocking the road at the demonstration.
Socially political atmosphere in the area that she calls home, she described as "Irregularity."
Still, she does not stand in her efforts that she had committed since three years ago to the streets of Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains."
There was a field burning in Kolinsk.
There were dozens of firefighters, helping the helicopter.
Near the Czech Ship in Colinsk, between the villages of Bilana and Liberace, burned from 2:00 a field about 15 hectares.
Fire stopped spreading around 15:15, firemen announced a third degree of fire alarm from four possible.
According to the speaker of firefighters, Ladislav Holomczyk was helping fire from the air to fire fire and the helicopter.
At 6:00 the firemen managed to extinguish fire, fire caused damage for 700000 crowns.
There were dozens of professional and voluntary firefighters fighting the flames in the place.
The fire came up because of the technical disturbance in the engine space of the combain.
Hasit also helped a helicopter, which totally carried out six drops of water.
"Instead of interference, we handed over to the owner until tomorrow 8:00 he will be guarded by a voluntary fireman unit," said the Holocaust today.
And Becoming Resemblance: Artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms of New York Fridman Gallery, there are a few faces of different shadows of skin - white, black and fur - hanged from the ceiling on the wire. Each of them is like to fall out of the previous.
All 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the rubbers of the oral dust and hair that Chelsea Manning sent to her.
Manning sent her samples from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where a former analyst departs a 35-year-old penalty for unauthorized publication of secret cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition started on August 2, is the name A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines its experience with technology, information and art, and Manning - transsexual and pioneer dissident, whose penalty was reduced by Obama three days before leaving President of the United States.
Algorithmic DNA analysis of Manning and using 30 portraits to illustrate how a person with this genotype was created by Dewey-Hagborg, if not an intellectual comment on DNA submission - as well as on many ways that DNA can be interpreted - and an immense determination of these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has spoken about being considered a woman since she was young and was sentenced on the basis of twenty charges in 2013, including violations of six spy laws, computer fraud and stealing.
All its photos were detained by prison staff. Only one black-white photos were fled to the public in the lower quality of which Manning, apparently concerned, sits on the seat of the driver in Platin's blonde paruce, which is now connected to.
In 2015, the Dewey-Hagborg project of 2012 Stranger Visions continued to respond positively.
In the context of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarettes and chewing - to create a picture of possible images of these people.
And at that time she received an e-mail from the Paper Magazine.
"They wanted an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to complement the article with a portrait," explained Dewey-Hagborg at the opportunity to open a new exhibition.
However, visits or photographs were not allowed, so they asked Chelsea if it was interested in the DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned museum were scammarized for two years through a correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who presented the vision of what would happen if Chelsea was loved and could attend the exhibition in person.
The President Obama really asked Manning to be released after a few years of insufficient time spent in a military prison in Kansas.
It is really interesting that the exhibition takes place just when Donald Trump runs a war with people who seek to publicize government information and transgender soldiers, while trying to find new ways to stimulate their tweets in the areas that he should support.
In response to the question about this special timeout, Dewey-Hagborg said that “everything is happening for some reason”.
Under the statement of the artist on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls on her huge signature (written by “i” in the name) after the end of “self-related fractionalism based on sex, race, sexuality and culture”.
On the other hand, there are sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - a stonoch of letters C, G and A recorded by a pen.
By classing 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist) Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least on the biological page, we all are.
"I hope that people will take away that our genome doesn't matter who we are and that the genetic data are subjective and everyone can interpret them on their own," said Dewey-Hagborg. It is also visible for her work of Spirous Memories from 2007 on the video.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last example of the exhibition located in a separate room is the only page of the above graphic novel.
It shows Manning, which comes out of the way King Kong from the United States Disiplinary Barracks prison with a megaphone in his hand.
"When they prevent you from speaking, they win," it says.
"Never let you shut up."
"It is a direct receipt from one of the letters," said the Philadelphian artist.
"When I think about it, my skin is jumping out."
Manning has not visited the exhibition personally - which was predicted in the comic book - but when it happens, she will be welcomed in the middle of the room with its masks, its own genome images, sorted as a crowd of protestants.
Which was also aimed at the exhibition, including nearly 160 cm high statue of Maninga, where its genetic haploscopes are recorded.
"In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted them to swallow a sense of crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg about portraits.
"I wanted to point out the impression of the mass movement that takes the form of Chelsea and releases it."
Professor Northwest University and employee of the Oxford University are searched for murder
In these days, a full-national search for a professor of the Northwest University and employees of the Oxford University, who are being prosecuted for suspicion of the murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, stated the police.
On Monday, the arrester was issued for the murder of the first degree on a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged collaboration at the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, states the Cook County's court record.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died of several stab wounds.
The Chicago police said the body of the dead was found on July 27th.
The police were telephoned on this, and after they arrived in the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found a victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead and detectives investigate the case as a murder.
Lathom has worked on the position of a docent of microbiology and immunology of the Northwest University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice-president of the University for Public Contact, in his e-mail statement, stated that Lathem is now at administrative vacation and was forbidden to enter the school spaces of the university.
"The whole matter is now investigated by the competent authorities and the Northwest University is fully cooperating with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial manager at the Oxford University.
The speaker of the University and Somerville College stated in an announcement sent by an e-mail: “We have been contacted by the British police and we are also ready to assist the American police. ”
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wished to sign up to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, director of the public of the Chicago Police Department, said he called on suspects to give up to the authorities concerned.
"The police have information about their stay and the search of suspects is graduating," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are helping to search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the Grand Plaza Building Manager, which was notified of the event that was expected to happen in the apartment No. 1008.
The police described the whole scene as a very violent one.
Guglielmi said it was not clear if the incident occurred on July 27th.
He added that Lath and Warren were caught by security cameras.
"We believe that Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
The Guide of Grand Plaza issued a statement for all residents: “Police are now working on the compilation of the victim's time review and profile and investigates various motives, including domestic violence.”
"In a rapid future, we will complete WADA's plan - Deputy President of the Russian government Mutko
Deputy President of the Russian government Vitaly Mutko stated that it will not take long and there will be the implementation of the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“A portion of the new plan criteria has already been completed and RUSADA has already obtained the right to plan and test in collaboration with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this, the WADA plan was updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to meet the code - which describes the criteria for renewal of the validity of RUSADA - which has recently been published on the organization's website.
According to Mutka, the Code does not contain anything that Russia should worry about.
“All was notified and all will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA at the nearest time," he added.
One of the criteria mentioned, however, calls after the public notification of the WADA investigation results investigated by Richard McLaren on the alleged sponsorship of the doping of Russian sportsmen by the government.
On this subject, Mutko said: “We are conducting an investigation, because our antidoping system clearly failed.
It was approached to all measures.
However, there were no state programs in our country and we cannot therefore confess to something that never existed."
Mutkov's words confirmed Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In the Russian RSport Smirnov interview, he admitted the problems of Russian antidoping factors, but added: “In many occasions, we stated that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report completely without an objection," Smirnov finished.
WADA suspected RUSADA for the delivery of doping checks within Russia in November 2015 directly before the doping scandal.
However, the organization allowed planning and uniting testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this year in June.
Following the visit to the Moscow Centre of the organization in July, the Director-General of WADA Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is “in the right way ” to renew the validity.
The police accused three people, one is a youth.
The police accused three men of the establishment of a medium fire of a rare wooden church in Trinci-Gutech on Frideck-Mestek.
One accused is youth, all three are Czech nations.
For a criminal offence of general threat, they are in danger of up to 15 years of imprisonment.
To the newsmen today, the Mauritanian police director Tomasz Kugel told them.
He thought it was a deliberate crime.
"It's a very fresh matter and the police currently working on the motive of the whole matter," Kugel said.
He stated that the police would be dealing with the possibility of taking the accused in custody.
More information is not possible to be published by the Director.
"I can't tell more yet, because the workers of the criminal police and the investigation and the State representative who surveys the matter," Kougel said.
The wooden church of God’s body in Gutech came from the 16th century.
He was a valuable memory with many original equipment and pictures of the first half of the 16th century.
Wealth damage will go according to preliminary estimates to tens of millions of crowns, but the historic loss is unequal.
The reconstruction of the church began to be considered after the fire.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, the additional costs are ready to share the Ministry of Culture and the city, the public collection is also prepared and the contribution of the owner of the memory, that is, local farness.
Similar wooden church of St. Katherine in the 16th century in Ostrava-Grabova also destroyed fire 15 years ago.
It caused an electro-installation disorder at that time.
In his place, there were exact copies.
The state counts on citizens in the defense of the State.
He'll support their training.
With the financial support for the communities used in the defence of the State, with voluntary training or with the training team, it counts on the actual purpose of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the State.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been processed by the government, promises that it will be able to increase the physical ability of the Czech and their ability to take advantage of the crisis situations.
It comes from a proposal that the Ministry has prepared.
If the law has been adopted in the future, the State would provide support for the defence of hundreds of millions of crowns regularly.
The main objective of the proposal is, according to its authors, to create an effective system that would help to increase the readiness of the Czech Republic to defend the State, beyond the performance of the defence obligation and on the basis of volunteering.
For example, the State would financially or materially support the mergers of radioamateurs, shooters or cinologists and allow them to increase their capacity.
In return, he would receive data on people who are willing to come to the country when the crisis is to help, and on their ability or material equipment.
Accredited instructors may also be available to help the communities and other stakeholders in training or education.
It is also consistent with the organization of words with war veterans or people who act heroically.
One of the possibly options assumes that a new agency should be responsible for the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal emphasize that the participation of people should be voluntary and the State would use their ability until they announce the situation of threats.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual deletion of earlier obvious borders between individual types of threats," states in the intention of referring to the danger of so-called hybrid threats.
The ministers have noted that there is a need to focus on supporting as many as possible capacities, not only those military.
"The basic goal of the purpose is to create a very broad base that will enable every citizen to respond qualifiedly to the situation threatening the supremeness of the State or life, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, in case it contributes to the protection of others, and to the wrong behaviour to avoid the fulfilment of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic," states the intention.
The adoption of the law would bring a lot of financial rights.
Their above will be dependent on the selected option.
For example, the Office provides financial support for projects for the preparation of citizens to defend the State to up to 100 million crowns.
If the administrative and coordinating centre is established, its operation could cost about 60 million crowns a year.
Other money would go to payments or construction of the information system.
The proposal also assumes that the scope of the district military commands should be expanded, which would combined with 42 additional troops.
The representatives of the Ministry have already stated that the law should also help to resolve the disagreement of certain Czech politicians with the introduction of the European Union Directive on the maintenance of weapons.
It would allow the shooters who are part of the system to keep some of the weapons reserved by the Directive.
Startups that help your company not become with the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the level of satisfaction of the employees of her e-commerce startup, but she did not find a suitable research.
The answers were often incorrect, useless, or even fake.
And even though she promised anonymity of research, some employees expressed their uncertainty in the entire process.
"I have searched for consistency and objectiveness," said Erett, owner of the e-commerce of Madison Reed's haircare company with a seat in San Francisco, which employs 75 people.
So she asked for outside aid.
There are still new startups in the field of human resources that are helping the company to examine the satisfaction of employees.
By creating and licencing the software with a specific purpose of measuring the responsibilities of employees, the startups allow companies to carry out rapid votes, target specific teams and demographic groups, further offers the total anonymity of employees and the hot line for complaints, and in some cases they also allow the informants to survey the supervisors and contact direct direct direct directors.
"There are tools such as Strava and Fitbit, which are watching your health status, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-based and general head of startup Glint with a resident in Reedwood City.
Errett said that thanks to Glint, she got more awareness of what her employees think and feel in three years.
In addition to rapid research and voting of specific teams, Glint offers a company's temperature map and an executive review of groups with highest number of complaints, as well as a review of low-value managers - which allows users to work on fixing.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the work environment - in case they become another Uber - which is dismissed in scandals after the former employee published on his blog a contribution described by the company environment and the disturbance of employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for research of the company culture is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global sector of control, regulation and completion can exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Convercent from Denver in Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and disclose inappropriate behaviour, saw a small increase in interest and activities at the beginning of the year, just before the Uber scandals.
Almost 600 Convercent clients belong to Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber also accepted his wings under his wings.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send adaptable "flash" research, collect confidential information in real time and show the temperature maps of the difficult areas.
It also offers anonymous text hot line that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, complaints shall be sent directly to the Administrative Board.
"The Court of Justice of Public Opinions has authorized regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and executive director of startup Convercent.
If the company is convicted of wrong treatment with its employees or non-ethical behavior - and if the regulators do not proceed - he may face costly consequences as a result of the customer's combat, the exhaustion of employees or court proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Restaurant Network of Ruby Tuesday, which employs more than 25,000 people around 500 locations, uses Convercent more than a year to raise awareness of business principles and procedures and to ensure a easy way to contact corporate leadership.
Earlier, if the employee wanted to report any problem, he had to survey a telephone number or e-mail on the company's leadership, officially file a complaint and hope for a good solution.
It was often a distracting and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, a general representative of Ruby Tuesday, who used to have no reliable way of monitoring the complaints of employees.
Now, when the company uses Convercent, fast detection and solution of problems that have never come to the managers sitting in offices on a mile away from the real solution to complaints - the discrimination, disturbance or unfair treatment.
"It is close to the holistic, total view of the experience of employees," Vitrano said, who manages the group of Ruby Tuesday to supervise risk management.
"We are jealous of protecting shareholders from judicial disputes by employees."
Companies stopped taking ethics, values and participation of employees on light weight in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen crashed after Enron's fall in the issue of abuse of ethical rights of employees, Quinlan said.
But only when “the social media lighted the whole thing, ” the companies began to realize that in the online world they cannot easily hide their cupcakes in the closet.
"Before people began to use the technology ethics, they rely on faith," Quinlan added.
Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by the brave capital investors who supported both startups.
Convercent chose in its February campaign from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital totally $10 million and eventually took the capital of $47 million.
Glint won $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and won $60 million during the entire campaign.
These investments are barely surprising in view of the nature of companies, culture and risk capital.
The growing number of research clearly confirms that today’s employees expect from their jobs more than ever before.
And on competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, they are not the main advantage of high salary and interesting projects.
Employees want to realize that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are devoting their time to a positive mission.
"If people are happy in their work, they realize that their voice is heard and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, vice-president of global benefits and employee benefits of LinkedIn, which uses Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn if companies and companies are successful, if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure the involvement and commitment of employees to society, it is no wonder that there are many investors who will support this effort.
It is important to provide data on the satisfaction of employees.
But the data themselves are inadmissible unless the company takes the necessary steps.
The fact is that once the company asks for a renewal by its employees, there may be major changes.
And if the change doesn't happen quickly - in the worst case at all - can cause disappointment and no interest in employees.
"As soon as you ask for 4000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, the consultant director at Kotter International, who was witnessing many companies who were too relying on data themselves.
"Because when you don't get things to end, the employees will start asking themselves: ‘Have you ever heard me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should it interest me?"
Madison Reed, who is currently conducting a regular study between employees every month, can solve the problem by Glint within one day, said Errett.
After the meeting of the backroom from the employees who were frustrated by slow decision and quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and begin training communications to address the problem.
Ruby Tuesday has a very important view of its employees and hopes that, in a long term, he will achieve high employment in the field known as common release.
"If you do not strive to create a transparent work environment, employees will not trust you," Vitrano added.
"And once you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And the whole company is breaking down with the customer's disturbance."
Thursday became the warmest day.
Thursday, with 38.3 degrees recorded in the Watch Tower in Hodonina, is the warmest day of the year in Czech Republic.
So he overcome the Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
The workers of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute informed it.
On Tuesday on Thursday, there were not many temperature records.
The vedra affected Morava mainly, the Czech Republic was mostly cloud.
On Tuesday, the records were overwhelmed or compared to 35 of 145 meteorological stations measured over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term stations recorded the record.
For example, in the Watchhouse today, the temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In the Lednica in Brzeclaw today, 37.4 degrees have overcome the original maximum of four tens of degrees and in the Pogorelica, the current 37.1 degrees have exceeded the record by three dozens.
Both records, just as the Warden came from 2013.
High temperatures have appeared today mainly in the south and east of Morava.
After the Watch was the biggest vedro in Dyjakovice in Znoyemska and Brode over Dyja in Brzeclavska, where the mercury rose at 37.8 degrees, but the record did not overcome.
On the contrary, for example, in Western and northeastern Czech Republic, the highest temperatures of CHMU were only about 22 degrees of Celsia.
"Thermorrhagic temperatures have started to grow there until now afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current vedro in Czech Republic will be gradually discharged, and more significant rain can come on Sunday.
Most of the places of Morava, however, will remain high temperatures on Friday and southeast of Morava and Saturday.
We've got this screwed up here.
Miliarders don't have the same voice in elections as every one full-year-old man in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because not all are as hard as Andrej Babish, who wants to own a state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penty Marek Dospava, along with other colleagues behind the water, Martin Burdo and Antonin Frych, is sponsoring Robejs Realists.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is financed by the insurance owner and the realities businesser Paul Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his side.
The convicted corruption and the king of the Czech gambling Ivo Valenta acquired the Private Party.
Political motion Agrofert, as Andrea Babiša did not name exclusive mayor Jaroslav Germany, is a chapter for himself.
The Mayors have recently caught their billionaires.
It's Dalibor Grandpa, owner of Jablotron's security facilities.
According to his own words, he enters politics to do good.
But the Grandpa didn't make much of an entree in the city's dress.
"I've never taken small goals," he said at the press conference.
That means that my goal is to make the ANO move to get the Mayor's movement in the elections twenty percent.
Leckdo smiled.
But grandfather's rebellion is more convenient.
Miliarder Dalibor Grandpa is a man of firm opinions.
Although she's going to speak about votes in the Master's dress, she continues to support Andrey Babiša.
Grandpa was supporting Grandma in the previous parliamentary elections.
"Babish is not a shooting speaker and does not control a loving rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote before the elections 2013.
But it's definitely not in politics because he wants to improve himself personally.
Babish will remain a hero for me.
He is willing to leave his world under control, and to do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors presented him as a new support, he reaffirmed himself from his admiration to Babish.
And he said he wanted the Mayors to learn how to cooperate with Babish.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa does not change his views and stands behind her, regardless of what dress he's wearing.
Others can speculate whether Babish sends to the Mayors to build his bee to someone like this.
Others may ask whether the boss of Jablotron has not broken up with the boss of Agrofert in the store and does not seek another way to defend his business rival.
But the first grandfather’s public performance was not just around Babi.
Grandpa promised to send the Mayors to the 10 million crowns campaign.
And if they need more money, he'll send more.
A few years ago, it would be hard for anyone to stop.
Otherwise, the courtly recognised gauner Zdenek Bakala had thrown millions on all parties before the elections in 2010.
The Political Division of Vita Barta Security Agency, TOP 09 and civil democrats have gathered a total of 30 million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits any political party to give over three million.
When Grandpa's already entering politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Perhaps he would not have to ask himself why politics have such a bad reputation.
His first days in politics then Grandpa crowned the proposal for tax benefits of families with students.
People with high school education will come to us about 50 grand a month.
Those with the base on less than 20s.
A man with 50 thousand is rich for this relationship.
The one with the 20 poor.
In Grandfather's vision, poor people pay fair taxes and wealthy enjoy benefits from the social state’s functioning, which are not too much involved.
Wealthy simply need to be helped to avoid suffering.
Mayors can congratulate each other for their new acquisition, and Babish change their hands.
We, even thanks to Grandpa, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
There's still a question about who to vote.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to keep them.
Those who members and members of their party or citizens and nationals of the State do not become their employees and the country for their property.
Finally, those who want to live well in the rich earth, not only to some people.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex must have dropped by 234 million.
The sale of real estate is sometimes not easy.
And many times he won't have 11 bedrooms, a beautiful sea view, or the fact that the real estate is selling US President Donald Trump.
At the sale of the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down with incredible 8 million pounds.
He informed the web mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says, "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Run to the place as none else.
But neither the link of the reality company with the US president has declined a extreme price.
Donald Trump must have reduced his Caribbean seat price for incredible 8 million pounds.
The original property price was 21.5 million pounds, the final price dropped by 13 million pounds.
So even after the discount, the villa complex stands about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's nothing to wonder.
A fascinating seat of 5 acres in the Caribbean island, St. Martin, has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, reinforcement rooms and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
Part of the land is also the pool and the tennis kurt.
There are dozens of palms in the land.
The terrace is a beautiful sea view.
According to reality experts, the price showed that the connection with the president is not sufficient to attract potential buyers.
The real estate is now closer to the common prices of real estate on the island.
Trump bought property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about 15 million pounds.
The property was supposed to buy for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on St. Martin Island.
But with a new price, they are ordered to the second place.
The neighbourhood property was estimated at 13.5 million pounds.
NCAA decided to end two trainings a day.
The eleventh morning players of the UCLA UCLA university are coming up to the sideline of the new school field.
Some of them take off their dresses and reveal sweaty backs, unfaithful sign of the first day of the training camp.
For most members of the team of these few minutes, nothing is supplied by the afternoon break.
The players recorded in the summer semester will go to rooms after a three-hour training to study at the final tests before they return to Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that is going to be on the next morning at 6:30.
"For these boys, the next three days will be a real pussy," said Coach Bruins Jim Mora a moment before Monday was overweep on Tuesday.
With two trainings in one day, NCAA wants to relieve to players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - so at least until Friday, when the final tests are finished.
That's why the first three UCLA trainings are planned at 19:15 - to incorporate many students in so scratched journals.
For the first time in six seasons that Mora spent on the position of the coach in Westwood, the Bruins training camp begins a week before last year and training is limited during the summer semester. It also has its impact on the decision to limit the number of trainings from two to one daily.
A total of 18 trainings are scheduled until 20 August, starting formal preparations for the first match against Texas A&M team, which is going on in September.
It must have been heard that it supports the NCAA decision, although it added another item to the already loaded players' daily.
"Three or four days are players under great stress and it is very exhausting for them," said Mora.
"But no one gave up, everyone's trying. They're great.
I think Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed after the completion of the training camp, which will not be easy to see the clear lines of surrounding lands from the nearby parking and the luxury hotel of Luskin Center, which has been acquired by players after the scratch of the protective network behind the brank.
The Bruins players should hire the hotel starting this week, but Mora admits that when the rooms are empty during the season, there might be a problem.
“The land will be guarded by the security service”, added Mora.
“Security is taken care, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our training.
It's good to deal with such materials.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by the security, as well as the parking lot of 8.
We'll use for the maximum of our funds.
I believe everything's gonna go well.
It's all planned."
Facebook plans more thoroughly checking the facts to limit the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially false articles to control third parties and show findings under the original contributions to fight the so-called Fake News, the largest social network on Thursday.
The company in its website declaration states that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes that will be sent to third parties to verify and potentially show the results of the research under the original contributions.
Facebook was marked as one of the main sources of false messages and many believe that these unconfirmed reports have influenced the presidential election last year.
In Europe, political debates are being addressed. French voters are flooded by the lave of false reports of May's presidential elections and Germany plans to put a penalty on the network of social media, if it quickly does not remove anger contributions.
On Thursday, in his further statement issued in Germany, Facebook stated that it was about to start testing a new function for the control of false reports in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to showing the reports verified by third parties, people request more content to be better information and to decide what they can share," Sara Su, the product reporting manager of Facebook company.
She added that Facebook continues to test the function “related articles” and also works on other changes to reduce the number of false messages.
Graphical novel creation: story of A Castle in England
The small castle Scotney Castle recently played a major role in the music video of the Squeeze group and also found its refuge in it during the 70th and 80th century.
Scotney, however, was a witness of a storming history of 700 years from his comfortable place at the Bewl River in Britain Kent, which inspired the courageous Jamie Rhodes from the York County - known love in historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
"The view of the letter of a man who is 300 years after death fascinates me," says Rhodes with a serious face.
"When I keep a letter in my hands, I feel personal connection."
Graphical novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families living in the castle of Scotney from the Middle Age to the Eduard period. Each story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkyewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first book of Rhodes' inspired archive: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teeths and Other Stories (2014), the collection of inspired documents of the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was taken by a fingerprint on a letter written by a double agent in the '70s who worked for Jacobites," he said.
"This is his fingerprint!
And the letters always smell like a smoke, because in those times, you had to burn a candle.
When I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How much I love the archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, support is by the National Trust and Arts Council of England and the possibility of staying nearly four months in the castle almost as a dream. ("To tell the truth, I extended my stay a little longer.")
Rhodes spent time studying the Victorian “new ” castle, exploring archives and studying many treasures and curiosity, such as the head of hyena on the walls and bottles that have been thrown after centuries in the bottle.
He was walking around the land and examining the ruins of the old castle, talking to hails, gardeners, and sometimes with artists who worked on illustrations to his book.
In the night, “he drank whiskey and wrote. ”
Confidential history of Scotney is relatively familiar, since the National Trust Organization has obtained access to documents until in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the place ten years later, the employees were only starting to invade into the archives that Rhodes described in words, as if “aristocratics of many centuries were throwing away with the words: ‘Let it into the ceiling.’
The journals, letters from the British Empire, maps representing property: “You may think that the dispute about land is boring," Rhodes said, "but I ran into one case when two families were dragged over the belly.
Stop it, people!"
Some stories in the book use a castle as a remarkable bridge and go deeper into the English history, including a story named The Labourer, who follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English rebellion in 1381.
"I found a rebel record in the castle of 1380, which was called Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex," said Rhodes.
“The English rebellion actually began in this area and I thought the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe it's somehow connected."
Other stories are firmly linked to the history of the castle -- for example, the Priest, who tells the story of the Jezuit priest who was hiding Darrell's family for seven years during the English reformation.
Or The Smuggler about a 18th - century counterfeiler named Arthur Darrell, who reportedly emphasized his own funeral when he filled the stone coffin (which was discovered a few years after the discovery of the canvas).
Rhodes’ favorite family are Darrell’s: “I was fascinated by men’s generations - men of that time were always debted and spent money for things they couldn’t afford.
Different generations of the Darrell family have dealt with it by taking rich or old pans -- I imagine they were a beautiful gentleman who loved to whisper their heads to her her heritages."
With the end of stay in the castle, Rhodes are looking for other adventures.
Recently, he returned from a two - week stand in the Finnish wilderness where he inspired his next book about Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the beginning of the 20th century, which was absorbed by nature.
But it's a special place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I said, 'I'm going to go back to real life now."
Washington changes the conditions of granting a green card
The media published President Donald Trump's words on the new U.S. immigration plan, in which the green card will also be changed.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50,000 annually, as a result of stricter rules for provision of temporary work visas and family visa restrictions.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The proposal for the law will be submitted to the Congress soon.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase remuneration and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and we will aim to change the rules for the issue of green cards to the inhabitants of other countries.
The law limits the number of immigrants and replaces the current scheme.
The new application process prefers English speaking applicants who have funded and demonstrated the ability to benefit our country," said Trump, quoted media.
Sexual robots are on rise - we should be careful
Just when it seemed that 2017 cannot be bizarre, a report on the technological development of sexual robots will appear on the Internet.
Yes.
Sexual robots are now really popular.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a declaration on the development of sexual robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former robotics professor and artificial intelligence at the Sheffield University and co-based FRR Noel Sharky needs to be considered seriously to raise sexual robots.
Customers can choose the color of their eyes, the shape of nipples and the look of robot's nails.
"People are getting rid of them, but sales are growing and we must be prepared to see them more frequently," Sharkey stated at the opportunity to publish the report.
Modern sexual devices are transformed from pushing gentleman to robotic women with a silicon skin, which is pleasantly warm to touch - of course it is artificial intelligence that imitates human behaviour.
The user can "mode" robot to the image of his - from the color of the eyes and shape of nipples to the appearance and colour of nails.
Of course, it is very disturbing that many robots have their own "person", which would also disgrace the Stepford Pani.
Modern pushing virgins developed in robotic women with silicon skin.
The owner of the Robot RealBotix can set up various characteristics to his replacement woman, including shyness.
And then there is a sexual robotic woman Roxxxy Gold company True Companion, which is supplied with advanced programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah", which is characterized by a shameful nature and "violent Wendy" with a "advertible" nature.
"Roxxxy Gold is set to fit your personality as possible," says True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like and the opposite.
She's even moodful, just like people.
She can be tired, calling or being “in the mood. ”
The rise of sexual robots is alarming immediately for several reasons - between which there is no substitute for real inter-human relations. Interrupting are rather underlying women's characteristics and violent edges - for example frigid (reads opposition) Farrah.
True Companion on its web sites illustrates Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
"When a woman can have a vibrator, why could she not have a man of Roxxxy?" it says on the page.
However, sex robots are not just fetish or sexual aid.
Their creation and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeper rooted in our culture - the departure from the ideal or sexual equality towards the desire for submanial sex with a electoral electoral elevation.
Most men, of course, do not buy a robotic woman and while the FRR speaks of their growing favorites, sexual robots remain on the edge of the public's interest.
However, this border interest may become a mirror set up in modern times.
And most people are not weird or violent until they have a free market.
There is no chance that these sophisticated sexual robots appear at the time that women around the world gain their rights, and in the White House, the president is sitting on a woman's address of a very embarrassing way.
The most horrible aspect of the series The Story of the servant is not what we see - hanged bodies and scratched eyes, rather the reality of these visions.
The book proposal The Story of the servant represents a step in the right direction, but at present it seems to be a small step.
Sexual robots are to be similar to real women if possible (may be with porn heroic rates).
Their creators design them so that they are pleasant to touch and act at first sight as a real woman.
However, when it comes to their “person, ” the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They don't have any work or history, nothing that would incite their independence or violate their devotion to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
Greek 21st century: servants.
NBA star on the green hand.
Curry fights in California for cutting.
The star basketballist Stephen Curry, despite the screwed first trigger at the premier start, did not lose his professional golfists.
Double owner of appreciation for the most useful NBA player played the Ellie Mae Classic series below Web.com Tour in California Hayward's first round on 74 wounds and will fight for cutting.
The Golden State Player, who in this season obtained a second title with the Warriors team in NBA, began very nervously and his first blow ended up in a drink in a golf wheelchair parked at the fairway.
Even after that, he wasn't as accurate as under the basketball basketball basketball, yet he left a dozen professionals with a balance of four wounds over a couple.
"It was not the perfect way to start, right after the first blow to call the judge, but then it sat a little," Curry said with a huge trim on him.
It was very nervous to blow the first shot at the tournament, but it was all I was hoping to do.
"If you told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it immediately," he added.
If Curry manages to fight with a cut, which is likely to be set two wounds under a pair, he will become the first representative of another sport that will be able to do it on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now, when I got rid of the drems, it might be possible," said an excited golfist who played on tournaments of celebrity and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
He's starting the first time in Hayward at the PGA tournament.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he obtained a sponsorship exception and preserved amateur status.
The Web.com Tour is a category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's great victory?
On the contrary, Mitt Romney is a healthy body of mind.
The indispensable sign of Trump's era becomes political divisions that divide American voters and also micro-measures the entire families.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving period, it argued in American newspapers how to deal with relatives who choose Trump.
We're just supposed to wait to let us get nerves.
However, less attention is devoted to Trump’s ability to diminish the family.
I'm talking about it because my cousin, a poet and a left fan, who has been visiting me this week in New York, has been visiting me in Chicago, who has been paying for a Republican fool for a long time.
She reminded me that the emotionality of faces to the common enemy could have a strong effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, the whole family is suddenly - including all the Republican cousins with whom the politics had been hastered for years - on one wave.
At dinner at the family table, it's a good thing; but I'm impressed that in a broader context, it's a significant risk.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
Speaking of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the scary possibility that his assholes can lose their attractions one day.
However, there is a more dreadful long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the right republicans, who, opposing its standards, will suddenly be the emotionality of what can be called rational.
In these today with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of mad conduct - a dog on the roof of the car, 14% income tax (we had at least awareness of his tax confession) - of which both examples look compared to Trump as a very mild offence.
After Tramp's departure, it will be sufficient to make the subsequent Republican candidate at least normal, which will be an enormous improvement.
We used my cousin's visits and we took the kids to Central Park to the largest circuit that operates the New York Park department -- for your three dollars, you can't find better use unless you need a caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the central war is covered by a clown - clowns and animals are filming and in horrors they look at their own shoulders - a totally dark view and a shining music of a miracle reminds the public transport.
Many cliché will soon be freezed: the view from high buildings, the panorama is embarrassed, instead of breathing with the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your ideas.
Fifty-fifty years later, I still did not pass through the fact that Swiss Cottage isn't actually Swiss cheese - does not count thematic bedroom Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but the metro station in London.
The Central Park wheel, however, causes an extraordinary magic experience, to the extent that two two two-year-old children, as well as two mature women, are greatly entertained in it.
If I could evaluate the circuit, he would have earned the maximum points, but fortunately no one asks.
This week, I experienced similar experience in the shop when I was asked to assess my “revision” on a degree from one to five.
It's the same in my street cafe in my corner, with the difference that I can get 15% of the drink for something I'm buying behind the pulp.
Not only is that it slows the rapid sale otherwise, but the waitress is so forced to embarrass in the favor of buyers when it doesn't need it.
A woman in the store excused me with a smile when I unwillingly appreciated my transfer of credit card to five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transported from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time that the Pistorium must have been transferred to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cutting wounds on his wrist, which, according to the sentence, caused himself after the fall in the cell.
The Pistorius was accused of murder after appeal against the original sentence of murder.
He killed his girlfriend Steencamp in the early morning at Valentine in 2013 with a few shots across the door of the toilet closet in his house in Pretoria.
The writer claimed that you were wrong with the thief.
The plaintiffs announced their intention to reappear, this time against the six-year penalty of the Pistorius, which is too modest according to their words.
The National Prosecuting Authority stated that it would be appealed to the South African Supreme Court and the judicial proceedings will be carried out this year.
In the case of success, the prolongation of the penalty is threatened to Pistoryus for up to 15 years.
In the South Africa, the death penalty is not paid.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a young man in captivity of a grown panda who was in the wilderness.
It's a huge success for the Pand Rescue Program.
Because the Centre is trying to expand the genofond pands in captivity.
The worker of the Centre Chang Č-chung told the New China Agency that the pand behaviour is a big risk of a relative crossing.
In captivity, only 471 pands lived at the end of last year.
Only two thousand survivors have been survived in the free nature.
Efforts to let captured pands with those savages are the first step to help the pand behaviour protect this kind.
The 15-year-old Cchao-chao was released to the natural reservation at the beginning of the Pandi Paradise period on 11 March.
With the tracking device on the neck, scientists could observe every step.
She met her chosen Cchao-chao 12 days later.
Sexual relationship with a pandie male lasted a minute and a half and it was successful.
It can also be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not considered the most successful lover of the animal empire.
The males have relatively badly estimated the time when the females are ready, and they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
Young people were born healthy, and even since Chao-Chao had a special appetite during pregnancy, it was worth 216 grams after birth.
The average weight of the newborn panda is less than 70 grams.
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in Greece for illegal camping, BTV quoted the statement.
The group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, was detained on August 1st in the morning of the Sithony police.
They were all released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said for BTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have strengthened the rules of free camping and store strict penalties to all who are arrived in a place where camping is not allowed.
The checks will run over the whole season.
The Ministry stated that the court could retain the penalty.
Spilk's on the first round of British Open at the fiftieth place.
Golfist Clara Spilk figures at the first round of Major British Open in the 50th place.
The score in the Kingsbarns score was one hit under a couple when she played three times the birdie and twice the godey.
The twenty-two-year-old Czech player is so hoping that the famous major will first pass through the cut.
Introduction with a grant of $3,25 million went out the best American star Michelle Wieová, who won the first round in the 64 wounds record, which is eight under a pair.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are downloading millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands themselves have already closed 180 minors for the incident.
The Netherlands Food Safety Authority of NVWA, according to the Reuters Agency, announced that it is investigating 20 per cent of all the Dutch poultrymen, which according to it means that 80 per cent of the eggs in the market are unacceptable.
The Authority emphasized that the risk represents only a limited number of types of eggs identified by specific numbers.
According to German authorities, the quantity of toxic substance in eggs is small, and for adults, it is not a potential threat to children.
The speaker of the Czech SVS Peter Mayer informed that the eggs and chickens from Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities joined the closing of the nanny, had not recently imported to Czech Republic.
However, the veterinarians will take the egg and chicken meat samples from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, whose markets have appeared insecticide.
The eggs from Belgium were last in the Czech market in April and the Netherlands in May, according to the veterinary administration.
The chicken meat from Belgium has last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
But in Czech Republic there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of the anti-bags, all and slippers.
However, it is not possible to administer animals consumed by people.
The World Health Organization of the WHO considers the preparation a mildly toxic.
His high doses lead to the feeling of disturbance and turmoil.
Riga's beautiful, I'm gonna miss her, says the golman Sedlack, looking for an engagement.
I'd still like to catch ten years.
"Maybe I'll come back there once," a 27-year-old Sedlack, who could start the season in the Zlinne Dress.
It's important if he gets an engagement at the start of a new year.
What were the four years you've been in Latvia?
If I'd appreciate it as in school, I'd be three.
I didn't catch much for the first year, I had an experienced guilty before me.
I was studying.
I started catching the next year.
Third season I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought a new guilty guy I had to go back with.
Last year, I assumed I'd be catching all the time.
But during the starting ten matches, we could only get five points, so the coaches started to film it.
At the end, my colleague caught more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it in the next season.
How was life in Riza?
Beautiful.
It's a little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'll miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're three years together, we'll get married next year.
So I got something.
How hard is KHL for the branners?
The first ten teams are really qualitative.
Then there are men like us or Slovak who must change their game style against them.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it.
That means playing more back, more fighting.
I didn't see a problem in the width of the field.
The difference is, the Russians want to play empty.
They're less shooting, and even if they have a half-law gate ahead, they prefer to record.
There's only more shooting in Czech Republic.
Didn't you make a trip problem and move over seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
She can sleep calmly.
The program is usually done so you play four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do Lothis even see their KHL club?
As a national team.
The whole Latvia's watching hockey, with basketball, it's a national sport.
Everybody's familiar.
Even though it wasn't, there were a lot of people walking.
Did Dinam's impact in KHL help that Latvia at this year's world's championship almost passed into the quarterfinal?
KHL is playing since 2008 and Dinamo is there from the beginning.
And since the same time, their results in the world's championship began to go up.
On Olympiada 2014 in Sochi, they fell in quarterfinal with Canada close 1:2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they got to a higher level.
Still more lottery players are headed to the Czech extraligy.
In Zlína, Roberts Bukarts was seated and before the contract was signed, Ralfs Freibergs.
What's so much of them coming here?
They're not any beach players, they're really quality.
These teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Lotys among them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still not engaged?
At the beginning of February, I knew I wasn't going to continue in Riza.
That's how we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a budget for a goal, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was classic.
We talked to different teams, but in the final, they decided for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlína and I'll wait for something to come up.
Are you not nervous about this?
That was four years ago when I left and didn't know what would happen.
The current situation is not the best, but on the other hand, I'm home for some time.
I got something in KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The only question is when and where I'll sign.
How real is the option that you go to Zlina's new year?
Anything can happen.
Let's see what's going to happen in a month.
Now I can just wait to see what the agent's gonna do.
Do you prefer any competition?
The past season was not that I could choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government's flight continues.
In January this year, I wrote about a camp in the Orlic Airs.
The principle of the problem remains the same, so I will allow the urgent passage of the article to remind.
The Flight camp has been talking about for many years.
For readers who don't know exactly what this is about, it's probably the best to look at the official pages of the cultural memories Pietnament instead of the Flights.
There, in the introduction of the historical review, the camp stood two miles east of the village of Letas, that since 8.1940 served as a work camp, since 1.1.1942 was a camp in the congregation, and since 2.8.1942 became a cyccan camp.
The next text describes the progress of life in the camp, including the non-human conditions, until March 1943, when the first air prisoners were included in educational transport.
On 4.5.1943, the largest transport to the extinction camp was transported by 370 persons.
The total of them was 420.
Very sad history of the enormous sufferings of human beings that caused them again of human beings and distorted ideology.
There is no dispute that these events need to be reminded constantly.
There is no dispute that this reminder should occur at the monument in the place of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
For socialism, somehow somehow forgotten about the camp, and in the 1970s, he was built nearby and in part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was randomly discovered in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, a monument was discovered in the Years in 1995.
In the mid - 1990 ’ s, the government promised the redemption and demolition, but so far did not.
In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural memorial, and since 2009, its management was falling under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Committee for Human Rights called on the Czech Republic to close the vacuum.
So short of facts about the war fate of the camp.
On the fall of autumn, the government approved the buying of vinegars and decided that an expert assessment should be drawn up for the purpose of determining the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, then the government will buy off.
According to Herman's Cultural Minister, there are some numbers, but I guess I would have dreamed about the intentions if I went to public with them.
Let's see what a professional assessment brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, hundreds of millions may be available, others say the price can reach a billion.
Anyway, it won't be cheap.
And only a few hundred feet from the former camp stands a monument in which the state had invested in 2010 almost ten million crowns.
Even if the United Nations Committee for Human Rights funded the whole transaction, which is obviously not threatening, I think it would be the same as dismissal of money.
Does the government not have other priorities?
The monument, the dignity of the seat, stands the will of history practically in the immediate nearby of the tragedy and whoever wants, can be presented here by a memorial of suffering and murdered.
I can't see any reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is, and keep the place with the maximum patience.
The authorised property, including the money of taxpayers, should, in this case, treat the Government of the Czech Republic with the care of the proper economy.
At least with one like in his own firm!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Vice-President of the Government is not the whole government.
But I still feel from the above facts the ANO leader's password only as an empty electoral proclamation.
This year, in May, I went straight to the place.
Very pleasant arrival trip, adjusted parking lots, replicas of wooden camp houses.
In one exposure, in the second integrated toilet with liquid water.
A small natural amphitheater with the possibility of seating and with a view to its own pea place, which is made of stones located in a mild hill.
A lot of flowers and veins.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, as appropriate and belonging.
Archaeological research is currently in the place of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, part of the disclosed foundations could be conserved and appropriately accessible at least visually.
That way, the Minister of Culture, Daniel Herman, could make his efforts.
If he is able to make a redemption in the government for public money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already so difficult work in the function of the Minister of Culture.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate may mitigate the symptoms of inflammatory abdominal disease (IBD)
For your experience system, red meat and milk products can be a nightmare.
However, a new study suggests the contrary: food rich on animal protein and milk products may help to relieve from the symptoms of inflammatory abdominal disease.
Untreatmental disease that affects up to 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 patients in Great Britain causes stomach pain and bleeding fever, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
Patients are usually reminded not to use meat and milk products to mitigate symptoms. However, researchers of the Washington University found that the essenceal amino acid triptofan in protein helps to create immune cells that support the resistance of the worm.
Dr. Marco Colonna, a leading study, explained that immune cells protect the wormhole and ensure the disposal of harmful food microbes.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells supported by tolerances and protecting the body without damageing the sensitive tissue.
Once the bowl of the wax slopes on the side of the inflammation, it may occur to an inflammatory abdominal disease.
In research, scientists found the presence of immune cells supporting body tolerance in the mice stomach with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the creation of cells the presence of triptophane - one of the construction blocks of proteins.
Professor Colonna said: “We have found a connection between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is common part of the intestinal microbium and the development of cells that support body tolerance.
The more triptophane had mice in their food, the more these immune cells had."
At the same time, he suggested that if it turns out that the same applies to humans, then the combination of L. reuteria and foods rich on triptofan would help to develop a more tolerable and less inflammatory abdominal environment.
The postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas in a study of some kind of immune cells supporting body tolerance revealed that one group of testing mouse cells had these cells, while the second group of the same mice kept separately missing cells.
It led to the fact that one mouse group has a different abdominal microbium — a community of bacteria, viruses and pellets that usually stay in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse tree was tested by the DNA classification method and researchers found six types of bacteria in the mouse with immune cells missing by the second group of mouses.
The mouses that were kept in the sterile environment and lacked the abdominal microbium -- therefore, they did not develop this type of immune cell -- were given to the L. reuteri bacteria -- and they created immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affects the immune system, researchers raised L. reuters in liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without bacteria - unexplored immune cells stored in isolation.
Immune cells have developed into tolerance cells.
After removing the active substance from the liquid, it was shown that it was an adverse product of triptofan metabolism known as indolyl-3-oct acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of triptophane in mouse food, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent, and after the distribution of the triptophane doses decreased by half the number of cells.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as the mouse and most of us keep the L. reuteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known if the side products of triptophane from L. reuteria caused the development of cells in people the same way as in the mouse, but triptophane genes were found in people with inflammatory abdominal disease.
Dr. Cervantes - Barragan added: “Everyone of us should probably seek to develop these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the worm.
The potentially high level of triptophane in the presence of L. reuteria can increase the population of cells."
José Mourinho considers the signing of a contract with Nemie Matic and its transition to Manchester United as “genial”
Manchester United got into his "genius" team in the form of Nemanja Matice - at least thinks José Mourinho after the carrier debuted in the middle fight against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed a contract of 40 million pounds, introduced in the first game of winning 2:1 in Dublin - the last pre-seasonary struggle in front of the UEFA Supercharge, where the United met with Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed his role as a host by Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not attend a team pre-season Asian tour, Matić had no form and played only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinha, the next season of the Premier League should be worked before the start of the Premier League.
"It takes time, but it is experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant thought - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get into the condice as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new colleagues Victor Lindelöf and Romela Lukaku also played the first match at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho starts slowly forming their 11 for the next season.
The independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign the contract with the other three players, but insists that the club had done “fantastic work” and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank the club for helping me get three of the four players," he added.
"Four of four would please me more, but I admit they made the maximum for me."
The life challenge of the king of the chicken skins of the Lada Gross.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
This multipromised image began to be drawn through a new TV show on Prima Zdeňkov Academy.
The germ immediately struck a chance.
"Dear Zeddy, I'd like to join your cooking academy with this, because I think I can learn a lot from you," he called it in a social network video.
And since they've been screwed up for a few years, the Laddy didn't forget to irritate him this time.
"In return, I can teach you a sweat from the diet chicken meat, American cocktails or invite you to water and show you why the favorite is a roasted cheese," he crushed.
His participation in Pohlreich's new show is serious.
It's time to move a level higher and learn from the master.
"The question is what the boss said to the Lightning.
But Pohlreich did not express himself because he was filming the new parts of his next show Yes, boss!
Only Prima responded to the participation of the Hrushka in the Culinary Academy with taking the whole matter as a personal activity that goes outside the TV.
He planted a big wound to Hrusk Pohlreich in December 2004 by his first cook.
Over 300,000 pieces have sold her over a few days!
The new show that Prim presented yesterday at the press conference for the autumn transmission scheme is a fake cooking school.
Pohlreich chooses his students from a series of viewers, and in twelve parts they are familiar with twelve cook techniques.
In the last part of his show Now the boss cooks in November 2014 Zdenekek made his back of his trick squeezing the overcrowded throat.
If he had my face there, I'd laugh a lot.
"I'm just smiling over that gruss - the gross is a healthy fruit and has plenty of vitamins," responded Ladja.
He thinks about the Ladde's culinary art.
"Cooking according to the Lada Hrushka doesn't come into consideration either at home, because I don't get a gastropunk home," he clearly has the boss.
I appreciate Pohlreich's daily, even according to him, I'm making honey chicken.
But in my show, his recipes will certainly not appear," he did not forgive himself, Hruška.
He's an asshole!
He's not a cook for me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic analfabet or a jerk," Pohlreich said about Hrushk at one lecture.
"I don't have 20 to be able to wave my hands over them, but I don't deal with them anymore," he stated on the account of the insults of Hrushk.
The British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock the car and the house by waving
The British inventor became the first man in the country with a microchip infiltrated in the body. A simple waving of his hand can unlock the door from the house and office and even launch the car.
Thirty-year-old Steven Northam had a small chip implanted between the finger and the indicators and currently offers the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, anesthesiologist of the Royal Hampshire County hospital in Winchester, observes the procedure for implantation and enforcement of treatment procedures.
Technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted with dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a service to exchange locks of doors and cars compatible with the microchip. The price of one lock is 300 £.
A single child's father had technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car mark, which will start with a simple waving of his hand.
The requisition of the White House cost taxpayers a thousand dollars
The decision of the White House to arrive with a navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the US industry that was held last month came according to the navy records issued by the TIME week, at $24,000.
Green white helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the President on board, was the top of the programme of 17 July in the White House, which was a view of American constructive programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and several high officials of the White House were looking at the examination of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter from Connecticut was exhibited next to the Maine yacht, the fire car from Wisconsin and the vilicate drilling wheelchair from Mississippi.
The military officer of the White House issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and requested the presence of a helicopter for less than 36 hours before helicopter landing in South Lawn within the "extraordinary" event, stated the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - units responsible for the management of the helicopter.
"I wanted to make sure that you have awareness of such a significant event," commander HMX-1 wrote in his e-mail to his supervisor, the Navy Commander for Aviation Day before the start of the event.
The report suggested that the helicopter will arrive at South Lawn 17 July at approximately 7 a.m. to the occasion of a show, whose start is scheduled at 3:00.
The e-mail further stated that, if a delay occurs during the leaving of the White House, the replacement crew will be sent for the reverse flights due to the labour Regulation.
The initial crew remained on the spot that night along with the helicopter and with them the security unit.
From the records - which the TIME week received - was not evident if the second crew was finally sent.
The Hatch Act prevents public officials from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible violations of this Regulation.
"We wondered if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was all right," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you were blocked," the Deputy Commander wrote.
This show “Made in America” was marked by the White House as an official event and Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
But also official events have political subtexts.
During his participation in the event, the President promoted a health reform that went through the Senate and discussed the efforts to maintain the government regulation at the end.
The use of aircraft such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
The presidents use them for travel.
However, their presence is uncommon for presentation reasons.
Trump ordered control in February after the president's plane went back at his first meeting in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is charged with complaints about the use of the presidential plane of his precedent.
“The White House is pleased with the show“Made in America”, represented by the products of all 50 states produced by Americans from American materials”, said the representative of the press secretary Lindsay Walters.
The helicopter crew HMX-1 often trains landing in Washington and South Lawn and train possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum precision.
While Trump participated in the G-20 summit at the beginning of July in Germany, HMX-1 carried out 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight in Made in America was part of the current crew training, stated the state factor.
The helicopter unit in the same day ran into the “non-President support missions” for another 11 hours.
The White House stated that no further requisitions were paid from the money of taxpayers.
The speaker Sikorsky stated that the company was not interested in negotiations on the exhibition of the helicopter on South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not store the budget records for the presidential flights and the exact costs in relation to the examination are difficult to determine the navy's expression.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hour price for the fiscal year 2017, the refunds of DoD for VH-3D 24 380 dollars per flight hour.
Unit logs indicate the time 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are moving significantly under that amount.
"The introduction of taxpayers' costs based on estimates for expenses is very irrelevant," Walters told the whole matter.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs, which are included in the annual costs."
According to RAND’s 2015 supplementation of the expenditure of the DoD does not include the burden on staff, but includes the price of fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
The former press secretary of the White House Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter for the purposes of the show.
"The idea of the show that is going on this week is to present products made in the US," Spicer said.
"I am aware that the company of Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the protection of our state and that they provide work to hundreds, not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and other military devices that are involved in the production of many American citizens.
This is the real thing to remind."
It is not clear whether Trump was also looking at the helicopter at his business at South Lawn. With certainty, it can be said only that he sat behind a volunteer of one of the fire cars.
Back in the White House, Trump contacted the representative of Sikorsky and was joking with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three right now."
A young woman tied up in the swamp at Mach's lake, and the police were walking to her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday about 2:00 a.m.
But instead of swimming, she remained trapped in the wet.
When she decided to ask her cell phone to help the police, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"For that reason, police officers soon lost connection with her," said police speaker Ivana Balak.
A few police guards went to the place she described nearly, but finding a young woman was not easy.
"Some of the cops had to be floating with the racos wet hundreds of meters before they felt a solid ground again," Balak neared.
And likewise, she was missing.
Police officers were oriented according to the direction from which her call for help.
"To not lose at least this connection, they agreed with her that she would count out loudly," said the speaker.
The police found a woman at three quarters to five in the cotton.
She was on the boundary of physical and mental forces and showed signs of colding.
That's why the ambulance called to take her to the Chescolyptic hospital.
Grandpa's connection to Stan?
The desired bride becomes a selling girl.
That's a little irony.
With its web project searchesmessane.cz as a billionaire told the voters in fact that STAN suffers from a deficit of deficit of good people.
He also argued that politically unrelated bands were rather less famous to the mayors and independent, in fact, have no national programme for the elections of the Parliament.
Her election candidate will simply become a decent man after an interview with Grandfather, whatever political opinion he has.
This was the way Wit Barta started, and it didn't get too good.
In his pursuit of decent people and personalities, which may be replaced by some mayors in the candidate, which is also accepted by the Gazdík, and the Grandfather also disrupts the favorite argument of the head of State that the most value of movement is the political examination and experience of the mayor, the traditionally favorite politics and according to research.
Now, they're rearranging the rapidly collected unknown characters.
The total divorce with humans, after which the STAN changed the logo and slogan, Gazdík explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity in human candidates.
But if the state of identity has suspected only a few of them at that time, after Grandpa arrived, it's just a game of identity.
Not only Gazdík has long been set against ANO Andrea Babi, but the Grandpa, who is publicly praised, said: "My goal is to make the movement of ANO, then the Starship Movement won 20 percent in the coming elections."
Let's hope he didn't make a mistake.
Grandpa is a successful businessman, and a billionaire is certainly not a coincidence.
She often talks about politics like Babish, but she's not the own political mark.
STAN has been reminding reality show for a while rather than a real political party and the Grandpa's helpful hand as if she made a more selling girl from the bride requested.
For a while, Stan went with TOP 09, then with people, and now he's looking for a change to make good people.
Let's hope someone gets in touch.
Police dogs have been practicing on a helicopter in Bridge.
The dogs specialized for searching explosives and searching dogs were trained at the lake of the Bridge to fly with a helicopter.
The police dog must not be frightened and fearful from flying, said Peter Tomaszek, chief police cinologists.
The police dog training takes about two years.
In the Bridge, they were trained as adult dog training, so those who are just going through training.
In addition to the standard training where they were to expose sharp explosive samples around the lake and look for a lost figurant, all 12 animals had to enter the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
To immediately, what the helicopter reaches, the dog could go to work so that he doesn't have a problem with the way of the helicopter.
"The helicopter's coming up, the dog goes and searches immediately," said Tomaszek.
A dog who is unsmire or a helicopter is unable to start working immediately is expelled from training.
"Then most of them keep them in the garden, for example," complemented Tomaszek.
The police have 76 dogs with different specializations in the Age County.
The German sheep are prevailing, but also belgic sheep.
The dog cares for him from the puppy.
"He keeps him alone, prepares him for the service that the dog will do for us," complemented Tomaszek.
The animal is passing through repeated veterinary examinations that may disclose any medical disabilities.
If the dog is healthy and insecure, it consists of the first tests in 20 months.
"It gets to a sharp interference about two and a half or three years," said Tomaszek.
The length of the police's service depends on the dog's health.
Most of them serve at eight to ten years.
Then they live mostly with their dogs.

According to the United Nations, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
The elections can only be valid if all members of the company, including women, have been stated in the middle of the UN representative in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN Assistant Mission, said that elections to local representatives are attended by hundreds of women, three women are vice-president posts, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he stated in his central declaration.
The elections can be fully representative and reliable only if women participate, as well as all related processes associated with the elections.

The Afghanistan Independent Electoral Commission stated that a total of 3.6 million registered voters represented 1.2 million women.
Unique beer cooks again beer.
A good beer to a resurrected beer.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought back a few years ago a beer in Lobch in Mshen.
The beer reminded for the first time in 1586 has a renesans core and has been transferred to a parochronous operation in the nineteenth century.
It followed years of flower when the beer was famous mainly with dark beers.
During the second world war, unfortunately the production was stopped and in 1984 the beerware was nationalized.
Since then, buildings served a state ship.
The part of the destruction was completed by the owners of the beerware after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and deployed on construction material.
In 2007, however, the new hopes of the new owners, architects of Jana and Paul Prouzovs were lightened.
They began to repair buildings with the greatest respect for the spirit of building and every detail.
They were carefully dedicated and devoted to a study of archives, trying to maintain original materials and construction elements.
The beer has the same shape as in the 19th century when his golden era started.
Their work was evaluated by the statement of a beer for the cultural memorial by the Ministry of Culture, and the construction was also part of the European Industrial Heritage Paths.
In 2015, they also renewed the tradition of cooking beer.
To taste a great lobby beer in the painting landscape of Kokorinska, visit the exhaust in the beer area.
In the cooking of beer, they use cocorin water in protected landscapes, sweets from lobby fields, and yellow chmel.
You're gonna taste a traditional light bed, but also dark beer and specials.
And don't miss a beer examination, it's going on Saturday and Sunday afternoon and half second.
The biggest artillery firm of Czechoslovakia?
One of the biggest fortress of your type in the world's standard?
This was the unique construction of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Jacler, on the top of the territorial hill above the village of Babi.
It was originally to form up to twelve bunkers connected with a large underground.
Here should have been command, casino, ammunition storage, material, electricity, machinery and hospitals.
However, the Monache Agreement concluded the construction.
In a less than a year, the only powerful iron-beton bunker was built and underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to the enthusiasts of Stachelberg, who started reconstructing the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also look at it.
The underground is already available from 75 percent!
The part of the area is other than the marine scrap of T-S 73 with exposure and underground and an armed facility of light reinforcement, along with two displaced marine scratches, diggings and learning path of the Trutnovska.
Refrigerated, comfortable altanic and fabulous views in the land guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building came to the list next to such monuments as the Great Chinese Wall, Traian's port at Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Nimrud.
Clashter Chociešov originally from the beginning of the 13th century, which forms today mostly a powerful four-wing building of a convention above the beautiful garden.
The list he got on, but unfortunately, belongs to unique buildings threatening the disappearance.
However, enthusiasms do not want to give up and have many actions to support the monastery.
One of them is the next Anniversary for the Monastery Hotišov this Saturday of August 5th, where Vladimir Mišek, Ivan Voice, will see the charming appearance and look at the places of beautiful large buildings that are usually unavailable.
But mostly you enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

Recognize the plant with one click.
Students with herbs and ordinary plant lovers will be helped by a new free Pl@ntNet application.
When they are interested in what plant they have just struck on a walk, these applications will advise them.
The only thing they're gonna have to do is photograph the plant, and the application itself recognizes what kind it is.
The new application available for iOS and Android was presented to representatives of the Centre for Ethics and Environmental Education in the Bratislav Horic Park within the project The Secret Life of the City in Tuesday.
The project has also been included by students from 50 Czech and Slovenian schools who photographed and added plants from their area with teachers in the application database.
The newly emerged French application is free to download The Secret Life of the City.
The main goal of the French programmers was to contribute as many people to the application by their images, thus increasing the number of plants that the application can recognise.
"With the children holding a tablet or a cell phone in their hands, they can go into the woods," said the coordinator of this project, Ivan Polačkova.
On the basis of a sufficiently quality photograph of flower, sheet or plant fruit, applications can recognise its name within a few seconds, which will then in Czech and in Slovenia assign under the photograph.
The French have allowed us to translate the application to Slovenian and Czech to the project The Secret Life of the City.
It is therefore welcomed that users, after setting up an account to the application, contribute to the plant's image that is not yet in the database.
"Francouz will assess if it is useful, and then they will add it to the database," Polačková informed.
GMB concerns about investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The committees require insurance from managers of MacVitie's manufacturer's long-term production obligations in the Glasgow factory.
The Switzerland Union of the GMB stated that the company is currently silent about any investment in the Tollcross factory.
There are more than 500 employees working in the factory who produce other products and cookies of Hobnob and Rich Tea.
The owner of McVitie, Pladis, said that in several previous years, she invested more than 5 million pounds in the entire area.
She added that employees and representatives of the committee will be “the first informed” in the case of changes in the operation of the factory.
In the letter to the builder, the Scottish GMB commissions expressed their concerns that McVitie's “will not receive its promises of financing and modernisation of production lines”.
The GMB Major Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received clear answers from the builder on the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very disturbing for our members.
There have been generations of families and employees, mostly from the local community and the area of Glasgow, where the work in this factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social departure.
From the view of work, payments and benefits - and despite the view of Brexit, a growing life costs and declineing slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous producer as McVitie's."
The speaker of Pladis said: “Tollcross, who is building, received a letter from GMB just yesterday, and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we appreciate the continuing commitment to staff and committee representatives.
The regular meeting with staff and representatives of GMB in Tollcross took place two months ago and the meeting was openly discussed with many problems.
We talked to employees that as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operation on a regular basis, which applies for all our operations, so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested 5 million pounds in the area of Tollcross, especially in production lines and operational efficiency.
We very appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the localities and, if any changes in the operation of this factory are made, staff and committee representatives will be informed immediately."
Did she warn the PSG Barcelona about Neyar's movement three years ago?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow in its efforts to get Neimara on its side after she composed 189 million £, that is the amount needed to buy Neimar from the contract, but warned this French team of Barcelona about its recording invasion before three years ago?
This sensational offence has developed the waters of summer offences. Club Ligue 1 is ready to overcome more than twice the previous record amount for Paul Pogby's transfer to Manchester United, who paid for it in last season 89 million £.
After confirmation and finishing the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive world player and at the same time the best paid professional sportsman in the world - after taxation from the PSG team will collect over 500 000 £ a week.
Barcelona is agitated by the way Neymar exited from his contract, despite the confidential source confirmed that the club has always tried to meet Neymar since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the soccer world noted about the fact three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khalaifi warned all the clubs that would be interested in taking over one of the best PSG players.
"I am not afraid, because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we will certainly call one of their players," said Al-Khalaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they are trying to win one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seemed to have crossed the intelligent border when she expressed her interest in PSG Marca Verratti's bookmark in the summer.
PSG made it clear in the sense that under no circumstances it would allow the departure of the Italian representative. It is possible that Barcelona is now swallowing a bitter pill for his trimming dealings with Neyamara.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have widely understandable rules?
Donald Trump slipped on the anti-Russian sanctions.
On the day before, the United States has sanctioned Venezuel President Madura.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China is not doing anything with the North Korean threat and that it won't go any further.
Even from that, the idea of sanctions is like a shoe slam.
These things can't be thrown into one bag.
Madur's Venezuela really went to the way to the dictatorial, it's totality.
China just doesn't do what the American President wishes.
Russia is a chapter for itself.
But if someone wanted to summarize this in a way that the ordinary voter, American, European or other ways, would understand what it is and what system of rules is based on sanctions policy would be almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump only applies to what President Obama has already planned, but only gave an implementing remark.
Then why such a disturbance?
Last year, Europe was afraid that if the American elections of Trump won, we will hug Putin and revoke sanctions.
It's a terrible idea.
But in practice, it's the opposite.
With Trump, the sanctions are not released, but they're harder.
But Europe is scaring even more.
German Minister Zypries says Trump's sanctions are violated by international law.
It's like a cosser is only sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then they are not a carrier or the EU's anti-Russian sanctions.
The Chief of the European Commission, Juncker, again complains that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
It's like they're supposed to use sanctions so weak that they don't threaten anyone?
The usual voter is drowning.
For three years, he heard that the destiny of the anti-Russian sanctions depends only on the implementation of the Minsk Peace Agreements in Ukraine.
It is now learned that it is an energy security of the EU.
The voter's darker and wider.
There are sanctions on Russia for being too mounted where he hasn't.
China is defeated because it's mounted a little.
The Venezuel President is punished for building a dictatorship in the borders of his country.
All those punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see the system, the order or the rules in it?
Andrej Babish: I don't think of cooperation with Okamura.
Andrej Babish married, crossed the Republic with his visionary book and finalized the election program.
In addition to the Pardubian district, he has already completed all candidates.
According to his words, he did not have much to interfere with them.
He even agreed to lead the Haytman and Shadow Minister of Education ANO Ivo Vondrak.
"If he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a messenger or a haytman," he confirmed his earlier opinion, Babish.
A lot of representatives and all-country politicians you pissed off your mind that the mayors and primators should direct the municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I'm the favour of direct democracy, we're electing the President directly, and I'm convinced that we should vote both the mayors and the prime ministers.
In my book, I'm not talking about interruption of representatives, they can be there.
The question is, how many will there be?
When I present your book, what I dream about, when I'm sleeping, I heard you were talking about cancelling the substitutes.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about direct choice and reduction in the number of representatives.
New York with nine million inhabitants has five districts and 51 representatives.
A threshold of 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the primator is counting that she's a little building and not preparing big projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same applies to the government that only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman, were driven.
I'm not saying they did it right.
The current Prime Minister doesn't manage anything, he just modifys the debate.
That can't work.
That's why you want to plant the majority system?
It'd be perfect, but it's hard to make up.
All we have in the program is a change in the one-coll choice to the Senate.
We also proposed a sliding mandate of the ministers and the amendment of the Acting Rules of the Parliament to prevent the useless exhibition of Members who are to work mainly in the commissions and committees, not to be presented at the meetings of the Parliament.
It is definitely not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents fear.
That as a dictator you will run the government, control the Parliament of 101 Members, dismiss the regions and the Senate, and through grateful mayors and Primators you will control the entire country.
I'm sure it's not that way.
There's nothing wrong with debating about the number of messengers.
The French President Macron announced a reduction in the legislative corporation of a third, with 57,000 French lawmakers on one legislator, while it comes to 17,000 Czech.
But no one blames Macrona for the threat of democracy.
Even if someone won elections mostly in Czech Republic, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making some dramatic changes.
But the stocks for the one who has a parliamentary majority are large, just look to Poland or Hungary.
Nothing like that in the case of the ANO movement is not threatened.
We just need a team that will work for people in the government, not for their parties or resorts.
I don't understand, for example, why we couldn't agree that only the payments of teachers, employees in culture and social services will be increased.
Why did they voting me and add me to 21 percent of the GIBS members who are already taking 60 grand?
Would you like a prime minister?
The Prime Minister is to intervene when ministers are acting inadequately, screwing the government with travel offices, and for the money of the state, they would like to take business as Marian Jureka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and soil in Africa.
Ministers in the government don't have to argue, they need to talk to each other out of it.
There must be a complete material to go into the office, there is no place for coalition breaks, force votes and businesses, there to decide.
How do you want to have a coherent team when ministers are acting mostly partyly?
There's a constitutional law above the sides.
When the bread was broken, Sabotka said that the coalition treaty was not valid, and he fled Babica from the government.
It can be done by any prime minister.
But if it is personality and has controlling powers, the same plane gesture does not need.
It measures everyone equally and requires perfect performance from all.
Do you know who you'd suggest for the Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it, because we probably won't even be in that government, nobody wants to cooperate with us, even though I don't know what I've done so badly.
It's not that sceptic.
The Mayors have gained the businesser of Grandpa, who would like to cooperate with you, may win a wing of the chief Yuri Chunk.
I don't think so.
CHSSD leads Lubomir Zaoralek, which does not exclude the ANO coalition, may be accompanied by Václav Klaus ml., which will also not be against.
I'd leave it on the voters.
Vice-Premier and Vice-President ANO Richard Brabec said you have many common points with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the economy.
So the coalic partners come into account?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, candidated as Vita Barty's doll for VV, then gained money for his company from the Dawn.
He, of course, is a significant personality.
Of course it's kind of brown.
If I take his program, there is a wide range of involvement of people in society management, direct democracy, that can be agreed.
I'm not asking you that at all.
I wonder if you are a acceptable person who has xenophobic opinions speaking on demonstrations with screws and wants to step out of the EU?
We don't consider cooperation with Mr. Okamura, I can't imagine it.
Apparently, he went to politics to profit from it.
What about the silent support of the Communists to your minor government?
I can't imagine that, but the voters will decide.
It's going to be a victory negotiation with another in order, but God knows who will be the winner and who's two.
Of course, it is important that they be able to negotiate a coalition government programme.
Let's go back to your attempt to become a company.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything expel, never decided.
Coalitions such as CEB or EGAP did not work.
Because Saturday is his madness, and I think that was also why he fired me.
Once he did, Chaz controlled the Czech government.
It is unbelievable that the Prime Minister has brought a resolution written by the management of CEZ, which stores to the Minister of Finance, how to vote at the valuable CEZ.
If you become a prime minister, would you change your personal relations in the supervisory council and exchange the top management of the CEZ?
Jesus, if I'm the prime minister, I'll see you.
I'm not yet.
There's noise that Chez has already sent signals to your direction.
He would like to exchange a good collaboration with the CHSSD for even better with ANO.
Well, maybe after the elections, it's going to go on.
I don't know anything about it.
I don't have any humble lobbyist or Pink, I'm a single unit, and I'm not dealing with this at all.
Then answer directly.
If you are headed by the government, will you seek to exchange the leadership of CEZ, the Czech Television or the General Health Insurance, that is, the institutions you criticize?
I'd like Chez to be a transparency company.
He's been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to the traditional political parties.
All you need to do is look at Mr. Schwarzenberg's words.
Even though he's supposed to stand in the Chez majority, he's never driven him, he's only been there to the number, which's wrong.
It's a trivial thing for me.
CHEZ should take Dukovani, evaluate them, put them into a daughter's company, arrange funding, make a supplier competition or get a coinvestor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And the Czech TV?
Some of her shows against me lead a permanent target campaign, but I don't have and I won't have any competence to dismiss someone.
But to control yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens are paying for public laws and television fees approximately 7.2 billion per year, but they don't actually know how these institutions economy.
How come they don't know?
The Convention approves, however, the report on their economy, which directly affects the positions of the Director-General of CT and CRO.
Look how those reports are discussed, on the superpower covenant of Sobotka Kalusek, which always worked.
It's both about the current parliamentary committee to escape from the investigation records and Lex Babish.
And Saturday was so stupid that he let Kalous push me out of the government, which won the percentage of TOP 09, but the CHSSD put them on.
They are afraid of the violations of their corrupt system, thus speaking of the threat of Babish democracy.
No one's immune.
What do you say to the articles describing the first Vice-Chairman ANO Jaroslav Faltinek builds the power land by putting his son into the supervisor of the Board of Teplaren Brno and providing a related lawyer Cvetoslava Glynn's contracts with urban and state companies such as the Prague Transport Business or the Czech Roads?
We have a permanent dispute in that.
I don't like it, and I've done it several times.
The Faltenek arguments that the mentioned lawyer works as a significantly lower rate and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
I didn't have anyone as a Minister of Finance.
Unlike the juices, we never had a corrupt affair, no Pelta, the Kratowall, the Brezine.
If there was a sign of customerism, we fired a man like that right away.
In this direction, I'm inpromissible.
If something like this happens, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it would be.
