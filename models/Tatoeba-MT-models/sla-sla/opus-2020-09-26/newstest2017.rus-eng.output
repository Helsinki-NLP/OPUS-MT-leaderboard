Scientists found a animal that could live for 500 years
The International Biologist Group concluded that the long-term spinal animal was a grenland Polar Shark, which could live for about 500 years, transmitted by the RT.
Scientists conducted a radio-carbon test of the eye chrustling 28 grenland sharks.
The largest shark, which exceeds five meters, may be between 272 and 512 years of age.
The biologist believes that the shark's long-term role plays a low metabolism that leads to slow development.
Grenland's female sharks only reach gender maturity to 150 years.
Previously, it was considered that the “neighbours” of the sharks, a grenland whale, lived longer than all spinal animals.
The oldest person known as scientist was a little older than 210 years old.

Should we go to the sanatorium if there is no health problem?
Our expert is the main doctor of Olga Bogos.
And if a person is healthy, he's just tired of work, should he go to the sanatorium?
We don't only need sanitation vacation for treatment but also for prevention of diseases.
In the conditions of the sanatorium, a person can check the state of his body and receive the doctor's recommendations to live so that his health should not be destroyed.
Such recommendations will not be excessive for anyone.
"It's just tired of work" is an important body signal, and it's not worth waving off.
Permanent stress, mental and physical exhaustion can lead to depression and chronic tired syndrome.
The stress is about 90 per cent of the arrivals.
He is most subjected to people from large towns aged 45 to 55 years.
So it's best not to complicate the situation and let yourself rest in time.
Studies show that 98 per cent of people are reducing their biological age during their stay in the sanatoria.
Modern sanatories offer comfortable rest for the whole family.
So if you want to spend your holiday with the kids, you won't have to break up with them.
For children, even the smallest, healthcare programmes include both diagnostic services, pediatric consultations, analysis and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatories have child pools), inhalation, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, physician.
The course of procedures determines a doctor taking into account individual testimony and characteristics of the growing body.
In addition, the sanatories usually work with animators where children can attend game classes, different master classes.
Some sanatories open their doors even for visitors with infants, provide the necessary conditions for the breasts and provide the services of an experienced nanny.
A soft winter, a long summer, has created good conditions for round-year rest in the Caucasian Mineral Water.
And then the body needs rest not only in summer.
So we should not be afraid of weather outside the window, since most procedures are carried out in the premises and are not dependent on the season.
In general, sanatorial curriculum treatment is desirable to be conducted twice a year, especially for adults.
The main stock of the Caucasian Mineral Water region, of course, the cure mineral sources: Slovanovski, Smirnovski, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect different organism systems.
Water is different from temperature, salt, total mineralization, chemical and gas.
The doctor picks water depending on the patient's self-esteem.
Thus, Narzan has anti-fuel, immunomodulating action, restores the functions of the stomach-basket tract and the exchange of substances.
The Esentuki-4 affects the stomach and pocket tract, reduces the sugar level.
The essentuques of the new is an anti-fuel, yellow and urinary action.
The same effects have the water of the Slavian.
The doctor must take into account the state of the heart and the system when appointing water.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks less salt water because salts keep the liquid, which leads to increased pressure.
The acceptance of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be drinked at a certain time, at the necessary amount and specific temperature.
The sanatories are now available in various cosmetological procedures for the person and body.
What kinds of healing based on the natural features of the North Caucascas can be obtained in the places of the region?
There is, for example, a salt lake of Tambucan, an illuminating dirt of which is useful for the compounds, the spinal, the internal organs.
It provides anti-fuel, sealing, immunomodulating action.
These are healthy walks on individually composed routes.
They are particularly popular in Kisloodsk, where there is a huge Kurort Park (second in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is close to the Narzan mineral source.
There can also be wine baths, birds, yodobers, seasonal, salphyno-lacrine, depending on what the doctor will appoint.
Prolong the fertility.
What do we do to make the fertility go to the end of the season?
Tells Julia Belopuchov, agronom and cluster.
It is time for highly grown tomatoes to make a haircut: to remove new pastures, cut off the scratches, remove all the leaves before the last fibre with fruits and small bonds, they will not be able to mature.
All the tomatoes, regardless of the Constitution, as well as peppers and baklayed by feeding gold-superphosphate exhaust, processing bio-preparations (Adolescent - to accelerate influenza and growth of fruit, Fitosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamair, Bactofit - from diseases, immunocytofit - to improve immunities, Bitoxibacillin, Lepidicide, Fitoverm - if there are harm).
Only copper copper, coloid cheese and green sauce are used from chemicals at the end of summer.
We're doing the last flood of plants.
The long-plied corn in the heat shall be declined from the wall so that the lower, shaved part of the tree (25-40 cm) will be laying down on the ground, pouring with warm water and circonic solution, putting down the steel of 5-7 cm composite.
Prolong the fertility of the cabbage is also not complicated: cut old leaves, spill with warm water and solve the integrated fibre, suppress the fruitful soil under the mushroom.
To protect from the night colds, set above the ark with a cover material.
Keep the plant open in the day and close the sun after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is out of the crisis?
Economists have seen the signs of Russia's exit from the last 20 years of recession.
According to Bloomberg analysts, GDP of RF demonstrates a positive dynamic - by 0.8 per cent in the second quarter, GDP decreased by 0.8 per cent in the annual expression.
This indicator has been minimum since the beginning of 2015.
According to Rosstat, the Russian economy declines in the second quarter slowed up to 0.6 per cent.
The situation was recently stabilised by the Central Bank and the Mineconomic Development.
There's slow growth ahead.
According to CBR experts, the Russian economy recession remained in the past.
"The index assessment of the Russian GDP suggests that the recession remains behind and the slow growth of the economy ahead," said the Russian Bank's "What Trends say."
GDP module estimates for the current quarter have increased to 0.4 per cent, estimated 0.5 per cent by the fourth quarter.
As the representative of the Mineconomic Development reported, during the second quarter, GDP has stopped in the second quarter by 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleared GDP decline was 0.2 per cent to the previous quarter.
However, during the quarter the decline stopped: it was 0.2 per cent in April, and in May and June, GDP changes were between 0-0.15," quoted by the representative of the IRR " News " .
The slowdown of the falling Russian economy during the last five blocks indicates that "one has passed."
Bloomberg, among other markers indicating the renewal of national economy, calls for increasing demand for electricity and railway transport, business recovery.
If an amendment to that year is high, it is clear that the dynamic in plus 1% of electricity consumption can be halfly caused by an additional working day.
Let's add a lower average temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of cargo transport, but it is difficult to obtain accurate data, and a plus a minus 0.5 per cent of the seasonal volume can also be explained," explains Cyril Jakovenko from ALOR BROCER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of the stability of the Russian economy.
For example, price pressure reduction.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month last year.
Furthermore, the last two weeks, Rosstat fixed the deflation.
Prices in Russia have fallen for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamic of the ruble course, which, although showed strong hesitation at the beginning of the year, the result of August has increased by 12 per cent since the beginning of the year.
It is also one of the recovery indicators from the real economy," said Jacobenko.
Furthermore, since April, industrial production has increased.
In June, the indicator increased by 1.7 per cent.
Foreign trade rates are delayed from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
The positive dynamic also demonstrates the labour market situation where unemployment rates decreased to 5.4 per cent.
It was only in September 2015 (5.2 per cent).
Despite the healthy situation in the labour market, the real income of the population should be left to wish for better.
The annual expression decreases by 4.8 per cent.
This factor may hamper the recovery of the economy, as household expenditures contribute significantly to GDP.
The economy is generally more than 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, economic growth risk factors can also be called a strict policy of the Bank of Russia.
The regulator maintains a rate of 10.5 per cent, which does not affect the real sector well.
The negative factor is also insufficient investment levels, which prevents industrial capacity development.
But generally, it can be assumed that by the end of the year, the rate of the fall of the RF economy will slow up to -0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015," said the GK Forex Club Analyst, Irina Rogova.
The process of naturalization of sportsmen, recently launched in Russian football and well evolved in winter sports in Socia, is not so actively developed in summer sports.
If the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and former aliens are speaking, most of the cases are the harvesters of the former Russian Republics of the Soviet Union.
However, in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process, which is sufficiently large number of Russians who are standing under the flags of other States.
In any case, the history of change in citizenship is different.
Some parents were taken to another country when they were children without a choice.
Someone did not endure competition for the Russian meeting.
And someone felt that the best conditions for sports development would be created outside.
AIF.ru found at least 16 sportsmen who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The German passport of a 27-year-old girl says her name is Lisa Red.
But before she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Just four years later, as the Soviet Union crashed, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow her older sister’s steps — to engage in a light athlete.
Just like the sister, Lisa chose jumps with six.
She stays in Russia, and she wouldn't have been able to move Elena Isinbaev from the throne.
Unfortunately, in the Rio Lisa Olympics, it will be our only landlord, although our former, in the sixth jumping sector.
Her best achievements in this sport are the bronze of the 2010 European championship and the silver of the 2016 continental sovereignty that she had won again in the absence of Elena Isinbay.
29-year-old Elena Pirožkova was born in New Kuzanek in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandasists in the evangelist direction.
Mostly because of their faith, they left to the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight other children in the family.
They all lived in a small town of Greenfield in the state of Massachusetts.
Lena started fighting at school.
In showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where the U.S. Centre for Combating continued her training under the leadership of another former Russian Vladislav Izbinikov.
In the 2012 Olympiade, Elena lost her first fight in London.
But the world's champion of the same year is victory.
By the way, she has won silver in 2010.
Thereafter there were bronze 2013 and silver 2014.
The 26-year-old Mary was born in Jaroslavle, where she first met the synchronic swimming.
But being raised by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl's family decided to emigrate in the United States and settle in Colorado.
There Mary continued her classes.
Soon, she was in the United States Assembly and showed great results in the Pan-American games.
Understandably, at a serious international level, the Russian synchronists could not compete with competition, but for America its indicators were a ceiling.
A new name that sounds strange in Russian, Christina Shaldibin was 11 years old when her parents decided to continue training a girl from behind the ocean.
Until then, the girl was in her favorite sports in Yaroslave.
By emigration to the United States, she quickly entered the youth group of the country and later broke into the main national team.
In the Pan American games, 19-year-old Christian won gold and silver.
At the first position in the world scene, she did not have to fight, but for the United States, she organized a real break -- put a star-level collection in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another one of our former artists is Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who serves as a collective German.
She was born in Toliatti.
In 2008, when a girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more prospects of getting into a national congregation.
Soon she was representing her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, indeed, it could only take 17 places that are not sufficient for the final competition in the first place.
But two years earlier, she was able to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Youth Games.
Another gymnast, only this time, is Irina Sazonova.
If the ways to emigrate the previously mentioned sportsmen can be called standard, the choice of Irina's family is very unusual, Iceland.
Ira is a wilgograd sports school.
Of course, in Iceland, she immediately became the country's champion.
It is true that Ira is trained in Russia, a special visit to her home to avoid losing art.
In Rio, she did not work as well as she wanted.
The best place is 40 in a personal multiborder.
Notes about Maria Uglkov swimming in the Russian information space are very few.
Maria has been living and training in Switzerland for a very long time.
However, for a long time, it has spoken under the Russian flag, showing good results, even the country's record was 200 meters away by battery.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began speaking under the red-white flag.
In Rio, its best performance is 14 places in the integrated estaphet 4x100.
In order to get to the games, the girl launched a croudfunding project that made it possible to collect around 6,000 francs that allowed her to pay for training for the Olympiade.
A 31-year-old free-style fighter, Adam Batirov, spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During that time, Hasavurt's harvester was able to become a three-time championship champion of Europe, Russian champion, a Russian sport master of international class.
When he stopped entering our national congregation, it was time to think about a change in nationality.
For a few years, a talented fighter disappeared from sports reputations.
The Triumph Return was already represented by Bahrain in Asia in 2016, for which Bahrain won a gold medal and received a trip to the Olympiada to Rio.
Another ex-Russian, Michael Kumanova, is even less known in the family than Swiss sailing Maria Ugolkov.
The thing is, his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
That is where Michael started sporting gymnastics.
He has not achieved great success at the international level.
In Rio, its best results were 40 seats in parallel brush.
But for New Zealand, even the impact of the Olympic games in sports gymnastics is a breakdown.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There the girl continued its synchronised swimming, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, a girl at the European Championship in Berlin took the sixth seat in synchronous swimming.
In the duet with Eugenea, the Tetelbaum Anastasia took the eighth seat.
It was the fifth in the salt programme.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitri Croiter serves as a congregation of Israel.
When a boy was only six, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
During 2009, at 17 years of age, Dmitri has already become the country's champion.
Same year he won the youth champion of the world.
A year later, Croiter won the gold of the youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to jumping to the height, Dmitry has been jumping into length and triple jumping.
The 31-year-old Albert is another Hasavurt's heir who, after long talks for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, in contrast with Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which would be represented in Rio.
In Russia, he was speaking for the Higher Sports School of Krasnoyarska, and in 2011 he even became the country's champion.
The 28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the SSSR collector on Jaroslav Antonov volleyball.
Literally a year before the birth of the son, Jaroslav was recognized as the best volleyballist of the planet.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
There, the family remained for a permanent residence.
In 2015, he became a bronze championship of Europe in the territory of his new family.
Hadjiev was born in Chechen in 1994 and was in the very middle of war with his family.
Ten years later, parents decided to emigrate.
Norway was originally targeted, but the northern country failed to go to France, Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to learn free fighting.
Soon he won the world's privilege among youths and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the fighting tournament.
And again a free fight, and again the former Russian.
This time, it will be the crop of North Osetia, who emigrated to Spain, Timoraz Frieve.
At the end of December 2012, he was assigned to Spanish citizenship, and currently served as the collective team of the country.
Before that, a 30-year-old athlete has been able to mark the high results in Russia.
It became a bronze championship of the country in 2007 and 2008.
The Statute of Disappearance, Timuraz, decided to change sports citizenship.
The last in our list is the Czech boxer born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Mahachachala, Arthur Biarslanov.
When he was ten years old, his parents took his family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur began doing a box on his older brother’s advice.
Since then, Arthur was three times the champion of Canada, and in 2012 he became a world champion of youth.
In 2015, Biarslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, first for his new family since 1975.

Why are the kids classes in school?
According to Governor B. Condratiev, “they must be raised not by action and parade, but systematically.”
They need to grow and at least from seven years of age understand that they must be cocoaki and education.
But while this work seems to be formal and I suspect more on paper.
If the classes of the scatters take into account all the positives that have been accumulated earlier at the quality of the new level, I would be pleased.
If we don't know how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
CCIC continues to be one of the most criminal sectors in the country's economy.
There is an injury to the funds allocated to the needs of the communal scope of the budgets of different levels.
According to the Prosecutor's report, excessive tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the field of CCIC.
As a result, the consumers of the region have over 170 million rubs overpaid to energy.
At the day and the Prosecutor's office of the Red Day found the facts of inclusion in the expenses of unfounded costs.
In the OO 'IV-consulting ' s costs (on cold water) 4 million runs were rented by cars above the market price.
And such examples on the country of mass.
The people pay for the "communal" for the latest money, paying correctly, according to the Ministry of RF, the average salary rate of 94 per cent of the population.
It was accused immediately by several articles of the Criminal Code: dissolving, legalizing the income obtained by criminal means, abuse of powers, etc.
In the case of the investigation, as the head of the fund that repaired urban facilities, Macarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, not actually carried out, but paid.
Businessmen just paid him a lot of money.
As the owner of the UK, Macarov collected money from the population, but did not pay the service providers and spend it on his own needs.
As a result of the damage to the budget and residents, millions of rubles.
Macarov's machine scheme, unfortunately, is typical for Russia.
A whole wave of arrests and detention of the heads of the UK, which were taking the money of citizens across the country.
In Camchatka, the trial on A. Kohan was continued, by the way, by the former deputy of the Horsovet, who was accused of waving 91.7 million rubs.

However, the A. Kohan energy had not listed the funds, but wasted on himself, the loved one.
It's pretty difficult to judge in the field of JCX.
Things don't get excited, they're delaying.
And “help” in this extremely confused housing legislation,” says Lightlana Razvertneva, the Executive Director of the NPCC Control.
We are not able to earn one law, as we invent a new one that should make the previous work work.
Professionals, including judges, are also few.
Advocates themselves recognize that housing rights in the lips are very little attention.
Refugees of criminal proceedings, the wolves during the investigations are also discussed in the Guen Prosecutor's office.
Of the production in 2015, 3.5 thousand offences are less than half.
The rest of the investigation has been deprived of delay, and each fifth is suspended in connection with the failure of the accused.
Disadvantages in law enforcement authorities are often signed into gaps in the current legislation.
There is a law, but the findings authorities do not hurry to excite and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, approximately 230 fake reports -- only 60 criminal cases were raised.
In 5 months of the current year, their number increased only less than 99.
What was the fake of the housing protocol?
This means that the change in the management of the house, financial and other issues go around the views of the owners.
This also means that normal companies who want to work honestly, rather than "free" people, cannot be able to run into the housing and residence market.
A minor and medium-sized business is coming up.
First of all, by eliminating corruption as such throughout the State, Anton Žarkov, a member of the Committee on Property.
And now this work is actively done.
It's not just a single action, it's a targeted course to combat corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
In particular, it doesn't smell like scandals in the capital.
Why does there not be such scandals in Moscow as in many other regions?
Yes, because the capital Government has demonstrated iron will and has ordered it," said AIF, "Anatolius Election, member of the Committee on Security and Contracting Corruption.
I mean also a personnel and legislative amendments and legal education.
Managing companies have established surveillance, and all of them have been licensed.
The complaints of the citizens are quickly resolved in the public space (and residences and response measures are placed on the portal of the Government of Moscow).
Many are not just paying monthly bills, but are carefully watching what the house is written.
Awareness among the people of the rights of owners and obligations of resource and management organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow verifys the validity of tariffs for housing and communities services, since a large part of the budgetary funds go to grants and benefits for numerous categories of populations.
Probably all this together explains the calm situation in Moscow.
Is it all aimed at the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe it's worth changing the job?
Turkish gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to deny friendship with the EU and the United States?
The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, issued Ultimatum, offered to make a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Guleen, the Islamic preacher accused of the organization of a public revolution.
He stated that, speaking to his advocates in Ankara.
Erdogan called on the Americans to renounce the support of the "terrorism organisation of fethulahists".
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States calls for a change in their position.
Experts believe that the diversion in relations between Turkey and the West is increasing and can lead to a new attempt to change the country.
" Early or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO (The Terrorist Fethullahist Organization).
Either organizing FETO turns, or democratic Turkey.
It must make this choice," quoted the Anatolian Agency for the treatment of Erdogan, which sounded on Wednesday night in Ankara.
The President of Turkey once again, but he has already demanded from the United States to comply with his requirement for the first time after the rebellion.
Recall that, during the night of 16 July, the Turkish army, high-level representatives in Turkey, attempted to revoke the legitimate authority in the country, as well as an attempt to live the head of the State.
However, after Regep Erdogan spoke to the population, the rebellion was depressed and his organizers and participants were arrested.
Some 8,000 people were suspected, among whom there were teachers and scientists.
As Regepe Erdogan believes, they were spoken as a teacher of Fethullah Guelen, who lives in Pennsylvania in the United States.
Also, the members of Erdogan have allowed the Americans to be involved in the interruption.
All claims were denied by refussing to issue Guillene and advised to change the tone.
The latest statement by the representatives of the State of this account was made at the time of the visit of Erdogan to St. Petersburg on Tuesday.
This, however, does not stop the President of Turkey -- he insisted on his own and also raised the requirements for other Western partners.
"Ankara will cease to fulfil its commitments within the framework of the EU Migration Agreement if Brussels does not refer to the date of abolition of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens," said on 9 August the Turkish Minister for the EU Omer Čelik.
He said that the change by Ankara in the anti-terrorism law, as required by the EU, would threaten Europe's own security.
Notice that on 1 August, the Deputy Chancellor of Germany, Zigmar Gabriel, demanded that Turkey cease the EU's blackmail by promises to open the borders for migrants to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His words were the answer to the relevant statement of Head of MID of Turkey, Mevluta Chavushoglu.
Another provocative statement of Chavushoglu made in the past Wednesday, allowing Turkey to leave NATO.
The Turkish head of the MID did not exclude that the country would consider the possibility of leaving the Alliance unless it had the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence area is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries who cooperate with foreign States in the defence sector - rockets are imported," said Chavushoglu in an interview with the Anadolu Agency.
He said that Turkey must now create its own defence system on the basis of its technologies and cooperate with other countries.
"Turkey has so far tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have started looking for others," said the Minister.
Experts believe that all of this is a serious disagreement of Turkey with the West and the country ' s reorientation to the east.
The Chief of the International Institute of Political Experts, Eugene Minchenko, believes that Regep Erdogan is currently running his game and cannot go to a severe conflict with the West.
He is very bound to the West and to the business, and from a military perspective (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I believe that Erdogan will try to balance its framework with the West.
Although, of course, the Americans would be more comfortable to see a fully obedient person in this position," Aif.ru explained.
He said it was not excluded that after the Turkish leader ' s statements (o unpaid compensation from the EU, the requirement for visa space with Europe and the extradition of Guillene from the United States) would be pressured.
"Recep Erdogan will face both the deterioration of relations with America and the European Union, with the pressure on it on humanitarian issues, the dictatorial methods of governance of the country, and so on," said Minchenko.
The Chief of the Political Information Centre, Alex Muhin, believes that the President of Turkey has changed its view of relations with Russia as soon as it benefits.
Seven months ago, Erdogan took a very strong position on Russia and in all ways searched for favors in the West.
In a very short time, the situation has changed into the opposite.
Guarantee that the President of Turkey has not changed its priorities, no.
I think Erdogan has entered the period of human diplomacy.
Once it was between the two pols, the West and Russia, he would try to gain the maximum benefit of himself," said Muhin.
In his view, the main challenge for the President of Turkey today is to maintain political power in the country, and for that he needs Russia and partnerships with Vladimir Putin to stop supporting Guelein.
Turkey needs both the EU and the United States that control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Consensus with Turkey will therefore be achieved," the expert believes.
Another view is followed by the head of the Asia Centre and the Middle East, Anna Glasov.
Turkey's relations with the EU and the United States now are quite tense, and this is mainly related to the internal policy that Erdogan is conducting personally.
I think that the crisis in relations will be increasing, and the Turkish leadership will try to reload policies both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
Not accidentally the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, stated that they were willing to change their position on a number of Syrian issues, resolved relations with Israel, had a active political interaction with Iran," explained AiF.ru Glass, allowing the next step of Erdogan to normalize relations with Egypt.
She said that the policies that Erdogan is currently being conducted are returning to an external political concept followed by Turkey before the beginning of Arab revolutions.
"Turkey, therefore, began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region at " no problem with neighbours " .
The visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and Africa have now been very good.
Therefore, this external policy vector will develop and promote Turkey ' s positions both in the regional and international arena," the expert believes.
Glasova believes that Turkey's return to former relations with the EU would be incredibly difficult, and now the question is whether the EU will start to respond firmly to Turkey, which could go to the opening of the borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Structure of younger doctors: Calls for new collective protests
The representatives of the younger doctors requested the trade union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute on the new labour treaty.
The Committee of Younger Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is going to request its full Council to support more collective protests since September.
JDC said that the ministers had failed to answer labour treaty issues.
The young doctors and medical students voted in July for abolishing the contract on work agreement agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members who participated in a secret vote.
In a letter to members published in Twitter on Thursday night, JDC President Ellen McCort said that the Government continued to " silence" on issues that, as she said, led to the refusal of the labour treaty.
She said, "In view of the situation, the JDC manager voted for the rejection of the proposed new labour treaty in full and called for formal re-government on all your issues."
In response to the silence of the Government, the JDC officially requested an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to endorse the continuous programme of enlargement of collective protests from early September.
The argument led to the participation of young doctors in six strikes this year, including the first universal strike in the history of the State Health Service.
The Leader of the Younger Doctors of BMA, Dr. Joan Malawana, retired after a vote for abolishing the agreed working conditions recommended by BMA.
He said to members of BMA that the deal was good to be adopted during the meetings in the pre-gathering of 54,000 young doctors and medical students.
After the vote, the Minister for Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that this labour treaty would be used for medical workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "The Alliance of Bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in the green Palace Chamber in St. Petersburg, I had a sustainable impression that Ankara wanted more reconciliation.
It was a handcuff, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s smile looked tight, and he barely emitted the heat even by his own restraint standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the contrary, has repeatedly spoken about his "dear friend" Mr. Putin, five times, according to one report.
I lost the account.
He also promised that the relationship with Russia would return not only to their docrisis level but even higher.
The next day, one newspaper described Mr. Erdogan's action as if nothing bad ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm suggested the opposite.
But the delaying cold from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader did not forget anything.
In fact, the crisis was the first reason he mentioned in the introductory comments: Turkey hit a Russian perpetrator at the Syrian border.
Moscow's response was at this point uncertain.
Mr. Putin was punched by an angry tirada, accusing Ankara of the struck in Moscow's back.
The insult was even stronger, based on the alleged friend.
Recovery of real confidence will be difficult, probably impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
During months, the media-controlled State had an impressive, total attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, Turks should be considered guilty of everything.
The most serious accusations were from the representatives of the Supreme Guide that Mr. Erdogan's own family had gained illegal trade in oil from Syrian zones controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denyed it decisively.
But in St. Petersburg, there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Mr. Putin received an apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could have claimed to win its kind.
For Ankara the privilege of the reconciliation declaration is clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he could get after he was almost discarded from his post last month when he tried to turn.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shook him too.
There is also a economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit a lot — especially a ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast annually.
The number was almost 90 per cent severely down.
With regard to Russia, tour operators and charter companies will, of course, feel relief when the flights will finally renew.
They put on the end of the Mediterranean sea.
Even this week, the public television foretold cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products were re-equipped.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," said the report.
However, the visit also had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara of evil to the West because she considers a weak response to an attempt to turn.
Add to this its delayed dissatisfaction to the rate of talks on accession to the EU and the step of Mr. Putin, which is striving to use coldness and gradually destroy Turkish relations with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won a bonus score with Ankara for the invitation to support the elected authorities after an attempt to revolve the State.
Remember, this is the data for Moscow, which has its own deeply rooted fear of the change of the regime.
So the summit in this brilliant palace on the sea coast allowed Russia and Turkey to introduce what one analyst described to me as "the Alliance of Bad," two countries who feel rejected and humiliated by the West are uniting forces.
However, despite the public show of reconciliation, these two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite parties.
It is possible that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while two presidents were presenting a press conference, they had not even touched the topic.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided the answer to their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to emphasize them.
There is no clear consent in how they can find a common language in Syria.
But after the months of open hostility, and taking into account the possibility of a complete disaster, when a member of NATO, Turkey, struck a Russian reactive killer, was better than two leaders speaking at least again.
The Royal Scotland Bank will disappear for customers outside Scotland
Brand RBS should be composed of the role of the beck office, according to the Executive Director of the Bank.
The Royal Scotland Bank will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross MacEvan told Scotland that the RBS brand had been linked to the global ambitions of the bank.
The bank has withdrawn from them since it almost fell eight years ago and had to be saved.
During that period, the brand strategy used RBS to protect other consumer credit brands.
It was supported by millions of funds of sponsoring international sports, from the Cube of Six Nations on Regby to the champion of Wimbldon Andy Murray.
But now it was decided that it was appropriate to allow more national brands to go on the first plan.
The Royal Scotland Bank will be used with Scotland clients, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including external head office and fund markets, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private bank services, which will be more influenced — Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. MacEwan interviewed clients and staff at Inversshire.
He said to BBC Scotland, "Brand RBS will eventually become our investment brand and the one in which our personnel will be busy, because we are now more of a bank of brands."
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying we don't have any more global desires, we have local desires.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in its population groups, and our staff will work with clients under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsoring support of the six-national Cube, and it is building a profile of various brands in sport sponsoring.
"It is the right time for us to move the bank of brands, since (we asked ourselves) how we focused on the improvement of the customer bank?" said the Executive Director.
It would be very cynicly three years ago if we said we were going to be a great client bank and closing all these brands.
But with the work we've done, focusing on the needs of customers, not our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can get these brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori is up to 3,000 winners in Newmarket in Straits
Dettors squeezing champagne after the Duple in Newmarket leads to 3000 victories
Jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this excellent mark by means of his second winner of the night on his home trail, on the Strastia trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jokee that has reached this excellent mark in smooth jumps.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Long Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pat Iddery and Willy Carson.
The three-time champion of the Dettori Jockey, who won Ghayyar, said, "This is something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I'm very glad that this happened in Newmarket, because I've moved here 30 years ago.
It's not a big world event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free of business and I'm very unpleasant.
Dettours take applause when imposing the Preference after victory
Two Jocéas have reached such marks in barriers: the champion of Richard Johnson, and the 20-time pension champion, Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4300 victories for the recording career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career victory
Frankie is one of the best jokes in the modern era, and it is not surprising that he has reached the marking that so few have reached.
It's styled and strong, but it's his tactical slipper that distinguishes him from others in the weight room.
He was an excellent representative for jumping, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans in this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago to Epsom, he would have brought 6,000 winners if he hadn't only been a joke of weekends and big jumps!
And seriously, Frankie brought the winners in Britain most of 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energy character that's good for British jumps, but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this excellent mark by a firm rapid deck from the horse
From the rapid ends to rapid railroads, Frankie Dettori is a symbol of British smooth jumps for two decades.
They were flying and falling.
Many winners of great jumps, including its famous "The Great Seven" in Ascotta in 1996, but he also experienced an air crash and was disqualified because of the doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after a six-month disqualification, but he showed a huge force of will to challenge skeptics and return to form.
And he may not have finished for a while -- Dettori said earlier that he would like to continue to participate in competitions, at least until the age of 50.
Putin releases the head of the Administration of Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly fired his head of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of a trusted nearby circle of Putin for many years.
This 63-year-old was now appointed a representative for the environment and transport.
The statement from Kremlj states that Putin " has decided to release Ivanov from his responsibilities to the head of the Russian President's administration," but did not indicate the reason.
Mr. Ivanov has been appointed as successor since 2012, Anton Wyno.
Mr. Wyno, 44, former diplomat.
Born in Estonia Talline in 1972, he ended the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Ambassador of Tokyo.
Later, he was head of the management of the Protocol of the President and the Government's equipment, reports the Kreml website (in Russian).
During his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as Heads of State in terms of draft laws and control of how your instructions are implemented.
Putin informed a Russian television channel on Friday that Ivanov asked him to release him from that position and recommended that Vino replace him.
Are the smiles persuasive?
It's a move that confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest participants of Vladimir Putin, and, like him, served in the Soviet Security Service, KGB.
As the head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At the meeting with President Putin, which was shown on public television, both men stated that the head of the administration resigned on their own wish.
But despite the smiles on the camera, this has convinced few people here -- especially now, in front of parliamentary elections.
So that's the unpredictable consequences of any combating for power?
Not yet, no one knows.
The official statement, however, that a person for whom he once had been agitated as a potential president, suddenly wanted to manage the Russian environmental policy, was encountered with enormous skeptics.
In the comments of Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "I was true that in early 2012 I asked you to trust me in this very difficult position, even for four years.
Well, I was head of the President's administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov entered his position in December 2011.
He used to serve as Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He was a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the KGB State Security Service, as well as Mr. Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who arrived in the CGB, Ivanov was appointed as a Deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
It was once considered that Ivanov could be President of Russia after the second time of Putin, since the third term for Putin would contradict the constitution.
However, this post was taken by another closer participant of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister until he returned to the presidency only three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson was fired after the fight with the manufacturer.
Gibson was a participant in the show shots in L.A. last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, produced by series, announced his release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologised on Thursday before he was announced.
There were creative disagreements in the shooting and distinction in opinions.
I'm sorry that this happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how Gibson's character will be deleted from the show watching the team of FBI agents is expected to be done later, according to the statements of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who played the main role in Darma and Greg, was at the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love "Myself as a criminal" and I have put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years," said Gibson in his statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end, but now it's not possible.
I just want to thank the scriptists, producers, actors, our great team, and, most importantly, the best fans of whom the show could only dream.
It is noted that the show will be returned with its twelveth season on 28 September.
Mystery: Fish landed in Banfa's garden
A man from Banfa asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bane believes that 75 fish could be sands left with water.
Bain, living 500 meters from the sea, presented this scene in the Periscope in hope that someone can light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferi Crossing: Bridge is now connected to Pfeiff
The project of 1.35 billion pounds should now be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the north spring and viaduk Quinsferry Crossing, which means that the bridge is now connected to Pfeiff.
This is the first of the four slides between the veners of the plates, which are now approaching the end of all three pilloons of the bridge.
The Faith Bridge Section is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
There are 10,000 tons of concrete and 46 want bridges.
The project of 1.35 billion pounds should now be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of Economy, Keith Brown, visited the place today and was among the first ones who walked from the ground to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the Queensferi Crossing construction.
We are all witnesses of engineering art really an epical scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete were used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the viaduc and bridge slide is a virtual operation using extraordinarily precise acquisition permits.
In total, about 79% of all the bridge plates are now on the spot, concrete covering for the last section today in Rosate, which means that everything is ready to rise up on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: "The first removal on each bridge project is always a significant qualification.
In this remarkable project, it is the most contemporary construction art.
After installing the last section of the road cable and connecting it to the extending Northern Pilot road, we had to close the remainder in the northern, or the side to the shore.
This was made by a viaduk of the northern approach by 700 millimeters south.
It was a huge and very delicate operation, at the same time.
It was scaled because the viaduk was 222 meters long, weighing about 6,000 tonnes and was to be raised to a corner of a slope of approximately 3%.
Excellent, because the acquisitions on which the team worked were small — only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, it went very well.
Rescue in Moelfr Gulf: Three men 'happy to remain alive'
Three men 'happy to stay alive' after they were thrown out of the fishing vessel in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised an alarm at 13:20 on the British summer time on Friday after the team saw the event deployed in the Moelfr Gulf.
Three men tried to swim to a safe place, while their ship continued to move.
"We have seen their ship circled next to them and assumed the worst," said Moelfre Vince Jones, running a rescue boat.
"Fortunately, until we got down on the water, the strong wind took him away from them," he added.
Two men were saved through a local fishing vessel, and the third man for 60 years was found exhausted and plugged in a bow without a rescue vest.
They were all raised on a coast rescue boat and delivered to the rescue station
Jones said, "The three men thrown into the water were lucky they were alive and completely harmless.
The boat engine had an emergency wreckage, but somehow he was distracted from a man running the boat when she woke up.
Someone's been protecting these guys today.
Pokemon Go, worthy hunt for health and happiness
It's interesting to watch the world change.
The fact that adolescents and children are no longer outside to play, prefering to spend their free time looking at screens, was a complaint for many in the past decade.
Pokemon Go removes people from the couch and involves some physical activity.
The time in the screen was initially limited by television, then video games and recently by smartphones.
It's so great to see that technology and activity on the streets are not mutual.
I, of course, have in mind the full interest of Pokemon Go, the application based on the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (after a series of multifilms, cards and other responses).
Like many other pop-cultural phenomenons, all of this has lost its former relevance a few times before this new game was available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The launch in other countries was detained in connection with the mass response that reloaded the servers.
In the number of days, Pokemon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter had.
So how does it work?
In two words, smartphone players are going to look for Pokemons who are tracked by GPS and, as discovered, can be photographed (in your phone box) or captured.
The generation that played the game, as younger, joined in a slow interest, distracting the couches for search.
In the United States, the game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of " ordinary" steps every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which tracks 35,000 users, recently reported Washington Post that, within two days of the start of the game, the number of followers who daily exercised 30 minutes has risen from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who plays Pokemon Go, she just sees the primary data of the level passage.
Many healthcare campaigns persuading people to find 30 minutes, "rise from the couch" and "be active every day", did not respond because most health messages are boring and express people who seem unhappy.
However, the importance of physical exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the chances of cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to adjust weight, high arterial pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokemon Go is that it pushes people out to do what they love.
Thus, three grounds of health cover: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends in hunting.
As usual, there are boring dull ones looking for what they've got.
And yes, someone can hit the door.
So what?
There's been a breakdown.
Because despite the fact that the Smartphone apps, such as Fitbit, were able to monitor our physical activity earlier, they did not give us a reason for lessons, as this game gives us.
The news will come, and the use will be weakened in time.
However, the success of Pokemon will result in more games that will integrate applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simona Byles wins the gold of absolute primary in female gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the freak.
Simona Byles is insecure for all of this.
Dynamic on a resistant jump.
I'm not forced on the brew.
She's scary on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic Champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast risen to the title of the absolute champion on Thursday, putting a ruin between himself and the rest of the world at a persuasive demonstration under the remarkable Olympic attention.
Her total score 62.198 was sufficiently removed from the silver medalliest and companion of the Final Five team, Ali Risman and Russian Bronze Medalist Alia Mustafina.
Byles from the United States is at the gymnastical brew during the final of a female absolute primary of artist gymnastics in the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byles became the fourth sequence of the American woman who won the title of the champion of absolute firstship and the fifth at all, reputing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps any time.
She was crying when she showed her final overall score and her long trip to that moment ended.
This achievement puts her in the same league as very rare light athletes, such as Michael Felps, who raised their sports to new heights:
Byles spent the last three years, dominating in her sports, wining 15 medals of the world's championship -- including 10 gold -- with such remarkable programmes in their mixture of employment and precision that the Olympic Champion of 1984, Mary Lou Retton, called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen".
One last test was waiting in Brazil, competing not as much as Bajles and the rest of the sphere as it was between its and the burden of the above expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family's house in Spring, Texas, with a throat of gold medals, would be considered unreasonable expectation.
Simona Byles from the United States, left, and Eli Risman are hugged after the winning of gold and silver, respectively in the Final of the Women's Personal Absolute Hymnastics in the Summer Olympic Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Avg.
Byles earned the first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final accord for the good-bye party that resigned the coordinator of the National Assembly of Martha Carol.
While Byles insisted that she never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, that's not exactly true.
The part of its free exercise program — that includes its firm passage — is installed in Latin American music, which would come like the streets outside the Olympic Arena of Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandfather and grandmother, was a child-looking and opened mother of Coach Amy Burman during the visit to the hall where Burman was a coach, became a force.
It has not played any absolute competitive competition since summer 2013 — a threshold of happiness that should continue as long as Bailes wishes.
Although Mustafina had a small advantage with two turns, it was a mirage.
Gymnastical brew and free exercises — where Byles protects the championship of the world — are trapped.
It regained from 15.433 on the bear and ended with 15.933 on the floor.
Risman softly hugged her while they were waiting for the final account — pure formality — and the tears appeared around the bright red with the white and blue beam for the eyes of Bails, when the idea that she used to record in the album for cutting was implemented.
Risman's speech was a small place for the four years ago, when she shared the third place, but lost Mustaffina's bronze on the Tai Breyke.
This time, a 22-year-old captain of the team that the Americans call "baby" was far ahead.
She sent kisses to a crowd after her free exercise covered by return, which sometimes seemed to be questioned.
With regard to Byles, the 19-year-old viral tweet from the beginning of this week is now completely new:
Police: 3 victims in a serial killer were shot during auction of music in the car
Two women and 12-year-old girls who died during the most death attack in the first serial killer of Phoenix in the past decade were sitting in the car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to the reports of the police published on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and daughter Ellis, Malia, were shot on 12 June, when their car was parked on the road part, the authorities declared.
The criminal had made about eight shots from the gun, standing on the passenger side of the car and then hiding on another vehicle, reports the report.
The police claim that the triple murder is not apparently a result of the robbery, since a criminal did not take a wallet or $2,900 before one of the adult victims.
The representative of Phoenix Police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting instructed investigators to check if he had been related to four previous attacks.
Only seven people were killed and two others were wounded as a result of nine attacks in two mostly Latin American regions for four months.
"It happens in the housing area in front of the house," said Howard KPHO, CBS branch office, at the beginning of this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including brown Nissan at the end of 1990s, black BMW at the end of 1990s and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose witnesses that brought them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31 years old, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, died at the scene.
The Witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about being sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published the police's report on the shooting targeted by an empty truck half an hour before the three-hour murder, which was believed to be the case of a serial killer's hands.
The investigators found the bullets and pulled the bullet out of the seat and the pieces of the bullet from the engine.
The mother of a six-year-old child with a microcephalia: "It'll be better."
As most of the six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund’s microcephalia is the result of a genetic violation that his mother Elizabeth Pixivto did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign for that.
Which, in fact, is not true -- of course, you are signing it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund may never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized hospital.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were doing that," explained Pixivto.
Edmund's walking through hounds.
Edmund didn't sit down and crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't.
But it slowly passs some stages.
He walks with foreign help and rides the bike.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture Edmund made for "please sing me."
"We teach him the language of the gesture," said Pixivto CBS News.
But it is not just a common sign language, but it says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephalia may result in a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as cork and Zika.
The symptoms and forecasts may differ significantly.
It's too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those infected by Zeke's virus.
Pixivto recalls emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
Did I keep telling you what's going on?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a prediction for my whole life because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Pixivto has an inspiring advice for the mothers of children with birth defects due to Zik.
It's getting better.
You know everything will be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Silent rain, flood is the cause of rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The huge rain and widespread flood in Louisiana forced the Governor to announce an emergency position on Friday, with more declines expected to fall over the state until Saturday.
Many rivers in Louisiana and southern Mississippi have emerged from the shore and threaten the widespread flood after the extreme quantity of landscapes, reported the National Meteorological Service.
Governor of Louisiana, John Bell Edwards, stated that government officials were constantly in contact with local authorities, and aid has already arrived to the injured arrivals.
Mike Steel, representative of the Office of the Governor for National Security and Preparation for emergency situations, stated that there were demands for high water, boats and bags of sand.
Stil said that only Tanjipahoa's arrival invited tens of thousands of sand bags.
The danger of the flood remains in force until Saturday in the majority of the southern Louisiana.
The weather service stated in the statement that additional 3 to 5 inches could go into the area.
In southern Alabama, the flood was expected until Friday, since the rain continued to go to Mobile.
The Comith River next to Baton Rouge and the Amit River next to Dan Springs, both in Louisiana, predictedly had to establish a record of the water level during the past weekend.
Synoptic Alec Krautmann said that both rivers could flood a lot of houses in suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flood coming down in Assensensen was a threat, since these aired rivers would slowly steal to the lake of the Morpe.
The Tikfo River, a little south of the Mississippi state in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest of the ever registered levels at 9 p.m.
Rescueers were still pulling people out of the flood in the districts of Amit and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and a son, were among the rescued early Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62 years old, says that the waters of Beaver Crik, which are usually more than 400 feet from his house, were rapidly rising in the night.
He said that another passport who lived nearby warned him.
"We woke up and the water continued to come," said Hansford.
She's reached my belt level.
His wife told Hansford that it was the biggest inflammation she saw in 48 years living here.
Hansford said he and all his family had disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that the rescue officers saved all three with the army truck and delivered them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were hiding on Friday.
Crowtmann said that the flood was "producing quickly", since rain continues, noting that officials were considering the evacuation orders.
Crowtmann said that one observer near Livingstone reported a drop of 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Crowtmann said that the soil was oversailed by rainfall from the environment.
The strong rain and drowning of streets led to rescue residents from homes in Tanjipahoa and to dismissal in five school districts, the authorities stated.
The WWL, CBS branch, reports that Tanjipahoa adviser told about 200 warm homes.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, but both of them are now flooded.
The President of the arrival, Robbie Miller, stated that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven household animals in high water.
The shelter was opened in the city of Amit and the city of Hammond to accept those who were evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water begins to retreat," he said.
In the city of Hammond, the arrival of Tanjipahoa nearly two dozens of streets was closed because of the high level of water, and sand bags were available to extradite the inhabitants in hope that they would keep water away from homes and enterprises.
"The last large flood we had was in March," said the city manager Lacey Landrum.
It's on the way to become a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison District, the Chief of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacey, reported that the burden rain continued to go to the coast of the Mexican Gulf.
He said that several houses were registered as melted on Thursday, but none of them were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amit, lives in this area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen her before," said Tawson, and she still flys to the ground."
Mahage Brown, 6, "determined by bullets" remains alive after the shooting in Philadelphia
The police reported that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, registering the second shot in a 6-year-old city this week.
Grandma and grandfather of the child identified it for CBS Philadelphia as Mahage Brown.
Grandma and grandfathers say that Brown had received numerous fire wounds, including his smell, his leg, his arm and his stomach, but was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"It was a lot, his little body was solved with bullets," said his grandmother Delores Melandez station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in a critical state in the hospital and has experienced several operations.
The family told the station that he was expecting to be well.
He was supposed to go to the first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of the four people who were shot at in Jermantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29 and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be critical; two other victims were registered in a stable state, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot at the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old in critical state, reports the station.
Two other victims weren't in the car, and the police were investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Investigators report to CBS Philadelphia that there was apparently a shooting between several armed people.
The semi-automatic weapons sails, which were allocated to various instances of semi-automatic weapons, have placed.
It seems that it was definitely a long-term battle.
There were bullets on the street, on both sides of the coast.
Therefore, apparently, there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting," said the station Captain of Philadelphia, Anthony Ginaldi.
Many houses and cars in this area were also stuck.
No arrests have been made, and the police reportedly are looking at videocams.
Another six-year-old child, a girl, was impressed by a bullet on Tuesday when she played in front of her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby and Lori?
This is what I call a female olympic gymnastic group this year and for several reasons.
First, I have been on every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
Secondly, three gymnastics, Simon Byles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Hernandez, who have already inspired so many white girls.
The composition of this collective, supplemented by Eli Risman, who is a Jew, and Madison Koshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This gathering looks like America.
This also strengthened the black and Latin American female presence at the top of this sport.
During the last four years, a woman's gimnast number one was Afro-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabby were numbers 1 and 2.
It's powerful.
In the past Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic Champion, and America welcomed her welcome.
The world could now be witnessed by the three-time championship of the world Simona Byles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez who perform unexpected but still virtual gymnastical exercises.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American in order to win gold in a woman’s individual absolute primary.
And a colleague on Eli Risman's collection made a silver.
We are witnessing this type of sport, but it doesn't look like that in gymnastical sections around the country.
Simon, Gabby and Lori chose all the same way as Eli and Madison to form an olympics.
They are "final five" because the next Olympic Gymnastical Collection will only have four gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year of Marta Caroly's training.
But in fact, gymnastics are expensive sports, and the gymnastists are first trained in private gymnastical clubs supported by parents paying the value of training, equipment, travel, form, contributions to competition, hotel services (for trainers and their gymnasts and families) and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastical clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support the business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get everything from their training, and it's a dear and long-term responsibility for the gymnast families.
Amy Burman, coach Simona Byles, and Maggie Hannie, coach Lori Hernandez, both trained their sportsmen since they took the gymnastics.
We must create more acceptable at the price and accessible training for gymnastics to the communities of an insightless number of young girls inspired by Simon, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gymnastical fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (usually black and Latin Americans) and raised national and international championships.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve to learn and benefit from this great Olympic Sport.
Gymnastics develops the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the sustainability of exhaustive work, discipline and insistence for mind.
This combination has a positive impact on good health, success in school and work throughout life.
The inspiration of this collection will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and this is great.
Sporting is so important, especially for girls.
It's a great time now.
Thank you, Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women's Force in the winning of the Olympic Olympic Gold and for motivating so many girls of different origin to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Younger doctors have taken up further strikes after Jeremy Hunt's proposal was rejected
The ministers were hoping to conclude the dispute on changes by agreeing with the revised treaty with the heads of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of 37,000 young doctors who participated in the voting rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced the plans for the introduction of the treaty, saying that NHS was on " nobody land " and any delay that would cause damage to staff and patients.
The first younger doctors are transferred to a new treaty, which includes changes in working at night and weekends to improve services at an extraterrestrial time.
Dr. Ellen McCott, chairman of the Committee of Young Doctors, BMA, said yesterday in the statement: "Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that he will undermine the crisis of working force and that he cannot apply fairly to all doctors."
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors will be transferred to a new contract, progress is needed and time is over.
The WMA attempt to address the negotiations was encountered by an undesirable attempt to take action and sometimes by full silence by the Government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt has to act now, encouraging the introduction and respond to the fears of younger doctors.
If he does not, then the younger doctors are unwise that they are willing to organize the follow-up strikes.
The latest strike at the end of April took up some 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurses' receipts, while nurses and consultants were attracted to provide a replacement of doctors on the piqueting line.
The ministers were hoping to end the dispute on changes by agreeing with the revised treaty with the heads of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants a better weekend payment for 54,000 young doctors who will be subject to the treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS Employers, called on the younger doctors to stop striking.
Mortimer stated: “The strikes are low or nothing but are pressured on the team and services already working, and cause concerns, physical pain and disorder to patients, seats and their families.”
During the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Younger Doctors and with the Department of Health and Others, positively responding to their concerns regarding the role of custody and corporate information policy.
Workers hoped that the continued positive assistance on other important topics such as the distribution of staff, the flexibility of training, the additional training for those who returned after a break in career, the cost of training, the mutual recognition of the training plan, the academic vacation and gender disparities in medical payments were the sign of the seriousness of employers, Health Education of England and the Department of Health to comply with the conditions reached by WMA in November, February and May.
2 pounds per day may reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are going to use 2 pounds a day after the authorities recommended that it be given to more people and for a longer period of time.
The anti-controlling tikagrelor reduces the risk of repeated infection for people with cardiac diseases.
The prescription is already designated for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
The NCE National Health Service of the United Kingdom has advised people to give it for four years to continue to exclude the risk of heart and judicial problems.
However, now the NCE National Health Service of the United Kingdom has advised people to give it for four years in order to continue to exclude the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The heart attack occurs by approximately 140,000 people in England annually, and a quarter of them have another attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes result in accumulation of fat material on the walls of arteries and the formation of flashes.
If the bell breaks to parts, it may cause a thromb to block blood access to the heart and cause a heart attack.
And if the plate moves, it can move through the blood flow and block the bleeding to the brain by causing a stroke.
People who have already been attacked are more likely to get another.
Tikagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold by Brilique, reduces the risk by making the thrombs less likely.
The NICE instruction, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg tikagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the efficient methods of secondary prevention, about four people who have had a heart attack, there is another heart attack or a stroke, often with destructive consequences."
The fear of repetition may have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There are evidence that tikagrelor, combined with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of heart attacks and heart attacks in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
In pre-recommendation of the tikagrelor, we are pleased to have the opportunity to increase the treatment available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the efficiency and safety of the tikagrelor, especially the risk of bleeding, is limited over three years, the instruction draft recommends the treatment for longer than that period.
Cultural of PC ownership allows for prosperity in the Muslim regions
Ex-Mer Tower-Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from the post last year due to corruption, served as a thorough report of the Government
The culture of political correction led to the closing of the eyes, which turned into a widespread falsification of votes in muslim communities, on information from the destructive report of the Government today.
Former member of the Ministerial Office, Sir Eric Pickles has been criticized against police, electoral observers and city administration for ignoring the evidence of the election violations due to " excessive sensitivity on raciality and religion".
The former Secretary of the local communities, now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of the voters on religious ground was so strong that the police had to allow borders outside the electoral stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that the voters take the identity certificates to prove who they are when they vote.
At this point, the voters should only specify their name and address.
The report even suggests that unlawful inks be put on people's fingers when they give up their bulletins, to exclude, so that someone can vote twice.
It is necessary to provide best protection to the informants, said Sir Eric.
He called on the press to make more access to the documents of the local Council and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"It is not only aimed at protecting from fraud at elections but also to protect the local Government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that comes with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of a vote scandal in Tower Hamlets, East London.
Last year, the Special Court considered election issues, decided that the existing mayor Luftur Rahman had to be displaced from a long list of corruption and illicit activities.
The Court found that Rahman “cinicly distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and forced them to silence their critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman said, "He had his campaign, based on the duty of the believers of Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes, doubts had been raised or resulted in personality when a person voted in representing someone else.
Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed special concerns about the fraud by mail, in which the senior members of the Muslim community were reportedly pressured on people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, on the photograph, made several recommendations for the clearance of the voting system, including the requirement to bring his identity certificate to prove who you are.
His report states: " There have been evidence of pressure to vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, particularly women and youth, to vote on behalf of elders, especially in Pakistan and Bangladesh communities.
"There were fears that... State institutions have closed their eyes on such behaviour because of the excessive sensitivity of "political correction" on ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric gave 50 recommendations to cleanse the system, including to remove political activists from work with mail votes to stop the " collection of votes".
The report, at the examination of Teresa May, also calls for strong checks in the registration to prevent the use of a list of voters for immigration and privileges.
It is considered to require voters to submit a personal certificate before the vote.
Use unlaundered ink on people's fingers as soon as they drop their bulletin to prevent anyone from vote twice.
Implementation of systematic audits of nationality to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Enter a three-year restriction on requests for automatic mail vote.
Remove political participants of campaigns and activists from work with voting and e-mailing envelope.
Let the police have the power to set borders around the electoral stations.
Amend the law to facilitate the prosecution of intimidation under the Submission of the Human Act of 1983.
Make illicit photographs in the electoral stations.
Require only English to be used in the electoral stations (excluding Wales).
Strengthening training to ensure that staff forces voters to go to the box one by one.
Sir Eric attacked the city's police scaryly, claiming that it was "impressive" that no criminal charges were made after the Tower Hamlets case had been issued.
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corruption and illegal actions," he said.
He was found guilty of the lack of reasonable doubt — a criminal proof standard — on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the undeniable " checks for the bullet" of the city's electoral registration offices.
Sir Eric said: "The last year court order in the Tower Hamlets was a waking signal.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and hidden distribution of the electoral fraud and the state of denial by certain bodies threatens this good reputation.
Crazy bicycle analogs, Kate and other spouses of Olympiada in Rio
The Olympiada fans in Rio this week were mad at the French bikeman Pauline Ferran-Prevo, which appeared to be impressively like the Duchess of Cambridge.
However, 24 - year - old Olympic Games is not the only sportsman fighting for gold this summer, who can praise his own famous double, at least according to social networks.
So, in respect of the Rio Games and all the famous persons appearing on our screens, F. J.S.A. composed a list of Olympics with more than a surface similarity with Hollywood Stars.
Lover and wolf: Member of the U.S. Army team, Brady Allison, left, compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's bicycle trip, many people have hurried online to indicate how a certain shooter could be a superstar twin Leonardo DiCaprio.
The member of the U.S. Arrowman team, Brady Allison, became the cause of a hurricane in Twitter, after his images appeared scaryly similar to the star of Wolf from Wall Street.
And in fact, the shooter found out about social intelligence and admitted he heard he looked like Leo since he was a child.
"I don't personally see a huge similarity, except for vegetation on the face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly indicate even more this year: an impressive similarity between the British jumper Greg Razerford and the popular acter Neal Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Alia Mustafin, with her large eyes, is said to be an exact copy of the Cuban-American Singing Gloria Estefan.
In the South African swimming pool, Cameron Van der Burg was compared to the star of Hore Matthew Morrison for many years.
Going to more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is a "sports version" of the "Počal" acter.
Another long-term comparison was between Rafael Nadar tennisman and actor Josh Harnett, who could be administered by similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The silver sailing medalist from Russia, Julia Efimov, can not only be commended with the same burned skin and light hair as the actress Annalyn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the United States team, according to fans, looks like a “sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.”
Hard women: Hope Solo, left, and actor Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter, right, have the same forms of face and eye
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Creating theory: According to this user, there may be a reason based on a similar appearance of this couple
One Twitter user recently contacted the website to announce its admiration that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
In fact, the U.S. football star and the Dexter actress have incredibly similar forms of face and eye.
Other popular comparisons included Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the same smile of Laura Lynne's actress, as well as the gold medal of Gabby Douglas gymnast, who can praise its own beautiful broad smile that looks like the star "Have success" star, Gabriel Union.

We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to enter the air.
Last night we acted urgently to apologize to our audiences in direct air and our subscribers in social networks.
Let's make it clear that the comments of Bajron were referring to the speaking of swimming, not to it as personality.
However, it was an inappropriate and inappropriate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologizeed directly and tried to clarify his comment, saying that he did not think his words would be interpreted as an attack on the person.
'I would like to use the moment to apologize for the commentary that I made last night after the female estate,' he said at the Olympic Games on CBC.'

'No disrespect was meant, of course, and I am very sorry.'
The buyer of Primark insulted a woman who was shameless in the middle of the shop.
The buyers didn't know where to take a view when a woman was naked to sample pants in the middle of Primark floor.
What is worse, she took the way she looked in them, pulled them up and put them back on the shelf.
She continued searching and died four pairs of underwear in the Bouverie Place Trade Centre in Folkstone.
The Store Primark of the Bouverie Place Trade Center in Folkstone, where the woman was using tricottal pants before putting them back on the police
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at that time, said that after a sample of the underwear, a mysterious woman again dressed and left the store, didn't buy anything.
She said, "They couldn't believe what they saw."
Staying in the middle of the trading hall, she took a couple of panties from the vitrine, took off her own coats and coats and wore them.
"She didn't try to find a place to do it -- she was just standing there, embarrassing."
"Everybody got tired when she took off her pants again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same with the three other couples before she finally decided there was nothing that she liked, dressed again and left.
"It doesn't seem like she cared about, who was watching her, or that she thought about the man who would buy the coats she used."
The 33-year-old Jenny Davidson from Kent, said, "How disgusting to think someone's going to take home the coats that someone else was wearing and they were not washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I conclude that my staff was obviously trying to remove these clothes from the sales after she left, and so much better."
"I wouldn't like to come home with a new couple of female cowards and find out that another woman had dressed and took them off, and they were not washed."
The representative of Primark said, "Primark knows about the incident that happened in our Folkstone store on Tuesday, 9 August."
All the goods that we're talking about were taken out of sales.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks using a cow mag
The world around is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help you make it a little safer.
We talked to Ron Mizraci, master of the Federation of Magazine in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance.
Whether you're in front or in the back, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his weapons.
If they come back, according to Misrachi, the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and "free the fire line."
Then you shake a gun firmly between your arm and your shoulder before you hit them in the face with a free elbow.
Then you go knee in the smell, and while the attacker is squeezing from pain, you scroll the gun out of his hands, beat him in the face with a gun and go back, holding the weapons on it.
For the armed in front, the way to perform is to remove your body from the fire line, quickly grab the gun and turn it out so that the evil man can't shoot.
At the same time, put the weight on the gun and hit the attacker's fist into the chest, then turn the gun out of his cap before you step back and target it.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video to see exactly how Misracci does it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery, if you're not a master of cows, is to give your cash.
For the traveller, Yan Wright conducts its language in the most dirty places of Europe
The British traveller has subjected his immune system and a revolutionary reflection to a serious test, licking some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The leader and author of the travel books Jan Wright, 51, from Saffolk, conducted the euro banknote language, the Circus Piccadilli, the Unitaz button in the train and the Russian public phone to prove the power of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show to himself and us what it is going to do.
However, the experiment, which should become a film called "The Travel Guide of Lizuna for the Internal Force", gave some remarkable results.
Thinking of slipping a wash button in a train used by thousands of others may be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen shell.
During the whole European trip, Wright talked to doctors and medical workers about the increase of cardiac bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his licked taste was more than a bad mouth.
Wright became famous by the tests on the strength of his worm, traveling in the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From public seals on stations to the Unitasis Wash button, this task certainly tested its immunity system
In the film he took, he said, "When I was a child, I was totally concerned about my health, and I dragged many things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the movie.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test mast demonstrated the importance of a luminometer exceeding 4,000 units.
For comparison: just washed hands must be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after its luminometer was more than 4,000 units, while the washed hands showed less than 60
Wright and Finnish breast-producing producer Valio took a film on a traveller called "The Guide of the Travel of Lizuna for the Internal Force", which demonstrates the number of bacteria in various places, such as the toilet
In the movie, he said, "It's close to one of the worst things I smelled in the bathroom."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The Guide of the Lisun Travel on the Internal Force was removed with the Finnish breast-producer Valio.
The company provided the Wright of Valio Gefilus, which contains oxygen bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, with a view to acceleration of human cell bacteria and the development of an immune system.
The senior Vice-President Valio on breakfasts, juices and new categories, Nico Voorenmaa, said, "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and could explain the benefit of the probiotics at the same time.
We had a brain strike that ended the idea "Let's call Yana."
They claim that the interest in the health of the worm becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about foods, we wanted to put them in a large context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the wheat health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in the health of the worm is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary film, we have been able to provide more information to consumers in an interesting form.
I also think that the movie shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was a film director, added: 'Let's say that I would have lost respect for Jana if he licked some things I asked for, for example, the disgusting Russian toilet that was shown in the movie.'
Of course, some things were easier for Jana to lick, and some were pretty hard.
I'm glad that some of these licks have been able to record it.
During the 2015 Valio survey, 84 per cent of the respondents linked oxygen bacteria only to the good condition of the stomach and the stomach, and 58 per cent said that they used, at least sometimes, products containing added oxygen bacteria.
The Huligan family destroyed Saltash, the municipal house of Cornoull, before the expulsion.
The Huligan family left its municipal house with a loss of $50,000 after they were expelled for intimidating their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilkok were expelled from their property object to Saltash, Cornvol, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forced to expel from the property object, shocked housing cooperative officials found this property in the condition of requiring repair.
The walls were left with holes, halfs were opened, the trash was broken down on the floor and the walls were scratched.
The family is now moved and is supposed to live in a private apartment
Donna McAvoy, a settler in Cornwall Houseing, said she was afraid not to save him.
She said, 'It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like that.
There are many things that need to be raised because this property is likely to be known as not a very good aspect of Corneaulo.
This family uses a bad glory, and their name is a bad glory.
The couple had three sons who lived in real estate from time to time, and the police reported that the kingdom of the horror caused by the family included fights on the streets with baseball bits, intimidating inhabitants of nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screams, disputes and rumors.
Sceldon, 47, whose name was on the rent contract, received an order for anti-social conduct in June.
In several rooms, a house that could be taken down was found an old trash.
Poles in the house in which drugs were sold in the past were exhausted
The neighbours say they saw fights on the street and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Houseing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after they had provided a prolonged period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The relief was welcomed by the neighbors who said their lives were converted into a basic hell.
One said, 'They didn't worry.'
We lived next to them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we saw the police here is unbelievable.
'That morning we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here, we're not used to it!
Now that they finally left, it'll be great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall House's Neighbourhood Group, said that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and they regularly called the police
The garbage and old toys were displaced below the municipal house.
He added: 'It's embarrassment that the renter couldn't take any responsibility for her and her family's behavior, 'cause expulsion is always the last method of action that is considered by Cornwall Housing.
It was a very complicated case, since the behaviour was incredible, and their actions must have been terrifying for its neighbours.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police and members of the community of Devon and Cornoull, who bravely spoke to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that the association behaviour will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at a different time, but said that they all were a little more than 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the expulsion
Resettlement workers will now have to remove the breasts of the garbage that is surrounding the house
In 2014, the police carried out a search in the house and found more than 70 g of cannabis, as well as weights, respective belongings and 1700 £ in cash.
Sceldon was punished after he recognised himself guilty of class B drug ownership.
She stated that the money was paying for her son, Lee Skaldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After they were made homeless, Tanya and her partner are now living in Plimute.
The walls of many rooms of the house were spilled with graphites all over the surface.
The police said that they would try to expel the renters who were not subject to the rules of rental.
Angela Crowe, from the Devon and Cornual Police, said that this expulsion had sent a clear warning to other renters who continued to violate the rules.
'This is a message for those who feel that they can act without accusations of the prosecutor and those who are injured of such conduct,' she said.
Crime and anti-social behaviour will never be allowed by the police of Devon and Cornual, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Portuguese tourists came to shock when a low-flying military plane nearly touched the beach
In the city of Avira, Portugal, tourists who love sunshine were terrifying for their lives
Aeroplane P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force has flyed incredibly low
Air Force reported that he was conducting a training flight, but insisted on the lack of safety risk
This is the moment when the frightened tourists panic, while the low-flying aircraft spiked over the overwhelmed beach.
A military plane, flying nearly away from the touching of the sand hunters in Aviro, northern Portugal, is seen on dramatic records.
The resters jumped on their feet as soon as they became clearly concerned about the noise of the airplane engines, but without the possibility of seeing what's moving in their direction through the clouds.
The incident happened last night not far from the city of Aveira in Costa-Nova.
Daniel Fernandesh, one of the several vacationers who published a shocking video in social networks, said, "He flyed down twice, and there was a moment, at some point, it seemed to be broken."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was surfing and I swear, it was a feeling that the plane would just fall on me."
The tourists on the Aviro beach were terribly scared when the plane came out of the fog and flyed at an extremely low height.
The Portuguese Air Force stated today that the pilot of P-3C Orion carried out a training flight to find fishing vessels on the coast, and was forced to descend as low as it was the only way to verify them.
The pilot stated that the plane flyed a little below than it was usually due to the insufficient visibility of smoke caused by nearby burning forests, but the air forces insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires damaged the portuguese landscape of Portugal and took four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces made a statement today that the pilot had to fly so low in the context of the circumstances — the dense fog and the power of the forest fires that had worsened the visibility
The plane carried out a training flight, and the pilot was assigned to find fishing boats within the task
The HASSP system has been obliged to the public for over a year, but most of Petersburg's cafes and restaurants have not yet been introduced.
The verifications are increasingly active and the business is threatened by fines up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, in the Russian version of HASSP) - analyses of risks and critical checkpoints - compulsory to use food producers and carriers, as well as companies in society in Russia, as a member of the Tamonite Union (TC).
Business verifications by the Rossenger in accordance with those standards in Petersburg began in February 2015.
However, in the meantime, the officials are executing fines only for individual violations of the Regulation (see “Documents Absolution”...).
The non-compliance of the Regulation will cost a 600,000 rubles for the first violation and one million rubles for the second.
As a system that takes into account the risks of food and preventing them, the U.S.C.E. in the 1960s had been developed.
It was about the safety of food for astronauts.
The system is now used on all food businesses not only in the United States but also in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASSP has been operating in the TS.
The development and implementation of the business system had been four years (HASSP requirement appeared in the Technology of TS in 2011).
However, entrepreneurs themselves and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of that rule.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the standard concerns only food production, rather than restaurants, was explained by the head of the General Council, Elena Ceretelli.
Now everyone's trying to overcome what's missing.
The expected renewal of charter flights to Turkey, the end of August, the beginning of September.
However, they will not call for an important demand, since their target audience, family and children, is already preparing for school, experts are noting.
The Alliance of Tourist Agencys sent a letter to the Government yesterday with a request to authorize charters.
"For many Russian tourists, the issue of selecting quality and accessible sea holiday is uncertain because most of the placement facilities have already been reserved by the end of September," the authors noted and stressed that the opening of charter transport in August would not significantly affect the demand for the Russian marine tour.
As reported in the Northwest Regional Division of the Russian Tourney (RST), if Russian and Turkey airlines agree quickly, the renewal of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding when the charters are renewed, but not yet, this depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, aircraft can fly in September, even in August, if the tourist operators quickly build programmes and agree with airlines on ships necessary," said Paul Rumance, Deputy Director for Communications and International Projects of the Northwest Regional Division of RST.
He said that the possible renewal of charters was a good news, but it would not affect the marketing of forces, because the main buyers of charter tours, family with children, have already returned from rest and prepare for school or take a vacation in other countries.
During the season, single travellers and pairs buy tours.
Charter Programmes may rely on those who have the opportunity to rest spontaneously," said Paul Rumanians.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists, if it now gives very budgetary proposals -- 50 to 60 thousand rubbers for two, because there are people who are targeted to await very cheap tours," said Valeria Rosental, Director-General of Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, the main mass of travel is already planned to count on the availability.
Paul also believes that since there is demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be required, but there is no need to wait.
"For Turkey, starting charters now is a test for the next season," said Paul Rumanians.
"The opening of charters to Turkey is a positive news for the next season," Valeria Rubcevová agreed.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption of NDFLs laid down by laws of compensation payments within the approved rules relating to the reimbursement of damage caused by injury or other health damage.
The expense of workers with harmful labour conditions is provided for in the standard milk, p. 222 TCF.
However, the rules and conditions of extradition themselves are set out by the order for the minority of Russia of 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, free expenses of milk or other equal food products are produced to workers on the day of actual employment with harmful working conditions caused by the workplace of harmful production factors.
According to those rules, the Russian FNC concluded that, on the basis of paragraph 2 p. 3 p.m. 217 of the RF, revenues from NDFL are released from the cost of milk issued to workers in the day of actual employment with harmful working conditions in accordance with the Normas and the conditions approved by the order of the Milk Development of Russia of 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
The Moscow Gasbusterbank has lost the license of the CB.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia renounced the banking licence from the credit organisation of the Joint Commercial Bank, GASSTROYBANK, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, ACB GASTRAYBANK has conducted a highly risked credit policy related to the deployment of funds in low-quality assets.
The adequate assessment of the risks taken on the requirement of the supervisory authority and the reliable reflection of the value of bank assets resulted in a credit organization of grounds for the implementation of measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in suspicious transit operations.
The bank has appointed a temporary administration until the appointment of a competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive authority of the credit organization in accordance with federal laws are suspended.
ACB GASTRAYBANK is part of the Investment Insurance System.
Recall that the reimbursement of insurance to bank investors, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with Federal Law No. 177-FZ, on the insurance of the contributions of individuals in the Russian Federation banks, is 100 per cent of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million in the total of one cartridge.
The payments, according to the Insurance Agency, will begin not later than 26 August 2016.
According to the reporting, the ACB ' s ACB ' s assets ' GASSTROYBANK ' was 335 in the banking system of RF on 1 August 2016.
The londonian school girl who joined IHIL died in Syria
The Sultan Cadiza, one of the three British school girls who left London last year to join IHIL, reportedly died in Syria.
The Attorney Tasnym Acunji stated that her family had learned about her death in Raka, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It is expected that it was killed by a Russian air strike in Racca, a salary of grouping in the country, as ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultane was 17 years old, and, according to her family, she died just when she planned to leave the ruined war country and return to England.
"It can only be hoped that the only advantage of all of this is to be a supergrobe and the testimony of others, that these are the risks of traveling to the military action zone, to persuade people to make the same choice," said Akunji.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other students from East London sat on a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultana family said that she married an IHIL warrior in Syria and became a widow for a few months.
Reid claims that Clinton will remain loyal to Harland as a candidate for the Supreme Judge in the event of election
The Leader of Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reid, said he was convinced that a democratic candidate for Presidents Hillary Clinton would nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he was elected as president.
The Republicans of the Senate blocked Garland's approval, but as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The leader of the majority group at the Senate, Mitch McConnell, stated that the next president would choose a person who could replace the last judge of the Supreme Court, Antonin Sculia.
Reed said on Thursday at the conference ring that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland with some confidence.
Ms. Reid later said he didn't talk to Clinton directly about whether she was going to move Garland, and she was just making speculations.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "scatter the boat" with a new choice.
Harland is the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeal in Colombia.
Reid stated that the Republicans who blocked the nomination of Harland were the " privileges" and "payers" of the Republican candidate to the Presidents of Donald Tramp.
He stated that Tramp was unsuitable for the post.
Treats states that erotic calendars for "women, as well as men"
The Treats magazine collaborates with the photographer David Belmer to light the calendar for 2017, inspired by Pirelli 1970s.
However, instead of naked celebrates, they aim to find the next generation of top models for their calendar for 2017 with naked muses.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of naked models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I'm making it for women.
Apparently he thinks that the calendar is too.
"We need to return to the eternal and classical naked figure where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these pictures of a woman's body," said Shaw in a press release announced by the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful artwork.
Models can provide online or personal photos in open postings in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscows will give memories of unconscious Internet stores.
In Moscow, a memorial will tell us how to avoid being a victim of the Internet store.
This was reported in Rossenger, M24.
It is reported that department experts are preparing a memorial that will help citizens correctly choose the Internet store and identify possible fraud schemes.
The concept of this brochure provides for several sections.
These will be common information and legislative framework, the rules of delivery of goods, the way to protect their legal rights.
The annex will recommend how to make the claim proper and so on," said the Rosseur.
The memories are being completed to the present moment.
Later, it will be placed on the Rossenger website for Moscow, also planned to release a print version and distribute to Moscows.
The MID of Russia issued a statement in which the name of the second suspect was called for a diverssion organization in Crime.
Persons from Ukraine and Russia were detained to assist in the preparation of terrorist acts.
Among them are Mrov Eugeneus Alexanderovic and Zachéj Andrej Romanovic.
"They all give appreciative testimony," the report states.
Previously, the inhabitant of the Zaporogue area, Eugene Panov, who was detained under suspicion of the organization of terrors in Crime, recognized his guilt in the interrogation.
The FAS is going to punish Google by 438 million rubles.
The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service of Russia (FAS) appointed a administrative fine for Google Corporation of 438 million ruls, stated on the website of the Department.
"The punishment for Google for the violation of anti-monopol legislation was 438 million rubs.
We hope that the company will fulfil our decision and pay the fines soon," said Vice-Chairman of FAS Alexei Docento.
During the FAS investigation, Google found that the manufacturers of smartphones sold in the territory of Russia, the Google Play shop only provided other corporation applications will be installed on the device.
Among these annexes is a search system that should be placed on the main smartphone.
Accordingly, the corporation violated No. 1, 10, FZ, on " Protection of Competition " (dominant use).
We are confident that the implementation of the prescription will provide opportunities for the development of competition in the mobile PO market in Russia, which will be favourable to our consumers.
The Act on the Protection of Competition must be respected to all companies whose production is put on the territory of the Russian Federation and to transnational corporations, including," said the Chief of the Office for Communications Management and Information Technology of the FAS of Russia, Elena Zaeva.
The appointment suspects the conspiracy of 16 Russian shops.
The New Book Network has been punished for selling the book 50 days before my suicide.
The New Book Market Network is punished for sale of Stace Kramer "50 days before my suicide," reports the Moscow City News Agency.
The text of the book may be considered “provocing or motivating suicidal behaviour of children and adolescents”.
The Restkyn District Court reaffirmed the violation of the requirements for the distribution of information products among children and decided to appoint a penalty of 49 copies of printing products arrested by the management of the Rossenger.
The source at the New Book confirmed that it was Stace Kramer's production.
In March this year, the largest book stores of Moscow have been checked for the book "50 days before my suicide."
In Moscow, the Memorial of Ernst the Unknown will take place.
In Moscow the Memorial of the Sculptor Ernsta Unknown will be held in the evening, TASS reported.
The event will take place on 15 August in the Central Literature House.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the unknown in the United States.
It was therefore decided to organize this evening for those who wished to mention it on their homeland," said the Russian Jewish Congress press service.
It noted that this was important for the widow of Anna Graham and his friends all over the world.
For the evening, close friends of the unknown, including poet Eugene Eutušenko, artist Boris Messerer, President of GMII, Puskina Irina Antonova, director Mark Rosovski, as well as Minister of Culture, Vladimir Medinski, head of the Department of Culture of Moscow Alexander Kibowski, Deputy Mayor of Moscow Leonid Printnikov.
Previously reported that the relatives of Ernsta the Unknown planned to carry out a panachid on sculptor in New York, apparently by 14 August.
The final consumer blamed: Who actually buys plates?
Lone men of mid-year-olds love guilt.
And until you have made the commentary part of a rough insult under the name of the non-Single men of the Middle Years, this approvement comes from actual data.
YouGov said that so much of the renewal of the plastic is not caused by a bum among generations of two-thousands who want to invade the new material object, but by the medium-year nostalgia.
Those who have recently purchased vinyl album c are highly likely to be between 45 and 54, according to the data.
Furthermore, those who belong to the age group of 18-24 are at least likely.
This is also not just an act of acquisition of lovers - it is emotional: senior buyers have a little more likely to keep their feelings (56% against 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGov faithful?
If this blog was a television news report, the camera would follow me while I would go down the center of the Soho River Street, in a modest gray suit, and gesticularly before the stop, composing my hands and saying something exciting like, "Okay, let's see."
Okay, let's see.
While Soho’s heart slowly loses its charms and dirts — hotels, cafeteria, Paperchas stores have now filled buildings, some of the music stores with fantastic specialists have some remained.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene in which I am close to different people in some of these shops and try to evaluate their age and emotional attitude by monitoring.
Glazgo Stuart, 55 years old I was walking from Sister Ray (the data account: two young women, three medium-year-old men) to Reckless Records (the data account: eight medium-year-old men, one woman, probably over 20 years), in London on the afternoon to meet, and walking in stores to take a few hours.
He's a collector, am I asking?
"I suppose so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These tapes of the above (he sent me an e-mail, I didn't chase him to the house), they walked through the walls of his living room.
His reason for the acquisition of such enormous quantities of albums and singles is partially from its available income: he can now buy plates that he could not afford when they had just left, and buy the items he sold when he was young and in a mill.
"Mnogy of what I acquire is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, the things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates, probably introverts who like their own company, added, "I don't smoke, I don't drink too much.
It's my deficiency.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many clients he meets are in the YouGov profile.
He noted, however, the new wave of people under the influence of the media, people who heard of return and felt the obligation to redeem their old plates.
According to the conversations I have had, people have removed their collection usually in 1998 or 1999.
Clients who once sold their guilt to buy CDs now sell their compact disks to buy their plates," he says.
This may explain a boom among the reborn actors of a certain age.
What about the alleged emotional importance of the plastic?
It's enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that plastic stores offer comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Weese, some senior clients are particularly offended by the inadequate payment system.
Some guilty fans may feel shocked from the digital world and prefer to go to the continuity of known envelopes, objects that await memories of immediate youth.
"I think that sometimes it can be filled with emptyness or possession of material things as some kind of calm," said Wes.
Since I'm a collector myself, I have it, and I think many people have it too.
It's a simple way to take your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from a plate.
The ICM survey in April showed that nearly 50% of those who bought the vinyl album last month have not yet been obeyed.
The survey also found that 41% have a player that they have never used, while 7% of those who buy vinyls have no plastic player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably seem seriously confused by exploring the scope with the Bosanowa collectors.
The Trophy Aspect of Renaissance is what Johnny noticed, 42 years old, who works at Sounds of the Universe (the data account: three medium-year-old men).
"Someone recently came and said, "I don't have a player, but I want to buy a radiohead plate so that we can put it in a box," he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it's definitely happening.
More composing, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a recorder."
They're younger people, not older, they're less than twenty people who're just gonna know it.
Fopp, who has now taken almost the entire floor of vinyl, has a much more variety of audiences when I come.
There are couples for 70, tourists who photograph, teenager boys and women of mid-year-olds.
Although the atmosphere is less uncompulsory than the above-mentioned shops -- the last synth and sexy pop Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvization, it's going through the columns -- it's nice to see the diversity in its clients.
None of them seemed particularly lonely, but a tormental psychological injury was difficult to establish 30 seconds with someone.
Eleanor, aged 27, had been on Fopp for a few minutes, considering the various platelets available in the sale.
She's looking at the goods, not wasting money.
It does not earn much, according to her, so collecting plates is not a very appropriate option.
It's costly.
Listening to music on computer or other devices is just, but the beauty blames it is...," - it's floating into dreams with a sigh filled with love.
I don't know how to explain it is really incredible.
My last stop was a shop that, they said, contributed to the new generation of lovers guilty: City Fashioners.
As long as I create an illusion that I'm looking at the jeans bidding shorts, I'm watching a group of adolescent girls gathering around the Polaroid cell every minute before the father and his daughter begin to discuss the purchase of Crosley players.
The left is the staircase, which is set by Adel, Jeff Buckley, Amy Wynnhouse and Flitwood Mac: a mixture of modern style and classic, binding plates for any medium collection.
No one is looking, perhaps because they are just a decoration, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real massive guilt.
However, given that any attraction of attention to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into Soho's depths for a while, there is almost nothing to complain.
It is not surprising that the layer of the population who has more probability than most have more time and money than most is the layer that spends most of the money on luxury items, such as the guilty.
But while my findings indicate that the YouGov results are accurate, at least in Soho's stores, they do not exclude the existence of a large number of women collectors and guilty fans that exist in reality, in plastic stores and online forums.
These people may be working all the way in schools or offices.
But they obviously don't spend the morning on Thursday, walking around the shops of plates on Berwick Street, slipping through the plates and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old false leader who is hanging over the shoulders of no suspected men of the middle age.
Grenland’s Polar Shark — the longest spinal animal — video report
Scientists claim that the Grenland Polar Shark has the highest life-life of all spinals on the planet.
Julius Neilsen, who studies these sharks, states that the female record was 272 to 512 years old and five meters long.
The French Court rejects the proposal to dispatch shops in the Jungley refugee camp
The French Court rejected the proposal of the authorities of Calais to take down tens of self-profit stores and restaurants in the Jungley camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At trial hearings this week, the authorities of Calais said that the State should be able to take a total of 72 self-markets, where people inside the camp sell goods, cigarettes to energy drinks, propose shaving or selling tea for 50 cents (40) or simple foods for several euros in self-restaurance restaurants.
The prefecture of Kale expressed that these places should be discarded because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they have a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups, told the Court that shops and restaurants are vital, claiming that free food offered by the pro-governmental association and other groups does not provide sufficient food for the increasing number of camps.
They expressed that self - shops and restaurants often provide blood and free food to those who need it.
The Court of Justice decided that there was no legitimate reason to expel people who were managed by 72 self-government shops, but stated that the problems of the prefecture of Cale were "what was fully understood".
Judge Jean-Fransua Molla said that bacalees, cafes and restaurants played a lot more than just feeding people who are "with extremely scary conditions".
He said that spaces provided peaceful points for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened to bear was a child cafeteria Book of Jungles at a camp that does not work for benefits and offers 200 lunches a day, English and French classes and asylum consultations for hundreds of vulnerable minors without accompanied in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the children’s cafeteria.
A letter sent to Guardian stated that his closing would "be a catastrophe for those children, some of which are not older than eight years old."
Two charitable agencies, Assistance to Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants evaluated on Friday that the number in the Djungley camp increased and exceeded 9,000 people, the highest in history, after the rapid increase of the new arrivals during the summer.
Micro-ray libraries invite young free people to knowing programmes.

Britain is stopped on silver at regbi-7, after Fiji's Master Class allows them to take gold
The impressive series of Britain in Regbi-7 was disrupted at the final obstacle by the Fiji team in the final on Thursday night, when they were totally destroyed by 43-7 at the Deodoro stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master-class of ball, displacement, disposal, support of the game, runing lines and rough force to win the gold, their first olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not too poor comfort in the form of silver, the third of Britain for a day, and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic tournament on Regbi-7, in which New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa were conquered on their way.
Box's sick beating, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier the same day, could return to negatively affect them in the final.
But, despite anything, Fiji has won the best team of 15 people in such a form.
This may be some comfort for Britain — but probably not — that at least one British will hang a gold medal on the neck tomorrow — Chief Coach Fiji Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.
It was a certain trip to Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.
They lost only one here.
These strikes will hurt, but progress is impressive.
Fiji began greatly for fun by trying to take over the ball of Britain.
It was like pushing on a bus column for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up to 5-0 when Osea Collinissau divorced into the corner.
On four minutes, Gerrir Tuwai added another tachdown on the right flag, which was implemented.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great attempt to capture Mitchell has kept Leon Nakarv's man away from killing the third, but it only delayed Fiji.
At the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua made a tachdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarava added another one after resuming and the hour was still more than a minute... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravowa then broke through a few more huge attempts to overcome Britain and took a line to get a score.
Implementation led to 29-0 in a break.
It seemed like Fiji was born to play a regbi-7, while Britain still possessed a remembrance.
That's what it is.
Great Britain has made mass replacements for half the game, and they bought a fidgian damb... for all four minutes, which was good by the standards of the first half until Joshua Tuisov passed after a few brilliant fidgian interactions.
Dan Norton took an attempt for Britain by making a tatdown in the left corner so that the account would be 36-7, but the game was long on the way of the islands of the South Sea, whose fans were singing, wearing flags and dancing in tribunals.
It was impossible not to admire the full joy of the approach of Fiji.
Mata William decorated a fijian cake that did not need a decoration, another attempt in recent seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged, and the Great Britain fell on the lawn, totally defeated.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan from 20 to 5 in its half-final, and Britain had a little over South Africa in a tense half-final attempt to each -- the British implementation difference.
Kyle Brown's taking Boxs forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, using some excellent work of his legs, broke the line and screwed under the heels in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to capture from Marcus Watson, a brother of the 15th side of the team of England, Anthony, has won — and finally a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the coach fight against cancer
There will be no more exciting gold in these games, and that's something.
From the first move to the last, 220 heavy rises in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance of their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who dragged the weats, there were three votes in that boat, the eho of coach Robin Williams was always while they were trying to reach the second sequence of the Olympic gold in women's couples, the first women in the British sports analyses that reached that height.
Their superiority was absolute, and at last, it was their 39th unbelievable speech, again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant sportsmen slipping on the surface with the elegance of the swans do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
At each gold, the battalion of prepared arms that contributed to gradually increasing victories that are important, and there were no hands that were more important than the coach's hands, which had been diagnosed by cancer 30 months ago, did not know if he would live before see the day.
As he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had the cancer of the urine bubble, which is one of the things they could do, and they did it.
If they don't, he's going everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
She's changing your kinds of future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was lucky that he could start the treatment in the beginning of 2014, retaining the breakdown of the schedule as minimum if it could be the right expression in such circumstances.
I needed the pay, so I had to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked in a section -- 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they spoke enough steps.
That's how it starts.
The grebble itself is a journey, but it makes it a little more.
Their first thoughts after the victory were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little bit more than usual in trying to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, the captain of the artillery police with the Afghanistan service behind the shoulders, said, "I was an emotional disturbance this week, maybe it's a little overwhelming, but that means so much."
It just confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin, too.
It was fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be no one, so thank him very much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better training partner or best coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost any race in five years.
The couple has given a tense rhythm to which their competitors could never meet.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Denmark teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We've been a lot in the phase.
Helen called, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
Now it's very important not to get involved.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do something amazing.
We weren't waiting for fireworks today, we were just waiting to be able to grew well and get out and win this race that we did.
The couple will take a year to solve their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, on her own TV searcher for Steve Beckshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that this was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I was the Olympic Champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
The Government has extended the deadline for the destruction of sanctions
The Government extended the destruction of food prohibited to import to Russia by the end of 2017.
The appropriate decision was signed by the Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, published on the official portal of legal information.
The embargo on countries which introduced anti-Russian sanctions due to the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban has been prolonged repeatedly, and it is now operational until 31 December 2017.
Russia is prohibited from introducing certain types of agricultural products, commodities and food from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, sea products, vegetables, fruits and milk products were under ban.
The use of food imported to the country in the circulation of embargo is carried out in Russia since August 2015.
Only for I quarter 2016, about 100 tonnes of prohibited products were taken from sales.
Hunting the "prohibition"
There are rain and storms in Moscow on Friday.
Through the capital region, there will be an atmosphere that will bring down and reduce air temperature.
In the day, the air will warm up to 25 degrees of warmth.
Thus, a short-term rain, possible storms and wind blows up to 15 m/s will take place on Saturday night in Moscow.
A day is expected to rain with storms and wind breaks up to 12-17 m/s.
Thunderstorm rains are also predicted in the Orlovska, Kurońska and Vronneška Area, reports Days.ru.
The layouts are unlikely next week.
The WTO arbitral panel found that Russian imports on papers, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the rules of organization.
The import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia when entry into WTO.
"It is the first case when WTO has taken a decision against the RF," the official site of the organization said.
However, arbitraries emphasized their conclusion that the European Union had not presented sufficient evidence that the measures of Russia were " systematical" or "imaged a comprehensive nature".
Russia, in turn, promised at a time to adapt imports to paper and refrigerators.
This is mentioned in the Communication of the Mineconomic Development of Russia.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intends to join the World Trade Organization for Russia, which introduced additional restrictions to Ukrainian goods transit.
This is said in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times stated that the United States behaviour undermines the principles of discussion in the WTO when dealing with issues.
Similar statements were made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other members of the WTO for the refusal of the Americans to endorse for the second time of South Korean Judge Chan-Song Hwa.
As a result, Russia will not address WTO on Western sanctions imposed against RF.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
Now it consists of 162 countries.
Russia joined her in 2012.
The President's administration has changed the leader
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, appointed the head of his own administration of the former Deputy Sergey Ivanov Anton Wyno.
Vladimir Putin took a change in the President ' s administration and hoped that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and Kremlj.
In turn, Anton Wyno stated during the meeting that he considered an important anti-corruption work to be held at the head of the administration of President Ivanov and promised to cooperate with the Government.
Previously, the Notifications have been said that experts consider the situation with the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the position of the transparency and understanding administration and the reconstruction would not fundamentally change anything in the activities of the Kremlj administration.
They note that the leader who had been working at the President ' s administration had effectively built the AP.
Instead, the Deputy Head of Administration, Anton Wyno, a person who knows the specifics of the work.
In Poland, no fuel will be purchased from Gazprom.
The Polish oil company PGNIG does not exclude that a few years later the supply of gas from RF could become unacceptable for it because of the reorientation of fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Vice-President of the Polish company on the finances of Bogoslab Mužez.
His words transmit TASS.
"Maybe that we will not fully buy gas (in Gasproma), we are now diversifying our supply.
For the next four years, we will have the main directions of supply for the East, commodities from PPP Terminals and Norway," said Mužetz.
Gazprom is currently in the dominant position of gas supply in Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 had put it nearly 5.3 billion cubic gas at 30 per cent higher than 2015.
The share of the Russian gas giant in PGNIG procurements increased to 49.8 per cent compared to 40 per cent earlier.
Recall that on 22 July, the Polish Anti-Monopoly Department did not agree with the establishment of a joint Gazprom and its European gas-building partners, Northern Stream-2.
In this month earlier, Poland left the Gazproma request for 11 billion cubic gas on the Northern Stream-2.
This was said by the Vice-Chairman of the Holding of Alexander Medvedev.
The auction for the power of the North Stream-2 will take place in 2017, and in the autumn of 2016 the auction is scheduled on its cartridge.
At the end of May, the Gazprom has not yet planned to take any action on the intentions of the Polish party to renounce long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, said Vice-Chairman Alexander Medvedev.
He recalled that in the I quarter of this year, the Poles only increased by 42 per cent of RF gas procurement.
In advance, Gazproma added that the fact that the Polish PGNIG claimed to the Stockholm arbitration court was not yet to cease negotiations.
Previously, the Polish company has turned into a judicial institution to reduce the procurement price of Russian gas.
Recall, the Polish Government on Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Peter Naimski, said that the Poland authorities had decided not to extend the gas supply contract with Gazprom.
The Poland Contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expired in 2022.
In March, the Polish Government of Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Peter Naimski, stated that his country could reject the supply of blue fuel from the east.
He said that Warsaw planned to build a new terminal for burned natural gas Baltic Pipe, which would link the country to the Norwegian Shelf.
The “North Stream-2” provides for the construction of two threads of the marine gas pipeline with a total of 55 billion cubic gas per year from Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission has increased the number of observers around the Ukraine border with Crime.
This was reported by the first SMM heads in Ukraine, Alexander Hug.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, responding to the relevant question of journalists, "RIA News."
According to OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crime was not fixed.
Observers tracked the three passage points through the Russian and Ukrainian border.
There was a video on the landing airport of Uffa's passenger aircraft, As-42, which drove outside the landing bar by 400 m and fell on the left wing.
The video was published by the 360 TV channel.
The CHP took place at 4.30 by Moscow.
The Aviation Aviation Corporation Redavia has arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place that was not affected.
The aircraft was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa Airport is working in normal mode.
The CAP has been investigating the reasons for the hard landing of the aircraft.
UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in the rebel areas of the Syrian city Aleppo.
All sides of the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN Special Ambassador for Syria, Stephan de Mistura, considers the fact that happened unconfidently.
Such statements were made before the third round of inter-Syrian negotiations to begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN specialists have launched an investigation on chemical weapons reports in the Syrian town of Aleppo.
The first information on the toxic gas terrorism, apparently chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
The opposition then stated that in the area where the Russian military-transport helicopter had been hit before, the aircraft had dropped bombs with poisoning substances, but in Moscow these charges were called a drop.
Later, the Ministry of Defence of Russia accused the eventual opposition group Haraqat Nour Ad-Din az-Zinky.
Soon it was known that the toxic gas bombs were two.
This was confirmed by one of the victims of the BBC.
"A few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, started burning my eyes, it was hard to breathe," quoted the witness's word.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people died, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of the poisoning gas is confirmed by experts, actions will be considered as military crime.
The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, stated to journalists, " Proof that this really happened, a lot."
The inadequate use of chlorine for military purposes is prescribed in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CHOP).
Although all sides of the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, the human rights defenders identified 35 cases of the use of the Syrian army chlor against the moderate opposition in 2015.
The Aleppo situation is complicated that the shootings of its regions are conducted daily, and terrorists are obstructing the exit of the people from the city.
According to Reuters, the UN expects Russia to establish a humanitarian break in military action.
The current daily three-hour consolidation regime is considered "insufficient to help nearly 2 million peaceful citizens trapped".
Adviser Staffana de Mistura for Humanitarian Affairs, Jan Egelann, stated that a 48-hour ceasefire would be needed to be delivered to the city of assistance and evacuation from there every week of the sick and wounded.
"We have to send volumes of trucks in the area where roads are practically destroyed and the remaining are mined," said Mr. Egelann. " But the Russian delegation confirmed the readiness to sit with us at the negotiations table."
Consultations in Geneva between the representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a humanitarian break continue.
As Russia opened the humanitarian windows in Aleppo.
Under the ongoing struggle for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia announced on 11 August the introduction of a three-hour combat regime, which would act daily from Thursday.
The establishment of humanitarian windows is designed to provide conditions for the delivery of medicinal products, foods and items of the first need.
The decision of the RF Mino defence was adopted on the basis of an increasing international pressure on Moscow with a requirement to reverse military operation and to facilitate the resuming of the negotiating process.
A series of explosions in Thailand were killed by four people.
Several explosions were exploded in the south of Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attacks, four people were killed, injured 19.
The explosives' epicentre came to the city of Hua-Hin.
There were ten aliens, four-country citizens, no Russians among them.
The responsibility for the incident has not yet been taken by any of the terrorist groups, but the IMD has hurried to state that Islamists are not involved with it.
There are suspects that a number of people have been detained in the organization of explosions.
According to the preliminary local police, the scale and specificities of the explosions indicated that they had been directed against the leaders of the military country.
The attacks took place in popular tourist courts, including the Patong beach in the area of Phuketa and the towns of Hua-Hin, Trang and Surrat Tani.
After military junta arrived in the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few sectors demonstrating development.
In 2016, 14 million people have visited the country, which is 1.5 million more in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of attacks have already been detained, reports Colonel Crissan Patanacaroen to the police.
Until early to speak of the goals, he added, however, in the IMD countries, they are "convinced that they are not related to international extremist groups."
Too early to make conclusions, said Mr. Patanacaroen.
But we know that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact, local diverssions, and we are trying to identify the identity of those behind them.
The explosions took place on the birthday of Queen Thailand Cicrit.
Thai Hunta considers the protection of monarchy as one of its primary priorities, so the incident is probably targeted against it.
According to the statements of the General of the Sithician Police, the bombs were exploded remotely with a difference in half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on live streets filled with tourists in restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four deaths has become a Thai girl traded in street food.
The figures of the remaining victims are not yet known, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign States.
According to the Thailand Royal Police, four German citizens, three subjects of the Netherlands, two Italian citizens and Austrian citizens.
There are no Russians among the victims of explosion, reports the Rosturism press service.
Local experts also link explosions to the referendum of the last 7 August, where 61.4 per cent of the population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by the Constitution-developing Commission appointed by military hunta.
The voters had to determine whether they supported the system where the upper parliamentary Chamber was fully appointed military and had a significant role in the election of the Prime Minister.
The new system has been adopted and will be tested at parliamentary elections in 2017.
Recall, on 22 May 2014, a military turnover was held in Thailand under the leadership of the Priut Chan-Oca army.
To this step, he said, the army had begun the continuing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military established the National Council of Peace and Order, introduced a command and censorship, expelled the protesting and upper parliament.
How Bangkok was in an emergency situation
The Government of Thailand, headed by Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat, announced in January 2014 an emergency situation in Bangkok and the capital of provinces.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
Like two explosions went through in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions in Bangkok at the Monument of Victory, where one of the main protests had been held, resulted in 28 explosions, five of them were critical.
Explosions produced unknown on motorcycles.
The authorities strengthened security measures in the capital and attracted military forces to protect demonstrators.
In the Suho Logo, conditions began to be developed.
The Government was invited to agree on the auction conditions for the Suha Logh ' s golden landing with two key restrictions.
The auction is proposed not to allow a company where 25 per cent more belongs to foreigners and those claims in which the capital will not be at least 25 per cent of the publicity.
The industry does not expect the Government to overwrite the conditions, noting that many players do not risk a complicated and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August and held in October.
The Government has introduced a draft order and conditions for auction to the largest undeployed golden site in Russia, Suho Log (Irkutian area, stocks and resources - 130 million ounces), two sources of " Y " known to the situation.
The project was introduced on Wednesday night, and one of them clarified.
The Min приrodes confirmed the " Y " that the project was introduced to the Government.
The representative of the vice Prime Minister Alexandr Kloponin said " Y", that the draft had not yet entered the Officer's office.
"The auction may be announced in August, immediately after the Government's order, and taking into account the time for the collection of requests of potential participants (at least 45 days) the tender may be held in October," said the Minpriroda.
According to the " Y " project, two key requirements for potential participants were maintained in the option to harmonize the Ministries and FOIVs in July (here is " E).
The first is the presence of at least 25 per cent of the State.
Second, the refusal of access to auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on investments in strategic society.
According to the two set out in the draft articles of the FZ, as already wrote " Y" on 2 August, the auction may not allow companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent of the shares and above) to be tax residents of RF or have double nationality.
The Government has the right to invoke such restrictions, as the Suha Log is of federal value (supplies over 50 tonnes of gold).
The Min приrodes confirmed that the project " would contain restrictions to allow foreign companies," but refused to comment on the details before the Government ' s order.
The auction capital requirement was made by the Irkut District, spoke to the " E" in Minprida in December 2015 and later confirmed the Governor of the region, Sergei Levčenko, noting that it was sent to Minnature by his precedent Sergey Erostenko, " minor agreements on investment projects with "Rostech".
Who has lobbed a restriction on the permit of aliens, the interviewers " Y" do not clarify.
"But it is in a spirit of time: not to give control in the largest landing of gold in Russia on the basis of Western sanctions," said the interviewer "Y" familiar with the auction.
The Head of the Ministry of Sergei Donna said on 1 August that aliens could " go to the consortium" if the claimants attracted them "as a financial structure, technical partners".
The interviewers " Y " believe that the Government is inadequate to adjust the conditions.
The primary pretendent for Suha Log is the consortium of the largest golden producer of RF PAO PAO "Pole", the supervisory son of Sulejman Kerimov Saidu, and "Rostecha".
As the "Y" said in July, the partners created the SL Gold, where the "Pole" shares 51 per cent, the "Rostech" structure of RT-GR is 49 per cent.
In Roseche, they refused to comment, said " Y" in Poles, "ultimately interested in this assets" and have all the necessary competences and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be adopted after the announcement of the conditions," added Paulis.
The auction may be part of ALROSA, but the RF Government decision, the sources of "Y".
The possibility of participating in the Developing of the Suho Logo was stated by the Russian GV Gold and the Canadian Kinross, developing assets in Chukotka, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to the E, were not interested in assets.
The head of the Union of Gold Industrials RF Sergei Kashuba evaluated "Y" investments in Suho Log in $2,5-4 billion in December 2015.
Most potential claimants are not only intimidating investments but also the complexity of the project: the need for serious research of stocks and technologies with complex lifts, explains the interviewers in the industry.
The largest M&A deal was launched in the pension market -- the "WHIT Finance Pension Administrator" has launched a process of mergering four NPF under control.
As a result, the Gazfond Pension Building will create NPFs with a quantity of approximately 373 billion rubs.
About the launch of the procedure for the merger of four retirement funds, the WHIT Finance, the Promagrofond, the Heritage and the Gazfond Pensions, reported yesterday by the owner of 100 per cent of the OOO Fundations "Finance Pension Administrator " .
“Reorganization is carried out in conformity with the CB in compliance with the requirement for non-recovery of the conditions of the current treaties”, states the company ' s report.
The merger is held on the base of Gazfond Pensions.
As the NPF director notes, Oleg Beloshicki, the funds are combined with a number of challenges: the enlargement of the presence geography, the development concentration, the cost reduction, the best practice of each fund and the optimization of corporate governance.
He said that the consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of the NPF, Gazfond Pensions will become the largest player on the OPS market.
According to 31 March, the amount of retirements of the funds was above 373 billion rubs.
As reported on the Funds website, their owner ' s beneficiary, " CHIT Finance Pension Administrator", are now Anatolius Gabrielenko (with the controlled OOO owns 65%) and the NPF Gazfond (35 per cent).
However, the group itself had launched a much later competitors.
Thus, the O1 NPF " Future" group has swallowed "Stalfond" at the beginning of the current year.
This unified NPF is currently joining the funds of Uralsib and the Russian Standard.
“Merge into a single structure, in addition to reducing the costs, it is necessary to address structural tasks”, noted the NPF Director of the Future Nikolay Sidorov.
The active work on the consolidation of funds from April is also in the Safmar pension group, the NPF European, the Education and Science and the Regional Fund should be involved in the NPF Safmar until the end of the year.
In 2017 they will be joined by the NPF Trust.
"Merge of funds will enhance risk control, operational processes and expenditures," said the Safmar Pension Group.
The pause in the merger of the funds held by the “Finance Pension Administrator” may be caused by several reasons, indicate the experts.
Until recently, the NPF could not buy more than 40 per cent of the issue of infrastructure liabilities in which the group was actively placed.
Following the amendments to the decision of the CB in March this year, there are no more limitations for the regulator's requirements.
If necessary, the entire issue can buy a large player," said the Director of the ACRA Financial Institute Review Group, Yuri Nogin.
Several NPF leaders from top-15 for assets, another possible reason for a break, call the division of the scope of influence and, as a result, the personnel assignments in a single fund to be agreed by the owners of the group.
Yesterday, Anatolius Gabrielenko was not available for comments.
At the request of the " Y" NPF " Gazfond" also did not respond.
Although the consolidation of funds is a labour and inferior event, this decision will be justified at a long distance.
As noted by the Advisory Director of the Pension Partner Sergei Ocolesnov, Gazfonda Pensions has less fluids, the accession will allow the stabilization of the other group funds.
This will require better experience from the NPF " CHIT Finance " and " Promagraphonda " in the construction of distinct OPS sales, as well as the use of more modern P.O.
The CB requirements for the processes and staff of NPF are continually increasing, so duplication of infrastructure in four funds with one investment is not appropriate, considers the Director for Corporate Reviews, Expert RA, Paul Mitrophanov.
"The effect of reducing duplicate functions will clearly cover the possible cost of association," said Mr. Mitrophanov.
Four Sergei Okolesnov funds are estimated in 30 to 50 million rubs.
"The expenses to the content of four funds are about 400 million a year, with a medium-term consolidation, to reduce the budget in reality," Mr. Okolesnov was sure.
The Russian procurement came up with the best Disney movie Pete and his dragon.
Beautiful New Zealand, a loving dragon, a familiar history and songs in the style of contras to believe in old - fashion magic, ELENA CROWZUN believes.
A frightened baby picked up a dragon that became a human baby and a gentle nanny and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honor of a puppy from a book of tales, plays with him asleep asleep.
Six years later, he was grown and bound up, no longer distinguished from the other skilled forest sorban - Maugli.
In such a form of Pete and discovers a red-headed woman, Yeager Grace (Bris Dallas Howard), while the Brigade of Gavin (Carl Urban), her husband, is aggressively declined by the forest.
Now she will not only have to believe in the existence of a dragon, but also to help save him.
Pete is running an accelerated course of being human in the surroundings of idillical Americans wearing cowboy shirts, the moral code in the heart and smiling more blind than in any advertisement.
No character appears and does not act too bad to really hate or fear the observer.
Even Gavin, who had discovered a hunt for a non-type resident of forests, far before an unfinished evil man.
The huge floating dragon has also become unsafe, with a good buldogue, airline wings and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon screams fun, screams, and, unfortunately, it doesn't say, but it's always to be smoothed, and it's very different from all known movie dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of maintaining such a high degree of emotional inclusion that in the most tense moments, they start crying desperately in three ways not only small audiences but also adults.
Amazingly good and minor Oaks Figley as Pete who breaks between the possible family and the real friend.
And Robert Redford virtually issues a canonical grandfather who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did the director David Loury manage to take a fantastic sweet remembrance of the forgotten Disnei film, Dracon Pete, 1977, medium-sized from his nose to the tail and remembered only the mix of animation and the game movie, and make it the most mental film this summer?
It's a miracle that helped.
In his original picture, Laurie took only two things: Pete and Dragon.
There are musical numbers behind the board and most of the strange jokes.
This good story reads the characteristics of the Bambi, the alien and many other sweet hearts of children's paintings.
The Disney study continues successfully to expand the gallery of high-quality remnants of the 21st century.
Of course, Pete and Dragon isn't as amazing as the same "The Book of the Jungle" and there's no skilled thief in Kate Blanchett as a Machecha in the new "Soulke".
However, this naive film has been helping to believe in miracles and good in the best disney traditions.
By the way, the keys to the Disney's magic castle, the director Lourie will receive again for the artistic film adapthation of the story of Peter Pene.
A new ambitious project on not an adult boy on James Barry's so-called story was made by David Lawrey and Toby Halbrooks.
The journalist of RBK, Alexander Sokolov, will be charged with a new charge
Advocates of the RBK journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of the organization of the extremist structure, stated that the prosecutor had found insufficiency in their defence.
The fact that the prosecutor had made a presentation, we learned from investigators literally yesterday.
We have been scheduled to participate in the court meeting on the limitation of acquisition of criminal materials, but the meeting was not eventually and the investigators informed us of the presentation issued by the prosecutor," the RBK said to the lawyer of Olga Dinze.
She explained that the prosecutor had indicated to investigators that the qualifications of the case and the collected material were incompatible.
The investigators will now have to remove the gaps in the evidence base and make Alexandr Sokolov a new charge.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (UK) will appear in the case, or the same will remain, but with other arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze has been clarified.
As said "U", Alexander Socolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
The current year was reported in June that the result was excluded from the accusation of the RBC journalist of the formulation of " discharge of political situations towards instability" and "adjustment of power in an illegal way".
ACLEXANDR ZILBERT lived the Olympics' life in the Olympic village, inspected the house of the Russian gathering, had lunched in the local dining room and even delivered WADA test after that.
It doesn't seem like life's going on here for a second.
Even at night.
The latest starts sometimes end at midnight, and then the sportsmen need another hour or two to return to the Olympic village.
Furthermore, the settlement and displacement are conducted without delay, since some athletes are finishing their performances and leaving Brazil, and some are, on the contrary, just coming here.
Well, at 7:30, the heads of all the Olympic delegations are drawn in one of the temporary tents.
In these meetings we usually discuss some operational house issues,” said the head of the Sports delegation of the Russian Igor Kazikov team. - Although the house in which ours were placed, consider the sampled one of the first, and showed all the verificationers, even in it, there are some misunderstandings.
Well, with the hot water, I'm sorry, with the shoe.
We've been fighting for cleanness for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the cliners started coming, but they just pushed some kind of substance on the floor, and that's all.
They have poles, you see, some innovation.
Moll, you can't wash them humanly.
We know these poles, laminate ordinary!
In general, the Clining Company's changed and now it's okay.
The Olympic village is such South Boothovo, a bedroom frozen on the one side of the mountains, the other is an impressive row, a water-filled area.
Well, for security, there is still a two-foot iron fence walking along.
Totally in the village, up to 17,000 people can be placed in 31 apartments.
One of the 18th floor buildings hangs a giant Russian flag -- this house is fully given to our collection needs.
If you look at a small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems must be the most vital for the national team.
There are two statements at the registration station: "Please don't throw a paper into the bathroom" and "I'll take a gift of the badge.
The stand itself drowns in the tracts.
Their cheerful flower contrasts with the titles of the brochure: "The Memorial of Infectious Diseases for Rio de Janeiro", "The first aid in drowning, infection, infection, loss of consciousness", "First help at fire, warm blow, fractures and bleeding".
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example, " Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent treatment.
Nevertheless, a favourable outcome does not all.
Of course, there is a medical centre in the site of Russia, which is ready to provide qualified assistance to the homes at any time, including a relaxing and sports massage.
On the contrary to the Medical Centre, our delegation's headquarters.
Besides the door, the inspiring poster, "We'll win!"
And, of course, the verses:
All arguments are absolute crap!
They believe only those who fear.
Less than us, the sweeter the taste of victory, the Russians don't retreat, and they don't break!
And for the greater elevation of the spirit, the announcement is: "Dear brothers and sisters!
On the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and the entire Russian Cyrilla, the spiritual care of the sportsmen of the Olympic College of Russia has been carried out by the protoyers of Andrei Vladimirovic Alexejev.
Procurement and other requirements can be made on the phone...
In general, there are meditation and religious rituals in the village for representatives of all religions.
Well, the Russians, in a privileged position, have their own clock.
With regard to the loading of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth, I decided to go down a staircase that is recommended to be used during the fire.
And in the darkness he stumbled about the bodies on it.
Apparently, they were sleeping collaborators of the new Clining Company.
I suppose at any time they were willing to wash innovative fields, they decided to set a quiet time right on the cold steps.
At the fourth floor, I was waiting for a meeting with a long friend, Vitalia Fedorovich Dubko, a coach of our batutes, leading them to the Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his educator, the champion of Europe, Jana Paul, kindly agreed to show his rooms.
There's nothing to complain about, but it's not critical.
Sanuzel is one in four, but it's space.
The closet, of course, is funny, from the tissue, doesn't cause confidence, but things can be put on.
"No, well, you pretend they're done with tea!" - she's hand-sharing the tennisman, Lightlan Kuznecov, who met me in the main dining room.
It is called the principal, at least because it represents the space of 2,7 thousand square m and is ready to take at the same time 5,000 visitors.
There's 60,000 bucks out for the day.
The options of the menus are "Best of Brazil", "Pears of Peace", "Asian Food" and "Pice, macaron products".
The latest option, as I've seen, is very popular in our freeboles.
I didn't find soups in any of the giant restaurants.
What kind of soup?
It's good that I took the Chinese with me.
And a tea pig.
But in fact, for you to understand, we've got a lot worse food on the board.
There's something you can choose, despite the unbearable uniformity.
I've personally chosen a pair and a tomato sauce.
A table with its name in three English, French and Portuguese, as well as the food value of the product and the presence of allergens is available alongside each dishes.
Well, I'm sure it's been a bit.
I don't even understand why this is the queue in the local McDonald's.
We can say "heat" sportsmen from the restaurant are waiting for our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They are deceived by a victory that wins a shirt.
They're provoking, you can say!
To receive a gift, you need to answer at least eight questions from ten.
There's a question in Russian! - a WADA girl attacked me.
But I didn't attack it.
I mean, I'm in a patriotic stroke, of course.
The situation has already increased on the second question, "If I have received a notification of the doping control, should I immediately go to the Doping Control paragraph?"
I stopped at version B, "No, I have one hour."
I lost, like, caution.
Forgot that WADA doesn't have to expect weaknesses.
Anyway, we need to show up right now.
Well, at the seventh stage of the Victorine, my situation has become critical.
I somehow thought that if I would be difficult to maintain a balanced diet because of my weighty schedule (and, by the way, hard!), I could use bio supplementary supplements to get "supplementary nutrients to improve my productivity".
No, they won't!
More specifically, the response was made that it was not categorically prohibited, but it was urged that several proposals were rejected.
It's not fair to WADA!
What's up, Russia?
There's no way behind Ethima, Isinbayev and all of our bloody team.
So I concentrated on the last time, and I won an unfortunate shirt.
Know what it says, ours!
In a victory mood, I went to a gym center in the neighborhood.
He got involved in the training accounts.
It's 250.
It was surprised that no Russian sportsman had been found in this accumulation of russian tracks.
But maybe it's right?
Let someone who can't play is trained!
There's one of our boys sitting in the nearby polyclinic.
In line to the oclist.
Don't worry, don't be a shooter.
In the polyclinic, however, as in the entire village, wherever a swimming swimming, the condom is hanging.
It has an encouraging call: "Please with a condom!"
It remains only to rotate a rail that resembles the hand of the door castle, and the condoms made from the natural Amazonian lattex willingly fall out of the apparatus.
I took myself, for memories.
The sportsmen won't get away, they've got 450 thousand.
For the holiday and celebration of the Olympic village, there is a whole entertainment center.
In addition to it, an acquaintance table reminds that the International Olympic Committee is spending $3.25 million a day in various ways.
The Centre is flooded with video games, billards and tennis tables, football and hockey and some strange devices like video trainers.
What is this? - I'm interested in a friend in the form of a Ukrainian toy that actively uses a wild toy.
Of course, you could just say that he doesn't want to talk to a person in the form of Russia's assembly, yes, and all.
By the way, there are some strange circumstances in the eyes of the yellow-blue boys.
The most playful group is turned out.
It takes not less than three hours to get around the entire village, looking into every corner of it.
But if you are not going on electrical drives, you will also be opened by the Canadian house with salmon at the entrance and the tent with the reconstruction bathroom, and the ticket office, and the laundry, and the chimney cleaner, and the flour store, and the store with the goods of daily consumption, and the e-mail with unique marks (only you can't wait for a row of Chinese philatelists), and the bank, and the bureau of findings, and the photokiosk.
Later at night you will sit next to the olive tree hanged with colored tapes in the memory of those who left this world with friends and relatives of athletes.
And you'll be under the accommodation of a car that dissolves the liquid to kill the insects, thinking about eternal.
I mean, the olympic movement.
Which doesn't stop in this village for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world kept his breath on watching the Australians almost punished the American Dream Team, the true cheerleaders went to the network.
Not a lot of people know that the news that Inna Deriglazova won gold at the XXXI Olympic Games, I got first.
Maybe I'm even the only Moscow who saw it happening, without counting on those, of course, who watched the competition at Carioca that night.
Only a real cheerleader can understand that.
Here's the deaf Moscow night.
The neighbours from the bottom -- as always at night -- wake up and start wakelessly, but very loudly yelling at each other.
And threatening to move the furniture.
There's no time to go to the market and buy, as the wardrobe asked, a new one.
There's nothing understood in the television schedule, so I just kept the Match channels controlled, the First, and in any case the Russian, although it's almost meaningless.
"Russia" is a family of repeats, all sports are somehow in records.
It's where the series are transmitting directly.
Hope, of course, at "Match" all night, a young man screamed in the news releases first about the great semi-final of Deriglaz-Shanaeva, then about the coming fight for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead, U.S. basketball -- Australia.
By the way, I can't say anything wrong about this decision.
The Australians were equal, the first half of them even won.
They've been placed out of their own size of Americans.
As a result, it has been lost, but as is now expressed, the basketball olympic tournament will no longer be previous.
It's all good, but there's a fight with Dee Frances and on the screen without change.
In light panic, I'm starting to leak the channels.
It feels like it's the second time.
All right, let's go deep into the cables.
There's no mathematical spectacle on any of themes.
And, in my sense, the fight is about to start.
Some sports sites don't make me happy with text and tweets.
The road surfing gives an unexpected, but brilliant result.
The First website appears to have direct technical transmission of all the competitions that are being held at this time.
I'm calling for fighting, getting a fight for gold.
Deriglaza is greatly contradicting, moving forward in the shoes, and it is obvious to start dragging time.
The Italian woman plays almost all the bullets.
Our one point ahead, up to the end of almost two seconds.
Dee Francesca is thrown into Deriglazov, but it's over, the time ends, the Italian woman's punching.
Victory!
A few seconds later, the Olympic Messenger on the phone reports about the fourth gold medal.
Apparently, I'm the first one who saw it with my own eyes.
Intelligent, faithful, participating.
The Spiritual Muslim Management (DUM) of Tatarstan denied the use of Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, DOM had pledged to conduct Friday preaching only in the tatar language to force young tatars to learn their own language.
The Office claims that it is "none at all" the rights of muslims of other nationalities.
In some machetes, Casani believes that the tatar language does not understand up to 60 per cent of those who are foreign students, migrants and tatars themselves.
Mymas are afraid that their tatar preaches will not come to the whole audience.
Yesterday, DUM Tatarstan was unanimously decided to conduct Friday preaching in the swords of the Republic only in the tatar language.
As Tatarstan's muftium Camille Samigulin said, this should be an incentive for young tatars to learn their own language.
"For those who say "weighed," we intend to organize tatar language lessons absolutely free," Mr. Sammulin promised.
He added that “decision has already entered into force” and today, in all the mosques, the preaching “will be already in the tatar language”.
He reminded that the DUM of Tatarstan issued the Schura magazine with typical Tatar languages.
I have, who speaks not well in Tatar, "may be prepared according to it. "
TATARSTAN MUSTUES to combine over thousands of income in all the municipalities of the Republic.
According to the muftium, the Friday preaches are conducted only in the tatar language.
At the same time, in Kazani, a number of swords had been used mostly in Russian.
In particular, as the muftium indicated, it was practiced in the Burnay Machete, the Zakabana and the Eniler.
However, Mr. Muhammethin emphasized that the leadership was to enable all students to own both public languages of the Republic, regardless of nationality.
"Nothing of any disturbance to the Muslim Netatar can be said," Mr. Muhammadshin emphasized that the preacher itself "is not a mandatory, essential part of the massage."
At the same time, the apparatus will continue to be read in Arabic, and the machetes will continue to preach and learn Russian.
At the same time, Rafik Muhammathin said "Y" that there was no serious threat to tatar's sword exhaustion.
In addition to Russian and Tatar, other languages, such as Uzbek or Tadjik, are not used in the preaching work in the Republic.
DM decision was actively supported in the World Congress Committee of Tatar (WCT).
The head of the Vietnam Rinat Zakirov said, "A: " Macheti is an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the tatar language left this sphere.
He noted that the conduct of the preaching in the tatar language was “the desire of the owners,” but in the SBI “will be considered correct”.
Inquired "Y" havemas who have been preaching Russian are willing to fulfil the DM decision, but they believe that they will have difficulties with the understanding of the priests.
The sandwiches are both the tatars and the Russians.
Many don't understand the language.
Of course, they'll be sad.
"We'll have to restructure," said the Burnay Machet Farhat Muvletdin's.
He said that the preaching in Russian is even closer to many tatars, since “the Russian and schools and in children, the radio is everywhere. ”
However, he believes that the machete can continue lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held in other days.
We rely on Allah.
Allah will show a way out of this situation."
But about 60 percent of us don't know the tatar language.
These are the Uzbek, the Tadjiks and the Azerbaijans.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
"So we've been four years moving into Russian," he says I have.
He believes that in the tatar language, the preaching will "may come to a closer circle and not reach the entire audience."
But we will obey the decision of the captive.
Just the result of the preaching will be different.
But time will show.
"For example, it will be easier for me, because the tatar language is my native," Gabdullah Galiullin concluded.

The Russian copper company (RMC) is willing to take social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMC took up the modernization of one of the oldest and environmentally dirty enterprises of the country, the Karabasian Mediterranean Combination.
The Karabasian Mediterranean Factory was established by the English shareholder society, headed by Leslie Urkworth in 1910.
At the Soviet time, it was an industrial business that was important for the economy of the country, and it actually provided the whole city's life.
However, in the 1990s, production was stopped due to financial problems, which led to serious social problems in Karabasha.
In 1998, it was decided to renew the work of the Karabasian Mediterranean Combination.
One of the main issues of the Karabash factory was also needed to be addressed - environmental.
By the beginning of the 2000s, Karabash was already sadly known as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation in Carabashmedi began to change in 2004 after the company was transferred to the Russian copper company.
The company began to modernise production, which has gradually reduced environmental burdens.
This was noted recently by the Governor of the Chelabin area, Boris Dubrovski, who visited in the first numbers of July the Carabashmead.
The head of Southern Ural referred to the great changes that have occurred with the company since the Carabashmad became a group of RMCs.
The main event for the modernization of the Carabashmedi has been the construction of a new serum acid to capture up to 99.9 per cent of metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Medical Company, the amount of investments in the project was approximately 7 billion.
The next phase of modernization of the C.O. Carabashback is the reconstruction of the converter perimeter.
The replacement of three converters, smokers, gas tract is scheduled at the end of 2017.
The cost of the project was 2,5 billion.
Furthermore, at the end of 2016, new purification rates are planned to be launched by 1 billion rubs.
In turn, taxes to the city of Karabas will also be raised.
During the entire time of implementation of the Tominian GOKA project, from the beginning of the construction and before the second row operation, the federal penalty will receive 8.9 billion rubs.
After the introduction of GOKA, the tax income to all levels could be 80.9 billion rubs.
During the year of production in the Varen region, the budgets of various levels were listed by 346.3 million rubs.
And that's the first year.
"The longer the business has been working successfully, the amount of calculations may be greater," added Valerius Ulanovski.
The RMC stated that taxes from the Micah GOCA were approximately 1 billion rubs in 2015.
However, the participation of RMCs in life and development of the territories of their presence is not limited to tax deductions.
RMC companies help to repair and maintain schools, children's gardens, sports facilities, to build cultural and entertaining facilities, to promote territories.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian copper company in Karabasha became capital repair, and in fact, almost the full restructuring of the N9 child garden to 95 teachers.
The building built in 1960 was in an emergency.
Also, in the territory of the RMC Arena, the landscape with artificial ribbons, underground and overground parkings will be placed on 600 machines, cafeteria and sports stores.
The RMC Arena will allow for visible sports activities at the international level.
However, the main objective of this project is to make exercises in physical and sports in comfortable conditions available to the Chelabinski residents, primarily for children.

WSJ: The United States considers the introduction of sanctions against RF due to the invasion of democratic servers.
Officials of the United States are considering the introduction of new sanctions against Russia in response to the invasion of the servers of the Democratic Party, states the Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
For sanctions, the U.S. President Barack Obama would be officially accused of the attack on the servers of Russia or supported by the Russian hackers.
According to sources, the FBI and other US specialities are practically convinced of the involvement of Russia in cyber-attack.
WSJ notes that U.S. usually prefers not to indicate the name of those who have hacker attacks.
The exemption consists of the invasion of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database in 2014, which was officially liable to the CDD.
However, last year, Obama issued a decree that facilitates the introduction of sanctions against those who implement or assist cyber attacks.
It was initially directed against China, but could also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process of sanctions may be long, in the edition.
Even if the officials have concluded that the hackers acted with the support of Russia, before decision on disclosure of information, they would have to raise the possible consequences.
They need to determine whether there was such a serious incident that would make the tension bilateral.
The Administration of Barak Obama has previously been reported to allow the use of sanctions against the State whose hackers broke the servers of the Democratic Party ' s naccommittee.
The WikiLeaks website published an electronic mail of the National Democratic Committee.
The media reported that the hackers working with the Russian authorities may be involved in a breakdown.
Such communications were called absurd in Kreml.

The Effect of Anime Snapchat is criticized as an Asian cartoon
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some viewers say it's racially intact.
With the Linza Snapchat tool, approximately 150 million users a day allows them to change the reality and to play with individual ways that limit absurdly.
You can turn yourself into an ananas, a dog or a character to make Roy Liechtenstein's painting.
The lenses are rough, screwing instruments that create more than 30 million self-corrected daily.
Any mistakes are rapidly known.
The Snapchat lins have been criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising the dark skin of the person or encouraged white persons as the ideal of beauty.
So when some users were offered this week to a lens that gave them hairy eyes, curved teeth and puffed cheeks, some criticisms considered this racist cartoon for Asians as "Yellows".
And they were wondering whether these repeating contradictions indicated a more serious problem of the company involving diversity.
On Wednesday, the reports on the Verge and Motherboard were distributed and followed by disturbance, the next day after the Snapchat claimed to be removed.
The company commented: the lenza was designed as respect for the characters of animation, not as a picture of Asians.
However, the experts who know about racism have not heard of it, the lenza reminded the insulting stereotypes of action.
Others have completely rejected the comparison with an animation.
In the e-mail of Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student who was actively sharing on photos, said that the lens were "insulting and at least uncomfortable".
She added that " argued to compare side sides with a very rough drawing on Asians and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just yellows, but to the highest degree destructive yellows.
Snapchat is not the only company going through these cultural bridges.
The American culture seems to be involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, starting from corporate halls to Hollywood and the deviations that we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people in Snapchat -- who are more racially different than their older generation -- may mean that they are more likely to wait for understanding.
When one of the Snapchat lenses creates an insulting image for the user, then, in an interview on Thursday 25-year-old Cathy Joo, "to the course of events is much harder to remain unnoticed as it was before."
On Thursday, Jou, the manufacture manager and the engineer who worked for the Medium, decided to remove its Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In the Medium and telephone interview article, she said that racial contradictions were the cause of insufficient diversity in the collection of staff in Snepchat.
I criticized the most white leadership of a company consisting only of men and ended her article with the Hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Jou, who is the American of Chinese origin itself, said, “If they had no sufficient number of white people in the state that could make such decisions, either they have worked in white people, but they do not have such positions where they can be safely and openly speaking.”
Other viewers shared its view, expressing displeasure that Snapchat did not answer most of its questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state by emphasizing its private company status.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of its staff, but, according to the trusted person, the company recently hired a recruitor to focus on the inadequate layers of population and on active attempts to involve internal resources.
On its part, Jou said that she would keep her accounts closed in Snapchat, added: "I wonder if they really needed more users like us to be able to say that it would not work."
Military leadership distorted the intelligence of IHIL, reports the Congress Commission
Officials from the Central Armed Forces of the United States have modified intelligence reports to provide a more optimistic picture of war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than to provide grounds for events on the spot, reports the Congress Commission in the report issued on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group established by the Republican Chairpersons of the Committee of Representatives of the WC, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Provision Subcommittee found " widespread dissatisfaction" among the Central Command Intelligence Analysts, which claimed that the leaders had controlled their assessments of American actions aimed at winning the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military administration in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence documents approved by the Supreme Command of Centcom generally gave a more optimistic picture of United States anti-terrorism action than being confirmed by real data from the scene of events, and were stablely more optimistic than the analysis provided by other specials," the report said.
"What happened in Centcoma is unacceptable: when a higher leadership appears to be an untrusted analysis, our military people suffer," said the member of the House of Representatives, Ken Calvert, the Republican from California.
The problem with the leadership of the Centcom is the top of the organization.
The ten-party report detailes the inaugurations that have been raised in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of the American action aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
Although it did not contain final evidence that the members of the Obama Administration had ordered to falsify reports, he claimed that the analysts felt that the Manual of Centcom had them to present a more optimistic view of the threat by the Islamic State, also known as IHIL or ISIL.
"In the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony of the Central Command in the Congress were much more optimistic than real events," the report reported.
For example, the Officer of Centcom publicly stated that the major military attack on the return of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is certainly known," said the member of the House of Representatives, Mike Pompeo, the Republican from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the U.S. Central Intelligence Service leadership was fake intelligence in order to reduce the threat of IGIL in Iraq.
The Republicans established an operational group when they learned that the analysts expressed concern that the examinations of the Islamic State were fake.
The report published on Thursday will follow more distorted data when the investigation is promoted.
The examination of the exploratory investigations of the Cencom is being conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
The representatives of the Democratic Party in the Intelligence Committee of the United States Congress Committee published their own data on Thursday, which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican operational group.
"In between 2014 and 2015, Centcom has established an excessively closed intelligence procedure for Iraq ' s IAIL and security forces," said in the statement by the member of the Palace of representatives Adam B. Shiff, the chief representative of the Democratic Party in the Committee.
This procedure, according to Shiff, has “presented the issue of intelligence documents”, damaged the moral status of analysts and “insufficiently reflected the distinct views”.
However, Shiff and Democrats claim that they did not find evidence that the White House had tried to force Centcom's analysts to bring them to their prisons under “consigned or political interpretation”.
The Congress's preliminary results were presented by the The Daily Beast portal on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported the existence of an investigation by the Chief Inspector Pentagon, opened after the Centcom analysts complaint.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, representative of Pentagon, said in the statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Congress until the investigation of the Chief Inspector continued.
However, he said that “experts sometimes distract in the tracting of integrated data, and the Special Services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a healthy dialogue on these vital topics relating to national security”.
The consequences of the investigation are beyond the question of whether the targets of the American bombing in Iraq and Syria are being achieved (as the Ministry of Defence now confirmed).
However, the statements last year questioned whether President Obama could rely on the fact that the Central Commanding provided true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crises.
The criticism of the intelligence of the Islamic State repeated the disputes that occurred more than ten years ago, when analyst of the intelligence of Centcom Gregory Hooker wrote a study article in which it claimed that the administration of President George Walker Bush, due to the protest of many analysts, had spoken to support a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think of what would follow the invasion of 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest caused by the Islamic State.
Last year, according to officials, the Hooker team concluded that, despite the public statements of the reverse, the aircraft on oil race plants belonging to the Islamic State had not resulted in a significant deterioration of the financial situation of the terrorist group because it built temporary oil race plants to sell oil on the black market.
But the opening was not distributed outside the Central Command, as the Times reported in September.
The then commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after the testimony in the Senate, which many deputies considered excessively optimistic war assessments.
General Austin retired in April and was placed in the Central Command of Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins four times in a female hockey on the grass, thus approaching the decisive conflict with Britain
On Thursday, Katie Bam opened the first two goals for the US female hockey team on the grass when the Americans won the Indian team with 3-0.
Five heads in two games should be a memorial achievement, but Bam, aged 27, claims that she was not sure if she had ever done something like this.
"I don't use my mind," she said.
I'm not really the people who track their naked.
This is what she knows: the Americans account at the Olympic Tournament, and they compete for the first place in their group with Britain, which remains invincible after Japan's losses with the account of 2-0 on Thursday.
The British and United States teams will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first tour.
Both teams are pretending for the fourth-final, and the result of the game will determine who will take the first place in their six teams and who is the second.
The winner will avoid meeting with a strong team of rivals from the Dutch, leaders of another group, a little weather when the fourthfinal games begin.
However, the Saturday game shows that the Americans had made a noise here by their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams in the London games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time she took a hockey stick on the grass when she was 3 (her older sisters were playing this type of sport in Drexel) and joined the national gathering at 16 years of age and became her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympiada when she did not run a final tour.
Thereafter came 2012, when she and her teammates were disagreeable.
The next year, Koeig Parnham, was appointed a coach, and everything began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical training," said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the productivity that we have now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday night, Bam opened an account in the first half of the game with an uncomfortable hand at a short distance.
India came to the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself to be a strict surprise and kept the account 1-0 until the end of the third period when Bam took the initiative in its own hands.
She made a long passage with a ball down to the left side of the field, then came into the middle and sharply sent the ball to the gate, thus giving the Americans the advantage of 2-0.
Melissa Gonzales added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The win was the first tournament for the US boatman, Jackie Briggs, who was missing one goal in each of the first three victories.
She's hit.
Like Bam.
"We are in a good position right now," said Parnham, but how good it depends on the results of the Saturday game.
In the midst of the Olympic Games - "day" jumps on the batute
Wherever you are, no matter what time it is, it's the Olympics.
Events in Rio de Janeiro seem unchanged and inevitable, which is a mad combination of competition and desire.
It's like the Olympic Fire itself and it's the burning towel that is transferred from the shooter to the swim, to the gymnast, to the triatlonist.
You can't turn on television, read the newspaper or listen to your neighbors' conversations in the cafeteria and not hear about Simone Byles, Katie Ledeca or the hostility between Michael Fellps and Chad de Cloo.
And there's Logan Dooley.
The Douli, who first participated in the Olympic Games, a beauty with jams on the cheeks, could be among the famous ones showed in the prime time that sponsors and life-affirming advertising films, if he was a swimmer, gymnast, or even a focalist.
But the 28-year-old Douli from Lake Forest in California fights for gold in the Olympic jumping jumps.
The Olympic Fire does not enlighten all events the same.
Further from the center, partly in the shadows, there are sports that are not generally recognized: a gun shooting, a bowl shooting, a badminton, a tekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, his long reign.
But if I'm allowed to speak hard to protect my personal addiction, allow me to draw your attention to the modest charm of jumps on the batute.
Although the batute jumps were an olympic sport since 2000, when they debutted in Sydney games, in past 16 years, they received so little recognition that many of the people I've been questioned were not aware that they were at all referring to olympic sports.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States had been sending sportsmen to competition, they had never won medals in the batute jumps, and their sportsmen had not come to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share male prizes, and Chinese and Canadian women.
Dun Dunn from China and Rose McLennan from Canada will protect their London gold medals this year.
But the batute jumps have an outside shock, in particular because the unexplored ear is more associated with a circuit college than with the Olympic Games.
Here I must admit that I'm not an expert, I'm just a landed enthusiast.
They really have a comic potential — a cartoon of infinite jumps — but also the decoration of gymnasics and jumps into water, the two types of sports that they combine mainly.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolin", which means "bamplin for water jumps".
Pretendents are jumping on a giant battoo, flying to the air nearly 30 feet, and have to perform a series of acrobatic tricks (with turns, squirts and saltos) until the final landing on their feet.
They are evaluated by the implementation, complexity and " flight time", according to the official Olympic Games Programme.
Thirty-two sportsmen from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will race in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is forward.
Pretendents must go on, faster, higher, and higher in pursuit of gold, sometimes to the end, and sometimes back and forward, there and over there in the field.
They strive not only to the final character or the starting wall but also to the television camera, to another irritating abroad: the world or the Olympic record.
This persistent desire is noble, worthy of admiration, even fanatic — and it is sufficient to make the watcher climb.
But I think it's a little tired of watching the Games.
He's got a break on the batute.
Batutist's direction up.
Moveing forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps, seems like astronaut, flying up, then down, then no effort again.
Of course, they do not work without competitiveness or difficulties, but during the entire programme there is no crazy zeal for the end, no jumps in length, but a strange, delicate disappearance of time and gravity.
It's the most close to the day of the Olympic Sport.
Women's qualifications, and then the final will take place on Friday day, translating at an hour of Eastern European time; men on Saturday, as well as an hour.
The NBC will translate the final in the daily programme from 2:00 at both days.
A calm, beautiful moment is expected to be seen in a common scrap.
And if consciousness increases can only be achieved by men's sportsmen who have acquired views and objectiveization, as according to Wall Street Journal, recently suggested by the United States' gimnast men, Douli is only waiting for his new admired fans.
The generation protests in Ethiopia, an old United States Alliance
Irritating protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia faced a violent opposition by the Government.
The witnesses say that dozens of protestants were deadly wounded during the conflict with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the edge of the crack?
In the past decade, she was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong West ally with a rapidly developing economy.
However, in recent months, anti-governmental protests have shaken the country by spreading its territories to a growing number of territories.
Only in the last week, thousands of people were out of the streets, demanding radical political changes.
The reaction of the Government was cruel, according to the human rights defenders.
The witnesses claimed that police officers had shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos from the protest scenes, allegedly taken at the end of the past or early this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they were put on the wall.
The United Nations Higher Officer for Human Rights now calls on a thorough investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country from decline, and it will continue to be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Rog project in the international research group.
Ethiopia is the second dense country of Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and almost no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is developing at an impressive speed.
Her infrastructure has been significantly improved — even a new suburb train in the capital of Addis Abeba.
Her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was barely a model of democracy; human rights organizations have constantly mentioned government repressions - the opposition in the territory of the State, because the dissidents were actually forced to be silent.
Many of them were deported, imprisoned, killed or expelled to remote deserts.
But it can change.
"If people are constantly suppressed and left no other options than protesting, the rebellion will rise," said Seyum Teshome, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia.
All youths protest.
The generation protests.
The complaints are numerous, starting from land use, ending with the overtake of government coalition.
Following the widely criticized elections last year, the Government and its allies have fully expelled the opposition and now controlled 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, the tension along the border with Eritrea is growing; the fight for this uncertain, disputed border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups, which have been destroyed more or less in recent years, such as Orome's release Front or the Front of Ogaden National Liberation, may try to use the worries and rewear.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, which have been softened in the heart for several years, are now.
First, it would seem totally harmless: smartphones.
Only in the past few years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate in social networks because cheap smartphones have become common and the Internet service has become better.
Even when the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through the proxy servers that hide where they are.
A number of young Ethiopians said that they were organized for protests.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
During the centuries of Amhara, many of them are Muslims and live in low-level areas.
But this is also changing.
"We will act together under one beginning," said Mulat Hemech, leader of Oromo.
The greatest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromo.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic Tiger group, which is about 6 per cent of the population and controls military and intelligence services, trade and policy.
The third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenaui.
Meles, a former rebel leader, had served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, until he died from unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could predict the danger.
The analysts argue that he was particularly skillfully recognizing the first dissatisfaction signals and used investigators to obtain data and defeat opponents.
"The current regime lacks healthy sense," said Abdi, analyst of conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hylemariam Desalen, appeared from nowhere and took Meles' place.
Unlike Meles, a member of the region of Tigray in northern Ethiopia, Heilemariam is a Southern.
The analysts say he does not use the security service controlled by Tiger.
Many fear that this will lead to even more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such anxiety in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what, as the analysts said, appeared to have been the elections that the Government had halted and then failed the results.
During subsequent repressions, many Protestants were killed, although in a smaller number compared to the past months, and this period of worries passed relatively quickly.
The development experts expressed appreciation to the leaders of Ethiopia for the long-seeming development of infrastructure, such as the new intergrading train and significant success in combating poverty.
But it was obvious that this did not stop the growth of internal dissatisfaction by the Government of Ethiopia.
It takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, the protesting in Gondar, the city in Amhara, attacked tiger enterprises and anti-Tygranic hatred in social networks became comprehensive.
The analysts claim that the protesting States and other Western allies have put in an uncomfortable situation.
The American Government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over the neighbouring Somalia, although it recently declared that it closed the base.
On the one hand, the West is clearly trying to support democracy, but on the other hand, he does not want his ally to lose power in the already unstable region.
"And it will be hard to go through this rope," said Abdi.
Donald Tramp explains his statement that IHIL was founded by Obama, "sarcism"
Donald J. Tramp tried to overcome the last conflict covered by his pre-electoral headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when he said several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were " founders" of the terrorist grouping of the Islamic State.
The explanation raised new issues regarding the ability of a candidate to be president from the Republican party to address the American people.
It also placed his deputies, who tried to protect him during the period of anxiety, in an uncomfortable situation, as they had to explain the statements that he probably did not mean.
By expressing this assumption at a meeting on Wednesday night, Tramp strongly insisted on his approval on Thursday, repeating in the interview that he really wanted to say that the President and Clinton founded IHIL.
But on Twitter's post early morning on Friday, Tramp wrote that he was just a nurse.
This post was a direct opposite of the allegation made for the day before, when Tramp said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious in his accusation.
When the Conservator of Radio Hugh Hughit tried to help Trampa mitigate the statement, reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy IGIL, the candidate for President of the Republican Party did not use the opportunity.
The last scandal was overwhelmed when Tramp tried to reorient his campaign into the economy on the basis of the reduction of the rating.
Tramp and Clinton spoke with competitive economies in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Tramp tried to return to this subject again.
Once again came to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to increased taxes, and said that it was boring.
Tramp used sarcasm before as an excuse.
At the end of July, after he criticized himself, he practically said that the Russians should break the e-mail of Clinton, he later explained his comments, saying, "Of course, I'm kidding."
This approach allows Tramp to leave beyond the political speech permitted and to take back its words if necessary.
"I think that it is his way to test some or some communications that have been responded among his worshippers to watch how they act and then to explain them in one way or another, depending on the response," said Ruth Sherman, a communicative expert conducting analysis of both candidates' language.
But I also think that he's careful about his speeches and knows that they're swimming enough to treat them differently.
Instead of mitigating the expressions for the broad selection, Tramp took even more vulnerable tone in the last days, while its rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist released on Friday showed that Tramp was resigning Clinton with a large restraint in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, with its level in Florida.
Although Tramp is usually trying not to apologize for the provocations that he says, he often accuses his critics of the wrong interpretation of his words and the lack of understanding of his sense of humor.
But since Tramp became an accelerator in the last months of the presidential campaign, his jokes put his faithful allies in an uncomfortable situation: they must publicly support him, whatever provocational statements were.
Rudolf U. Juliani, former Mayor of New York, who is one of the most famous Deputy Tramp, made serious efforts to protect the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an acceptable political comment," said Juliani when he was asked about the credibility of Tramp's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It's true in the sense that before Obama, IHIL was almost unknown a small organization, he called it no threat, absolutely unfair, and that's why it happened, because he expelled the troops from Iraq.
Most of the medium-statist republicans assured that Obama's administration, in which Clinton was a public secretary, had allowed IGIL to develop, since it had not been able to resolve the situation in the Middle East.
Before the meeting in Pennsylvania on Friday, Tramp continued to attack the media in Twitter for the demolition of every word and predictability of it.
He was kidding the poor poor television experts trying to figure it out, and said, "They are weak!"
Some democrats laughed at Tramp's excuses as a lack of confirmation that he was not able to be president.
One day a coffin returns to Greenpoint.
The Verb Cafe was scratched, taking only cash place in Williamsberg, where there was no Wi-Fi, but had been a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was expelled out of her room with a bedford avenue.
The Soup Sherry Store, which took the Verb place in summer 2014, is selling sauce in the form of cookies.
The local inhabitants mourned her as the last loss in the renewable city.
Molly Crabapple's artist wrote on Twitter, "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea's hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a sauce store."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is, in turn, updated.
The restored Café Verb opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
In the new Verbe, there are Wi-Fi and credit cards, but there are some of the same staff and similar simple atmosphere.
Besides, coffee is still good.
The head of the new Verba is Sisco Rodriguez, an old caffee officer, who is the owner and general manager in the new place.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients proposed to offer it in a new place, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, who was 36 years old, has left a lot in the past.
Verb works with the same Baggle distributor and bought the same coffee machine model.
It even sets the mirrors from the old Verbas.
But Rodriguez said he would also want to experiment.
He offered new meals.
The menu contains bacon sandwiches, eggs and cheese, and there are toppingues from coppers or baked bowls.
There's a storm rice dish.
There's no more beer in the coffee room, but fresh juices are cooking.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he drew attention to the unchanged flow of old permanent clients.
"Mnogy former clients have also been issued by prices from Williamsberg," he said.
In one of the recent resurrections, Rebecca Olivier was one of such clients.
Oliviera, who was 34 years old, used to live in Williamsberg and visited Verbe.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she went there anyway.
After the Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that the coffee and atmosphere impressed me in Verbe," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, although that day instead of a normal ice coffee, she ordered a bathed tea, another new thing.
Tom Rosental, another ancient client, was loyally visiting Verb from 2003.
He went before his work and ordered the same thing.
"After 15 minutes of the eighth, every day, as by the hour, I came, and I was prepared with oil and with all the ways," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new meals in the menu.
Today, Rosental is still making an ordinary order, but once, he's changing something with bacon, eggs or cheese on the beggle with all ways.
Rodriguez said he wasn't insulted that the sauce store once took over the old place.
Furthermore, the owners of Soup Sheri proposed to make a special soap for Verba, using coffee prepared in a cold way, as an ingredient.
"I think we may agree on their proposal," said Rodriguez.
The permanent inhabitants of Greenpoint also loved this coffee.
One of these new clients translated the menus to the Polish, and Rodriguez said that he planned to find a place for him in the vitrine so that his new neighbors would feel desired.
There are other benefits in the new place.
The local sale point plans to pour the bottles and sell coffee prepared in a cold way.
There is a probability that the coffeehouse will join the neighbouring building.
Many customers have enough that the new Verb will include their favorite foods in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a permanent client and told him he was killed by grief when they closed up.
When the coffee was opened in a new place, Whit said that when he came in and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt like he came home.
"How long I wanted to feel this smell," he admitted.
Depressive nutrition of depression in "Plotting Food"
In March 1933, shortly after the post of the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gurmane, President Roosevelt loved fashion foods of the Fifth Avenue, for example, fua gra and Meriland's cream soup.
His menu was more modest on that day — bathed eggs in tomato sauce, potato sour and dessert pudding from black cream.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Zigelman.
Her husband Andrew Cow added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
Women living in Brooklyn Hytes are specialists in the history of food.
The last book of Coua, Ragu in Chinese, was dedicated to the Chinese kitchen in America, and Zigelman told the story of life in a surveillance apartment in the Lower East Side through food in his book "Home 97 on the street of the Fruct Garden".
Their new joint work of "Plain Food", which will be published on Tuesday by Harper's publication, is the history of American food to the Great Depression.
In some degrees, they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny meal in the Flethayron block, which has been working since 1929, the Birge crash.
Zigelman, 54, ordered slipper cheese and candy with pieces of olive, and Kou, 57, took an orange, potato sour and vegetable mixture.
When a reporter ordered a meat roll, a couple viewed it as an appropriate point for the discussion of food in the depression era.
"Rulets used a great demand," said Zigelman.
There was a nut roll, liver roll, grape roll.
They were made of basic ingredients and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to grow.
Imagine you ate as much nuts as you need for dinner.
Kou's screwed up.
"He must have lied in his stomach with a stomach," he said.
In years before Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, represented the Swedish table.
Women's teams cooked a farm for men, and a fresh-fined cake was supplied for breakfast, dinner and dinner.
The Americans were sending food to the hungry Europeans during the First World War. The “Pleasure Food” describes how the country was dealing with that suddenly no longer being a country of abundance.
"It was the time when the food became a central, difficult topic for the Americans," Kou said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
It was similarly difficult to the new budget: mysterious foods, such as roulets and bakers, have become the main food products; the baking is a "made way to utilize sauce," said Zigelman, because the cooking could hide unappreciated ingredients under a thick sauce layer.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dry fruits.
The meat, for many years the former foundation of American food, has become an economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutrition values have become more important than taste and even a cooking sense.
In the study of the book, which includes recipes, Zigelman prepared the meal of that era: a baked bowl filled with nut oil.
"This supplement to the lunch table has not been used successfully," said Kou.
Zigelman added, "It was very weird."
The nut oil doesn't really fit in the liver.
This was characteristic for many household recipes.
As ever before and ever since, household professionals, including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Housewife from 1923 to 1943, have managed food habits of the country.
Publishing the recipes and articles in the newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become " Budgeters", to accept the challenge and to convert a borde like the sharked spaghetti with carrot into delicious meals.
"Plate Food" is the array of curious historical facts.
Especially picantic stories about the Government ' s response to hungry citizens, for example, the position of President Herbert Guver, in the spirit of "letting to eat pies".
He was publicly accompanied by a simple farming stroke of Iowa in his childhood, feeding himself as a decent millionaire to whom he became.
"He liked the continental kitchen, for example, a fish with a cotton sauce," Kou said.
He was practically eating in a golden meal wearing smoking.
He was fantasticly distracted from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to give him an example with her own stomach.
As explained in the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired an economy who was completely not interested in the taste, which led to the White House to "use not only the most disgusting food in Washington but sometimes the most disgustingly prepared."
Many of the culinary receptions of the Depression Age were forgotten as soon as the country regained.
Their heritage is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Zigelman, and how science was used to prepare food.
Marriages tell us that during the writing of the book they had better understood the food habits of Zigelman’s mother — that she could not throw out food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of the negligible relationship with food," Kou said.
Zigelman remembers, "She's poisoned people seriously."
There was one unpleasant case with profitors.
When the tables in Eisenberg's were deserted, they received dessert from Kou, which they had prepared at home, dessert from black barbecue, which President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
"It's called Muss of Moss from Moss," said Zigelman, adding that it was a widespread reception - to give modest recipes broad names.
There were no slippery, nothing more, nothing more torture, sugar, water, and squirrel.
Everybody unwantedly loaded the spoon into a tight, brown, sticky substance.
For a surprise, it was good.
The one asked for the supplements twice.
In the voice of a confident composer of the budget, he said to his wife, "A little screwed Greek nuts would be good."
Arrest of mass fighting figures on the Hawaii cemetery extended until 14 November
By 14 November, the Pressenia Court left a case of mass fighting at the Hovan cemetery, satisfying the prosecution of the investigation.
14 persons are being accused.
Recall that on 14 May, there was a mass debate of several hundred people from Central Asia and Northern Caucas with the use of weapons, which resulted in three deaths.
The former head of the cemetery, Yuria Chabuev, and the lawyer, the co-ordinator of the Public Nation, Alexander Bocharnikov, was charged with murder organization.
The second of 2016 pension indexing could be resolved for the next two or three weeks.
On 12 August, the Vice-Chairman of the Government of RF Olga Hungarac reported that during the visit to the British Area.
We have specific parameters for how much retirement needs to be improved in order to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are made.
The economists are now undergoing the summary of half anniversary, and we'll finish this work for the next two or three weeks," quoted the Interfax Hungarian.
Commenting on the proposed head of the Centre for Strategic Development, Alexei Kudrin, a pension scheme for six months each year, Vice-Prime Minister reported that the topic was not considered in the cabin.
At the end of July, it was known that the Government had agreed on the full indexing of pension payments in 2017.
The Stone and Gregorian went to the final of the shooting games from a small-caliber gun.
Russian sportsmen, Sergei Kamenski and Cyrille Gregorian, went to the final of a small-caliber shotgun shooting game from the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergei Camenski took 629 points and took the first place -- a new Olympic qualification record.
Cyrille Gregorian became the second - 628.9 bulls.
There were eight best athletes in the final.
The Stone is a world recorder in this discipline (633).
Turkish oppositionist Fethullah Gullen requires an international investigation of the circumstances of attempting to revolve a State in Turkey.
"I require the independent international commission to investigate the attempt of a public turn," the French Le Monde newspaper quoted Guilene.
The Turkish oppositionist also stated that "if any part of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Guelen denies the involvement in the retreat, emphasizing that his organization had never claimed political authority.
The Istanbul Court had previously arrested the opposition preacher of the Islamic preacher Fethullah Guleen.
Recall that the attempt of a military turnover occurred in Turkey at night from 15 to 16 July.
Gilead companies will reimburse the costs of legal services during the dispute of patent from hepatitis C with Merck
The Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to reimburse the costs of legal services that it has carried on the hepatitis patent with Merck & Co Inc medicine manufacturer, decided by the Federal District Judge.
In June, the Gilead company was released from the payment of $200 million for the violation of the two patents of the Merck, related to the medicines of Gilead, the selling leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the US judge discovered a number of violations by Merck, including the lie under oath and other non-ethical actions.
At the trial on Thursday, the Federal Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that the Gilead company had the right to reimburse the costs carried out during the debate.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the new generation of medicines from hepatitis C, which can heal more than 90 per cent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their lab labs based on sophosbury, an active ingredient of the medicines of the company Gilead.
Armed forces established with United States support claim that they have taken full control of Manbridge from the Islamic State
The armed forces established with US support have taken full control of the northern city of Manbage near the Turkish border, after the last remaining in the city of the Islamic State had left, the representative of the group reported on Friday.
Syrian democratic forces (SDC) are now purging the city after the remaining group of warriors hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages who were held by warriors, informed the agency Reiter Sharfan Darvis of the Alliance with the SDS of the Manbage Military Council.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are taking cleaning operations," he informed the Reuters Agency.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton announced its tax declarations for 2015, which showed that the candidate from the Democratic Party and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in the form of charity contributions, mainly in the Clinton Fund, former President Bill Clinton, approximately $5.3 million in favour of a statement, and the former State Secretary announced the income of $3 million from the issuer Simon & Schuster for her book of staying at the State Department.
The potential Vice-President Clinton, United States Senator Tim Kane from Virginia, and his wife, Anna Holton, announced tax declarations for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set the standard of financial transparency," said the advisor of the Clinton Jennifer Palmieri pre-electoral headquarters.
On the contrary to them, Donald Tramp is hiding behind false excuses and violates his past promises to publish its tax declarations.
It is an ordinary case for candidates to Presidents of the United States to publish their tax declarations, although the law does not require that.
The New York Businessman Tramp and his lawyers called the verification of the State Tax Service as a reason why he refused to publish their tax declarations.
"Your move," said the Twitter adviser to the Clinton Yan Sams pre-electoral headquarters, having regard to the declaration of a candidate from the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, the Special Adviser Trampa Michael Cohen said CNN that he would not allow Tramp to release them until the checks were completed.
Tramp's criticism, including a candidate for Presidents of the Republican Party in 2012, Mitta Romney and other republican communities, said that his refusal was the issue of his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other links, including Russia.
Clinton captured the issue and released an online video on Friday, where it was the main place for excellent Republicans who convinced Tramp to report tax accounts.
On Thursday, she raised this issue during the talk on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what each candidate has done for decades without exception: to publish his tax declarations," she said to the gathered.
The Politico newspaper reported that Tramp had not paid any or almost no taxes in the 1990s, and the New York Times business provider quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants who believe that it might still exist.
The federal tax rates were subject to a dispute at presidential elections.
Clinton supported the rule named by the billionaire, investor Warren Buffett, which would guarantee that people who receive more than 1 million dollars a year would pay the tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barak Obama also supported the proposal.
At the meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate is based there, invited Trampo to meet and exchange tax declarations.
Buffett said he was also under the IRS check, and that Tramp is not afraid of a tax collection agency, but of voters.
The Clinton Pre-electoral Headquarters announced tax declarations until 2007.
Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid the average federal tax rate from about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective total tax rate of approximately 40.5 per cent.
The Declaration of the Clintons for 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 from their income were a source of salary.
Their main investment was an insufficient Paye Index Fund, and Clintons claimed dividends and capital income of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder and fireworks increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Tanzania’s struggle for Environmental Protection uses a non-traditional way to prevent elephants from wandering into the settlements — the condoms filled with chili powder.
The method was effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation organization, which came to mind the idea several years ago, along with the American Nature Protection Committee, had taken its progress by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, consisting of four steps, a way to protect their homes and seeds without harming animals.
Many used spears before to protect themselves.
The World Day of elephants will be dedicated to animal protection on Friday.
"When we invented a set of tools ... we have seen a change in the relationship within these communities, which makes them much more confident that they will be able to avoid elephants in their fields without hurting elephants," said the executive Director Honeyguide Damian Bell in the statement.
The first two steps are in the burning of the towel before the elephant's broken border and signals through the horns.
If he hasn't been frightened, they're throwing the so-called cloud of chili.
The powder of chili mixed with soil is placed with a condomy, and its end turns out, only a fitile is left outside.
When condoms are burned, a little dust of chili in the air is spinning.
One duning is usually enough to turn the elephant to the other side.
The ultimate measure is a lighting device that shoots Roman candles in the air by producing a loud, bright explosion.
32 Turkish diplomats have not yet returned to Turkey, who have left the country after attempting to revoke this July.
Such data led the head of the MID of Turkey, Mevlut Chavushoglu, in a conversation with local journalists.
At the first stage, we revoked 208 staff diplomats to continue their work in the centre.
32 people have not returned without objective reasons and explanations," said the Turkish head of the Foreign Political Office.
Recall that a State revolution was attempted in Turkey in July.
The authorities of the countries officially stated that the proceedings had failed and reported that more than six thousand persons were detained, among them the military acts of a higher and medium.
As a result, 290 people died, according to the MID of Turkey.
The Jewish director dramatically criticised the Berlin Hotel for the removal of Israel's phone code on "please" of Arabs," reported the RT News channel
The French Jewish director linked a scandal in the media, discovering that the hotel of Kempinski Bristol in Berlin does not have the Israeli telephone code list, and the servants refer to " requests" by Arab clients.
Claude Lanzman, author of the documentary film on Holocaust Shaw, expressed his displeasure by the hotel of Kempinski Bristol in Berlin, wrote a open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay in the Lanceman hotel, he tried to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among States to call directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of New Germany, Israel was excluded and eliminated?
Written by Lanceman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to call Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In search of explanation, the director raised this question at the standing of the hotel administration.
The answer he got there, according to Lanceman, "shocked him."
Clerk said that this measure was a "conscious decision to manage the Kempinsky hotel network."
The reason behind this step has caused a greater anger of the director.
"The majority of our guests of Arabs, and they demanded that Israel's code be removed," said Lanceman, a hotel official.
Israel's Ambassador in Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handelsman, has called the case "safe shame," reports Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's really awful shame.
What happened in Germany and this hotel network is even more embarrassed.
There are no explanations here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," said the official.
The case caused a lot of resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the hotel of Kempinski had just "took" in the alleged demands of Arab clients.
“We would be ashamed, ” said another post, which indicated that the hotel on the glorious street of Kurfurstendam is near the synagogue.
The hotel itself has hurried to revoke any charges, named the unsub and "excused" to Lanzman, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order to include Israel in the list of fast sets," quoted the representative of the hotel of Kempinski Suddeutsche Zeitung.
It adds that the code is now added.
Police uses tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students faced the police in the Brazilian city of San Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered to protest government reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The disturbance began when police officers tried to expel students, which resulted in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
Pursuant to the suggestions of the Governor of the State of San Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public high schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redeployed to save money.
Some participants of the protest could be seen by writing on the walls of graphite against the temporary responsibilities of President Michael Temer.
This last protest took place only a few days after the protesting mass went out to support the dismissed President Dilma Rusef, when the country's Senate voted for its impunity.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71%, reports RT Business portal
With the abolition of the sanctions, the goods between Moscow and Teheran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, according to the Ambassador of Russia in Iran, Levan Jagarjan.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been withdrawn, the interest of Russian companies in the country has been increased, said the Ambassador.
Russian companies renew links with Iran, and new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further increase in trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Jagarian said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the goods between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
Trade increase has been achieved through the supplies of machine equipment, ground vehicles and weapons," said Ambassador.
Jagarian also predicts that this year Russia will visit a recorded number of Iranian tourists.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic representation in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mainly tourist citizens of Iran.
In addition, Iran first entered the top-20 countries on the number of tourists visiting Russia.
The last year's record of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be be beaten," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, that the ambassador hopes to change.
"I personally recommend visiting the towns of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yidd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are kept in good condition," he said.
The State continues to revolve gates in the defence-industrial complex.
The " systematic non-compliance" of the director's "Almas - Anthey" assignments, "release" and "juter of trust".
The NGO leader for the next three years was appointed Gennady Benderski.
Information on release was only appeared on Thursday evening and has not caused a wide range of resonance in the media.
How can such silence be explained in terms of the army's massive rearmament?
The leadership of RF probably does not wish to distribute any rumors or negative presumptions in the public environment.
This reaffirms that the defence-industrial complex (OPC) has many problems, and the State does not want to pay attention to them by society.
The Removal of the Nescreen is undoubtedly an important event from the perspective of order in the industry.
The Almaz NGO is the main concrete enterprise specializing in the production of marine and land-based ventile complexes (GRC).
Almaz is currently working on the establishment of the PRC Poliment-Redit and Morpeum, which are planned to set on new corvets, fregates, esminics and creisers.
The founder of the Portal Military Russia Dmitrij Cornev believes that the release of the Nespod was due to a breakdown of the deadlines under the projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of Morpheus began in 2007, and the introduction was expected in 2013.
The Poliment-Redit should be the main system for the CFP on the latest BMF ships.
The information I have received has not been performed in a number of years of trials.
The truth is, as far as I can judge, there is no single guilt of Almaza," said Cornev.
The expert fears that the delay of introduction in operation may also occur to the P-500 RRK.
Expert-constructive work on the project has not yet been completed, but the first complexes should enter troops during 2016.
The Ministry of Defense assured that “work is planned and all will be completed within the deadlines”, although in 2014 the Office recognized the problem with the development of P-500.
It is extremely difficult to evaluate the professional qualities of Almaz since 2011.
Cornev stated that the discounts of projects could be both cause and cause of dismissal.
He believed that in recent years, information on internal processes in OCC and business management plans has been very difficult.
The industry has received long-term orders for dozens of billions of rubles, and large money, as we know, loves silence.
The Directors of Defence Companies generally leave their own positions, on the agreement of the parties or are transferred to another work.
In this case, the removal has occurred publicly, although it has not been reconciled.
This emphasizes the idea that Almaza leader may have been a stroptive figure and resisted the top of the "packages".
Apparently, the State is no longer intending to treat such behaviour.
The shareholders will remove those who prefer to argue with the installations of the Minobrane and do not carry out the tasks set out.
At the same time, the leadership of the RF seeks to punish producing managers (mamination of the Star Courts).
Increased attention to the sector's issues has been given to the President.
Vladimir Putin is headed by the Military Industrial Commission and has periodically held meetings devoted to rearmament.
The Kreml protects the numbers of OPC managers, endeavouring to have a loyal composition of directors to carry out the orders received above.
It is far inadequate policy, but there has been no corruption and lack of normal competition in the OCC of other instruments in the State.
The situation in the defence, of course, is not a catastrophic situation, but the current geopolitical environment stimulates the Kreml as soon as possible.
In parallel with the " cleaning" of managers in OPC, RF leadership has taken a full successful step to improve Russian troops ' professionalism.
The Army's staff has acquired a new quality as Minister of Defence, Sergei Shoigu.
It is impressed that the president took a famous saying: "You want peace to prepare for war."
During the cold war, the SSSR military force and the nuclear parity reached in the 1970s have led to the conclusion of the Helsink Covenant, which has strengthened the scope of influence on the continent behind Moscow.
With all the deficiencies of the bipolar system, it worked very effectively.
The evidence was that there were no wars in the European continent and a relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
In the cold war, the " winners" marketing has resulted in strengthening international terrorism.
After a series of terrors in Europe and the United States in a civilized world, there may be no calm corner left.
Despite the general trouble, the West refuses to speak to Russia at the equal partner level.
In such circumstances, the only allies of our country remain fleet and the army.
Strengthening the military power will allow Moscow to be more effective in resisting national interests and to enter into new abroads of world policy.
Scotch Callum Skinner is running in the final line, resulting from the British taking bicycle gold
The Scotch Callum Skinner went to the triumph in a man's team sprint at Rio's velodrome last night, resulting from the command trio of Great Britain protected his title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old Glazgo was the strongest one his friend, Sir Chris Hoy, who made his own, and the young man came into history proudly, running through the final line to escape the victory of the Favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain declared the right to a sudden victory four years ago, victoriously when Hoy announced the right to the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after they finished modestly six in the March World Championship in Track Velgons in London, despite the fact that Hoy had finished his career since.
The question between Peking and London was the replacement of a specialist of Jamie Staff.
They did the same once Hindes showed up.
Hoya's carriage also created the emptyness Kian Emadhi and Matt Crempton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was held by British coaches, seeing the potential in Scotch, which was now realized.
Hindes, Kenny, the Hoy champions four years ago, and Skinner set an Olympic qualification record, but the normative was overcome by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was right behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported.
The change of the strategy was a major part of the transformation where Hindes had been on a larger transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, to keep Skinner pace.
Hoy observed from his place as an invitated BBC expert and caught the view of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered the pedestal.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgo said, "This is a flash comparison."
I'm here to do everything possible and make a name for myself.
We set the Olympic record in the final and defeated the world's champions.
That was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After the triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes intentionally acknowledged his fall on the track after the failure launch.
He renounced the commentary later, and there was no way to appeal to the British competitors.
There was no such issue this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like London with all those British flags on the tribune."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We've lost so many races with a world name that winning the Olympics was just amazing again.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country that won seven of the 10 names of the race both in Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress, perfect in the past five months, the velodrom is waiting for five more successful days.
With the form shown by Kenny, it is not beyond the possibility to imagine how he repeated Hoya's move by winning three Olympic gold medals in one Game.
This would see Kenny, who was just 12 years older than Hoya, who was born on 23 March (this seems to be a sacred date in the British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister), brings his account to six gold medals and one silver.
It would be just like Hoy.
The next time, Kenny will compete in a sprint that begins today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old man from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this right now.
Command competitions are always the best.
You're coming to win with your friends.
It's a little lonely to win alone, if you're honest.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must get a knight."
It was the only one in the day of the medal play, but there was the next good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doll are qualified by the fastest four-mile team race.
They finished for 3:51.943.
The world record set at the winning of gold in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 a.m.) will take place today, on the second day of the event where Whiggins will be exactly in the centre of attention.
He had a discussion with the Commissioners yesterday, before the qualifications, when the officials requested him to measure his weight.
In the appropriate female event, which is resumed and completed tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rousselle Shand, Eleanor Barker and Kathy Archibald of Milgavi, showed a time 4:13.260.
The commander of Great Britain has come to the relief of the powerful bicycle team to take in the middle period of the Olympic Games and earn a bunch of medals.
After really exclusive demonstrations of full superiority in Beijing and London, the expectations were weakened in progressive training for Rio.
There were dramas on the second plan, not the last - leaving from the Technical Director Shane Sutton in April because of the accusations of sexism and anxiety, and the care of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first evening race on the velodrome, the legendary glory of Great Britain now appears to be attained at the right time, perhaps just again.
The future Portland metallurgical factory threatened by the breakdown of the electricity contract
The future Portland Aluminium Factory in Victoria, as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers, is threatened because the electricity company that supplys the factory, according to one of the owners of the factory, is going to break the supply contract: all supplies are planned to be broken.
This step is the result of the decision taken earlier this year by the Government of Victoria not to extend subsidies provided to support the operation of the factory.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs can be threatened at the Alcoa factory in Portland.
The entire 2,000 jobs — directly and indirect — can be in the risk zone as a result of any closing.
There may also be additional indirect consequences, as the metallurgical factory consumes about 10 per cent of the entire electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the metallurgical factory in Point Henry, which led to the closure of the power station in Angles last year.
The Portland metallurgical factory of Alcoa loses money and risks closing.
These actions have been the summary of thinking about the future factory for several years, the initially due to the strong positions of the Australian dollar and later due to the price of the production of the factory.
The AGL company, which provides a large aluminium plant with its Loy Yang A electricity in Latrob Valley, said that it was expected that other three owners would also take steps to break the treaty.
The controlling share of the factory belongs to the joint short-term enterprises of Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp belongs to smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland object to continue to work, i.e. that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical factory will not stop," she said.
According to AGL, those contracts are the so-called 'hedged contracts ' which were to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month period of breakdown, so they will actually end in 2017.
"Certainly, AGL is still expecting those contracts to bring their portion of revenue in the 2017 financial year," said the electricity company.
Any potential impact on the profits of the AGL from the 2018 financial year has been limited to the prognosis of the strong fucher market for the optimal prices on electricity.
The AGL said that it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its accountability by $187 million in terms of the " forthcoming distortion " .
According to Alcoa, the decision to break the contracts "does not affect the ability of Alcoa to manage the metallurgical factory or to provide electricity to the metallurgical factory".
The American company stated that in 2010, Loy Yang had concluded a twentieth-year contract that had to enter into force in November this year, but it still had to explain why it broke the contract.
The analysts feared the possible closing of both the Portland metallurgical factory in Victoria and the Tomago factory next to Newcastle because of the disadvantaged economic situation in the industry.
Turning to analysts earlier this week, the chief of the AGL Service, Steven Mickelsen, said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy annually, and Tomago is approximately 900 megawatts.
If both factories leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [electroenergy].
It will be bad for us as a producer," he said.
Not only a reality show show of Cardashian, Kendall on the cover of the Vogue September number
Kendall Jenner, 20 years old, model and fourth daughter of the Clan of Cardashian-Genner, the mother manager Chris, appeared on the seasonal cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who was the face of the Estee Lauder brand and defilled the week of fashion in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in her account in Instagram on Thursday.
"Bying in the room with my favorites, I looked at this cover and cried," Kendall wrote.
The news of the cover was accompanied by a strange (or just in the spirit of the Cardashian family?), prepared by the reality-video, in which the whole family of Cardashian-Gener (deboshire Rob and Caitlin, also joining the universal favorite Uncle of the Cardashian family), forgot the appearance of the sister on the cover, and eventually the classic turn: they planned a party-surpris.
This is the standard story line of almost all the episodes of child television showes dedicated to the birthday (Sykrest says, "You thought we'd forget about you?" with the sincerity of the rabbit from the 8th morning), but Chris needed this glory to get to other girls.
Because with this episode, dedicated to the September Vogue number, we certainly entered the new era of the Cardashian show.
May the senior sister, Kendall Kim, have reached the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on it with her husband Kanie West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is a achievement by itself.
The September issue is the most selling issue of Vogue a year.
A thickness more like a gift issue than a fashion magazine, it attracts a huge number of advertising (as regarded by the Fashionist portal, 615 pages of the last year ' s 832-page issue).
The news of who from the stars will fall on his cover is so awaiting that in the past two years the photographs of the magazine have been combined before the official annotation.
The number of previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, more "markets that work in models" than famous models have been presented on the cover.
The Laureate of the Oskar Prize and the face of the brand Dior Jennifer Lawrence was presented on the cover in 2013, a year after the honour was dropped by Lady Gague.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, whom the magazine described as a "excellent model" of his generation, falls first, she's in a good company.
These famous ones are not relatives of famous people, reality stars or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (although Jenner is in all of these categories).
These are really talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Bayons, who appeared on last year's cover, this year, he was one of the most lucky in his career about the release of Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone's happy with the success of Jenner.
The situation of Jenner in the fashion world, in view of her past television reality show star, always had to be awesome.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague, Jiji Hadid, called them "the bitches of the moment".
These moods were rebuild after the news of Jenner's appearance on the Vogue cover.
But it doesn't make sense.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September Vogue number.
She's a supermodel in all the senses of that word.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you a tone cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, are selling your photos in their same applications available on the pay signing.
She sells her own photos of the daughter of Cindy Crawford LOVE magazine.
And at the free time, perhaps to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she's taking part in the reality show on TV.
Public legal centres deny the service of 160,000 people a year
Each year, more than 160,000 least protected populations refuse to serve in public legal centres, since the sector is preparing to the effect that will further cut the funding to and so ongoing activities.
In Queensland, three of the five people — mostly older, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people who have no opportunity to fight unfair deprivation of property and so on — have already been rejected by trying to obtain free legal assistance and representation.
Public legal services already working outside the possibility are preparing for further reductions.
Since June next year, these legal centres must lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of the Queensland Public Legal Centres James Farrell said that, according to the report of the latest list of the National Association of Public Legal Centres, thousands have been rejected by thousands of people a year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision was not cancelled, the situation would only deteriorate.
"Quinsland's public legal centres are constantly receiving insufficient funding: that means that thousands of people are renounced in the necessary vital services," he said.
People who have been left of violent relations, people with uncontrolled and disobedient debts, families passing through divorce, unfairly fired workers, all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot receive the assistance they need.
The Federal Government will cut the funding by 30 per cent since June 2017, thus thousands of less protected citizens of Queensland will be forced to address complex legal issues without assistance.
We call upon the Minister of Justice and Senator Queensland George Brandis to immediately cancel these reductions in financing so that people can receive the necessary assistance when they face legal problems.
Last year, the Government of the State had fulfilled its obligation to finance free legal assistance to the country ' s average rate.
Now it is time to draw attention to the needs of public legal centres and communities, their clients, and to the Government of Palastuk, it is time to invest in this important work.
Donald Tramp's pre-electoral headquarters were tried after the officer was reportedly threatened with a gun.
According to New York, the headquarters of Donald Tramp were courted: the headquarters claimed to have done nothing after the report that his operating director in North Carolina threatened a gun to a staff member when they drove in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a judicial case issued on Wednesday in Charlotte Vincent Bordini, former instructor for software in the pre-electoral headquarters.
Bordini said he was waiting for a few months to solve the problem internally, but he realized that it would not happen.
The director Earl Phillip " pulled out his gun, put his right pointing finger on the bullet and put a dull on Vincent's knee cup," says Bordini in complaint.
Requesting to the local and regional headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four other people were participating in similar incidents with Phillip, was approved in treatment.
"The guns don't have to shoot to harm," Bordini said in complaint.
The case took place only two days after the presidential candidate from the Republican Party made a furor, saying to the listeners in North Carolina that "the people of the Second Amendment" understood as arms owners and his lovers can act if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and can choose judges.
The Trampa pre-election headquarters said that the media had pulled his words out of the context and that it had not been expressed in support of violence.
In his complaint, Bordini requires compensation from the pre-electoral headquarters for immediate control, and Phillip for the threat of physical violence, injury and moral injury.
The representative of Trampa Hope Hicks is slow to respond to the request to comment.
The attempts to talk to Phillip failed.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Philip had recently left the headquarters.
In response to his consulting firm's calls, the Innovative Consulting Services, no one quickly called.
The President of the Republican Party, Donald Tramp, had held a dispute campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Court General, Department of the Supreme Court of Justice of McClenburg (Charlott).
Britain must guide the Olympic Spirit in the right direction and extend Hitrou
Heavy will also bring rehabilitation and prosperity not only in our populations here and in all over London, but and across the country.
I believe that this was exactly the huge advantage of Hitrou, just as it was with London 2012, where we made all our efforts to make our peoples and regions benefit from Games.
The Olympic Games have made great benefits for Stratford and East End.
And we'll do that again by creating opportunities for local residents and firms next to Hitrou.
Only for our populations here, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London 2012, those who believed that the Eitrou ' s expansion would be too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic games, and that we would be in a difficult situation in the world's arena.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they would prove wrong about Hitrou.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Hitrou answers any question raised on it.
Like the Olympic Games, Hitrou is a infrastructure project for most people, not just for a narrow circle.
The enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving the inheritance of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a great team in Hitrou, which introduced a programme of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investments in time and within the budget, from T5 selected by the best terminal of the airport for five years, to T2, built in the middle of the two most busy airlines in the world.
They are now ready to provide the third landing bar confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The Olympic Games in London 2012 have been a great success for Great Britain, and I am sure that Hytrou's expansion will also be.
It is time for us to send the Olympic Spirit to the right way and expand Hitrou by ensuring our trading future and creating the inheritance of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton, Chairman of the Council of Hytrou and former Trade Attache of Penalty
Adblock Plus, Facebook plays cats-Mouses on advertising blocking
For companies who earn money in the online advertisement, the attempts to cross the software to block the advertisement are a game with cats-Mouses, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, literally a few days after Facebook announced that it was going to block advertising blockers on its desktop version, Adblock Plus published a blog that users could update their filters in the program to block the advertisement on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the web site's current version would change the row around its advertising so that the advertising blockers would be more difficult to identify which parts of the website are advertising.
But Adblock now claims that he was able to surround the new code.
In its blog, the representative of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that " such a mutual combating between the community of advertising blockers with open source code and those who are trying to surround it continue from the invention of advertising" and that Facebook might present its own decision soon.
The fact that the largest social network in the world has entered into the fight is a clear sign of the great problem that advertising blockers have become.
Some 200 million people throughout the world use advertising blockers according to the last year's Patrifair and Adobe study; almost four times the number of those who used such software in 2013.
Given 1.3 billion daily active users who go to Facebook through mobile devices, the mobile advertising is now 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising income.
However, the company is hunting advertising blockers on the table, as mobile advertising blockers are ineffective in Facebook mobile applications for social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
However, the advertising in the table is a sufficient income article to make Facebook a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its advertising tool to provide more control over how advertising is tagged.
On Thursday, Facebook stated that new Adblock filters cause anxiety because they would also block some non-recommendable content on the website.
"It will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem," said the representative of Facebook in an official e-mail.
The advertising blockers are a rough tool, so we focused on creating instruments such as the Advertising Preferences to transfer management to human hands.
The woman was moved to the Swiss highway in an apparent suicide episode
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police calls upon witnesses after a woman was moved a few vehicles on the highway early on Thursday morning in an obvious attempt to suicide.
The incident occurred at A1 near Morge in the canton.
The woman lay on the road in the darkness of "in the gesture of despair" and was hit by several vehicles, said the police in the statement.
Apparently, as a victim, a Swiss woman aged 49 years of age, had hit several vehicles, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
Several involved drivers have already been questioned, but some have not yet been identified, the police who calls on them and anyone else witnessing the incident to respond.
A criminal case, a "logical" step in this situation, said the lawyer of Gile Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is still necessary to find out whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid strike?
This is what the prosecutor needs to determine," said Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be considered responsible.
In each case, both of whom are involved in the darkness of the road was sentenced that carists could not expect a random meeting on the highway in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, the officer was justified of cautioning death after she hit and killed a man lying at A1 at Pierne's night in August 2014.
A 22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, listening to the court.
The court found that a policeman, who responded to an emergency, had controlled a vehicle that was justified, and that the presence of a person on the road was "exclusively and unforeseen situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has information on the incident on Thursday near Morge should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have once been a resident, according to NASA's new climate model.
Scientists from Goddard's Institute for Space Study developed a model for the past Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climateists.
The model was designed to determine whether on Venus, with its hot waterless surface and the atmosphere oversailed with carbon dioxide, ever existed conditions like the earth.
Scientists previously assumed that a small rotation rate of Venus was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest modeling suggests that Venus could probably have a cut atmosphere like the earth, and still rotate slowly.
The model also considered the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more dry regions on the planet than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical variables to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evasion.
The early Vienna also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent tighter.
"In accordance with the GISS models, the slow rotation of Venera puts its daily side to the sun for almost two months at one time," explained Anthony Del Henio in the GISS printing report.
This warms the surface of the planet and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds that act as a zontic that protects the surface of the planet from the substantial part of the sun’s heat.
The result is the medium climate temperatures, which, unbelievably, is a few degrees colder than today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venera, similar to the development that had previously been expected by planet study professionals.
Although Venus once may have been inhabited, it was affected by too much heat and ultrafial radiation over a few billion years.
Her oceans are out, and her water pair was burned with ultrafial radiation.
When her hydrogen flyed, only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- that's, Venus, which we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new climate model of Venus in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy leaves the Avalanche team trainer
Patrick Roy left the coach and vice-president of Colorado Avalanche's hockey activities on Thursday, referring to the lack of influence during the decision-making process.
The Vice-President/Chairman of the Colorado team, Joe Sakik, reaffirmed the news and noticed that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have fulfilled my responsibilities to the Chief Coach and Vice-President of the Colorado Avalanche Hockey Activities with energy, passion and determination," said the 50-year-old Roy in the statement.
During the summer, I've been thinking long and carefully about how I could improve this team so that she could give her the depth and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and the vice-president of hockey activities should be perfectly consistent with the organization's vision.
It should also have the right to vote in decision-making of the team.
These conditions are not met at present.
Sakik, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrik told me about his decision today," Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him success in the future.
Roy became Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the League during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was scattered by Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and lost playoffs for the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced an assessment of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and five points left the Wild team in the fight for the second easy trip to participate in the Western Conference.
The Porter from the Hall of Slava, Roy won four Stanley Cubes — two with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oils resume negotiations and stop strike
Work strike on oil salary in the North Sea has been suspended, and all sides of the discussion are approaching a new round of negotiations, reported by the leading representatives of the parties.
Strike against the Wood Group was sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea of Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Unions of Unite and RMT can confirm that we agreed to renew the negotiations process to resolve current disputes," said the joint statement.
We will hold a few meetings for a full day for several weeks, starting from the beginning of the next week to look at the problems with a fresh view.
The trade unions reported that their recent action, which they believed to be the first over 25 years, had been addressed against potential reductions in salary to up to 30 per cent.
The Wood Group has reduced the rates paid by contractors working in the North Sea this year by approximately 9 per cent due to the negative tension of the market.
The reduction of the company's rates took place after the 10 per cent reduction in the contractual staff working on the beach in 2014.
According to the company, additional reductions will give it a space necessary to overcome market decline.
Shell, for its part, reduced thousands of people and announced plans to cease oil activities in countries up to 10, since it rationalized its activities as a result of its mega-mlining with the British Energy Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the low prices of uneven oil: the economic situation has deteriorated because of the decision to leave the European Union adopted in June of the United Kingdom.
The Scotland member of the parliament Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest labour conflicts in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and across the country, we need a economy that would work for most, not only for some," he said in his statement.
Less than $1.4 billion for new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, contrast with an average of approximately $7 billion for the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in the Pleyad Building
The latest space telescope mission of Kepler has helped astronomers to gather the fullst directory of star rotation in the Pleyad Building.
New data helps astronomers to understand why the stars are rotating with different speeds and how the rotation periods relate to the formation of planets.
"We hope that, comparing our results with other star bunches, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Louise Ribal, a scientific officer of the Infrared Processing Centre and Analysis Centre in the California Technology Institute.
The fever is 445 light years from the Earth.
Many stars in the bunch now only reach maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're turning as fast as they're never going to.
At their peak speed of rotation, these growing stars throw out large amounts of star wind.
By traveling through the magnetic stars fields, these winds make the stars a braking action.
As the star ages, its rotation speed starts to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star, tracking the time between the occurrence of known star spots, such as sunflowers.
The latest pace of rotation speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Ribal compares stars to dancers: larger piruettes are slower than smaller.
"In the balet, we see that those who rotate slowly are usually more massive, while those who rotate faster, usually refer to very light stars," said Ribal.
Since the bunch of Pleyad is so close, it serves a perfect space lab to compare star properties with rotation speeds.
"The Star Building of Pleyada provides a point for theoretical star rotation models both younger and older," said Ribal.
We still want to know how, where and why the stars slow down their rotation and hang on their shoes, in a way.
The Ribal and her colleagues detailed their last analysis of the speed of turning the Feed in three new articles, which will soon be published in the astronomical magazine.
The investigation related to the activities of the Ukrainian diversants detained in Crime are two offices, states Commersante.
The FSB collects evidence of the involvement of detainees in preparing diverssions in Crime.
As previously reported, the inhabitant of the Ukrainian city Energydar Eugene Panov agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
He said that he considered the Titan Hymbudget in Armenia, the oilbase in Feodosia, the Kerchen parom transport, the gas pipeline, and one of the military airports.
Legislatives believe that the detention has been successfully detained by not all diversant participants.
This was, in particular, the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kiev Paradise of Simferopol, noted the publication.
The principal coach of Russia's soccer was Stanislav Churches
At the meeting of the Excellency of the Russian Football Union, it was decided to appoint the chief Russian coach on football, Stanislav Churchesov.
The contract will be calculated for two years before the completion of MM-2018.
On 11 August, the PFS appointed the principal Russian coach on football, Stanislav Churchesov.
It is a famous footballist who used to play in Moscow Spartacus at the seathower position, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was a teacher of Russian teams like the same "Spartak" and "Spartak", "Terec", "Amcar", "Dinamo", and the Warsaw Legia, who became the winner of the national privilege and the cup of the country.
It is reported that the Churches contract will be signed at the very nearest time and calculated for two years.
Thus, it is the responsibility of preparing the World Championship in 2018.
It is known that his training headquarters will include Miroslav Romastenko, Guntaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikov.
There are information that the entire training headquarters pay 2.6 billion euros a year.
According to the media, the FSS leadership set Stannislav Churches aimed at bringing the collection of Russia to the semifinal and conquering medals.
As the trainer himself stated, he considered the establishment of a competitive environment in the team and would give footballers an opportunity to show himself.
Also, according to Churches, he was glad that his choice had fallen upon him.
The first match under the leadership of Churches will be held on 31 August in Antalia, a companionship with the Turkish team.
Recall, previously, the head of the Russian football coach was Leonid Slucki, combining it with the CSCC coach.
He announced his resignation from the post after the failure of the Russian national team to Euro-2016 in France.
However, he has taken responsibility for the bad result of the collection on himself.
In the meantime between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered severely during a long fight against the apartheid.
However, after the independence of South Africa in 1990, the country with 2.4 million people has achieved huge success, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for the success of Namibia is that the Government is paying great attention to education.
While people in developed countries consider themselves a recognised free primary and secondary education, many poor countries in the middle and even primary schools require a wage for training.
Furthermore, Governments are often advised to introduce training fees for the " reimbursement of expenses " .
However, in Namibia, primary schools are free of charge.
Furthermore, the average education has become free since 2015.
The authorities also work actively on other important directions.
Malaria's efforts have reduced the number of annual diseases by 97 per cent in the past ten years.
Despite the international trend of inequality, it decreases in Namibia.
In comparison with the 1993 indicator, the Ginny coefficient, which was a standard inequality of income distribution, fell by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this indicator was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty rate decreased from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty ( less than $1.90 per day) also decreased from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest rate of freedom of speech in Africa, according to the Reporters Without Borders.
The country has significantly preceded the United States and other rich States.
Furthermore, the country has a favourable rating -- one of the highest in Africa -- in the Independence of Corruption Index, which are human rights defenders from Transparence International.
Even now, when the prices are under commodity, Namibia is able to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, debt to GDP is about 25 per cent, which is less than 1/3 of the US debt and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The level of unemployment, at least on traditional evaluation methods, remains sufficiently high, almost 28 per cent.
And, like other countries in the region, the high level of HIV/AIDS in Namibia is almost 17 per cent of the population infected.
According to the World Bank, Namibia is the number of countries with income higher than the average, but the authorities insist that their State is actually a developing country.
Namibia is definitely faced with some difficulties that will result in the weakly developed economies.
The State has to develop a very large and dry country with small populations.
In the territory of the desert, the isolated Nomad tribes of collectors, which should be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
Integration of people who were on the periphery of the world economy fourth century ago is a challenge for each country.
It is even more difficult for Namibia: as any other country in the world, it faces the consequences of climate change.
However, Namibia did not think of falling down, but the country solves its problems.
Almost immediately after the independence of the authorities were engaged in the creation of a diversified economy and a combined society.
It is noted that competitive political fractions have gathered together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap medical services not only for its own citizens but also for its neighbours.
About 15 to 20 per cent of visitors of health institutions in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia speaks of the construction of a wall that would separate the country from poor and corrupt neighbours.
The Namibians realized that the neighbours were not chosen and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate, to share deficit water resources, to participate in regional medical projects, to encourage investments and exchange students.
Furthermore, the Government of Namibia has justified that wealthy natural resources can easily become a curse by promoting the wealth of few.
The authorities understand that income from Namibia's natural wealth needs to be invested in infrastructure and productive powers.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek a maximum profit from the country's sale of resources, and to review investment laws and contracts to ensure that it is true.
Transparency is crucial for this process, so strong support by the Government of freedom of speech is so important.
As the head of the Hague Gaingob state noted, the media often say what he did not like.
But after the fight against the freedom of apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms received, said the President.
Not all Namibia's key resources are exhausted.
Some, such as fisheries, are renewable, and the Government has made every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
More than a million foreign tourists visit the country every year.
Namibia indicates that even those countries that start with serious deficiencies -- racism, colonial structure, inequality and low development -- can become a path to general prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the Gold of Varna, the ancient gold objects created by man (4600 - 4.200 before our era).
It was probably the loudest archaeological senction in the 1970s: in Bulgaria, at the excavations of the Varnen Necropole, a fantastic number of gold artifacts was found -- more than three thousand total weights of six pounds.
Only one funeral known as "Mobile No. 43" was derived from 990 gold items of a total weight of more than 1,5 kg.
However, the official status of the ancient gold of the world may soon be converted to an unexpected vision found by the archaeologists in July this year.
Again in Bulgaria, in a historical settlement known as Tel Junaci.
Unlike Varna, the port city, the Tel Junaci are far from the sea, near the village of the Pazarjik region.
The busin is a golden strip, turned into a ring.
Javor Boyagiev, the excavation manager in Tella Junaca, dated the findings of 4600 years before our era and stated that she was the older of Barna's gold for at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna, recall, are dated approximately the same period, 4600 to 4.200 before our era.
There are currently no technologies allowing for a perfectly precise date of metal.
How, then, can you be confident of what gold is more ancient?
Apparently, Professor Boyagiev knows more than he told Reuters: "I am absolutely sure that the gold of the Junaca is older than the gold of Varna."
It's an emergency finding: it's a small object, but it's big enough to take the right place in history.
The Reuters Boyajiev interview reported that the scientists are analyzing the metal composition soon and re- and more carefully study the archaeological layer where the golden artefact was found.
This will help to date the busin with as much precision as possible.
The place of finding also explains a lot.
The Tel Junaci is a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
The Tel Junaci is currently considered an ancient “ground ” of Europe.
The Tel was founded by the descendants of people migrating to Europe from Anatolia, modern Turkey, 7 millennium before our era.
During the next centuries, metal processing has been rapidly developed in this region, from the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full industry.
The country's history of this archaeological community has a special name: the Balkan-Carpath metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium before our era, metal processing centres began to occur in urban settlements.
They are now called the ancient cities of Europe.
The Tel Junaci may be the most ancient, since the artifacts were found here in 4900 before our era.
I would call the Tel Junaci prototype of the modern city, although it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This is the place of the senior Schumer for a thousand years," said Boyajiev, having a general view that the city culture was born in southern Mesopotamia, modern Iraq.
The first cities there were in the common understanding of this word.
The Tella Junaci scope has been conducted since 1976.
During that time, the archaeologists digged nearly 12 hectares, which is about a third of the estimated common settlement area.
The remnants of the fortress wall have been found, once reaching three meters high.
The houses and workshops have not been preserved, but the archaeologists clearly distinguished streets, public buildings, city density buildings, the "work center" and the dwelling areas.
The Tel Junaci are often called "The Bird City," and there were tens of clay figures of birds found.
All the birds are represented in the state of peace, and there was an assumption that they were not decorative objects, but an object of local worship.
The “Bird City” was destroyed about 4100 years before our era, perhaps by indioeuropean tribes coming from north-east.
The nomads had no cities, but there were horses and weapons.
The three-foot walls did not stop them.
The archaeologists found clear signs of cruel fighting: the remnants of old men, women and children were found inside the homes with trails of wounds caused by seafarers.
New findings and new facts appear annually, changing the common ideas of ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly speaking not of individual cultures, but of the " lost" first civilization of Europe in the Balkans.
A powerful stimulation in the search for this civilization was the "Zlato of Varna" found relatively recently in 1972.
It is logical that the golden luxury of Varna had to be preceding -- something like a tiny gold bush created in Tella Junaca.
In Porsche artificially aged 911 Targa model
It is officially stated that the preparation of 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is conducted by manual professionals of the serial machines.
The retro port is, for example, in the special color of the Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model -- even a model logo.
Furthermore, the Targa received a firm white graph alongboards and the special 20-inch wheel drives of RS Spyder, as well as some details of the decoration of the pieces decorated in "white gold metal".
In the interior of the retro lines it is noted: it differs, on a large account, by grey-blue gamma, with new chairs with expanded ranges of electro-oregolisers and separate black anoded steel thresholds with the unit logotype.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a car cheque and a richly separate album with photographs of the production process.
Porsche Exclusive has not been touched by the force installation: the retro-targ of characteristics is fully matching the series.
It is equipped with a six-cylind engine with a turbinad volume of 3.0 l, developing 420 L.C. and 500 N.E.
The most dynamic version 911 Targa 4S can speed up to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released by a limited tissue, but neither the amount nor its value of each specific sports car shall be reported.
Facebook and advertising blockers linked the arms race.
The recent introduction of Facebook technology preventing advertising on social sites has caused the developers of decisions to block advertising to response.
The AdBlock Plus was released with "protein," but Facebook is planning to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus proclaimed its new technology, which would probably remain effective for a while.
The representatives of the social network noted that the decision of AdBlock Plus, along with commercial announcements, blocked many customary posts from friends or pages, in order to deceive the new " unlocked " technology.
In Facebook, they regretted this AdBlock Plus policy and promised to solve the problem soon.
As the source told among the developers of the TechCrunch publication, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook desktop will be prepared in the next hours.
Thus, social and blockers linked a race of weapons, attempting to win each other, and the side became users who missed interesting records from friends or who saw the advertisement where they hadn't used to see it.
The ethical aspects of advertising have recently caused hot disputes.
In Murmansk, the violent will be presented before the Summer Murmansk.
His case has already been completed in the Investigation Committee of the Russian Federation on Murman.
The prosecution made by a 54-year-old man is very serious that he commits sexual violence.
It was found that, at the end of November 2015, the accused in the street of Paul in Murmansk had committed sexual acts with the application of violence against a 20-year-old girl.
The sanction of the article provides for the maximum penalty for deprivation of liberty for up to six years.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia crossween Fengguang 370 and Picap Rich New - Website Front www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of the popularity in China of the class of cars combining the dignity of miniven and crossware.
Another announced Russian Prime Minister is Rich New.
Many Western companies of Moscow's international car salon have decided to ignore this year, so the emptyness of the exhibition chambers, Crokus Expo, will be filled with Chinese companies.
In particular, the Dongfeng Motor corporation, which has large types of Russian markets, will be presented by the powerful front, and will in the near future offer some interesting news to our autolobs.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 sales crusade in China on the spring price of 55,900 Juanas (at less than 550,000 per current course).
The Russians are unlikely to swing the price, and the question of delivery to our country is still in the stage of discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370, as a result of June's sales, was able to reach the 11th place in the list of the most selling minivens, although due to a large road education (175 mm) and the protective plastic coverage on the lower perimeter of its cruise can be comprised with cross-controlers.
Crosswan was built on the frontroom platform of the younger Fengguang 360 model, in the 370s the same wheel base in 2725 mm, but a little longer (4565 mm vs. 4510 mm), the design was more solid and the wealthy equipment.
The salon was decorated by wooden plans, but a large vertical sensor screen on the central console was only on the early exhibition exhibitions of the Crosswane, and the "muzyka" cars had come to sale.
Five of the seven landing sites are easily composed of a flat loading area length of 1650 mm, the maximum amount of the trunk of 1500 l.
The engine for Fengguang 370 provides only one 1,5-litre gasoline gasphere power of 115 l.s, which is combined with a 5-step mechanical transmission box.
The manufacturer modestly reduces the dynamic qualities of the car, but promises the saving budget of the appetite owner at 6.7 l/100 km.
Picap Rich New is well-known to the Russians Nissan NP300 Navara of the past generation, but with a little cheaper Chinese designer.
Despite the morally aged structure, this model still uses a stable demand for Chinese consumer as a reliable and unwanted “working horse”.
At the same price, Rich New must be interested in Russians, because modern Japanese trucks have become very expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two electoral engines: gasoline 2.4 l (137 ls) or turbidzel 2,5 l (116 L.s.).
The transmission box is only mechanical, but there are modifications with a strictly connected front.
The Dongfeng stand and the new flagman sedan A9, its Russian prime ministerial representation of the Chinese company has been analyzed in June.
Minvenolike crosswords in the Chinese market are increasingly increasing, one of the recent news is Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
The Russian Dongfeng ambulance is currently two models: S30 sedan and Hatchbeck H30 Cross.
During seven months of this year, Chinese company dealers implemented 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax reports will cease to be sent by the website by www.zr.ru.
The tax inspection has changed the order of dispatch of notifications on property taxes.
All Russian owners have used to the schedules that have not changed in the years: on summer and autumn they receive a tax card for transport tax payments for the previous year.
However, this year many will not wait for them.
The fact is, the tax inspection has changed the order of notification of citizens without noise.
Those registered in the Personal Tax Office on the official site of the office.ru will be e-mailed.
Inspections were automatically viewed by such Russians as online users and emphasized them from a standard, "paper " dispatch.
News will affect all vehicle owners and real estate.
All others will continue to receive customary letters.
However, the possibility of returning to the old scheme has also the owners of the account record on the site.
To do so, they will have to visit the tax office during August and make a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more contemporary and more comfortable.
The notification will appear in the personal office immediately after the composition, while the letter will take several days and may be lost at all.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet tax inspection has exceeded 18 million people, allowing the office to save seriously in the mailing.
On the other hand, the humble news on the inspection site is clearly not enough to inform citizens about the change in order.
Some could have registered in the personal office to obtain one-time service and have forgotten that long ago.
These people will not wait for their post reports and, without knowing it, they will fall into a category of non-payers with all the expiring consequences.
Access to the Personal Tax Office is carried out in three ways: through the account portal gosuslugi.ru, using electronic signature or input of the login and password specified in the registration map.
The latter can be obtained personally in any tax inspection office (whether the place of accounting).
Recall that the transport tax has to be paid up to 1 December in the current year.
The sending of notifications began in July.
Mercedes-Benz G-class Ttuning, in which improvements are aimed at achieving a very high rate, is the thing in itself.
However, the concept of the controversy did not embarrass the masters of the G-Power who took up the revision of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its dependence on BMW cars, but nothing human to her masters is foreign.
Indeed, why not improve G 63-571-powered flying couvalda with tank aerodynamics and race up to a hundred per 5.4 c?
With the muscles of a mad helicopter, the master used the advantages that opened a 5.5-litre suppressive "eight".
However, the race dynamics have improved to a hundred to inseparable 0.1 per cent, and the flying ciggle is now capable of ripping for 5.3 c.
However, the acceleration of the average speed is probably better.
The speed roof scares that if the standard G 63 is not 210 km/h, the tuning-trail with the deactivated e-shift is capable of exhausting 250 km/h.
The vehicle outside is practically independent from its factory source, except for other wheel drives, 23-inch Hurricane RR size 305/35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach Luxury Division analyzed the impressive conceptual set of length of 6 m, which is represented under the Pebble Beach Elegance Competition.
The Mercedes-Benz company will compete with the "green subbrand" BMW and will promote its electrical models under a separate trade mark.
For the next years, at least four ecological news are expected.
