Members of the Welsh Meeting are worried that they will “be like Mupets ”
Some members of the Welsh Meeting are consterned from the proposal that their title should be changed to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, a member of the Welsh Parliament)
The proposal causes plans to change the name of the meeting for the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the meetings across the political spectrum are concerned that the name could cause a laugh.
One member for the Labourist Party stated that his group fears that “this is ryming with Twp and Pwp. ”
For readers outside of Wales: In welsh twp means stupid and pwp means bullshit.
The member of the country Plaid said that the group as a whole "is not happy" and proposed alternatives.
The Welsh Conservativer stated that his group had access to the change of the name “with open mind” but noted that the MWP was close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the English letter "w" is expressed as the letter "u" in yorkshir English.
The Assembly, which is now preparing the legislation for the introduction of the name change, stated: “The final decision on how members of the Welsh Meeting will be called will, of course, be on members of themselves.”
The Major Government's law of 2017 gave the Welsh Meeting the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, where wide support was obtained by a variety of calling the Welsh Parliament's meeting.
With regard to the title of the members of the meetings, the Commission preferred the name of the Welsh Parliament, or WMP, but the MWP option has obtained the greatest support in the public discussion.
The members of the meetings clearly suggest alternative options, but the fight for consensus may bring concerns to the President, Elin Jones, who will submit a proposal for legislation within a few weeks.
The reform laws will include further changes in the functioning of the meeting, including the rules for disqualification of members and the draft committee system.
Members of the meetings will vote on their title in the context of the negotiation of the new legislation.
Macedonians will vote on the change in the country's name
On Sunday, the voters will decide whether their country's name will be transformed into “Republic of North Macedonia”.
All votes should resolve tens of years of lasting dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens have insisted for a long time that the name of the northern neighbour represents the right to the Greek territory and are repeatedly protesting against the requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the plebiscity on the change of the name, declared that the vote would not follow.
Respondents of the referendum, including the President of the Government of Zorana Zaeva, however, argue that the change in the name is simply a price for EU and NATO entry.
St. Martin's bell will shut down because the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival.
"The old people I talked to say that before there was a bar and church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"There's no one there today."
He thinks that the bar's missing is understandable.
"People are dealing in a different way today," he says.
"The bars are no longer living rooms where people go regularly."
With regard to churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of property will not be enough for as long as their representatives expect, “and sooner or later will be exactly where they began. ”
As he adds, churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of such types of people who will not help the remaining Stations in the quarter.
"A total majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white," he says, "and so soon the day these churches will be closed completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into the apartments become members of churches."
Both churches built white congregations before the black metropolis became from Harlem – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodistic Congregation moved in the 30th century.
The building was taken over by the Black Congregation, whose godlyness was held nearby.
St. Martin took over the Montenegro Congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was headed by the boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping bullwar in Harlem, who refused to employ or promote black people.
In 1939, the fire had severely damaged the building, but when the father Johnson's fountains planned his rebuilt, they ordered a bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin, proudly called the bell of the poor.
The expert who played the bell in July called it "cultural treasure" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell in the church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says no one's been replaced by St. Martin.
In the past few months, a complicated story of architects and builders, some of whom called the lying church leaders, others episkopal dieses.
The Council of the Elders, the head of the fertilizer's body, sent a letter in July, in which he expressed concerns that the diet will “may try to transfer costs” to the Council of the elders, although the employment of the architects and builders that she sent to dieceze did not participate.
Some frenchers complained about the insufficient transparency of the diet.
A shark wounded a 13-year-old boy in California who drowned for the lobsters
According to the official report, a shark attacked on Saturday and injured a 13 - year - old boy who drowned for lobsters on the day of the beginning of the jam season.
The attack took place just 7 hours ago near the Beacon's Beach Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said to the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning he swimmed with his friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy calling for help, and then he wandered to him with the whole group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel stated that the call first considered the joy of catching a lobster, but then “he realized that he was screaming“ He bit me!
He bit me!"
When Hammel reached the boy, he noticed that “he had the entire area of the key bones broken apart. ”
"I shouted to all go out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’ Hammel adds.
The boy was transported by a helicopter to the Council's Hospital in San Diego in critical condition.
We don't know what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Captain Larry Giles said at the press conference that the shark was seen in this area a few weeks ago, but it was designed not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the top of the body.
The Offices closed 48 hours of access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad po Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the cosmetic market in Great Britain
Sainsbury's wants to build the Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams cosmetical streets in a business house style where specialized sellers will be available.
In the context of the strong marketing of cosmetics in Great Britain, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and domestic needs falls, the streets with cosmetic will be tested in 11 sales throughout the country. In the case of success, the next year will expand to other sales.
Investment in cosmetic is linked to the efforts of supermarkets to find use for regals used earlier for television, microwave pipes and domestic needs.
Sainsbury's states that it will double the offer of cosmetic products up to 3,000 products and will introduce marks like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
More space also gets an existing sort of L'Oreal, Mogelline and Burt's Bees marking places like those in boots.
Supermarket also introduces its sorting of make-up Boutique, so most products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
Furthermore, in two Saintsbury sales’s concessions will be tested by Fragrance Shop. The first such store was opened last week in Croydon in southern London, and the next year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Shopping online and moving towards daily shopping of small food in local shops means that supermarkets must try more to attract people.
The Director-General of Sainsbury's Mike Coupe says that the sales will look more like business houses, because a chain of supermarkets is trying to offer better services and non-food products to combat discounted sellers, such as Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened hundreds of sales branches of Argos and also introduced a number of Habitat departments, which are the chains he bought two years ago, and thus increased sales of food and acquisition are even more profitable.
Previous attempt to reconstruct the supermarket department with a cosmetic and pharmaceutical classification ended unfamously.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s tested a joint company with Boots, but the connection ended after the argument on the separation of medicinal products in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s 3 years ago sold his 281 pharmacists for 125 million pounds to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain.
Lloyds should play its role by adding a widespread sort of luxury marks for skin care including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four sales.
Sainsbury’s Trade Director Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We have changed the appearance and style of streets with cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our sorting of marks should satisfy all the needs and the attractive environment and the advantageous positions mean that we now represent a attractive place for buying cosmetics that changes old shopping methods."
Peter Jones is "angered" after Holly Willoughby left the contract for 11 million pounds
The star of Dragons Day Peter Jones "shore" after Holly Willoughby's TV moderator resigned from a contract worth 11 million dollars with his lifestyle mark so that she can focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home clothes and the Trull's accessories.
The instigation of this couple was compared to the Goop actress of Gwyneth Paltrow.
Seventeen-year-old showmoderator announced the departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered the star of the Dragons Day Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last moment – to focus on her new large contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the informationed sources, Jones was "shooting" when a television star at a busy Tuesday meeting at the centre of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, confessed that because of the new contracts, up to 1,5 million pounds, would no longer be able to spend time on their labels of domestic clothing and the Truly.
The substitute was compared to the Goop actress of Gwyneth Paltrow and could double the riches of the modernist Willoughby in the estimated value of 11 million pounds.
When the seventy - year - old Willoughby announced in Instagram that the Truly mark was leaving, Jones left Britain to one of his summer habits.
The unnamed source states: “The Truly mark was the entire priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, which would provide her for tens of years ahead.
Her decision to leave all the participants was totally shocked.
No one could believe what's going on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
The center of Marlow is full of goods ready to sell."
Experts believe that the departure of the moderator show This Morning, which belongs to the most favourable British stars, could cost the company millions due to fat investment in products from pillows and candles after clothing and household clothing and the possible further delay in setting the mark.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded the Truly mark with Tary Capp in 2016 and the 20-year-old Jones joined as chairman of the branch in March.
Pairs ride together on vacation and Jones has 40% share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become Ambassador of M&S and will replace Anta McPartlina when modifying I'm A Celebry to ITV.
The source close to Jones last night said: “We will not comment on his business. ”
The difficult acts “and then we fell in love”
He was joking about the criticism that he would receive from the journalists as a note that some believed as a “looking president ” and how positively he talks about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump replied with his ridiculous "proclaimer" voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that after their June first meeting in Singapore Trump evaluated as a big step to the danuclearization of North Korea, Kim is interested in another meeting.
But the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons were stuck at the dead point.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, a significant North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the United Nations Valn Assembly on Saturday that North Korea from the United States does not see “responsible response” to its first steps to disarmament.
Instead, the United States continues to sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were at the edge of war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
His efforts to improve relations with Kim, he believed, brought positive results — the closure of missile tests, the help to release hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers to the country.
And he defended his unusual approach to information about relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave like the president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people outside into this overwhelmed arena, we should have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said and pointed out a crowd ahead.
Tsunami waves and earthquakes in Indonesia devastateed the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, in the situation after the earthquake of Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations have learned that they are not necessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lomboku population were expelled from their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is an essential assumption to accelerate international assistance.
"In many cases, they gave very clearly that they did not require international assistance, so it is a little difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
The Organization Save the Children is bringing together a team that travels to Palo, but is not yet clear if foreign personnel can work here.
The speaker of the National Disaster Agency Mr. Sutupo said that the Indonesian officials evaluate the situation in Paul to find out whether international organizations will be allowed to help.
Since the earthquake is very often happening in Indonesia, the country is still sadly unprepared to Mother Nature's anger.
Although the ceilings against tsunami were built in Aceh, it is not common on other parts of the coast.
The loss of human lives has likely contributed to the obvious lack of siren warning in Paul against tsunami, even when the warning was issued.
Even in the best time, travel among many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics are even more difficult.
A hospital ship that cocked in Lomboc and helped victims of earthquake is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of new calamity.
Improving the bad Indonesian infrastructure was the main point of President Joko Widodo's election campaign and the president spent a lot of money for roads and railways.
The next year, he will re-elect, but his government is increasing the losses in financing.
President Joko also faces pressure from the persistent sectary tension in Indonesia when members of the Muslim majority accept more conservative form of faith.
The street fights between Christians and Muslims, where gangs use machetes, ports, and arrows and other primitive weapons, have already demanded more than a thousand people and tens of thousands of people have expelled from their homes.

Chelsea led 1-0 in half-time after the belgical star of Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.

Cromwell's Socha in Parliament has recently been hit by arguing about "subscripting history"
His exile would be a punishment for his fanatic puritanian followers in the style of Taliban destroyed many English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "idioticity" and "the effort to rewrite history."
The President of Cromwell Society John Goldsmith says: “In the existing debate on the elimination of the statues, it was unavoidable that one of the goals would become Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell has not ordered or conducted an iconiclasm in English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for his precedent Thomas in the past century."
The excellent formation of Cromwell, whose author is Sir William Thorneycroft, is proof of the view of the 19th century and part of the history of the character that many think they still deserve to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Mnogi people consider Cromwell, even though today less than at the end of the 19th century, for the parliamentary defender against external pressure, of course by monarchy.
The precision of this interpretation is the subject of unconditioning historical debate.
Certainly, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the follow-up development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identified character that represents one side of this area.
His success in the Lord Protector's function is also worth celebrating and reminding."
Killing pigs broke the Chinese farmer
According to local media, the market in southeastern China was attacked and killed by a pig farmer.
As the South China Morning Post journal wrote on Sunday, a man with only the name “Yuan” was found dead with a cross-cutting arterial in the blood claw near the market in Liou-pchan-shui in the Kuy-Chou province.
The pig farmer is preparing to apply the vaccine to pigs at 30 May 2005 in the city of Si-ning in the Chinese province Ching-chai.
He reportedly arrived with his cousin from the Jün-nan side province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door to the side barrel was open.
He said there was a big powder in the powder with blood cream.
According to information, forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg powder of a farmer was broken.
"The Brother had his legs all bloody and crushed," quoted Guiyang Evening News' cousin, named "Wu".
The security camera records show how Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4.40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News journal that the pig was closed so it could not be thought of anyone else when the police gathered evidence at the scene.
The market representatives are allegedly dealing with Yuan's family on compensation for his death.
The attacks of pigs on people are rare, but they have come to them in the past.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband at the farm in Massachusetts and criticiously injured the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300kg pig dragged the Whale farmer to the tractor and dragged him away until the farmer’s wife.
After the oregonic farmer ate his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoby said the CBC News station that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can work as a “launcher”.
"They're just playing.
They're investigators... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remains of the hurricane Rosa will bring a strong rain to the southwest of the United States
Hurican Rosa, according to predictions, weakens and moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the next days, however, north of Mexico and southwest of the United States will bring a flood rain.
At 5:00 a.m., Rosa reached the wind speed of 137 km/h, which represents a category 1 hurricane and was 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific, the beard of low pressure is formed and moves to the east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches Baja California's half-ocean in Monday, he will have a form of tropical storm and start pushing tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico Rosa will bring up to 250 mm collapse on Monday.
The tropical moisture then, with a nearly low pressure scar in the next days, causes a powerful rain in the southwest of the United States.
The batteries of 25 to 100 mm locally cause dangerous influenza floods, streams of supplies and possible landscapes in the desert.
The strong tropical moisture will cause the places to be closer to 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Some locations in the southwest of the United States, especially above the majority of Arizona, are expected to be 50 to 100 mm collapse.
In the rapidly deteriorating conditions, in view of the distracted nature of the tropical rain, there may be inflammatory floods.
Given the danger of tropical crashes, it would be very unreasonable to walk to the desert.
A strong rain can cause the canyons to become rageous rivers, and storms bring local winds and powders.
The nearing breast of low pressure will bring strong local crashes on certain parts of the coast of Southern California.
The total collapse can occur over 13 mm, which could cause smaller streams of sutin and slider cartridges.
It's going to be the first rain period in this region.
On Sunday evening and Monday morning, the only tropical trails will be approached to Arizona, and on Monday night and Tuesday the rain will spread.
On Tuesday, a strong rain will spread to Four corners and will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense temperature changes throughout the United States, because the Arctida is getting cold, but in the tropical zone it will still be warm.
It sometimes leads to severe temperature changes in short distances.
The excellent example of significant temperature differences is the U.S. center on Sunday.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, there is a difference nearly 11 degrees of Celsia.
In the next few today, they will try to reinvigorate summer heat.
Most territories in the Wednesday and East of the United States are expected to start a warm beginning in October with temperatures around 27 °C from the Southern Plans to the northeast of the United States.
In New York City, there could be 27 °C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term prophecy shows in the first half of October the high probability of high average temperatures in the east of the United States.
Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation followed over 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched on six TV channels a quarterly linked statements from the candidate at the judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual attack, which reportedly happened in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political path situation continued, and the voters interrupted regular programs with reports of sudden Friday Return: the agreement that Senator for Arizon Jeff Flake has intervened, that the FBI will conduct a single weekly investigation.
Christine Ford told the Senate's court committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had her drunk at the high school party and tried to take her clothes off.
In his excited deposition, Kavanaugh said that he was 100% sure that it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people were followed by the event as stated by the Nelsen Agency.
The company calculated the average monitoring of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
The numbers for other stations, which transmitted statements, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not available immediately.
And Nelsen is usually in trouble counting people looking at offices.
For comparison, this is a similar number of viewers who watch football games in play-off or participating Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderates strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the greatest tracking of all stations when he was monitored by the Nelsen Agency during the full-day hearing.
The second was the ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
Nelsen states that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2,52 million viewers.
He continued his interest even after the conclusion of the negotiations.
The main character of the Friday Drama was Senator Flake.
After the office of this modest republican announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught on Friday morning, as protesters cried on him when he was about to drive an elevator to the court committee.
CNN was transmitted lively with a few minutes standing with a closed eye and letting it go.
One woman said, "I'm standing right in front of you."
"Do you think the earth is telling the truth?"
He also heard: “You have power, while many women are helpless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement, and even before closing the door of the elevator, he added that he would say more on the negotiations of the committee.
All cables and television networks later broadcast lively when the court committee was to vote for the submission of Kavanaugh's nomination to vote the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if the candidate charged by next week was investigated by the FBI, which demanded a minority of democrats.
Flake partially convinced conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After the interview with Coons and several other Senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have had enough votes to approve of Kavanaugh.
President Trump launched the FBI investigation on the charges charged against Kavanaugh.

Sopka squirrels ashes in Mexico City
Ashes that falls from Popacatepetl soup hit the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.

Before the annual vote of independence, the police struggled with catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesting for independence encountered a regular police and thousands of people joined in competition demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of voting on independence divided by Catalan.
Regular policemen blocked a group of masked separatists who were throwing eggs and powder color after them. The streets that are usually flooded tourists created a dark cloud of dust.
Later, there were also fights for which the police had to use their arms to calm down.
Groups supporting independence during a few hours singing "We will not forget, we will not forgive" faces to protesting Union colleagues who called "Let Spain live".
According to the local press, 14 people were easily injured during protests.
A year after a referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal but separatist catalanists celebrate, remains tension in the region trying to achieve independence still high.
The voters expressed themselves mostly for independence, but the participation in the elections was low, because the opponents of the distraction boicoted them.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to end the vote in the electoral rooms.
Groups supporting independence remained on Friday night outside to prevent demonstrations from supporting the national police.
The demonstration went through, but she had to choose another route.
The 80-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped for independence for Catalan.
"We have experienced one of the best moments last year.
My parents were joyful to vote, but now we are in a blind street," he said.
Despite the important, even though the close victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan party supporting independence had to fight to keep things in progress this year. Many of their most famous leaders either left to exile themselves, or are waiting in custody for their participation in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Twenty-five-year-old Joan Puig monator recorded a protest to support the police on his phone and said that the conflict was blowing up by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is increasingly tense," he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine catalan leaders who have been waiting in prison last year, announced on Saturday that the next year will run to the European Parliament.

Mengo's hit secured Livingstone victory 1-0 over Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Mengy for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, who came from the lower division, shocked the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of 18 matches as the manager of the Ibrox club.
Treff Dolly Mengy turned out to be decisive when Gary Holt's team got to Hibernian in the second place.
Gerrard's team has not yet won this season in the Premiership League on the guest field and next Sunday will be the first Hearts to lose eight points.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has expanded a number of matches without defeat in the division to six fights, so the main coach Holt, who was in charge of Kenny Miller last month, has not yet experienced the defeat.
Livingston did not use a chance against unexpressed guests.
Holt's team should have led a long time before the goal because his directness caused Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson broke into the defense, but he failed in front of the gate, then Alan Lithgow just passed the head of Craig Halkett in front of the gate.
The homes were just watching the Rangers play before them because they knew guests could suffer with standard situations.
And so the key goal came.
Against Rangers, a free cop was ordered, and Livingston created a sculpture, Declan Gallagher and Robinson sent Menga together, which scored and scored the ball in the middle of the penal territory.
In this stage, the Rangers were dominated in the ball, but their home defense was invisible, and the Liam Kelly branner didn't usually have a lot of work to do.
The same image of the game was in the second halftime, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to hit.
Scott Pittman stopped the legs of Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow failed to hit another standard situation in Livingstone.
The centres that persistently cleaned, and two penalty spears came to Livingstone — after Halkett's attack on substitute Glenn Middleton and another hand.
“Fenomen” from Livingstone – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena stadium
Fenomenal performance and results for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception and still overcome expectations on their way up.
Their style of games and men have almost changed since they returned to the spice, but the Holt deserves great commendation for how the team has screwed up since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was awesome, managed a greatly arranged defense, while Menga kept him at Connor Goldson and Joe Worral's emergency all the time.
Rangers are missing inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they're no longer reaching these standards.
Their end was chab – only once they broke into the home side – and for Rangers it should be a wake because they are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan waited for a mixed arrival in the Colin
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered on Saturday (29 September) for breakfast in Berlin, the sky was blue and all the smile.
This is the last day of the controversial visit to President Erdogan in Germany, which aims to fix relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed with a number of themes including human rights, freedom of press and the adoption of Turkey to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Colin, where he opened a huge new mosquito.
The largest Turkish population in this city is outside Turkey.
The police for security reasons prevented the crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the meshite, but many supporters who wanted to see their president appeared in the area.
There were hundreds of people -- many of them Kurds -- protesting against Erdogan, who condemned his policies and decisions of the German government to welcome him in the country.
The opposite protests reflect the controversy of a visitor, which some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others cursed as a autocrat.

Long Lartin prison: Six overseers were injured at anxiety
According to the prison office, six overseers were injured in a male prison with high security.
The disturbance exploded in Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 local time and continues to last.
In order to manage the eruptions involved in eight prisoners in one wing, specialized overseers from the Tornado team were called.
The overseers suffered light wounds and were treated in place.
The prisoner spokesman said: “In order to manage the incident in Long Lartin prison, special training was established by prison workers.

Hurican Rosa threatens floods of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the area where dry is, can benefit)
It is not unusual that Arizona is affected by a tropical breast of low pressure, but it is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week when the remaining hurricane hurricane of Rosa crosss the desert southwest and brings the risk of the inflammatory floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued warnings against floods on Monday and Tuesday from the West Arizona for South and East Nevada, Southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday and brings rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix on Twitter stated that “only ten tropical cyclones have been stored from 320 km from Phoenix the status of tropical storm or pressures below in 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane of 64 km from the border of Arizona."
The latest models of the National Centre for Hurricanes predict the crashs of 50 to 100 mm in the area of Mogollon Rome in Arizona are 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the centre of Scalist mountains and the Great Panve, likely falls from 25 to 50 mm, with local corners to 100 mm.
For those who are not threatened by the inflammation floods, Rosa’s rain may be a blessing because the area has affected dry.
The floods are a very serious thing, but these crashes may help somewhere, because the southwest of the United States has just struck dry.
The weather.com server states that the U.S. Drought Monitor experiences more than 40% of Arizony at least "extreme dry", which is the second highest category.
The road to the hurricane Rosa will first lead to Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa, still with the hurricane strength with the maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, then on Sunday morning will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at 19 km/h north.
Then the storm meets the coldest waters of the Pacific, and he loses power.
It is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, collapses will be strong, which represents a great risk of flood.
“In the area from Baja California to Northwest Sonora, the total collapse of 75 to 150 mm is expected to occur up to 250 mm," states the weather.com server.
Rosa then likes a tropical storm across Mexico north and on Tuesday mornings arrived on the border of Arizona, then passing through Arizona and on Tuesday late evening entering South Utah.
"The main risk of Rosa or her remains is expected to be very strongly collapse in Baja California, Northwestern Sonora and the desert Southwest of the United States," the National Centre for Hurricanes informs.
These rains are expected to cause deadly dangerous floods and streams of waves in the deserts and landscapes in the mountains.

Trump says that Kavanaugh “dose evil and anger” of the Democratic Party
"The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is the rejection of the unreasonable and scandal tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said on the property in Wheeling in Western Virginia.
Trump declared that Kavanaugh during his nomination's process “dose the wickedness and anger” of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh confessed on Thursday before the Congress, where he definitely and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's order that a few decades ago, when teenagers were, he sexually attacked her.
Ford also declared her charges to the negotiations.
The President said on Saturday that day “the American witnesses of Kavanaugh’s greatness and quality and courage. ”
The representative of his supporters from Western Virginia said that “the voice confirming Judge Kavanaugh is confirming one of the most excellent legal brains of our time, a lawyer who has an excellent public service account. ”
The President directed the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about how important it was that the Republicans participated in the elections in the middle of the functioning period.
“Five weeks ago, one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't want to, but I'm still moving," he said.
"So I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump declared that the Democrats decided to “resist and opposition”.
The Governing Council of the Republican Party said the CNN station that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on the ground of the Senate is expected at the latest Friday.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people and the number of victims continues to grow
On Saturday, the authorities announced that after the Indian island Sulawesi affected large earthquakes and tsunamis, at least 384 people lost their lives, many of whom destroyed huge waves flooding the beaches.
At the beach in Palo, on Friday, hundreds of people met at the festival, but at the darkness of the coast, up to six-foot waves that have killed many people and destroyed everything that was in their way.
The wave of tsunami prevented the earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people continued to be on the beach activities and did not escape immediately, so they fell waves for the victim," said the speaker of the Indonezian Agency for the Mitigation of BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroa on the Brifink in Jakarta.
"The wave of tsunami didn't go alone, taking cars, bats, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugro said, and he added that before the coast attack, the wave of tsunami on the open sea spreaded by 800 km/h.
He stated that some people fled the trees and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palo.
Aviation photos published by the Disaster Reduction Agency show a number of destroyed buildings and shops, crushed and broken bridges and water-absorbed mosques.
The consequences were shaken by the coastal city even on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were to feel in a area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonezian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated in its statement that energy was released by fifth-fifth strong tremors was approximately 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb deployed during the second world war in Hiroshim.
The city lies at the end of a long, tight bay, which could still increase the wave of tsunami.
Nugroh described damage as “extensive ” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been denied.
He mentioned that the bodies of some victims were found scattered under the ruins of declined buildings, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugro informed that the number of victims and damages could be greater on the coast of 300 km north of the Palo, in the area called Donggala, near the epicentre of earthquakes.
He said that the communication was “utterly protected without any information” from Donggala.
The red cross in his statement stated that more than 300,000 people live in the area, and complemented that his workers and volunteers are headed to the affected places.
"It's a tragedy, but it could make it worse," the statement says.
The agency was very critical on Saturday because she did not inform Pala that the wave of tsunami had affected, even though the authorities stated that the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In the amateur videos shared in social media, there is a hearing of a man in the higher floor of the building with desperate screaming to warn people on the street from tsunami coming.
In a few minutes the coast will hit a water wall that carrys buildings and cars.
The Reuters agency was unable to check the record immediately.
Agricultural and tsunami waves caused a huge loss of electricity that interrupted communications in the area of the Palo, so the authorities could only coordinate the rescue work.
According to the authorities, the army began sending cargo aircraft with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened only for the transport of aid and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit the evacuation centres in Palo on Saturday.
The number of victims of tsunami in Indonesia climbed to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When the workers of the World Vision of Donggala arrived in the city of Paula, where employees hide in the ceilings built at the courtyard of the office building, they saw images of destruction, says Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed homes," he adds.
It's too bad.
When helping groups began a sad work of help in disasters, some of them complained that foreign workers with great experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
According to the Indonesian legislation, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad may start to the place of calamity until the national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the province level," says speaker of the Indian Red Cross Aulia Ariani.
"When the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster', we can start international assistance, but it is not yet."
When the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami came in Paul, friends and relatives of those who were still unrest, they still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that distract the dark stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a little boy out of the channel on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescue was released from a woman who was two days in prison under the ruins next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidists on the Asian games that ended in Indonesia this month.
Another of the people in Roa Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a person who has been dealing with paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Mr. Gendon emphasized how in the hours followed after the paragliding community learned about the disregard of Roa Roa Roa hotel, he desperately sent messages through whatsApp competing from the Palo, who attended the beach festival.
His news, however, ended with a gray mark instead of a couple of blue pinches.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he says.
The thieves took 26 750 USD during the completion of the Newport bankomate on the Levee
According to the press report of the Newport Police Department, the thieves left on Friday morning 26,750 USD worker Brink while complementing the Newport bankomate on the Levee.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the car driver was emptying the bankomat in the entertainment complex and was preparing to put more money in it.
When he did it, another man “run behind Brink's employees ” and stole a bag of money to be invested in the bankomat.
According to the press report, a number of suspects who fled from the scene were seen by the Witnesses, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in incidents.
Relevant information on the identity of suspects, inform the Newport police on number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West is changing his name – to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: “The creature is formally known as Kanye West. ”
Forty-four-year-old West has a name Ye for a while and he used the pseudonim as the name of his eighth album, which came out in June.
Change comes before his show in Saturday Night Live, where he should introduce his new Yandhi album.
In the show, the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for “sensitive reasons, ” as he stated, the creator of the series.
West has already said that the word for him is other than the abbreviation of the existing professional name and the religious meaning.
“I think it's the most used word in the Bible where “ye” means “ye”,” West was told at the beginning of this year when he spoke about his album with the Big Boy Radio moderator.
"So I am you, I am us, it's us.
It's changed from Kanya, which means the only one to just Ye – just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are."
The name has also changed a number of other famous rapers.
Sean Combs was known in various periods as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love (love) and Brother Love.
The former West colleague, J.Y.-F., also wrote his name with a collaborator and without it and with large and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the army against civilians
At the occasion of the 50th anniversary of bleeding attack against students, the freshly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador committed never to use the military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that “he will never use the army to oppress the people of Mexico. ”
At the time the left student movement spread across Latin America, the soldiers of October 2, 1968 started shooting people at a peaceful demonstration in the Square and killed up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador was committed to supporting young Mexicans by paying monthly support to students and opening other free public universities.
He declared that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education dragged young people into criminal gangs.
United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
According to the investor and expert on the artificial intelligence of Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active and the US should double the amount they are exercising for research in this area.
The comment comes after the various parts of the US government have announced the AI, even though the US has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence as a whole.
In the meantime, China introduced a plan last year, according to which he wants to be a single one in the innovative AI by 2030.
"Double AI research budget would be a good beginning, since all other countries are far further than the USA and we are looking for another breakdown in AI," Lee says.
Lee, in an interview for CNBC this week, stated that double funding could double the chance that the next large discovery in the area of AI will be done in the US.
Lee, who published this month in Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's book “Supervelmocy AI: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order”, is the Director-General of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most significant AI companies in China, Face++.
In the University of Carnegie Mellon, in the 1980s, he worked on the AI system that overcome the best American player in the game of Othello, and later he was head of the research worker of Microsoft and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee evaluated the previous technological competitions of the US government, such as the Robotic challenge of the Agency of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next one would be to help identify new visioners.
Researchers in the United States often need to try hard to obtain government grants.
"Academic peaks do not take China but corporation," Lee says.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have been employed in recent years by the best universities experts to work on artificial intelligence.
In order to improve efforts in the field of AI, the United States could also help change in immigration policy.
"I think the doctorate's owners in the AI field should be automatically offered by green cards," he says.
The State Council of China issued the Plan for the development of the artificial intelligence of a new generation in July 2017.
China's National Fundation of Natural Sciences provides finances to people in academic institutions similarly as the National Science Council and other government organizations give money to researchers in the United States, but quality of academic work is worse in China, says Lee.
The U.S. Ministry of Defence established this year the Joint Intelligence Centre to be involved by partners from the sector and the academic environment, and the White House announced the creation of the Election Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that she invested 2 billion USD in an AI Next initiative.
With regard to NSF data, it now invests more than 100 million USD per year in research.
However, the U.S. legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not done anything for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum whether they want to change the country's name
Macedonia's people voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed to “Republic of North Macedonia”, which would solve a few decades old dispute with Greece, blocking the requests for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbour represents the right to its territory and therefore vets Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded a new agreement in June on the proposed name, but the nationalist opponents suggest that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slovak population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov declared that he would not vote in the referendum, and a boycot calling campaign raised doubts whether at least 50 percent of the voters would be delivered to the referendum in order to be valid.
The question in the referendum was: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with Greece's agreement?"
The applicants of the change in the name, including the President of the Government of Zorana Zaeva, argue that this is the price worth paying to make Macedonia, one of the former Yugoslavia successive countries.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the roof of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," says 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not binding, enough members of Parliament have said that they will be followed by the results of the vote.
The change in the name would require a two-third majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no problems were reported in 13 hours.
The vote was, however, only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of the registered votes eventually renewed their vote.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old voter from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško are giving up their votes in the Macedonian referendum on the change of the name, which would open the country's way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is preparing a small stage to the parliament and drawing chairs before the states built by people who are boicoting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with a head arising, not a door to the service," Kavadarkov says.
“We are poor land, but we have our pride.
If they don't want us like Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the euro-Assia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring Macedonia, which has a level of unemployment exceeding 20%, as much as necessary investment.
"I think the great majority will be for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
The result “yes ” would be“ confirmation of our future. ”
According to an examination published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute last Monday, the referendum could participate between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters, which is less than the required participation.
In another study organized by the Macedonian TV station Telma, it was found that 57 percent of the respondents would vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote yes.
In order to make the referendum successful, it must be evaluated by 50% plus one voter.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first serious injury for the Western government policy since its entry in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has come for a goal through the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made the defense of Brighton on Saturday, and thus secured Manchester City win 2-0 on the Etihad stadium in Manchester.
In Aguer's application, his goal in the 65th minute seemed ridiculous.
It all started with an argentin's attacker in the middle of the field.
He printed between the three brayton defenders and got into the open space.
Then Aguer was surrounded by four green dresses.
On the edge of the penal territory of Brighton, he circled around one defender and ran a few other.
He found Sterling next on the left.
The English attacker put the ball back in the penal territory to Aguer, who right-handed Brighton Brancher Mathew Ryan by shooting the right side of the network.
"Aguero has a problem with legs," the reporters announced the city manager Pep Guardiola.
“We thought he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's what it was.
We were lucky he gave it a goal at that time."
Initial advantage for Sky Blues in this game Premier League but he arranged Sterling.
This goal fell in 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the territory of Brighton.
On the left, he sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane processed his ball and then sent Sterling to a remote stick.
The Sky Blues attacker put the ball in the network just before he slipped off the field.
City will play Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the League of Masters at Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the joy of Rockies
When Nationals were expelled from the play-off fight, there were no many reasons to come again.
But an eternal competitive Scherzer hopes on Sunday to be placed in a fight against Colorado Rockies – only when they will have Rockies who run in NL West for one game over Los Angeles Dodgers, hope for play-off.
Rockies secured at least a wild card on Friday night by victory 5-2 over Nationals, but they still want to get their first title in the division.
"If we don't play anything, we can at least start, because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will play about the greatest effort I'm going to experience this year.
Why don't I want to play it?"
Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but they are allegedly up to throw Scherzer for such a situation.
For Scherzer, it would be the 34st start.
The right-hand steererer of Washington has 18-7 statistics in this season with 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 shifts.
Trump set up at a meeting in Western Virginia
The President indirectly expressed the situation around his candidate at the judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about how important it is that the Republicans take part in the elections in the middle of the functional period.
"There will be everything we have done in November.
One of the most important choices of our lives remain five weeks.
It's one of the great, big - I don't do it, but we're still moving and I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see that horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see it happens right now.
And they're determined to take over the power with any necessary means, you see the wickedness, the immorality.
They don't care who they're hurting, whom they have to overcome to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give it to them."
Democrats, according to him, decided for “a resistance and opposition. ”
"And you see it in the last four days," he added, and said that the Democrats were "angered and angry and disgusting and lying."
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Court Commission, the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a loud bullet in the public.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, what?
No, no, wait -- it was really a bad body speech -- the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
The Labourist Party is no longer a variety of view flows.
He is not tolerant to those who express their views
When activists from the Moment in my local country voted for my comment, it wasn't a surprise.
Finally, I am the last of a number of labourist messengers who have said they were not welcomed – because they honestly said their opinion.
My colleague from parliament Joan Ryan treated the same thing as because she resisted anti-semitism.
In my case, I was criticised that I disagreed with Jeremy Corby.
In view of the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, paradoxally similar issues that Jeremia has disagreed with previous leaders.
The report on the Friday meeting of the Labourist Party at Nottingham East stated that “we want meetings to be accessible and productive. ”
Most of the eight years since I was a local member of the Parliament for the Labour Party, GC meetings were exactly like this on Friday night.
Today, unfortunately, most meetings do not take place, and the promise of “greater, more politics” has long been forgotten if it has ever started.
It is increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the labourist side and every view is estimated to be acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, and the colleagues I thought we had similar political views, suddenly expected that I would turn 180 degrees and I would stand the positions with which I could otherwise not agree – whether it was national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in the public -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- then the tirada on social networks, where they call for my appeal, they condemn the environment policy and tell me that I should not be on the labourist side.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments on me are usually political.
I have respect for professionality and determination of the colleagues who face every day the inflammation of sexist or racist insults, but they will never resign.
One of the aspects of this era of politics from which I am most disappointed is how insults become a standard.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labourist Party should grow a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a variety of views and with every proposal to express uncertainty or to change the selection rules, the party becomes more limited.
In the past two years, I was encouraged to stay back, not to call so much, and then “I will be fine. ”
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I have entered the Labourist Party as a school student 32 years ago, the lack of care for Margaret Thatcher, who let my class of general school break down literally, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most – whether or not as a local council or minister of the government.
I've never hid my policy, even in the last elections.
No one at Nottingham East could be surprised by my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the existing leadership.
For those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would say only that when the country comes to Brexit, which damages households, businesses and our public services, I do not want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labourist Party.
Of course, my main message is not assigned to the Moment in Nottingham, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Labourist Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of appeal or political pragmatism will save me from acting according to what I think is the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr rose to the top
Two late fives screwed the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved in this incredibly fun match Tennent's Premiership triumph.
Now they're headed by the tables, like the only unbelievable.
Finally, it was an excellent defense and better use of chances that helped the home to win, and the coach Peter Murchie had the right to be satisfied.
"We have been through great tests in our fights and we are still invincible, so I must be happy," he says.
Robyn Christie from Melrose says: “All the honour of Ayra, they have taken a better chance than us. ”
Fifth Granta Andersona in 14 minutes, transformed by Frazier Clim, sent Ayr forward, but the yellow card for the Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who was released by Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to use the number of advantages and Jason Baggot won an unchanged five.
Climo increased the leadership of Ayra with penalto and then just in half-time scored and changed the salt experiment, so he fixed to 17-5 for Ayra.
But Melrose started the second half well and the five of Patrick Anderson, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a longer delay because of a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who left the field on his noses, and when he started playing again, Ayr again jumped through the five of Stafford McDowall, which Climo transformed.
The representative captain Blair Macpherson then received the yellow card and Melrose again used the players with the unchanged five Bruce Colvina after a short pressure.
The households, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got yellow for the attack of Clima without the ball, MacPherson put the ball from the penalt order behind the progressive maule of Ayra.
Climo changed, again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe grabbed David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth five homes.
The Still Game Star starts a new career in hospitality
It appears that the star of the Still Game Ford Kieran is moving into the field of hospitality. It was found to be appointed by the director of the licensed restaurant company.
Sixty-five-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show, who writes and plays with a long-year comedial partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the coming ninth series would be the last series of series, and it seems Kiernan's already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the statement from the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but the source of the Scottish Sun journal indicated that Kiernan wanted to join the “prosperous business in restaurants” in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours," inland Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Navy guards in front of the Navy Command in La Paz, which is decorated by chain.
Over the public buildings, the blue flag is flagged in the ocean color.
The sea bases from the lake Titicaca for Amazon are described by the password: “The sea is our right.
Getting it is our duty."
In the entire Bolivia, there is still a live memory of the coast that the country has lost for Chile in the bloody war on sources in the 19th century – as the desire to rebuild the Pacific.
These desires may be the biggest in a few decades, because Bolivia is waiting for a decision of the international court, which should fall on October 1, after five years of year-olding.
"Bolivia has energy, spirit of unity and calmness and, of course, expects a positive result," said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will monitor MSD decisions on large screens throughout the country with hope that the Hague Tribunal will decide in favour of the Bolivian claim that, after many decades of interviews interrupted, Chile is obliged to deal with Bolivia's sovereign approach to the sea.
The charismatic national President of Bolivia Evo Morales, who has a controversial battle on the re-election of the next year, is also very interested in the Monday decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court decides for the benefit of Bolivia – and even if it did, it would not have changed much.
This U.S.A. has no power to advocate a Chile territory with the Netherlands and has stated that it will not determine the results of possible interviews.
The fact that the decision of the MSD comes only six months after the last arguments have been made, shows that the case was “not complex”, as Paz Zarate, chile expert on international law.
And for the last four years, they didn't only support Bolivia's thing, but maybe they'd rather cut it down.
"The existing Bolivian government has been empowered to approach the sea," Zarate says.
It adds that Morales' attack rhetoric has weakened all the remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will begin to act again once again, but after this, it will be extremely difficult to lead discussions.
Both countries have not changed Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Deputy Bolivia in Hague, rejected the idea that the decision of the court was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “specific opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the chance to“ end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits”, he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales -- still one of the most favorite presidents in Latin America -- would use the question of the sea as a political garlic.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless the United States can believe.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his people will never arm their nuclear weapons first if he can't trust Washington
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations Valn Meeting.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made at the summit of the leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to restart the nuclear diplomacy that she has stuck at a dead point for more than three months for a Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Une.
Ri says that it is “playing hope” that the permanent sanctions and the opposition of the United States against the declaration that ends the Korean war could sometimes hit the North on the knees.
Washington is careful about the consent of the declaration if Pchjongjang first does not make significant steps to disarmament.
Kim and President of the U.S. Donald Trump want a second summit.
Of course, the general skepticism is that Pchjongjang seriously thinks that he will renounce this arsenal, which the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo wants to visit Pchjongjang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris show shows that your fashion shops will soon arrive in the latest trend of huge head covers.
If you want to expand your collection of hats or completely block the sun, your search is over.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne discovered a number of huge head covers for their spring/summer 2019 collections on the show that in Paris' week of fashion all captured.
Very irrespective hats this summer flooded Instagram, and these designers sent their exciting creations on the beach.
The exhibition piece of Valentin was overwhelmed by a bee hat with a wide edge of a pearl that floated the heads of the models.
Other excessively large supplements were decorations, witch hat, and even ananas – but they are not intended to warm the head.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the coloured masks have sewed lips and remind Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One manufacturing reminded the swimming equipment also with the blanket and the glasses, while another looked like a ice cream cream.
And if you continue with a huge fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion scholars predict that huge hats could also arrive in fashion shops.
The overrailed hats come after the "La Bomba", a half-meter broad crempe that everyone wore from Rihanna to Emily Rataikovski.
The cultural mark behind this very unpractical hat flooded by the social media has sent to the show mole another enormous creation – a slammed beach bag, which is almost as large as a model in the swimming swimming.
Dark orange rafia bag lemmed by rafia shakes and handcuffed with white skin handcuffs on Paris Week was the exhibition of La Riviera's spring/summer 2019 from Jacquemuse.
The famous Luke Armitage stylelist said for F.Š.A.: “I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in fashion summer shops – since the designer has so great success with them, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for excessively large supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a number of academic successes, and it continues in 2018 with other excellent results of the tests. Individual and group successes in sports, artistic, musical, and other community activities only underline it.
These schools have more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools – SCIS, and are trying to provide their students and parents with the best level of services.
Independent schools prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As a education sector that can propose and implement individually adapted school education plans, we observe that modern languages in schools are still favorite and demanded subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man the language he understands, it goes straight into his head.
If you speak with him his own tongue, it goes straight to his heart."
It is a significant note that if we want to build relations and trust in people from other countries, we cannot rely on English only.
The latest results of this year's tests show that the languages are at the first place of tables, and the highest level of success have independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign language have reached the best signs of A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that the highest mark A reached 72 per cent of the students of Mandarin, 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will need in the future.
Languages as the subjects the students choose, in the study plans of independent schools and other schools are equally evaluated as the subjects of STEM (science, technology, technical obstacles and mathematics).
The examination carried out by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, for the reasons of which employers refer as difficulties in the employment of free places, 17 per cent of the insufficient language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly needed in preparing young people for their future career.
Since more job opportunities require languages, these skills are necessary in the globalized world.
Whatever a person chooses any career, if he learns the second language, he will have a real advantage in the future that he has such a lifetime skill.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person speaking more languages will receive automatic advantages before competitiveness.
According to the research organized by YouGov in 2013 among 4,000 adults in Great Britain, 75 percent of them were unable to speak foreign language well enough to make conversations, with the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, specifically 15%, was French.
It is therefore important for children today to invest in language learning.
If children know more languages, especially the languages of economies developing, they will have a greater chance to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school is different from what languages he teaches.
A variety of schools focuses on more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be the most important for Great Britain in the view of 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child is interested in, he will always have in independent schools to choose from several languages with teachers who are in the field of experts.
Scotland's independent schools are devoted to providing educational environments that children prepare and equip the skills needed for success, whatever they are expected in the future.
At this point, the languages in the global business environment are essential for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and remarkableness to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will first present in the Lakers dress on Sunday in San Diego
The fans who are looking forward to the first time LeBron James comes to Los Angeles Lakers, will soon wait.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James will play the Sunday opening game in San Diego against Denver Nuggets.
But it's not clear how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton announced on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James will probably play a limited number of minutes.
Last week after training, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the pre-session.
"In this stage, I don't need my career for pre-season matches," he said.
Tramp's performance in Western Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts the campaign wave.
It's the first one of the five maths planned for the next week, including a stop in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the cessation of the vote on the confirmation of his candidate for a free place in the highest court, Trump wants to receive support for the coming elections in the middle of the mandate, as the Republicans stand in November's elections before the risk of the loss of Congress.
What time does Trump's performance start tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Tramp's meeting in Wheeling in Western Virginia is planned at 19:00 east time, today on Saturday 29 September 2018.
Trump's matrix in Western Virginia you can watch online below via live transfer to YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the hearing of a candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, which took place this week and was very tense for the accusation of inappropriate sexual behaviour. The confirmation of the Senate is expected to be delayed a week before the FBI investigation was conducted.
But the main goal of this wave is to help the Republicans get a pace before the November elections.
According to the Reuters campaign organizers, President Trumpa said that these five meetings next week are intended to “add energy to volunteers and supporters so that the Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority that they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives”.
"The control of the Senate is so important for his agenda that the president will take campaigns to as many states as possible," said the Agenda Reuters speaker of Trump's campaign that did not wish to be appointed.
According to the West Virginia Metro News radio station, weapons in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could be arrived from “Ohia and Pennsylvania and could be watched by the media from Pittsburgh.”
On Saturday, it will be twice in the last month when Trump will visit Western Virginia, in which he won more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Senate for Western Virginia Patrick Morrisey who remains in the research.
"For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the president has to come to help him in research," says a politician from the Westovirgen University Simon Haeder, according to the Reuters agency.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team showed that it has to fight the stomach to keep hopes from Sunday singles
After three unicorn attacks, Saturday couples may be exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
The floating whiskey is a totally invented sport concept, but the players really trust him, and the most in such competitions.
So where's the whiskey going now?
"They led about six points and now it's four, so we take it in a way that the whiskey is probably moving a bit towards us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Of course Europe has the advantage, leads by four points, and they remain twelve.
As Spieth says, the Americans feel that they have a little wind in sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, for example, the forms of Speethe and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and everyone can admire three points of four.
Spieth was dying when he passed from the green fireplace and went by an example.
The celebrated screams still strengthened the continuation of his bike when he managed to get the whole game when Thomas and I had two holes behind.
His path, who won the 15-hour game, met with a similar cry that tells you that the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own fight," Spieeth said.
That's all these players have left.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, certainly the main story of Ryder cup.
The strange, but cute couples from Europe are four of four, and they can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood was the only couple who did not hit the hole on Saturday afternoon, but passed on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again on Friday morning."
The progress and the way energy flows both to the stormful audience, and confirms from it that these are the players designed for Sunday victory, and that there will be no more favorite player than Fleetwood or Molinari in the sunset.
It's best both at the same time for a different hole.
However, the talks about European glory remain early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson worked shortly with Sergey Garcia, the hero of the morning games of four balls when he was parsed with Alex Noren.
The hole and two dables on the front nine were buried by Spain and Sweden into a ruin that they did not go out of.
But on Sunday, no one will help you.
The games of two two balls are so fascinating when you closely watch the interaction of people in a couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and by the last day it has taken a significant impact, but this game of two couples has also shown that the US team has a stomach for combating, which some, in particular from the states, doubted.
By the final day, Ryder Cupu leads Europe by score 10-6 points
Europe gets a healthy advantage by the last day Ryder Cupu, then from the Saturday games of two balls, it came up with a scope of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who reportedly won almost twice over the fighting Tiger Woods, decided to make four cuts in Le Golf National.
The European Party with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to keep the trophy lost in Hazeltine, dominated in the morning games on two balls with the American side that failed in series 3-1.
The United States showed more resistance in four, wins two fights, but they couldn't get into a deficit.
The party of Jim Furyk needs eight points from the Sunday 12 matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European new man who wins four points behind, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood" after the senzation weekend, are only the second couple who won four points from his four introductory matches in Ryder Cupu history.
After the defeat of the Woods and Patrick Reed players in the game on two balls and then smoothly beat the tired Woods and the US Newman Bryson Dechambeau even more emphasized 5+4.
Woods, who dragged two matches on Saturday, showed occasional glows of brilliance, but now lost 19 his 29 matches in the game of two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting after the morning game on two balls, returned to Henry Stanson's partner in the 2&1 defeat of Dustina Johnson and Brooks Koepky - units and threes in the world's ladder.
However, Europe did not have it on this pleasant fresh day south-west of Paris victory throughout the line.
The three-fold major Jordan Spieth winner and Justin Thomas ran two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a hard 2&1 victory over Spain John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game on two balls and returned later to beat the two Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the game of couples, although the first two holes lost.
Only twice in Ryder Cupu history, the team returns from the four-point deficit to the two games, even though as the defender of the Furyk Party needs only a remiss to gain the trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days, it seems to be a Sunday attack behind them.
North Korea says that “in no case” will not be armed unilaterally and without trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday that the continued sanctions of the United Nations have deepened their confidence in the United States and, under such circumstances, the country will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at its annual valuable meeting that North Korea adopted the “relevant measures of goodwill” in the past year, such as the stop of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of nuclear tests and promises that nuclear weapons and nuclear technology will not be spread.
"But we do not see the corresponding response by the US," he said.
"Beyond confidence in the United States, trust in our national security will not be found, and under such circumstances it is not possible to be unilaterally disarmad."
While Ri repeated the famous North Korean complaints on the resistance of Washington against the “proceeding” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for each step, his statement appeared significant in the fact that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization only because Pchjongjang had been through it in the past.
Ri mentioned the joint statement issued by Kim Chong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim had committed to working on the “denauclearization of Korean polooster” while Trump pledged security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea seeks a formal end of the 1950-53 war conflict, but the United States said Pchjongjang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the challenge to release hard international sanctions against North Korea.
“United States insist on ‘annuclearisation first’ and increase the pressure on sanctions to force their goals and even object to ‘the announcement of the end of the war’”, said Ri.
"The impression that sanctions can lead us to knees is a dream of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions deepen our untrustedness."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader emphasized in the United Nations earlier weekly.
Instead, the Minister emphasized three meetings of Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: “If this question of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not come into such a patch situation.”
However, the ton of Riho’s speech was dramatically different from the last year, when he told the UN Valley Meeting that the targeting of North Korea's missiles in the U.S. territory was inevitable after the "Mr. Bad President" Trump named Kim "rake man" for a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations Trump, who threatened “a total destruction” of North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take steps to disarmament, but said that there is still a lot of work to do and the sanction must remain in force until North Korea is fully denuclearized.
In Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame, he said: “If it takes two years, three or five months, it doesn't matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pchjongjang for the measures taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that “the promotion of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue clearly and without standing until we realize the complete, final, verified denuclearization”
The Security Council is unanimously supporting the sanctions against North Korea since 2006, trying to undermine the financing of nuclear programmes and balistic Pchjongjangu missile programmes.
Pompeo and Ri met at the United Nations valuable meeting by the party and Pompeo declared that next month they would visit Pchjongjang to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left Pchjongjang in July and declared that progress was made so that North Korea declared that he had “gangster requirements”.
North Korea has committed a meeting with the Moon this month to demonstrate the missile area and the nuclear complex, if the United States adopt “suitable measures”.
He stated that Kim informed him that “suitable measures” he hoped that the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore to normalize relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard attend the course to teach them sufficient rest
The new course at the Harvard University has forced all his students to sleep more, trying to fight the growing macho culture study all night when students don't sleep and encourage themselves with caffeine.
Academy found that students in the world's most famous universities are often helpless when it comes to the foundations of care for themselves.
The course proposed Charles Cheisler, a doctor for sleep at the Harvard Medical School Faculty and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and a woman's hospital that he believes is the first of his species in the United States.
He was inspired to start a course after he lectured on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“A girl came to me at the end and said, ‘Why are you telling me this just now, in my last year? ’
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep -- which surprised me," said the Telegraph.
The course, which was first presented this year, explains the basic information to students about how good sleep habits help the academic and athletic performance and improve their overall comfort.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatric professor at Harvard Medical School and the executive Director of the University Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce a course after finding that students were really unsleep during the week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of student railways where students click on cups with coffee, jackets, tennis and books on the effects of caffeine and light and how the athletic performance is affected by the lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleeping habits.
In other parts, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, infarction, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the behavior of students will not immediately change.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes to health," said Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride in "study all night" still exists, he added that modern technologies and still increasing pressure on students mean that there is also a problem of lack of sleep.
The enough sleep of good quality should be a “secret weapon ” of a student to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gathering, because sleep deprivation switchs the brain into the hunger regime, so a person is still hungry.
Raymond So, 19 - year - old California student of chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler propose a course that was graduated from one of his classes during the first year last year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push the whole course.
He hopes that the next step will request all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before entering a competitive institution.
The professor recommended students to consider alarm setting for the time to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lights that can resolve your circadianic rhythm, which leads to problems with sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal drowned Gerrard's husband
The Rangers suffered another loss when the Dolly Mengy hit identified Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with 1-0 defeat in Livingstone.
The Ibrox party tried to record its first victory from 4 to 1 February on St Johnstone, but the team of Gary Holt caused only the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 games as a manager to leave his post eight points from the front leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time, and the Rangers' composition seemed without inspiration and determination to combat.
While the Rangers are now falling to the sixth place, Livingston slips to the third and right behind the Hybernian team to the same gate.
And there could be more problems with the Rangers after the line judge Calum Spence had been treated with the head injury after he was apparently hit by the object from the perspective.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side, which moved around Ayr to Betfred Cupu semifinal.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who picked up the Hearts points last week and would have been happy as his well-trained men choked his rival on every step.
Rangers may have controlled holding, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were supposed to score only two minutes after the first time Menga let Scott Pittman go to the Allan McGregor gate, but the hostage buried his great chance.
The far free cop of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner Alan Lithgow could only try at the back post.
The Rangers took over control, but it seemed to be more hope than faith in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he should have a penalty for a four-hour lead when Steven Lawless and I had crashed, but the judge Steven Thomson distracted the Colombian challenge from the table.
The Rangers only made two targets in the first half, but the former Ibrox Liam Kelly branner was surprised by the head of Lassana Coulibala and a mild shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener could have been against the game run after 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserved it for the time.
The Rangers weren't able to deal with the deep Jacobs set again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and picked Menga for a easy final.
Gerrard took action at the break and exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had almost an immediate result when the wing crashed into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly struggled from the line and the attack blocked.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into the game of exactly the kind they like when Lithgow and Halkett metaled one long ball at the other.
Holt's side could have deepened its acceleration in the final stages, but McGregor was well up to block Jacobs before Litgow ran out of the corner.
Rangers Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim to penalty when he was screwed up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned back.
Almanach: Inventor of Geiger's Readers
And now the page from our Sunday morning: 30 September 1882, today it is 136 years, and it is still coming... the day the future physics Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measureing radioactiveness, an invention that eventually led to a device known as Geiger's reader.
Scientific staircase Geiger Counter also became a statistical pop culture, as in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado”, in the main role of those seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
A man: "What is this for God?"
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s reader, used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you put these listeners on, you can really hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactiveness in minerals.
Evans: “Oh, yeah, now it's really blowing up! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that brings his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The method includes extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation in the lab
Then they can "see" protein that is common to many cancers, and then again injected
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with several types of cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine teaching the immune system to recognise dangerous cells has disappeared from an egg cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their transformation in the lab, so they can "see" protein common in many cancers called HER2 and then be re-used into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “conducts the growth of several types of cancer”, including breast cancer, eggs, lungs and colorectal carcinom, explained Professor Berzofsky.
Similar approach when immune cells were taken from patients and “learned” is to focus on cancer cells, it has already been promoted in leukemia treatment.
Kanye West attended the pro-trump preaching, in his magic cap, after his appearance at the SNL.
It didn't work very well.
Kanye West was printed in the Saturday Night Live studio after a confused performance during which he praised President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After he songed the third song that night called the Ghost Town, in which his hat made America Great Again, he started swimming to democrats and repeated his support to President Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, "How much can you like Trump, is he a racist?"
If I had been disturbing racism, I wouldn't have been in America for a long time," he said.
SNL started a show of parodia with Matt Damon in the main role where the Hollywood Star was joking about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Court of Justice on Ford's rape from Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't transmitted, West's theatrical speech records were recorded on the social media by Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to laugh at West.
West also complained to the watchers that he had had his decoration of his head eaten well in the behind the scene.
“In the afternoon, I was screwed.
They said, "Don't go there with that hat."
That's bullshit!
They also said I was in the wrong place," the Washington Examiner said.
West continued: "Would you like to see the wrong place?" and added that he would "pull his superman suit because that means you can't say what to do." You want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments served only the bucking of the audience at least twice and the SNL members seemed disgusted, desperate, says Varieta, and one person even said: “The whole studio has been completely silent.”
West was invited as a late replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many present by singing the song I Love dressed as a bottle of water Perrier.
West received support from the TUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the most brave characters: Thank you for setting the SES on the DAV.”
But the hosting talk show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was just who he was, and that's absolutely amazing.
"But I WANT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “art”), which I believe he represents and sends to the world the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us," she added.
Before the show, Rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist who changed his name and goes in the tracks of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.

Game Thrones star Kit Harrington has been released into toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is famous for his role Jona Snow with a sword in his hand in the violent medium-century fantasy of the HBO series.
The actress, 31 years old, however, came out of the macho hero stereotype and said that such role on the screen means that young boys often feel that they must be claimed to deserve respect.
The Sunday Times Culture Kit said that he believed that “something is wrong” and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the era #MeToo.
The Whale, who recently married his star on the throne of Rose Leslie, also admitted that this problem was “intensely strongly expressed. ”
"In this moment I feel personally, quite strongly - what happened so bad to the masculine?" he said.
"What do we teach adolescents about the problem we now see here?"
Kit believes that television can partially be responsible for the rise of toxic maleness because of its very male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What do the boys learn on TV, on the streets, they grow to feel that every man needs to have a web page like that?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how to change it?
Because youths must have changed to worse.
In the interview, he also admitted that he won't play in no prequel or sequel Games of throne after the end of the series, because he has enough “feathers and horses”.
Since November, Kit will play in renewed Right West Sam Shepard, a story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently discovered that meeting with his current wife Rose for the best of the throne Game.
“ I recognized my wife when I filmed the series, so he gave me my future family and my entire life, ” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of the love of the character of Keith, Jona Snow, in this fantasy series evaluated by Emma's price.
A couple married in June 2018 in the lands of Leslie's family house in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China indicates 14% increase in new cases
China announced 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people are affected in the country according to official numbers.
In the second quarter of 2018, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant a change against the past.
HIV is traditionally spread over some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have infected HIV in this way has been declined nearly to zero, the Chinese healthcare stated at the Yunnan Province Conference.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people annually.
Transfer of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is allegedly increasing.
In view of the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of disease originate from insufficient sexual protection in these contacts.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised a universal approach to HIV treatment as part of the attempt to solve this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff would let the GOP data of the Senators avoid, the term "safe lies" and "conspiration theory"
The American Ambassador Maxine Waters condemned on Saturday that a member of her employees sent three Republican American senators to the lawmakers.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that the charges were supported by “ultra-regulars” scientists and websites.
"Lyes, lies and other disgusting lies," Waters said in her statement on Twitter.
The information published reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for American Senators. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the negotiation of the Senate for Sexual abuse by the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
There was some time when three Senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address, which is the source of contributions, is linked to the Waters office and published information on members of Waters' staff, says Hill.
"This unfair claim is absolutely false and absolute lie," Waters continued.
“Article of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been threatened as a result of these fraud and false accusations - has not been in any case responsible for the escape of this information.
This unfair claim is absolutely false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly served online criticism, including the former press secretary of the White House of Ariho Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that there is no temperament to be a member of the Congress."
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he can't be mad.
He can't be opposed.
He must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They must be calm and not excited."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the criticism of democrats towards Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticised because he seemed too angry during the quarter hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who took part in the election against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If that was true, it would have been something," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office warned “the competent authorities and authorities acting in criminal proceedings on these fraud.
"We shall ensure that the perpetrators are revealed," she continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for everyone and all members of my staff."
Johnny English again interferes with reviews – weaker spy parodie Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to look for Brexit in every new film with British tendency, which seems to be the case of this renewal of Johnny English in a series of action parodies - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this drunk satira on the topic how obviously bad nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this exhausted, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to screw this thing again in a completely new way - that name more than anything else signal that it was a wide comic creation designed for non-Anglish speaking kinematographic audience.
Of course he's the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has a little of inspector Clouseau, a patch from Mr. Bean and a great piece of that guy who sang the only tone in the Chariots of Fire at the celebrity beginning of the Olympic Games in London 2012.
The character is also originally based on a traveler and an international mysterious man played by Atkinson once in the already forgotten Barclaycard advertising, leaving chaos behind.
In this last edition, there are one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in the middle-aged armor, and the rotor's hatches were shortly crushing about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exposed, but humor feels quite subdimensional and strangely superior, especially when "serious" filmmarks such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offering a comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is rather as if it was designed for children than adults, and for me the crazy tramps of Johnny English are so inventive and focused, as Atkinson's quiet film gags in the person of Mr. Bean.
The continuing prediction is that the Great Britain has serious problems.
Cybernetic hacker infiltrated the British super-secret web spy network and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field to scare an agent in the service - too little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for the Prime Minister, which is a pomped and obsessed figure that is already suffering under the complete decline of political inpopularity: Emma Thompson plays this work of Theresa May as best as possible, but there is nothing in the scenario.
Her rapporteur's advisors inform her that once each active spy is threatened, he will have to retire someone.
This means that Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a director in some luxury device, but also gives a record lesson about how to be a secret agent: there are a few nice gags, because English offers a spy academy like Rock School.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and met with his former long-term partner Bough, who was playing Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man who lives with a submarine commander, an effective character that Vicki Pepperdine's talent may be wasting a little bit.
So Batman and Robin in packing tasks for her majesty's secret services, they are back in action and meet with the beautiful femme fatals of Ophelia Bullet, which Olga Kurylenko played.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously subjected to the magic of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims that she can solve British computer crimes: a vicious Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyse full of frascowful pattals: masked as waiters will burn the French restaurant; they will create chaos when they go through Volta's luxury yachts; and English will start pure anarchy when they try to know with the inside of Volt's house.
All essas are certainly ready for this last sequence, but whatever she is kind and violent, she has something in her child's television.
It's quite a measure matter.
And like the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't think: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson the role that really fits his talent?
Labourists deny that they would develop an English plan to work four days a week to get paid in five days.
The Labourist Party of Jeremy Corbyn should consider a radical plan where the British will work four days a week and pay for five.
The Party allegedly wants the boss of the company to transfer to workers the savings resulting from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
The employees would enjoy the class weekend, but they would still take the same reward.
The sources argue that this idea would "have come" to the Economic Agenda of the Party and plans to boost the country for workers.
The transition to the four-day working week was approved by the Congress of the Communities as a way that workers can use changing economies.
A long-term labour member stated for Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but the four-day working week is the wish that falls into the positions of the party to balance the economy for worker and the total industrial strategy of the party."
The Labourist Party will not be the first to support this idea, the Green Party has promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the labour party as a whole.
Labourist speaker said: “The four - day working week is not the policy of our party, and the party does not take it into account. ”
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to fill his vision of socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell declared that he was determined to return energy from "anonymous directors" and "scientists" in utilities.
The Shadow Officer's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies do not have to return to their total shares, as the labour government could carry out “speeds” on the basis of a notified prosecution.
He also confirmed the plans to place employees in the company's administrative councils and to create own property funds that will provide 10 % of their own private business capital to employees who have the right to pay annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said at the 60-minute series, whether the investigation of the FBI Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation against Judge Brett Kavanaugh gave the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raised the question of whether the finding of the office might squeeze some Republican Senators to draw their support.
In an interview from the Sunday '60 minutes' correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if anything that would have made them change their views.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the charge came out, and said, "You did it?"
He was decisive, determined, clear."
However , Graham's decision is incompetible .
"I have already made my decision over Brett Kavanaugh and would mean a really explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it hardly," Graham added with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those whom she appointed could verify.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything would change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what did he do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, in New York, the annual musical activities of the Global Citizen Festival will be performed, which offers a very impressive series of stars and an impressive mission at the end of world poverty.
The Festival Global Citizen in the seventh year welcomes tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase their awareness of the real goal of action, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was mentioned in 2012, is the enlargement of the Global Poverty project, the international groups to support the end of poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
In order to be able to obtain a free ticket (if you were not willing to pay for VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, e-mail to the world leader, call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful was the Global Citizen now 12 years before he reached his goal?
Is it the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really the way to convince them to require action, or is it just another case called "clicktivism" - people who feel that by signing online petition or leaving tweet, something changes?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, he has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by his favourites, trying to achieve various goals.
He says that these actions have contributed to the announcement of the commitments and measures of over $37 billion to affect lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
In the beginning of 2018, a group of 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that secure funds have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, the British partnership of investors and implementers who committed to “help children to grow into their full potential”, which promises to provide Rwanda $35 million to help to end the consumption in the region after receiving more than 4.700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can only make a note in history," Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman said the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 shares called on the U.K. to improve food for mother and children, the government announced the financing of the Power of Nutrition project, which will address 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on our Web site with a question, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty? ”
Global Citizen answered: “It will be a long and hard way - sometimes we fall and fail.
But as well as the great civil rights and the movement against the apartheid, we will succeed before us, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae belongs to one of the actors in New York this year to host Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
USA could use marine for the “bloc” that would prevent Russian energy exports - Minister of Interior
Washington may "if necessary" escape the marine to prevent the invasion of Russian energy on markets, including the Middle East, revealed the US Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke, as quoted Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria -- especially where it works to invite the legitimate government -- is an excuse for new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to mediate energy as in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe," he reportedly said.
And, according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"United States have the opportunity to make sure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy is not marketing," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the action carried out by the consumer energy alliance, which is an unprofit group that is considered “the voice of energy consumer in the United States”.
He compared Washington's approach and negotiations with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they were practically the same.
“Economic option for Iran and Russia is more than a investment in or replacement of engine materials”, he stated and also refers to Russia as a "one-intensive" player with economic dependent on fossil fuels.
The declaration comes, as Trump's administration is on the mission to strengthen the export of its fossil gas to Europe and replace Russia, which is much cheaper for European consumers.
To this end, the Trump Administration officials, including the US President Donald Trump itself, are trying to convince Germany to step away from the “inappropriate” project of Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “sponsor” of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly emphasized that Nord Stream 2 gas gas is worth 11 billion dollars to double the existing capacity of the pipe to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kreml claims that the zealous resistance to Washington against the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of some kind of competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to develop pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The United States has taken a position from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The largest German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called the United States to avoid EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to "see closely" the presidential candidacy in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the elections in the middle of the election period, “the president's candidacy is closely viewed.
During the meeting of the Holyoke City, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and repair our broken government, including the supreme woman's position," said The Hill.
"I will look closely at the presidential candidacy after November 6th."
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump during the session and said that “he leads this country in the wrong direction. ”
"I fear the bone of what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was open in her criticism of Trump and his appointment to the highest judge Bretta Kavanaugh.
On Friday Warren on Twitter, she said: “Certainly we need a FBI investigation before vote.”
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that most Warren voters do not think that it should be running in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters from Massachusetts indicated that the Senator should not be running, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent for candidacy and 48 per cent against it.
Among other highly built democratic names, mentioned in relation to the potential candidate by 2020, the former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders are the former Vice-President Joe Biden.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentioned the PTSD Track Palin meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq on the list in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence
"What my own son is going through after his return, may concern other families that feel the consequences of PTSD and some injuries with which our soldiers are returning," said the audience to meet with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
She called this arrest “the elephant in the room ” and said about her son and other war veterans that“ they are returning a little bit different, returning to healing, returning and asking if there is any respect for the things their colleagues and airmen, and every other member of the army, gives their country.
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilla in Aljaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, interfering with domestic violence and holding weapons in drunk, Dan Bennett, speaker of the Vasil police department.
18 States, D.C. supports the call for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support the legal call for new measures of the US government, which oppose asylum to victims fleeing from gang or domestic violence.
The representatives of the 18 states and the district on Friday in Washington issued a brief report on Friday to support the asylum applicant and question this measure, stated the NBC.
The full name of the prosecutor in the case of Grace v. Sessions, which was issued by the United States Civil Freedoms Organization against Federal Policy in August, was not revealed.
She said that her partner “and his sons and members of the violent gang ” abused her, but the American officials rejected her asylum request for July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
Attorneys of the States supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum applicants in the United States, as nations faced everywhere with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States has returned the decision of the Appeal Senate for Immigrants from 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants to flee from domestic violence to ask for asylum.
General Prosecutor Karl Racine, D.C., stated in the Friday statement that the new measures “is ignoring the decades of state, federal and international law”.
“The Federal Law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and that obstacle violates this principle”, said a short friend.
The lawyers further briefly argumented that the policy that denies immigrants' entry damages the U.S. economy and says it is more likely to become businesses and “do the necessary work”.
General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in the field of immigration not to grant asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and violence of gangs in June.
“The asylum is available for those who leave their home country for persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership in a certain social group or political opinion," the Sessions said in its statement of 11 June.
Asylum never aimed at mitigating all problems -- even all serious problems -- faced by people every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palo, where the number of victims has increased twice, race in search of survivors with time
For survivors, the situation was worse and worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her hot boy in the evacuation center in a sprayed town of Palo.
"Each minute, the ambulance brings other bodies.
The clean water is rare."
The inhabitants were seen to go back to their ruined homes, pick themselves through underground things and try to save whatever they find.
Thousands of people were injured, and hospitals destroyed by a earthquake of 7.5 were damaged.
Some wounds, including Dwi Harris, who suffered the fracture of the spinal and shoulder, rested at Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated outside because of the continuing severe strokes.
His tears filled his eyes when he felt that the violent earthquake shakened the hotel room on the fifth floor, which shared room with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save itself.
I think I was dragged into a wall ruin," said Harris for Associated Press and added that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calls for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "scoking" propaganda advertising
A week after the official Chinese journal published a four-sided advertisement ad in the American diary, which was devoted to mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador in China accused Peking of using the US press to spread propaganda.
The US President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday the paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the state of the largest selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere with US Congress elections in November 6th.
Trump's accusation that Peking tried to interfere with American elections marked what American representatives said that the Reuters Agency was a new phase of escalating Washington campaign to develop pressure on China.
While foreign governments are common to advertise commercial support, Peking and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating business war that is demonstrated at the level of mutual imports.
China's legal sanctions at the beginning of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in States such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador in China and former long-year governor of Iowa, a significant exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Peking injured American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in his opinion in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China is now doubled by publishing propaganda advertising in our own free press."
"The Chinese government uses an American valuable tradition of free speech and free press by placed advertising to Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"As opposed to that, in a newspaper stand on the street in Peking, you will find limited disagreeable voices and you will not see any real reflection of the unrelated views that the Chinese might have on the disturbing economic path of China, since the media belongs to the company "China Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused to publish the offer ” of his article, although he did not say what newspapers.
The Republicans leave their elections before elections for the debacle with Kavanaugh, warn the analysts
How many top republicans defend the candidate of Supreme Judge Brett Kavanauga, who faces several charges of sexual attack, the analyst warned that during the coming elections in the mid-period, especially women.
The emotions around this case were extremely high, and most republicans in the record already say they want to continue votes.
These things cannot be restored," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University at Syracuse.
Reeher said that he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) will last moment strive to investigate the FBI will be enough to calm the voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget about it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and speaker of the MoveOn Progressive Group, the newspaper in D.C., on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters scandaled “Listopad is coming! ” for a demonstration in the Chamber of the Senate, where the Republicans who are in charge of the Justice Commission decided to name Kavanaugh, even though Dr. Christine Blasey Ford witnessed, Mic said.
"Democratic excitement and motivation will break the records," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it's already been high, it's true."
However, it could be higher, especially among women's hesitating elections in the predecession and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who do not like the president, but often do not choose."
Even before the public testimony, Ford, detailed indicating her accusations of sexual attack on the candidate of the Supreme Court, the analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed, they could follow the opposition.
"The confused mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just a vote in the committee or on the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the capital, it is also about how the Republicans managed and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, the U.S. Priority Director, the group that helps vote democrats, pointed out the reporting channel.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided in the opinion of whom to trust in the light of the Fords and Kavanaugh testimony, with a little more sympathy to the other named.
The new YouGov study shows that 41 percent of the respondents definitely or likely believed the testimony of Ford, while 35 percent indicated that they surely or likely trust Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38 percent indicated that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or surely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, stated the Guardian.
Ford witnessed before the Senate Court Committee under oath last week that the drunken Kavanaugh attacked her at 17 years of age.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court showed her genitalia at the party during its study at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new Internet and prevent Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts startup, trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technological legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the open source platform of Berners-Lee called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people have access to information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he was joking that the project Inrupt was “the world supervision”.
"We must do it now," he said about this startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or sub.
It may contain lists of contacts, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and all at the same time.
What's on the personal online storage of data is that it's entirely on the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal power through data."
The purpose of the Inrupt project is to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help the Solid platform to be available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform bought by IBM, some employees working on the project have cooperated on the project and the community of voluntary programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using tools available on Inrupt websites.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with “Facebook and Google are not talking about making a complete change where all their business models overnight are turned up.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In his contribution to the media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that by sending the Inrupt project, it is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect integrity and quality of the new website built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past months, Berners-Lee was an influenced voice in the network's neutrality discussion.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: A celebration of a spiritual one that received Victoria Cross during World War 1
The celebrations took place for hundreds of years since the only Spiritual Church of England gained Victoria’s cross as a warrior during the first World War.
Lieutenant Reverend Bernard Vann received appreciation on September 29, 1918 at the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, the shooter killed him, and he never knew that he had gained the highest British military appreciation.
His two grandchildren revealed his memory stone on Saturday at the rushden celebrations, Northamptonshire.
One of his granddaughters, Michael Vann, said that the stone was “genially symbolic ” that the stone was discovered for exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s victory.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Col Vann led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin with very dense smooth and strong shooting from field works and bullets."
Later, he got into the first line and with “the highest courage ” he led the line forward before he dropped himself into the firefield and knocked three disconnected units.
Lieutenant Vanna killed a German shooter on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather's actions were “what I could never do, but at the same time something that is humiliating. ”
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, after a show led by a youth group of Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, put a vein.
Michael Vann said that “he felt great honour that he could have participated in the show, ” and added that“ the courage of the true hero is shown by support to many people. ”
The MMA fans stayed all night to watch Bellator 206, instead of getting a pig of Peppa
Imagine that, you've been waiting all night to watch the screwed Bellator 206, just to deny your main event.
The San José account contained 13 points, including six on the main card and live broadcasting, took place in Britain all night at Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a match, the British viewers remained amazed when the reporting changed to the Peppa pig show.
Some remained unexcited after they were awake until early mornings for the struggle.
One of the Twitter fans described a change in sending to children's show as a "a certain form of wrong joke."
"It is not suitable at 6:00 a.m., and therefore it is necessary to send the children's series," said Dave Schwartz, a higher vice-president for marketing and communication to Bellator after he was asked for this transfer.
"Devil Peppa," yes."
The President of the Bellator Scott Coker said they would work on the program so that in the future the viewers in Great Britain would be involved.
"I think that when I think about the broadcast, we can probably handle it," Cooker said.
"But there's six hours in the morning Sunday, and we can't handle it until Sunday of our time, Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were a lot of texts going back and back, and not all of them were very friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the government's fault.
I promise you this won't happen again.
We reduce it to five matches instead of six -- as we usually do -- and we have tried all the strength to keep the promise given to the fans and we failed.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "minor" because of sexuality
The Olympic jumping into the water Tom Daley says he grew with a feeling of less value to everyone because of his sexuality – but it motivated him to go to success.
24 - year - old sportsman stated that until he was at high school, he didn't realize that “are not all like him. ”
On the first Disc Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, who represented Lauren Laverne, said that he spoke loudly about gay rights to give to others “nade.”
He also said that the possibility to become a parent was less interested in the victory in the Olympiada.
A regular moderator of the long-term Kirsty Young show had a few months off for sickness.
Daley, who appeared as a trigger in Lavern's first program, said that he felt "minor" than anyone else who grew up with him, because "not socially unacceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: “Before so far, these feelings of minority and the differentity of the real things that gave me strength and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “Someone, ” he said not to disappoint anyone who would be able to find out how it was with his sexuality.
Double owner of the bronze olympic medal became a warrior for LGBT movement rights with a high profile and used his presence at the year's Games of Commonwealth in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said that he responded because he had a feeling of happiness that he could live openly without consequences, and he wanted to add to others “the hope. ”
This triple world champion stated that he was in love with a man, a US film director, Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, was “invasively unprepared”.
Daley's owner of Oscar, who's 20 years older, married last year, but said that age difference was never a problem.
"When you experience so much in such a young age - on his first Olympiade was when he was 14 years old and his father died three years later of cancer -- he said it was not easy to find someone in the same age who experienced similar rises and falls.
The two of them adopted the son of Robert Ray Black-Daley in June and Daley said that he “had changed his entire angle of view. ”
"If you asked me last year, it would be all like "I want to get a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are bigger things than gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic Medal is Robbie."
His son got his name after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't want to die, and the last thing he asked was if they had tickets to London Olympiade in 2012 because he wanted to be in front.
"I couldn't tell him – you won't be in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held him for my hand when he stopped breathing and until the moment he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The year Daley attended the Olympiades in 2012 and got a bronz.
"I knew that I had dreamed about it all my life -- jumping in front of our home games at the Olympic Games, I don't know better feeling," he said.
It also inspired the choice of his first song – Heather Small Stream – which resoned with him at the beginning of the Olympiada and still caused a humility in it.
Desert Island Discs show is sent to the BBC Radio 4 station on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of form, on Saturday at Ryder Cup ended on the cage
The American Phil Mickelson would have reached the record on Sunday when he played 47, the Ryder Cup game, but he would have to fix the form to prevent the unfortunate mill.
Mickelson, who played on the events performed every two years on the deficit record, sent Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday Fourballs and foursomes on the bench.
Instead of being in the center of the event as often as it was in the United States, he spent his five-fold primary winner day separatively between the cheerleaders and the game work in a row that he hoped to fix what had troubled him.
This 48-year-old player has never been the directest of drivers, not even at the top of his career, so it is not an ideal choice for the narrow field Le Golf National, where the long partial territory routinely punishes broken shots.
And if the golf field is not quite anxious about himself, he faces Mickelson in the ninth week's match to the exact champion of British Open Francescu Molinari, who won all his four matches this week with the new guy Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans who had four points less started 12 separate swords, escaped the rapid appearance, Mickelson's sword could turn out to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, and he didn't give anything else.
"He fully understands the role he had today, cried me on his back, gave me his hand around my shoulder and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He believes himself so much.
He's a member of the Hall of Slama, and in the past and this week, he was so useful for these teams.
I guess I couldn't imagine he'd play two swords.
I imagined more, but that's how it developed, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to attend, just like everyone else."
Mickelson's over Nick Fald's record in most wests of Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
This could mean the end of the Ryder Cup career, which never reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has reached 18 victories, 20 losses and seven remedies, even though Furyk says his presence to the team has brought some unwealthy results.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke people and is a great companion in the team's room," he explained.
"I think younger players also enjoyed entertainment when they were visiting him this week, which was fun to watch.
It gives it a lot more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can disappear soon.
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, from experience, knows that a great leadership towards the singles of the last days in Ryder Cup can easily change into a uncomfortable ride.
Dane debuted at the game in 1997 in Valderrama, where the company led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point scope over the Americans, but they got to the target level completely close victory 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You must keep reminding that we had a great impact in Valderrama, also in Brooklin, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only closely," said Bjorn, on the picture, after watching when we won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, to lead Le Golf National 10-6.
So history and every member of that team showed me that it wasn't over us.
Tomorrow you'll be bored.
Go there and do all the right things.
It's not behind you until all those points are on the table.
We have a goal, and that's how we try to get the trophy, and that's what we're focusing on.
I said I'd focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to stand on the other side - the best players in the world."
Bjorn, delighted in how his players led on a complex golf field, added: “I would never have managed to do so myself.
Tomorrow another animal is waiting for us.
Tomorrow, individual performances are preparing, and that's too hard.
It's great to be out with a partner when it works well, but if you want to be there for yourself, your ability to golf player is fully checked.
That's the message you have to hand over to the players, to get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind, and he's got to go and get the best out of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players play better as individuals than partners. Exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points from four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these great returns, when he was part of a victory team in Brooklyn, to end as defeated when Europe reached “The Miracle in Medinah”.
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, encouraged his players to go to the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important fights, but you would like to begin quickly as in Brooklyn, as in Medinah.
When this rate goes one way, it puts a significant pressure on the middle matches.
According to that, we have set up a composition and ensure that the boys feel like you know, as if we were to magic tomorrow."
Thomas got a task to try to run an attack and stand up with Rory McIlroy in the top game with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
“ I went with this group of boys in this order, because I think it covers the whole road, Bjorn said about his choice of singles.
Germany's new warship has been relocated
The latest German maritime fregate was recognised in 2014 to replace older warships from the era of cold war, but it will not be available for at least one year because of the wrong systems and the snow coast, the local media indicates.
The operation of the leadership of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the entire new fregate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, according to Die Zeit's quoting army, was now deferred to the first half of 2019.
The vessel was to become part of the Navy in 2014, but the difficult problems of the supplier have disadvantaged the fate of this ambitious project.
As a replacement for the ageing fregats of the Bremen class, four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which have ordered the marine in 2007.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with an efficiency, a number of anti-flying and anti-balistic bullets and certain hidden technologies, such as the reduced radar and infrared and acustic elements.
Other significant functions include the long-term maintenance period – the latest fregats should be placed until two years outside the domestic port.
However, continuous delays mean that the seaships, which were supposed to allegedly allow Germany to send powers to abroad, will be aged, notes Die Zeit log.
The famous F125 fregata reached the newspaper last year when the German Navy officially refused to operate and returned to the Blohm & Voss ship in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the manufacturer after the transfer.
It was just a little known about the reasons for return, but the German media quoted a number of major “software errors and disturbances on metal elements” that would cause the warship to be unused in the fighting.
Software disturbances were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessel will operate some 120 navy crews, which is half of the workers needed on the Bremen class fregats.
It also turned out that the ship has a significant overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the marine to add future innovation.
It is believed that the 7 000-tonne Rheinland-Pfal ship will be twice as heavy as ships like classes used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to metal elements disturbance, the price of the entire project is also the problem, including the training of the crew.
It is said that from the original 2.2 billion euros, the price has emerged at 3.1 billion euros.
The challenges with the latest fregats have acquired importance in particular in the light of recent warnings that the German maritime power is declined.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the Head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, confirmed that the marine army really “come the ships capable of planting”.
This representative stated that the problems have been redeployed continuously because the old ships were removed from operation, but no replacement has been granted.
He lamented that no of the fregats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could become part of the marine equipment.
The National Trust Organization listens to the secret life of the nucleus
There is a new research on the discovery of the landscapes in the Scotland Highland.
There is hope that finding the research will put a new light on the behavior of unique flying sugars and help to manage future activities to preserve this species.
The study carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by whistleblowers and the smallest and brown long-earth and water in the Botanic Gardens of Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in the key areas in this netopy seat, which will monitor the activities of the netopirs throughout the year.
Employees and volunteers of NHS will also conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings finds the frequency of the calling of netopyrs and what individual species do.
The map of the habitat and the report will then be issued, which will create a detailed landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a Natural Resource Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are the most important and how individual species use them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of the habitat management, such as the creation of a port, and the best procedure in maintaining forest areas for netoyers and other related species.
In the past century, the netoys of the population in Scotland and the whole Great Britain are highly exploited.
They are threatened by construction and territorial development that affect colonies and the environment.
Risk can also represent wind turbines and lighting, as well as traps for flies and chemical treatment of construction materials and cat attacks.
They're not really blind.
But because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful in hunting.
They use a substantial echo-location technique to track bugs and interferences in the flight.
NTS, responsible for care for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of soil in the country, takes netoyers very seriously.
He has trained experts who regularly conduct research, colony controls and sometimes rescue work.
This organization even set up the first and only protected reservation in the Threave seat in Dumfries and Gallovey, which is home of eight of the ten species of netopiters in Scotland.
David Thompson's headquarters states that this is an ideal territory for them.
"There in Threave we have an excellent area for the netoyers," he said.
"We have old buildings, many ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there's too many things that we don't know about non-towers, so the work we're doing here and in other places will help us better understand what they need to survive."
It emphasizes the significance of the control of the netopyrs before starting maintenance work in real estate, because it is possible that unconscious destruction of one mother's nest can kill up to 400 females and youths, which can destroy the entire local population.
They are protected and illegal to kill them, to disturb, disrupt or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to attach her hand to work and help.
She said: "We have a lot to learn about our untouchers and many species that we do not know how their populations are.
Ronaldo refuses the charges of rape and his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo marked the charges for rape for “fake news” and stated that people “will see themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German journal Der Speegel, who informed these accusations.
This Portuguese and the attacker for Juventus was accused of rape by America Kathryn Mayorga in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Accordingly, he paid her 375 000 USD to keep the case quiet, the Der Speegel log informed on Friday.
A few hours after the publication of the charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million watchers and labeled the information “fake news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-fold holder of the appreciation of the Golden Ball in the camera.
"They want to feed on my least.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their work.
I'm happy and I'm fine," said a smile player.
According to the Reuters Agency, Ronald's lawyers are going to charge Der Speegel's journal with unsubscribed charges, which they have identified as “inadmissible suspicion notifications in the private area”.
The lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would require compensation for “moral damage in the amount of the corresponding severity of violations, which is likely one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times.”
The alleged incident was to happen in June 2009 in the hotel Palms Hotel and in the casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the game, where according to the documentation filed at the Court of Clark County District Court in Nevada, she was analytically raped.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo kneeled and told her that he was “99 percent” of the “klajas” and disappointed by“ one percent. ”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but he was consensus.
Mayorga also declared that she went to the police and let her photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed with an extrajudicial settlement, because she had “the fear of revenge ” and was afraid of“ public humiliation. ”
A 34-year-old woman claims that she is now trying to renew the procedure because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronalda, at the time of the charge of the attack of steps from the move to the Real Madrid Club from Manchester United and this summer, bought him in 100 million euros in a famous Italian club of Juve.
Brexit: Great Britain will regret the loss of car manufacturers forever
Great Britain “will regret forever” if after Brexit loses its status of world leader in the manufacture of cars, the Secretary for Greg Clark has stated.
He added that it was “restraining” that the Toyota UK car informed BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production in the Burnaston race, near Derby.
"The agreement is necessary," Clark said.
The Japanese car stated that the impact of delay on the borders if the Brexite agreement is not concluded, it may be a job.
In the Burnastone race, where Auris and Avensis cars are manufactured by Toyota marks – almost 150,000 cars were produced last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would note the stop of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the executive director of Toyota in Burnastone.
Other cars, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover cars in Great Britain, are spreading fear of leaving the EU without an agreement about the operation of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, states that he will close his race for the manufacture of cars from Mini in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what producers call for risks for the supplier chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
The production line of Toyota is in operation on the basis of the supply of “report time”, while parts from the suppliers in Britain and the EU are supplied for cars produced on the order within 37 minutes.
If Britain leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be a broken boundary, which, according to the sector, could lead to delaying and lack of replacement.
For the company Toyota, it would be impossible to have more than one day in the Derbyshire race, said the company, and this would result in stopping production.
Mr. Clark stated that Theresy May's plans for the recovery of future relations with the EU are "precisely calibrated so that these border controls will not occur".
"We need a deal. We want the best business that allows, as I say, not only current success but also the understanding of this opportunity," BBC Radio 4's Today said.
"It is not only from Toyota, but also from other producers that we must be absolutely able to continue what is a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was not able to say how long the production will be stopped, but in a long term, she warns that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the race and eventually have been compensated for jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston race for 24 years and is the chairman of the racing committees, said that members of the committee organisation are increasingly concerned: “I have experience that once these seats disappear, they will never return.
The government speaker said: "We have set up a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, states White House
The meeting of Donald Trump at the high level with the representative attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “will be dismissed for another week” because he continues to fight for the post of the highest judge with Brett Kavanaugh, told the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is staring at the work of the Special Council Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian elections, the link between Trump's branches and Russia and the possible legal obstruction by the President.
Whatever Trump releases a representative of the General Energy, threatening Mueller's independence, the Washington knocks will be relieved for months.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the carrying of a camera to record talks with Trump and the possibility of meeting the President through the 25th Appendix.
Rosenstein denied the message.
However, last Monday, he moved to the White House surrounded by reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, who was at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York.
Trump pronounced that Rosenstein would not "rade" be released, but then the meeting was delayed to not be heard at the Senate Court Committee, where the witness statements were made by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI's weekly inquiry against Kavanaugh, which has delayed the full vote of the Senate again.
Trump's press speaker, Sarah Sanders, showed up on the Fox channel on Sunday.
She replied: “It may be this week, and it may be necessary to move for another week, taking into account all the other things that are being held in the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I will always communicate the current information to the media."
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders did not organize a press conference with the White House since September 10th.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences had not been caused to abolish the "divaway" of television journalists, even when she said, "I don't agree with the fact that they're going to come out."
It subsequently suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press will grow.
"The President is organizing more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she added, without giving evidence. "We looked at those numbers."
The conferences will continue, said Sanders, but "if the press representatives had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would certainly be better than interviews with me.
We're trying and you've seen that we've been doing this in the last few weeks and that a press conference will be held, where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with high representatives visiting.
The separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre views before the gathered reporters.
The Ministry of Health writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland not to be afraid of Brexita
She wrote to EU officials who work in the Scotland NHS to express their gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman's SME has sent a letter or not six months before leaving the EU of Great Britain.
The Scottish government has already committed to fixing costs on requests for the status of EU citizens working in transferred public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “In the summer, they continue to negotiate between Britain and the EU on the departure, and are heading towards the expected decision this autumn.
However, the British government also takes steps under preparation for a possible separation scenario without agreement.
I know it must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reassure you how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of nationality.
The EU's colleagues, even outside, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve health services and are useful for patients and communities to whom we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and our hot wish is to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is doing an emergency surgery after head injury
The expelled defender of Tigers from Tennessee Christion Abercrombie took an emergency surgery after he suffered head wounds in Saturday defeat 31-27 from the rival of Vanderbilt Commodores, stated Mike Organ from Tennessee.
The Chief Coach of Tennessee Rod Reed told the reporters that the injury occurred shortly before half time.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there," said Reed.
Coaches and medicinalists gave Abercrombie the sidelines of oxygen and then put him on their noses and prepared for another assessment.
The Tennessee State officer told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had a surgery in Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are no "details on type/range" yet available and that Tennessee is trying to find out when the injuries were injured.
Abercrombie, a second in the red shirt, graduates from the first season for Tennessee after transfer from Illinois.
Before the game was finished on Saturday, he had five total acts, which means a total of 18 seasons.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher property tax at buying real estate in Great Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher property tax when they buy real estate in Great Britain, while additional money will be used to help homeless people under the new Tory plans
This act will neutralize the success of Corbin's move, which aims to attract young voters
Increasing the duty of a higher real estate tax will pay for persons who do not pay tax in Great Britain
State treasure is expected to be increased by 120 million £ per year – to help people without home
Foreign buyers will pay a higher tax from the purchase of real estate when they buy property in Great Britain, while the money will be used to help people without home, the Theresa May announces today.
This act will be viewed as an attempt to neutralize the success of dragging Jeremy Corby to attract young voters with a pledge to provide price-available accommodation and focus on people with high income.
The increase in real estate tax will concern individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Great Britain, while the money will further strengthen efforts of the government to fight sleeping without roofing over the head.
The compensation, which is a supplementary to the current tax payments from the purchase of property, including higher levels introduced two years ago in other houses and purchases for rental purposes, can reach up to three per cent.
It is expected to increase up to 120 million £ per year in the state treasury.
The estimates say that newly built properties in London buy 13 percent of the citizens who are not residents of the Great Britain, which is raising prices and disrupting those who buy for the first time to get on the stairs home.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “the cities of ghosts” just because of a high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new principles showed up only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called after the reduction of the tax from the purchase of property to help more young people get their first home.
He accused large construction companies of holding high property prices by taking the ground, but they did not use it, and insisted on Mrs. May to withdraw quotas from the price-available homes to repair the “free ” home in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a linked series of proposed housing reforms, including the management of rents and the termination of "free" displacement.
He also wants to increase the competence of the committees to build new homes.
Mrs. Maya said: “Later, I said that I wanted to make my efforts as a premier to renew the British dream — so that every new generation would have a better life.
And that means repairing our damaged property market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and create life.
However, it cannot be proper that it is easy for non-Emergencies and foreign companies to buy houses as well as those working residents of Great Britain.
For a lot of people, the dream of their own home is too far away, and sleepless sleeping without a roof over the head is too real."
Jack Ross: “My highest ambition is to drive Scotland.”
Boss Sunderland Jack Ross states that his “the highest ambition” is to become the manager of Scotland at a certain stage.
The 42-year-old Scott is looking forward to the challenge of renewal of the Northeast Club, which currently stands in the third position in the First League, only three degrees below the top.
This summer he went to Stadium of Light after St. Mirren brought back the Scottish Premiership League in the last season.
"I wanted to play behind my country as a player.
I've got a B and it was," said Ross at the BBC Scotland's Sportsound channel.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that's always something that brings me back.
But this would only come if I had been successful in the club's leadership."
Ross' preliminary managers in Sunderland were: Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former head of Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel any concern about the consequences of such names in such a big club when he rejected the predegrations of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“ The success would be a question for me at that time if I could return this club to the Premier League.
Because of structure and equipment in this club, it certainly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get him back there, but I think I'd feel successful only if I could get the club back there."
Ross's been running his career for three years, he used to work as a helper boss in Dumarton and spent 15 months as a coach of Hearts.
Then he helped the Alloa club recover from the descending to the third group and transformed St Mirren from the starting decline on the winner of the Master's title immediately in the next season.
And Ross says he has a much better feeling now than ever in his career of players in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"They were probably real crossing," he recalls the time when Alloa took place.
“I really believed that the leadership was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I was good, making good money and enjoying proper heights.
But playing can be difficult.
There's a lot of things you have to go through a week.
I'm still going through stress and pressure on the job, but I just feel good in the leadership.
I always wanted to be the manager, and now I do it, I feel like I feel the most in my adult life now."

The research found that a great time for the pinto is on Saturday at 17:30
The summer wave of Veder increased the revenue of British houses facing difficulties, but increased the pressure on the restaurant chain.
The numbers show that the groups of cabins and bars recorded an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July – but the returns of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a consultant from CGA, who created final reports, stated: “Stable sunshine and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, when the cabin visit increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were even more affected.
The decline in the market of restaurants by 1.8 percent in June has yet been deteriorated in July.
The households and bars that taught drinks have had the most strongly like the restorations.
The households whose main merchandises are from food also suffered by the sun, even though not as dramaticly as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to get out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while the sale of food declined by three per cent."
Paul Newman, analytical company of free-time activities and hospitality, stated: “This results are the continuation of the trend that lasts since the end of April.
Weather and impact of significant social or sports actions are the biggest factors in the case of sale outside the domestic market.
There is no surprise that the restaurant chains continue to fight, even if the annual sales decline by 4.8 per cent will be particularly painful in light of the current cost pressures.
The long hot summer cannot be a worse time for operators of food-training businesses and time tells whether the lighter temperatures we have experienced in August will bring so much relief."
The total growth of sales in houses and restaurants, including newly open, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowness in the presentation of marks.
Coffer Peach Tracker's sales monitor for the British sector, bars and restaurants collects and analyses data on performance from 47 operational groups with a combined turn over 9 billion pounds, which is an industrial measure in the sector.
Every fifth child has a secret account in social networks that hide from his parents
Every fifth child – aged only 11 – has a secret account in social networks that hide from parents and teachers, shows research
Study among 20,000 high school students showed an increase in “fake instagram pages”
The reports raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of the students indicated that they had a “the main ” account that parents knew
Every fifth child - aged only 11 - makes accounts in social networks that he hides from his parents.
A study among 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in “fake instagram accounts ” on which photographs share.
Reports indicate concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students indicated that they have a decorated “the main ” account that parents know and also have a private account.
One mother who ran into a secret web of her 13 - year - old daughter discovered that her teenager encourages others to ‘ rape her. ’
The study carried out by the Agency Digital Awareness UK and the Association of Headmasters and Headmistress Conference (HMC) of independent schools showed that 40% of the 11-18-year-old students have two profiles, and half acknowledged the conduct of private accounts.
The chief of HMC Mike Buchanan said: “It is anxious that he has so many teenagers of temptation to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can't find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “glass of athletes” in the Scottish Athletic Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as an inexecutive director at the annual general meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most appreciated light athlete and President Ian Beattie described the move as an excellent opportunity for those who are in sports like those for whom its long-range experiences will be useful at the international level in the past decade.

The American, who won at the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996 at 200 and 400 meters, won a total of four gold medals and now is a regular BBC expert, could not walk after a transitory ischemic attachation.
He wrote on Twitter: “All a month ago, I made an attack.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show if I was healed or at what extent.
It is exhausting, but I have done full healing, he has learned to walk again, and today I do practice!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!"
Milk seating causing mother comparison to cows shares opinions online
The company dealing with the production of supplies divided online opinion by advertising, comparing breastfeeding mothers to breast-feeding cows.
In the framework of the marketing of the “first silent sealing in the world”, Envi issued a music video with an excess showing the freedom that the new supplier gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of shadow with cows on a song with the text: "Yes, I do, but you don't see any tail" and "If you didn't notice that I had no vegetables, there are my breasts."
The congregation continues: “Pump, pump, I feed children, pump, pump, feed my sweet milk. ”
The advertising, which was published on the company Facebook page, however, has caused online controversial reactions.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and he had mixed reactions from those who saw it, and many of them suggested that it was putting light on the "horories" of the milk industry.
“Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and be born to be able to give milk, but their children are taken a few days after birth," one of the comments says.
Elvia's seating is discreetly placed on breast breasts (Elvia/mama)
Another comment: “Seems to be traumatic for mother and child.
But yes, why don't you use them for a breast pump for the mothers that keep their children?"
Someone added: “The advertisement is completely off. ”
Even those who defended the advertisement appeared, and one woman admitted that the song was considered “infective. ”
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would've taken the pump if I'd still pee.
When I suck, I feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but it's a thing.
It's a brilliant product," one user wrote.
Another added: “It is a fun advertisement focused on mothers who suck milk (often at work or toilet) and feels like “cows. ”
It's not an advertisement that should admire the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they all dance with discreet sewers hidden under their chest.
The campaign concept is based on the notion that many women who suck milk indicate that they feel like cows.
However, Elvia's seal is totally silent, has no wire or snakes and is beautifully hiding in the breast of breasts, so she gives women the freedom of movement, the possibility of holding a child and even sucking walk.
Anne Balarin, a partner and ECD for mothers, added: “Elvia's seal is so revolutionary product that deserves a significant and provocative marketing.
By creating a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and cows, we wanted to point out the sucking of milk and all the challenges associated with it, while showing a fun and reliable incredible sense of freedom that the new supplier will secure.
It's not the first time Elvia's seatman got on the execution.
During London's week of fashion, one of the two mothers, Marta Jacobski, who was just using the product, appeared on the mole.
Thousands of children of migrants have quietly moved to the established camp at the Texas border
The number of detained children of migrants has rapidly increased despite the fact that the monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, especially because the hard rhetoric and principles introduced by Trump Administration have disrupted the placement of children with an escort.
Most of the companions were traditionally formed immigrants without evidence who feared the threat of staying in the country, so they claimed to belong to the child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household must provide fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the immigration and customs department, testified to the Congress that the agency arrested hundreds of people who asked for an immediate status of immigration.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrests had no previous criminal records.
When 80 percent of those who are sponsors or members of the sponsors are illegal in our country, and a large number of of them are criminals.
So we continue to pursue them," Mr. Albence said.
According to asylum workers, representatives in the effort to rapidly process matters on children have introduced new rules that would require some of them to be brought before the court within a month before the detention, instead of the previous standard 60 days.
Many will appear by calling within the video conference instead of personally to declare their case a legal status for the immigration judge.
Those who do not have the right to help will be deported quickly.
The longer the child is in custody, the more likely he is in anxiety or depression, which can lead to explosions of anger or escape attempts, claim asylum workers and report from the system in the past few months.
Advocates indicate that these concerns are increased in a larger device, such as Tornillo, where the signs of the child's suffering are more likely not seen, just because of the size of the device.
They added that the transfer of children to a certain camp without sufficient time of emotion preparation or byeing with friends could cause a trauma with which a lot of children are already fighting.
Syria announced that the American, French and Turkish “cumulatives” are to be downloaded immediately
During the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moul also called after the return of Syrian refugees home, even though the eighth year of war in the country is already.
The Moule, who is also a representative prime minister, said that foreign forces in the Syrian territory are illegally, under the cause of the fight against terrorism and that “this will be imposed according to that.”
"It must be given up immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Moul insisted that “the war against terrorism in Syria is almost over, ” and more than 360 000 people died since 2011, and millions of others lost their homes.
He said that Damaszek would continue “a fight in this holy battle until we remove all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and“ any illegally present aliens”.
The United States has some 2,000 units in Syria, which are primarily trained by Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting with President Bashar al-Assad and advising them.
France has more than 1,000 units on the ground.
When he issued refugees, Moul proclaimed that the conditions of return for them were good and accused “some Western countries ” of“ spreading unracional concerns ” that caused refugees to refuse to return.
"We have contacted international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier," he said.
"They politize what should be a clean humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that there will be no recovery aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assada and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats indicate that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a protective zone in the last refuge Idlib created an opportunity to move further in political discussions.
The Russian and Turkish agreement prevented the great attack of Syrian forces protected by Russia in a province where three million people live.
However, the Moule pointed out that the agreement had “a clear end term” and expressed the hope that the military action would be focused on hyhadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front organization with the imprisonment on Al-Qaeda, who would“ be destroyed”.
The Ambassador of the United Nations, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that the first meeting of the new committee consisting of the members of the government and the opposition to propose a war institution for Syria and the expansion of the road to elections will soon be held.
The Moul set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee with the words that the work of the panel should be limited to “control Articles of the existing Constitution” and issued warnings from the infringement.
Why Trump wins in the second period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would also win in other elections in 2020, if many Liberal Observers, Prosecution and Scandals had not ended his office in the president's position.
In that case, it would certainly be “the dramatic finals of the presidential period in history! ”
Until now, there are no signs of tired monitoring.
Since 2014, the monitoring of the main broadcasting time increased by 1.05 million per CNN and almost tripled by 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has a average monitoring of 2.4 million in main radio time, which is an increase of 1.7 million over four years ago, according to Nelsen’s Agency and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC has increased cable television monitoring to 3.5 million watching main night reports.
"It's a hot thing that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of the "Designed Survivor" show at the ABC drama on the Secretary of the Cabinet, who became president after the attack destroyed Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced author of the comedy and series “Just the funny parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking In the Hollywood Boys Club”, has another theory.
He remembers the taxi ride in Boston before elections in 2016.
The driver told her she'd vote Trump.
Why?
"He said: 'Because he's funny," Mrs. Scovell told me.
It's the meaning of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story that happens in Washington could pre-determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether families of immigrants can reconnect and benefit global economy.
Debug is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged tracker.
And yet it's about whether you're an informed citizen when you're watching a panel of experts that discuss how Bob Woodward uses "deep backup" sources for his book "Fear", whistling the skin jacket Paul Manafort in value of 15,000 USD" (arrogance dresses) and the consequences of the disgusting image of Mr. Trump Stormy Daniels.
By the way, I'm not going to look at Super Maria again the same way.
"The part of what he does and what causes the reality show is that you are feeded by something every night," said Brent Montgomery, the leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of Pawn Stars' document rotating with N.F.L. Trump's series in which Kim Chong-Una appreciates.
You can't miss any episode or you'll be behind.
When I connected with Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny, outside on the northern shore of Kauai 80 degrees, but he was stuck inside and watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't dismiss, not when Brett Kavanaugh was up to the Senate Court and the future of the Supreme Court was on weight.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy series and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I think it was supposed to be a joke, but it turns out they were right."

External money flows to the most close domestic races of the medium-term election
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania district experiences a financial influx through the reorganization of the congress districts that generated two holders of the Office in the fighting for the same chair.
This has recently led to the conversion of the Pittsburgh Pregrade District by the district Democratic Republican Conor Lamb – who won another district in the special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another holder of the office, the Republican Keithu Rothfus, who presents the old 12th Pennsylvania district, which is strongly covered with the new 17.
After the Supreme Pennsylvania Court issued in January the opinion that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favour of the Republicans, the maps were rendered.
The race in the new 17th district launched a rapid financial breakdown between the financial branches of the main parties, the Committee of Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after close victory in tracked March special elections to the 18th Congress District.
This chair has been held by the Republican for over decades and Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
The politics experts give democrats a mild impact.
America considers to retrieve Salvador for support of China, then withdraws
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Peking under a mild pressure of Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and was accommodated in a hotel in Panama until the partners legally moved the organizational team of Trump's leadership.
The representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to revoke the US Directors of the Diplomatic Mission from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of “the recent decisions not to recognise Thai-wan”, said the speaker of the Ministry of Heather Nauert in the statement issued at the beginning of the month.
However, the penalties were considered only against Salvador, who received estimated 140 million USD US aid in 2017, including the means to control drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties that included reducing financial assistance and focusing on visa restrictions would be painful for the Mediterranean country and its high unemployment and the number of murders.
With continuing internal negotiations, North American and Mediterranean representatives postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity relating to similar negotiations from the previous year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by half September, the leaders explained that they wanted to continue in the negotiations and effectively complete any considerable penalties for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now authorized to resolve the conference currently scheduled for half October, within the signal, which the administration has stated diplomats.
And three American ambassadors quietly returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without having any new unbreakable news from Washington.
The speaker of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American representatives, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their sources have been confirmed by an external analyst that is close to the government's executive and also spoken under the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The report of Robert Mueller from the Special Commission on the possible defence of Mr Trump in the exercise of the law which is now in public records.
Mr. Mueller, in his investigation, reportedly turns to whether Mr. Trump's campaign had no secret agreement with Russia on the attack on our elections.
If there was an exchange of parties in the Congress, Mr Trump would have to take account of this authority, just as he is preparing to come again before the voters, and he would eventually be expected by the jury composed of his colleagues.
This is a whole series of "if" and I don't want to claim that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable -- as well as for similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of Atlantic has a choice that will affect how long the suffering will last.
In 1938 the German officers were prepared to arrange a bullet against Hitler, just to build up and support the Western powers in Monache of Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid long summers full of bloodshed that followed.
History turns around such critical moments that accelerate or slow down the democracy.
The Americans are now standing before a few similar critical moments.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires the Deputy General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, here the man who runs the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's been impulsed since the report announced that he proposed to record the president secretly last year and speculated that he was not in the state of health to be able to stand the president's office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the Times version is incorrect.
"How do we react if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh will not be complete or fair - or what if it will be confirmed in the Supreme Court despite a convincing accusation of sexual attacks and wrong statements?
And what's the most important thing, we're going to vote in the middle of the functional period to Congress, which will be responsible for Mr. Trump?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will be waiting for a long dark night.
But I believe we don't, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew, deported to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime as my Ambassador home once occupied.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to burn candles on the table with swastic.
How could I not be optimist about our future with such heritage?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about the conflict with Rapid Vienna
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday with awareness that victory over the Akustants would give them a great hope of the G European League Group.
The wounding of the knee prevented Graham Dorrans from appearing in the season for the first time until the 2-2 remise with Villarreal. They believe that the Rangers can use this result as a reflective bridge to a larger thing.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a quality team," said 31-year-old player.
“ We went to a struggle with the faith that we could distract something, and we took the point.
Maybe we could have reproduced it at the end, but it was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half of time, but in the second, we improved and we were better.
It'll be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it'll be hard, because in the last match, they've played a good result.
Last year, it was pretty hard with all my injuries and changing the club, but now I feel very good about it.
The team is strong, and the boys are really enjoying it, the training is fine, too.
Hopefully we're going to do this now, throwing the past season behind our heads, and we're going to be successful."
Women are worried about retirement
Even though the participants had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few talked about it to family members.
Approximately half of the people in the national study declared that they discussed the value of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they were talking about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they do not decide to discuss it," explains Holly Snyder, vice-president of the whole country's life insurance.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care unless you first reveal your wishes to them.
Together with your counselor and family, discuss where and how to take care, because these factors can play a great role in determining the price.
Acknowledge your financial advisor: The counselor can help you find a way to remune these expenditures.
For example, long-term care can be financed by traditional insurance for long-term care, hybrid cash insurance that will help you pay these expenditures, or using your own insurance using your own funds – as long as you have money.
Create your legal documents: Stop legal battles as long as possible.
Specify your healthcare representatives, which will be a trusted person who will supervise your medical care and ensure that your doctors comply with your wishes unless you can communicate yourself.
Also consider writing full of power for your finances.
You will choose a confidential person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure your accounts in case you are not eligible to do so.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your old parent needs medical emergency and is on his way to hospital.
Can you answer questions about his medicines and allergies?
Please write these details to the written plan to be prepared.
“The game is not just finance, but what are the doctors called? ” Martin asked.
"Where are the drugs?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Have the plan prepared by your hand."

Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in strong earthquakes and tsunami affected by the Indian city of Palu on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to grow.
Since communication is out of operation, the subsidiary units could not get any information from the Donggala Regent, which is the area north of the Palo, which is closer to the epicentre of the power of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palo after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palo and the Donggala regency, on the island of Sulawesi:

In 1938, she killed more than 200 people in Donggala and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Tsunami hit the west of Donggaly in 1996, when she asked for nine victims.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle, and there is a regular earthquake.
Here's the list of several largest earthquakes and tsunamis of the last years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province Aceh in the north of Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunami that affected 14 countries and lost the lives of 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in the Aceh Province.

The oldest son of Sarah Palin was arrested for a domestic violence charge
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaska governor and Vice-President candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for the charge of the attack.
According to the report issued by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, the 29-year-old Palin living in Vasilla in Aljaska was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, violation of domestic violence reports and defending arrest.
When the police report tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, Palin took her phone.
Palin was sent to the Math-Su Pretrial Facility and is detained to an unsustained bond of 500 USD, CTUU reports.
According to the network report, he appeared in the court on Saturday, where he declared that he felt “decisively innocent ” when he was asked to make a statement.
Palin faces three of the offences of class A, which means that he could be convicted until a year of withdrawal of liberty and a penalty of up to 250 000 USD.
At the same time, he was accused of a violation of class B, punishable by a single day prison and a $2000 penalty.
It's not the first time Palin has to face a criminal notice.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palina.
The alleged attack on the police reported his mother, Sarah Palin.
The case is currently in front of the Alaska court for war veterans.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, infringement of domestic violence and the maintenance of weapons under the influence of deceptive substances in connection with the incident.
He reportedly hit his girlfriend's face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by war veteran groups in 2016 when the violent behavior of her son connected with posttraumatic stress disorder caused by the son's service in Iraq.
Indian earthquakes and tsunamis: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake occurred on Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 degrees earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electric and communication networks are out of operation and in the coming days the number of victims will be expected to increase.
The earthquake hit a part of the Sulawesi island, which is located north-east of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
There were videos on social media showing the moment of disaster.
Thousands of people gathered at the beach festival in Palo when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors require a special death penalty for a suspect of a terrorist attack in NYC
The Federal Prosecutors in New York request death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people died, is an exceptional penalty that was not for a federal crime in the state from 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly launched a cycle attack along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, using a rented truck Home Depot, which was destroyed by walkers and cyclists.
In order to defend the death penalty, the plaintiffs will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused a number of injuries – thus define the conditions of intention to grant death penalties under the document approved by the Court of Justice of New York.
According to the judicial documents, both of those figures would mean the possibility of awarding a death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, the federal jury accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including charges for murder for extortion, which normally use federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and charges for violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “significant planning and preparation,” claims the plaintiffs and describe the way Saip’s act was done, as a disgusting, cruel and cruel one.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused wounds, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diega Enrique Angelini, Nicholase Clevese, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diega Mendoza and Alejandra Damian Pagnucca”, stated in the intention.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District Court of New York was last sentenced to death.
The accused Khalid Barnes was accused of murdering two drug suppliers, but finally in September 2009 he was sentenced to lifelong imprisonment.
The latest death penalty was actually executed in connection with the federal case in New York in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed by a couple who had been proven to spy for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs sat on the electric chair on June 1953.
Saipov, a relative from Uzbekistan, showed a minimal regret over the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he felt good about what he did.
According to the charge of Saipov, he told the authorities that he was inspired to commit an attack by watching the videos of the Islamic State on the phone.
The police also announced that he also demanded the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital room.
He said he felt innocent about 22 accusations.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were "approximately disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to require a death penalty instead of accepting guilt and conviction for life without the possibility of exemption only extends the trauma of these events for anyone concerned," Patton said.
The team of Saip’s defenders has already asked the plaintiff to not demand death penalty.
According to Members, the Conservative Party should be authorised by negotiations on Brexit NIGEL FARAGE
Nigel Farage, during today's protest at the Conservative Party's conference, has committed to mobilize the army of the people.'
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party stated that politicians must feel the pressure of Eurosceptics – as proposed by one of their own Members, Theresa Maya, should negotiate with the EU.
A regular conservative messenger Peter Bone declared in Birmingham that the Great Britain would already be outside” if he was a secretary for Brexit Mr Farage.
However, the problem that Mrs. Maya faces in the reconciliation of her row, where there is deep disturbance, has also been highlighted by conservatives fighting for endurance in the EU who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain its compromise plan from Chequers under the attacks of Brexit, the residents in the Union and the EU itself.
The unions insist that they will continue to seek to agree with Brussels, regardless of the consequences – and will force Euroskeptics and Labourists to choose between its package and the ‘Chaos’.
Mr. Bone informed that the Leave Means Leave group would be gathered in Solihull, where he wanted to “cough on Chequers”.
He proposed Mr. Farage to become a representative and have responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was headed, we'd be out today," he said.
Ambassador Wellingborough added: "I will stand for Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers."
To show his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight World Wars so that we would have to listen.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.’
Mr. Bone rejected the proposals that the public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: "The thought that British citizens would change their views and want to last, is totally exhaustive."
Conservative Deputy Brexita Andrea Jenkins, who also attended the march, told the reporters: "I just say, Mrs Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is unacceptable in the wide public, opposition will not vote for him and do not like it by members of our party or our activists who are currently filling the streets to be elected at all.
Forget the Chequers and start listening.’
In a sharp report for Mrs. May, she says, "The Ministers will keep their place when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage declared that the conservative policy must be ‘involved in an uncomfortable situation’ if they wanted to betray their decisions taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
"It's about trust between us - people - and our political class," he said .
"They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are standing here today to tell them that we will not let you."
In his report, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the edge of betrayal Brexit, to feel pressure.
"Now we mobilize the army of the people of this country that has provided us with victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become independent and proud of the Great Britain that rules itself."
In the meantime, the Union residents were walking by Birmingham and then organized two-hour meetings in the centre of the city.
Several activists had the transparency of the Conservatives against Brexit after the weekend of the operation of this Party.
Labourist Ambassador Lord Adonis laughed at conservatives because of the security problems of the application of the party after the start of the conference.
"This are people who, according to their own words, can provide IT systems and technologies for Canada plus, for free boundaries, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a bunch.
There is nothing like a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to "consult" the president's candidacy
American Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after November's elections, she will "consider the president's candidacy".
Boston Globe reports that a democrat from Massachusetts talked about her future on Saturday at the town in the West Massachusetts.
Warren, the frequent criticism of President Donald Trump, is trying to re-elect November against the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was a co-Chairman of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She found herself in the center of speculation that she could stand up to Trump in 2020.
The action on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the voters at the city since Trump seated to the office.
One of the participants asked her whether she plans to address the presidential office.
Warren said that it was time to “wifes go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that means a woman in the highest place. ”

The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 ET news conference.
A video from the Friday shot was issued with an application for identification of a man caught on the recording.

Great Price Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of the world master when the team director joined his victory over Sebastian Vettel
The moment Valtteri Bottas ended on Saturday qualification before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the Mercedes team director would play a great role in the race.
From the field, Bottas had a good start and almost got rid of Hamilton when in the first two turns he defended his position and called Vettel to attack a team partner.
Vettel went into the dep first and let Hamilton reach the cars circling on the rig of the group, which should be decisive.
The rider of Mercedes went to the shop later and after his exit, he arrived behind Vettel. However, Hamilton went forward and in a close struggle, the Ferrari rider had to not be willing to leave the inner road free so that he could defend himself after a double maneuver in the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the back of the ride field and at the end of the first round he was on his 21th birthday in the lead.
Then he led a large part of the race because he held the original tyres as long as possible to focus on the rapid finish and could take Kim Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally, he went to the dep in the 44rd round, but in the remaining eight wheels he couldn't increase the rate and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend, and when he got his order, he was acting like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done fantastic work and the rewards are the first two places," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body speech.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at the Saturday meeting because she insisted not to publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford with the prosecution of the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh for sexual attack.
During the meeting in Western Virginia, he did not directly mention the statement granted by Ford before the Senate Court Commission, instead of saying that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “the wicked and disgusting and lying. ”
"One thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that happens last days in the Senary when you see the anger, when you see those people as angry and wicked and disgusting and lying," he said.
"When you look at publications and publications and they say to you, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, can you run away?
Remember her answer... you've published the document -- ah, ah, what?
Oh, no.
Not published."
Well, wait a minute.
We published... no, no," he added and imitated the Senator.
Feinstein has sent Ford's letter with the details of the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and information escaped at the beginning of September – but Feinstein refused to escape from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's orders, nor have I published information about the case," Klomisi Feinstein said, as the Hill informed.
"She asked me to keep everything secret, and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
However, the president, who spoke to the meeting on Saturday night, probably did not believe her words: “I will tell you that this is a really bad speech of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but anyway, it's the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
The President continues to defend the candidate at the judge of the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual distress, and indicated that the Democrats use these charges for their own goals.
"They are determined to take back too much of any available means.
You see the crush, the disgusting thing, they don't care who they're hurting whom they're going to have to knock into the country to get back to the power and to the steering," the Mediaite President's words quoted.

The analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The lawsuit terminated its speech on Saturday in this case, where a man is repeatedly judged by the burning of a woman alive in the State of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Ministry of Justice, in the person of his analyst Paul Rowlett, witnessed for a few hours and provided expert reviews in intelligence analysis.
The jury analyst planned a scenario to use the records from the phone 29 accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett stated that he obtained location data from several mobile phones that proved that Tellis was at the night of her death in Chambers, which was in contrast with his previous statement, stated The Clarion Ledger.
On the basis of the cell phone data, he proved that he spent the night with Chambers, he picked up that he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, who was visited by the police.
Sanford stood in court in the congregation and proved that the day was not in town.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said, "he's lying because my car was in Nashville that night."
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks to the day she died.
But the cell phone records indicate that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Chambers Tellis erased Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“ He removed it completely from his life, ” Hale said.
The defense will start its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to come before the jury later the same day.

Another black?!
The N.A. trainer sues a couple for his dismissal after the "racist" text report
The newyor woman complains a couple of for her discriminatory dismissal after she received the wrongly sent text report from her mother, in which she was labeled “the next black” text report.
A couple refused to be racists and compared the lawsuit I “extortion”.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed fear when the first day at work in 2016 found out that the new teacher of her children, Giselle Maurice, was black.
“NEEEEEEEE, FURTHER CLASS," she wrote P. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in the text report.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her two times.
When she understood her faux passport, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman expelled Mrs. Maurice and said that her executionary, who was a African, worked really badly and that instead of her, the Philippine was expected, stated New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the wage for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice has sued a couple of compensations for dismissal and requests a compensation of 350 USD per day of a six-month engagement for which she was hired at the beginning, even though without a contract closed.
"I want to show them that this is not done," said the Post newspaper this Friday and added: "I know it is discrimination."
However, the two have returned a stroke with the fact that they are not racists, but that the termination of Mrs. Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure because they were afraid that they could not trust her after that insult.
“My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are not racists," said her husband, Joel Plasco list Post.
“But would you trust your child in the hands of someone you treated roughly, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
Oh, come on."
Plasco compared the complaint to “extortion ” and stated that his wife cared for only two months of old child and was in“ a very difficult situation. ”
"Would you drive someone like this?
This is not a nice thing at all," the investment banker said.
Even though the jury continues, the social media was very quickly convicted to a couple for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington's stories were afraid that readers weren't identical with a speaking bear, showed the latest reports.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said to the rapporteur: “It is difficult to feel in the situation of someone who reads it first, before the publication.
It's very fun to know now that we already know the great success of the Paddington bear."
She stated that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write a child's book about a small bear bear, was very disappointed that his work was rejected, added on the 60th anniversary of the book, which became “sweet ” point after his death last year.
She added to Paddington, who was described as “the very important member of her family, ” that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was quite a silent man, he never had any applause," she said.
"But because Paddington was such a real figure for him, it was like you had a child who has achieved something you can really be proud of.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success with this view.
Even though it was just his creation and imagination, he always tried to make all his success only to Paddington."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was quickly transported to Louise Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that this is really bad and that he does not expect her to get out of it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I had a call from Nada, where she told me she would die in two more minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tash, I love you very much.
I'll be there soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medicinal products given to her doctors to keep her heart in the walk slowly lose their efficiency and leave her body.
She died shortly after, and it was like everything closed up.
I just had to sit and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to keep it in me."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, entered the plane together with other passengers, without showing what difficult test she is doing.
"No one knew about it," she said.
“I kept my head shut, all the time my faces tear.
It's difficult to explain, but it was just during the flight when I felt exciting understanding for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
The grieving women send cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones because of suicide cooperate to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending cards to the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers on which people can search for support.
The son of Mrs. Davis was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and took his life in their 18 years.
"I don't want any other parents to feel what I felt every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said that her son was a talented young cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile was able to light every room."
Nevertheless, before his death, he left work because he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found a fleshless body of his cousin after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis says: “I fear all the time how it will affect his life. ”
Mrs. Davis proposed cards, “to inform people that they have people who are willing to help them and can talk to them even if they were their friends.
Don't shut up, you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a old friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me that he felt on the bottom or depressed at all," he explained.
"We then observed a change in his conduct a few days before Christmas.
It was the worst of Christmas, when the children opened the gifts, nor looked at them, nothing."
She stated that her partner’s death was an enormous trauma for them, but that it must be progressively: “This thing can do a complete hole in the family.
It broke us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on the balance of how the FBI starts his investigation.
"I thought we could get something that he actually asked for -- investigation at the limitation time, with a limited range -- we could bring a little unity into it," stated Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would "depart" because both parties would bury themselves at acquired positions.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to initiate the investigation?
Their resistance is well timed.
The elections in the middle of the election period are only five weeks away from us, on November 6th, and if the Republicans have done wrong according to the expectations, it will lead to their substantial weakness in their attempts to bring the requested man to post at the highest court of this country.
George W. Bush called the Senators, lobated at them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for President Bush and by his way he met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary at that time.
What happens if the FBI compile his message?
The Senate will vote on this and there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
However, it is not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which enabled Vice-President Mike Pence to break the remiss and confirm the Supreme Court.
Numbers of refugees from North Korea for Kim "declined"
The number of refugees from North to South Korea since the beginning of the government Kim Chong-Una dropped seven years ago, according to the South Korean legislator.
Byeong-seug Park, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Unitedation, stated that in the last year there were 1127 escapes — compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park further stated that there are more strict checks on the borders between North Korea and China and higher rates required by the smugglers on the borders.
Pchjongjang has not issued any public statement.
The large majority of refugees from the North today receives an offer for South Korean citizenship.
Soul claims that since the end of Korean war in 1953 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border.
Most of them run across China, with which North Korea has the longest border, and it is easier to cross it than in a severely protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between both Koreans.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not as refugees, and often forced them to repatriate them.
Relationships between North and South – which are still technically in war – have been significantly improved in recent months.
In this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pchjongjang for interviews that focused on stopped denuclearisation negotiations.
This was the historic June meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Chong-Un in Singapore, where they agreed on large conditions of co-operation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong accused the United States of no progress in the issue of sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way to allow us to be unilaterally disarmad," said Mr Ri in speech before the United Nations Valn Meeting in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Democratic Minority, Nancy Pelosiová, called the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that it was inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this note on Saturday interview at Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help myself, but if any woman ever showed such a theater, they would call it "hysterical," Pelosi said in her response to Kavanaugh's quarterly statement before the Senate Court Commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all the charges that he sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at the time they were both in a teenager age.
During his initial word, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking about his family and his age at high school.
He also explicitly condemned democrats in the committee and stated that their accusations against it were “gratesk and coordinated attacks” to organized liberals who could not be transferred through the Hillary Clinton's loss in the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's deposition proved that he was unable to work at the Supreme Court because he showed he was preconditioned against democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself by these statements and the way he was based on Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi answered negatively to the question whether she would try to appeal to Kavanaugh in case of his confirmation, even if democrats received most representatives in the Assembly.
"I will tell you this -- if he does not tell the truth to Congress, then he is not only eligible for work at the Supreme Court, but also in the court on which he is currently working," Pelosiová said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. District Court of Appeal .
Pelosi added that as a democrat had concerns about the potential benefits of Kavanaugh in the Court of Justice Act on Admissible Care or Roe vs. Wade, because it was considered a conservative judge.
In the framework of the hearing of his previous confirmation in the function, Kavanaugh avoided the answer to the question whether he would reverse any decisions of the Supreme Court.
"There's no time for a hysterical, predictable person to come to court and expect us to just say "Yeah, that's a beauty," said Pelosi.
And women have to rule it.
After the vocabulary, months and years, she couldn't get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continues: “The woman who used to make a director somewhere helped me, who told me she was also crying when she was angry, but she created a certain technique, which means that when she was angry and she started crying, she told the person she was talking to: “You may think I'm crying because I am sad.
But I'm angry."
And so she went on.
And I think that's great."
The tears are acceptable as a means of reaction to anger, partly because they are not understood.
One of my most alive memories comes from the first job where I worked in the office where the men were dominated, and I once expressed my incredible anger with crying, but the elderly, always a cold manager I always feared a little, caught me in the neck and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never show them that you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to have you."
Patricia Schroeder, once a democratic congressman from Colorada, cooperated with Gary Hart at his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught at the unmarried affair on the Monkey Business ship and had to retire from the fight. Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not examine the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It was not a well-reasoned decision," she said to me with a smile after 30 years.
“Seven other candidates were already running and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snowboy and Seven Patches."
Because at that time, the campaign has been running for long, it has not been able to take a step with acquiring contributions, so it has committed to not starting to the fight unless it acquires 2 million USD contributions.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a man candidate would only give it 250 USD.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally implement the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions – as expressing appreciation to people who supported it, frustrating with a system that made it difficult to gain money and focus on the voter rather than on delegates and from the anger of sexism, that she was totally angered.
"You may think I've crashed nervously," Mrs. Schroeder said about how the press reacted to it.
"And perhaps you would think that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking what they might write to me on the stone.
"She cried?"
Why can Chinese-American business war for Peking good
The introduction of the trade war between the United States and China was deaf, and even though the battle is far away, experts say that there is a long-term breakdown between countries.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, provided first warning this year by giving Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
Most of the most important escalations, however, have seen the light of the world this week when new tariffs for the goods of 200 billion USD (150 billion GBP), which practically means the taxation of half the trade exports from China to the United States.
Beijing has reacted every time, the latest of the salaries of the customs tariffs to five to ten percent of the 60 billion imports of American goods.
China tried to repay the United States the same coin and it is unlikely that the second largest economy of the world would kneel in the knee.
Even if China wanted Washington to return to the original railways, it would have meant to resign from his demands, but publicly subjected to American requirements would be totally humiliating for Chinese President Si Jin-pching.
Still, experts think that if Peking could play his cards correctly, the US business war could positively support China in a long-term manner because it would reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
"The fact is that a rapid political decision to Washington or Peking could create economic conditions that would start economic development in both countries. This is much more dangerous than the observers have ever accepted," said Abigail Grace, a research co-worker focusing on Asia in the thinking tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, said Foreign Minister
Siria claims that she is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding the country devastateed by more than seven years of war.
During the talk at the Valn Meeting of the United Nations Foreign Minister Walid al-Moul stated that the conditions in the country improved.
"The current situation in the territory is more stable and safer through progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas of destroyed terrorists into normal condition.
Now all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees who were forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures focused on their daily life.
The UN estimates that Syria has left more than 5.5 million inhabitants since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million inhabitants still live in the country with the need for humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moul said that the Syrian regime welcomes any aid in building the devastate country.
However, he emphasized that he would not accept the conditional aid or assistance from the countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe responded clearly to the victory in Ryder Cupu in Paris
The Euria team won in Ryder Cupu in 2018 by defeating the United States team with the final score 16,5 to 10,5 at Le Golf National on the border of trouble in France.
The United States has now lost the sixth part of the European soil, so it has not won Ryder Cupu in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team reached 14.5 points needed for the defeat of the United States.
The U.S. star, Phil Mickelson, who mostly suffered from the tour, then launched a ball into the water on 3 pair of 16 holes and left Francesco Molinarim's victory.
The Italian golf player then brightened in all its wheels and became one of the 4 players and reached the best results of 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was approved in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 European team players with the lowest evaluation, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The most valuable world player Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who apparently graduated his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain Sergio Garcia became the best European player with 25.5 points gained behind his career.
“I usually don't cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, really happy I got a cup back.
Everything depends on the team, I'm glad I could help," Garcia said after Europe's victory.
He gave a cup to his landlord John Ramp, who defeated the American legend of Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in the singles on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride that I beat Tiger Woods, and I grew up on watching this guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and now records a career record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
The strange statistics of one of the best players of all times, which has won 14 largest titles, with which only Jack Nicklaus can be compared to.
The United States team struggled all weekend in trying to find a fairway, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed a top golf during the whole tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk, after the unsatisfactory results of his team, said: “I am proud of these boys, really fighting.
We really warmed Europe in the heart this morning.
We didn't really do it.
I'm scratching my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup and in collaboration with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cupu committee, we will move forward.
I like those 12 boys, I'm glad I could make them a captain.
I really have to screw up.
