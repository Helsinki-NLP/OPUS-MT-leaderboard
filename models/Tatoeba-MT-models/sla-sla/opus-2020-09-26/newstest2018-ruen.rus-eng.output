The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, signed a law on administrative responsibility for the violation of the period and order of the salary of goods (work, services) in procurement for public and municipal needs.
The law aims to address a very severe problem of non-compliance with the procurement of public and municipal procurement.
Another two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs were unable to receive payments under the already completed public and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia had ordered the General Prosecutor of RF to take special control of the problem.
Because businessmen themselves were unable to deal with unconscious procurement contracts that had not supported the financing of contracts, they tried to avoid the payment obligations taken and included illegal conditions in treaties.
The problem was system-wide in the country.
Since 2015, 9.7 thousand submissions have been submitted for the protection of the rights of entrepreneurs for public procurement, resulting in their consideration of disciplinary responsibilities, 4.5 thousand officials, to the administrative 533, the investigative authorities for the organization of processing checks, represented 75 materials, 46 of which were criminalized.
As a result, more than 66 billion rubber entrepreneurs have been exhausted.
These huge amounts have not been accumulated as a result of non-payment of many billion contracts.
Many, systematic delays in paying services to entrepreneurs were brought to baseline debts.
This is a very characteristic case.
A small company manager won a competition for social transport services for several million rubbers.
A man has invested all his robbery resources, fully fulfilled his obligations, but he has not received the payments in time.
The result is a growing financial comma from pay debts, taxes, credits that would result in bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not contacted the attorney's assistance.
The problem has now been maximised in a number of regions.
However, as at the first six months of 2017, the total debt of public and municipal contracts identified by the prosecutors of the Russian Federation was approximately 27.4 billion rubles.
In the regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the prosecutor is working in a manual anti-crisis management regime.
The Prosecutor-General has held a separate meeting with local representatives, on which all prosecutors ' violations and immediate removal measures are subject to substantial consideration.
Such operational meetings have already been held this year in Yaroslava and Ecaterinburg.
Qualifying the payment discipline of public procurement would be able to implement the Federal Law No. 189-FZ, on the amendment to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Violations in the establishment of administrative responsibility of the procurement officers for the violation of the date and order of the salary of goods (work, services) in the implementation of procurement for public and municipal needs, which last week the President of Russia signed.
The draft law was developed by the Ministerial Development of Russia on the Gender Prosecution Initiative.
The new law will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative offences of articles, which provides fines from 30,000 to 50,000 rubbers for the violation of the procurement officer of the date and order of the payment of goods, work and services for public and municipal procurement.
If the official has already been punished by the administrative punishment for a similar offence, it is expected to be disqualified for one year to two years.
All prosecutors of the Russian Federation have already received an order to ensure that these legislative novels are implemented in practice.
The Panel for the Protection of Civil Rights announced a warning on the movement in Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colorful Population has issued a warning for colored people traveling to Missouri because of the discrimination policy of the state and racist attacks.
The statement of the group reads: “The prevention for traveling the National Association to promote the progress of the colorful population by 28 August 2017 calls upon African travellers, guests and citizens of Missouri to be particularly careful and to be more cautious in state travels in connection with a number of suspicious incidents on the racial ground that have recently occurred throughout the territory of the state and that have been brought here.”
According to the National Association for the Promotion of Colorful Population, the Panel ' s prevention of the movement of the group was prompted by the law adopted in the Missouri, which has made people more difficult to win claims relating to discrimination and that the law enforcement authorities of the State have often chosen their minority objects.
“You have people who are subject to violations of human rights.
They are stopped on roads because of the color of skin, beating and killing," said the Canzas City Star, Rod Chapel, President of the National Association of Promoting the Progress of the Colorful People of Missouri.
"We hear complaints as often as ever before."
This is the first warning of such a kind as the United States Organization.
The Panel referred to incidents such as the degradation of black students on racial sign at Missouri University and the death of twenty-five-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he had ended his gas during his state trip, and the Missouri police arrested him without accusing him of a crime.
The warning also refers to the recent report of the General Prosecutor ' s State of Missouri, which provides that the possibility to be suspended on the road for black drivers is 75 per cent higher than for the white.
"The aim of the warning is to be informed of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
“People must be prepared in any way, whether they will take with them the money to be bailed or inform their relatives that travel in the territory of the state.”
According to the latest data of the FBI report on hatred crimes, 100 hatred crimes were registered in Missouri in 2015, which makes the 16th State of such violations numbered.
The movement warning is also the response to the new law of Missouri, which would be more difficult to raise a case against a legal person in connection with housing or labour discrimination.
Previously, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Freedoms (ACLU) announced warnings for travellers in Texas and Arizona after these States adopted new immigration control laws, according to which local law enforcement authorities were prescribed to arrest people for violations of immigration laws that, according to ACLU, racial checks had to increase.
Preventions on movement are usually issued by the State Department in respect of other countries, but recently, public organizations have struggled to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States.

All wounded are transported to the hospital.
According to the Agency, the police had stopped the car, and two in the armed person car had fired by the law enforcement officers.

Rosturism supports the law on the cancellation of free luggage for non-return aircraft
The head of Rosturism, Oleg Safonov, said in an interview with the RBC television, that " positive" refers to the adoption of the law on the cancellation of free delivery of luggage in non-return aircraft.
"You must create conditions where a person who has no baggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one with the baggage," he stressed.
Mr. Safonov noted, however, that, despite the concerns of citizens, it would not have to pay for the upper clothing and mobile phone in the manual layout.
"It would be right to calm all our citizens and tourists and to say that, to the top of the clothes, to the zontic, to the mobile phone, to iped or even to any computer, it would not have any relationship," said the head of Rosturism.
Previously, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the rule of free delivery of the luggage at an inverse aircraft.
It is that airlines can determine the number of seats and weights of the baggage included in the non-return tariff.
Vladimir Putin ordered to eliminate bajkal pollutants
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, at the Bajkal Protection Meeting, reported that significant lake territories have been extremely polluted in recent years.
It commissioned to identify sources of funding, plans and executors for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also ordered the full restructuring of pollutants.
"It is also necessary to deal with the objects that continue to work here, the cleaning structures of most of them are carried out," the President quoted "RIA News" quoted.
He also added that the Prosecutor-General of Russia should conduct an verification of environmentally harmful activities.
He said that there are problems in the area of lake related to the phenomenon of natural garbage and a number of ecological violations.
"I want to emphasize this: not all in order to verify, there is also a measure to be known, but it is an illegal and environmentally harmful activity and to take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Previously, the Prosecutor reported the reduction of fish stocks in the Baykal Lake and suggested an increase in the number of environmental surveillance facilities.
Recall, on 15 June, Vladimir Putin in a direct line stated the need to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of a special security regime.
He was informed by the people of the island Olhon, which belonged to the Bajkal Natural Territory.
The Head of the Ministry of Sergei Donsky immediately invited the problem to be resolved by clarifying the borders of the Bajkal water zone, but in the Government of Bureau, it was reminded that such changes were not sufficient, as the restrictions were related to a number of regulatory acts.
Previously in the Mineconomics, the problem was proposed to be resolved by changing the Earth Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
A new temple will appear in Yugoslavia
In the village of Sosva, members of the communities of the indigenous few people of the North of Rachtiña participate in the construction of the Orthodox temple, as the Holy Nicolas Wondercraft.
His location is the river shore, the temple will be well seen from far away, so it will serve for fishers with a road lighter.
According to community representatives, construction work has already been completed this year, now set up the dome, there are church colonels.
The Irish RAB of the fleet has been transported.
The temple is called Holy Nicolas Wonderful, since it is honored by the Orthodox Church as the Protector of Passengers, including the fishermen.
In Cosec, the fish industry gives work to the settlers, feeds them.
The local inhabitants are waiting for the temple to open their doors, and children even write about it as local qualities.
Disneyland with a death punishment.
Why do the laws comply in Singapore?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in the dining room in open air.
By commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette at the other, but he carefully stores the oaks in a iron box taken from his office.
After the end of the conversation, the businessman is headed to the nearest urna - to the metres - and throws the bulls out there.
Punishment for garbage in the public is $500 local, reports Chang.
You know, since I was a kid, my reflex just worked out: you can't throw a fence from a candy to a bridge, they're just being punished right now.
And now the video cameras are all over.
And really, the Singapore trotoaries in the center of the city are clean, like in the museum.
Chang explains: three months ago, his 18-year-old son of his neighbor drew a graphite of the wall of the old colonial building.
The court recognised the guy's guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to a rack.
What?!
Imagine it.
He got ten hits with wooden sticks and spent a week in prison.
We don't have any body punishment at all.
As the highest level of life and unbelievably rigorous laws were combined in Singapore, the AIF observer was dealt with.
There's no one here in mind to cancel the death penalty, explains Victor Lee Hong.
And the Government has long been concerned about the opinion of both the European Union and the United States.
If a person takes a large drug party or trades it, he's given a hang-up.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizenship was detained at the Changy airport: he took 400 g of cocaine.
It was protected by the Australian Prime Minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the Pope of Rome.
But the guy was still hanged.
After that, the drug couriers are carefully crossing our country by side.
The following is: in Singapore, laws are obliged to observe all in order, not only modest and wealthy people.
No matter who you are, the millionaire, the vice Prime Minister, the famous artist or the resident of the European Union.
If you have a cocaine, you'll be hanged.
When you walk in Singapore and you meet a number of warnings everywhere, you're misunderstanding, how much in this town's government of bans!
For example, the gum rubber is sold only in the pharmacists, and can be purchased strictly by the physician (!).
The arrival tourists will not be taken from the gum, but it would be worth sticking the ring in the metro, fixing $1,000 local dollars.
In four days, I met two people with white plates on my neck, "I was wasted."
In addition to the fines, the worms are often convicted to the "train in the palace": to clean up the parks and beaches for a week.
6,000 row pays a "criminal" who forgot to wash the water in the public toilet, and when trying to make a small need for the housing elevator, a special detector is being blocked by the door and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the exotic laws, the prohibition of pigeon feeding on the streets, the public performance of songs and even the excessive flood of the room plant (!): the abundance of water is considered to attract comaers.
In order to avoid smoking fires, smokers cannot carry fires into the metro, otherwise they are punished by 5,000 Singapore dollars.
In general, the idea is, as long as you try, you're going to break something.
It's not at all -- it's trying to convince me of Muhammad Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of the local tournament.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on the paper, and in the last 20 years, I haven't seen someone attracted for their violations.
Why do they keep them?
So the citizens can not relax.
The main rules are monitored inconsistently.
Let's say that if a minor is sold cigarettes in a kiosk, they will be punished by all the chain: the master of the store pays a huge amount, the offender himself will get hits in the back, and the seller will also be exposed and imprisoned.
It is because of such cruel laws of offence in Singapore.
Is that justified?
During the 1970s, we had a mess on road roads - carists ignored lights, drived as they wanted, drunk for driving.
After the penalties were introduced in a year, everything was calm.
Now the driver, drinking a whiskey, knows that if they stop, the police won't let go for bribes, they'll charge the cost of the apartment and send for years a prison.
Many aliens in South-Eastern Asia, the city of State seemed to be a variety of concentrating camps.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with death" -- a visitor from the United States, who has led to a horrified universal wealth of the inhabitants, a "clear airport" and "cultural nature".
Discovery, such things are unnatural, looks artificially, and it should not be.
The first days in Singapore, and you're sure you're afraid of throwing a paper on the trip, you're captured if you walked into the metro with ice cream.
But then you arrived in the Little India area, and suddenly, the "explosion of the pattern," the bus stops with plastic glasses.
"What's that?", you're surprised.
Here's the singapurs smile.
Anything happens.
Not for every such a crime, but you must know: if you have been calculated, you will not be awarded, for you have violated the law.
Often, it's enough for a man to act normally.
Of course, the power in Singapore is authorised.
But you know what?
In the Vietnam Hoshimine, I was moving very carefully - motorcycleists often pull smartphones and cameras from the tourists.
In the center of Paris, there's plenty of dirty mosquitoes and beggars.
In our streets, not everyone's trying to throw a trash into urns.
Singapur, however, has become the most peaceful, clean and safe city on Earth, through a set of dragon fines and ruthless (i.e. until death execution).
You'll think about it.
This is the human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one was trained until he was punished.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, it is voluntary compliance with laws.
And we have to think that in Russia, we would be happy with the pure streets, the lack of trash in the metro, and welcome the arrest of those who confused the elevator with the public toilet.
There's a body punishment. Thank you, don't.
The rest of the Singapur laws are at least worth looking after them.
Nothing sacred?
Now the White House of Tramp is targeted on the Statue of Freedom.
The most reliable sign of modification is when it begins to fight the statues.
The Americans understand this not worse than all others -- from here intentionally the theater statue of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos square in Bagdad in 2003.
Steven Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Government of Tramp, certainly knew what he was doing when he carried a symbolic seky over the Statue of Freedom during a severe dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acstah on the proposals of the president on a sharp reduction in legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try the statue himself.
The quantities of the owners of walking ships and artists representing the Statute of Freedom would have linched him if he tried to do so.
But he tried to make sense of it, and especially the meaning that she had been appointed in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, when the verses of Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
As Miller said to Acosta, "I don't want to go deep into history, but the Statue of Freedom is a symbol of American freedom that lights the world.
The text that you speak was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Freedom."
Miller put the facts right, but as he said, it's not really about history.
This is about the current sound of the incredible words of Lazarus, the only people in which the State invites not any immigrants but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, your poor, your crowds who wish to breathe freely, "
"The unfortunate waste" has never been so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't do the literature - he made it clear that in America, the Tramps are not waiting.
This dispute on the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus and her friends who fought to put her words on the statues after her death were very well understood that they did a completely political act.
The sculpture of the purpose was to mark the link between the French and the American Republics by using a banal classic figure of the women ' s image of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: In her scripture, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she received a completely different name: the Mother of the Exile.
The compound of the verse and image was a brilliant feminist move and a destructive attack against American nativeism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right one, even though to change it back.
The humming Rash Limbo, a kind of John Baptist, who announced the arrival of Trampa in 2010, considered that the Freedom does not invite anyone, rather the early non-conservator, bearing the flame of America in the darkness of the world: "Free goes forward.
It brings a torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The towel is not needed to light the way to the United States."
Limbo's contrary to the custom here really got to the point.
The meaning of the statue depends only on the perspective.
Lazarus was a great creative achievement to see it as it would be seen by the poor, unhappy but full hopes of people on ships after a long and frequent swimming.
This means literally to look at the world with the eyes of people who are looking for asylum and the chance of a better life.
Her statue answers the words of hope and hospitality that they wish to hear.
And, of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Tramp ever want to admit.
Their torch is not needed to light the way, but to burn hatred, which is the only source of their power.
The Peace Championship of 2017: Neil Blake appreciates the Scots members of the United Kingdom.
Alyd Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots were in Britain.
Neil Blake, director of the Federation of Light Athletics of Great Britain, stated that a 16-person Scotland part of the World Championship would make a "significant contribution to the team game".
The recorded number of Scottish flavours was selected for the London Championship on Friday 2017.
Blake believes that in Scotland there is something special and the Federation of Light Athletic of Great Britain should take into account this.
"We know that and we try to understand and support as long as they have the potential," said Blake.
"I spoke to people at the Scotland Sport Institute, and they think it's related to what they did.
The Scotland Federation of Light Athletics thinks that what they did has to work.
The British Federation of Light Athletics: with what they did, we have to work.
And people on the street think the same thing.
I don't know why the circumstances did so, but it's perfectly brilliant."
Some of the Scotland Leaflets are pretending for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 m; and Alyd Doyle has chosen the team to be their captain.
"Alyde is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," said Blake.
"A lot of light athletes, whether the Scots are or not, and from where they live or are trained, came out of this room, feeling pride and intention to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eileed had in it were wonderful."
The silver medal holder of the Commonwealth Championship, which at its fifth Championship of the World, will run a distance of 400 m from obstacles, said that 16 Scots in the British College is "unbelievable".
The previous record on the number of Scots in the world championship was seven in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Muir, specialized in a medium-distance race and beat five British and two European records last year.
She'll run 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O'Her, who will take part in the 1500-meter race, is another Scotch to pay attention: he's got a good season behind his back with wins in the British gathering competitions and the Annual competitions.
Doyle remembers his first world champion, when the only Scotch in the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team said that she was "incredibly proud of the fact that so many of her companions were not only entering the group but in some cases they would claim medals and fight for the finals.
"The captain is chosen by other members of the team, so it was a great honour in any case, but to know that your companions voted for you and chose you, it was a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who entered the board.
This shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all the light athletes that will seek to reach the pedestal of receipt.
What about my captain speech?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to take home the World Championship.
So it's just about how important it is to receive support from the cheerleaders and to use that we're going to be again at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to go to his arena and participate in competitions, and the atmosphere would be just great."
Blocking criticisms at Facebook: do not go to public position if you are not willing to listen to the criticism from the voters
The founder of our country understood what the critical press was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not prevent them from criticizing him for everything from internal policy to his political principles.
The criticism certainly irritated him.
But he didn't shut his mouth to his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "You can take the freedom of speech and us, deaf and smooth, will lead like sheep to a fight."
Now I'll go to Governor Maryland Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
The submissioners of Hogan blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Union of Protection of Civil Freedoms brought it to court.
The submissioners of the Governor have called this case a low case, and the commentary on the Internet was written in the spirit of "yes and what".
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But that's important too.
And that's especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is an incredibly popular Republican governor in a democratic state's advantage.
It is second in the country's approval rating among 50 governors.
Hogan is not a stubborn reaction.
He demonstrated a firm hand in the governance of the State and commitment to its principles.
He also uses Facebook as a primary means of communication with his voters and has a joke on his page showing his hairy head after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the Governor ' s page, which is stated as an official public forum and conducted by the administration on taxpayer's money, is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In the Washington Post interview, the press secretary Amelia Ches had protected the Governor's actions, claiming that the blocking of comments was just their modernization.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolles, spamers and hayers that are evil on the Internet.
The Post talked to some of the real people that Hogan blocked.
And these are real people, not trolles, teachers, businessmen, pastors who call for their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectable, content and not rude.
The Pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to the fact that Hogan was Catholic.
The Lawyer of Lakshmi Sarma Raman from Boui, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hatred crimes.
"I wrote a pleasant comment that I was disappointed in the absence of his response to hatred crimes and other news recently," she wrote in the section of comments to the article in Post.
"I also don't like the idea that when many people leave comments to the same theme, some say that it is a so-called scroll instead of acknowledging that they are dealing with a large group of dissatisfied citizens."
What the subjects of the governor call "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call the active life position.
In the era of Facebook, it is easy to edit its image, just blocking critics or washing negative comments.
This is much less dust than before, when it was required to send people, collect and burn newspapers with critical frontiers or arrest and shut the mouth of the protesters.
But that's exactly what's going on right now, just in the figure.
Hogen is not the first official being criticised for not listening to Facebook and other social networks.
The President Tramp was filed a complaint from the Twitter users who were deprived of his Twitter account.
One of the first, turning decisions on this subject was taken this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge from Alexandria James C. Casheris, the Chairman of the County's Observer Board, Laudon, violated the First Amendment by banging the voter at his Facecbook account.
And in Kentucky, the Governor of the Republic of Matt Bevin made claims to the American Union of Protection of Civil Freedoms for its conduct in Facebook and Twitter.
It must not be so hard.
During Washington’s era of available mail expenses, some of the same turnover as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers grew four, and the authors of anonymous letters have severely distorted his authority.
Even then Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the names of Yurikola, Valerius, Belizerius and Porcius wrote letters to the newspapers laughing at the decision of Washington.
According to historical documents gathered by the online project " Documents of George Washington " , his office was filled with petitions criticising his position on the Treaty on Friendship, Trade and Maritime Swimming.
But he didn't try to make them shut up.
Freedom of speech, inadequateness and speech is the basis of our State.
And true leadership means consent.
Ronan Rafferty is hoping for home comforts in the Renaissance Club
The former European champion Ronan Rafferty is hoping for home comforts for the next three days when the Renesans Club in East Lottian will take the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for older sportsmen.
The crop of Northern Ireland, who led the neighbourhood at the Archerfield Links Club, was moving towards the final round last year until Paul Ilsa lost, was attached to the new place and served as a representative of the founder and director of the Jerry Sarvadi Club.
"I have seen the Renaissance Club build, and we see it coming to success with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this field at his best moment, it is in great state.
Jerry did a great job making this place.
He's a stronger commitment to this game and is proud of his achievements here.
This is an excellent demonstration for this field."
The Englishman Ils looked forward to the opportunity for the first time to resist the championship, despite the victory of his 32-year career in the European tournament and the European Challenge Tour.
"It's a really special sense," said the Southport player.
"I couldn't try to win "Extremadura Open" again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Return to this corner of the world is magic.
It's a beautiful place to play golf.
The memories returned last year, and my wife Sharon and I had a very special impression of winning last year.
It was a really special time, and we will always remember it."
Returns to battle in the native country of Gary Orr, joined in the European Tournament for older sportsmen after he had fulfilled 50 years earlier this year.
This event will be his first appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open 2013.
"When you play at home, it's always a little more important," said the inhabitant of Helensboro Orr.
"You want to act well, but you feel this extra burden."
I was very pleased to play again, and I showed a good golf.
I am pleased to see how everything is yet done."
In this field, the trio will be joined by the former winner of the Masters tournament, Ian Wusnom, and the Major Champions for the older sportsmen Paul Broadherst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNalty.
Orr and former Captain Rider Cup Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Steven McCalister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drammond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and the parking lot is 5 pounds an hour if one person is in the car, and 10 pounds if a person is two and more.
All income goes to the British Prostate Cancer Fund.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
The type of tunnels over the roads capable of swallowing car car car oxide are already being tested on the roads of Great Britain.
The country's transport agency, as reported in the autocar, reported on the positive results of the 100-foot tunnel tests established on one of the highways in the northern country.
The tunnel, height of 6 meters, is built from some new polymer materials that are capable of absorbing harmful substances contained in car explosions.
However, the creation of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the magnificent measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the British are going to expand a network of electrical power stations, implement a number of activities to reduce road flows, expand the use of commercial transport on electrical weapons and modernize the heavy truck park.
In official statistics, a quarter of all atmosphere pollution is transported, and unsatisfactory air quality is caused by up to 40,000 early deaths a year.
Mosgorsus has changed the punishment of Makaev disabilities to fine
Mosgorsud has changed the punishment of an invalid Anton Mamaev, who was convicted for four and a half years of the colony, to a fine of 200,000.
TASS reports that.
Previously, the prosecutor asked the court to replace the term for the condition, explaining his request by the fact that Mommyev's disease " prevents him from being in prison conditions."
An 28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years imprisonment of punishment in the general regime for the breakdown of the former specialist.
On 19 July, the tribunal at a tribunal to the SISO released a man from detention.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian Goldland
Preparing lunch, Bardin Degei doesn't use a tile.
She's even rarely used.
In its wooden house in Enarotala, the capital of the district of Panya in the rebel province of Papua, the housekeeper usually simply places a sweet potato called “nota” in the fire.
In half an hour, the squirreled club gets and eats with impatient, unlawful hands.
Degei is sitting on the earthly floor — she has no furniture — and this is where she does its housework, such as the washing of the clothing of the mud water from the nearby mud.
The bathroom serves a coffin in a room without a roof.
She's the youngest of her four husband's wives, so she hasn't been assigned to work in the field.
Multi-wife here is widespread.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink and there are soldiers.
"No one decides to walk in the village after five nights," she said.
It is a rare opportunity to view the daily life in Papua, the former Dutch Colony, which was joined in Indonesia in 1969 after a suspicious referendum, when only 1026 elders had been forced to vote, publicly raised hands before the occupying troops.
The existing movement for the independence of the Netherlands has quickly reversed its anger against the Government of Jacarda, which maintains severe control over the region without allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, and the independent State of Papua New Guinea took the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is the city as distant as abandoned; the road includes a half-hour flight from Jayapura, the provincial administrative center, Nabir, and then a five-hour rental car.
There's no public transport here.
The city with around 19,000 people consists of wooden houses covered by bamboo fences; the roofs of the hoffred were decorated by rhythm in different red shadows.
A few of the Indonesians came here, not to mention journalists, and almost none of the aliens.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, my papuas worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
“We were unusual to wear this clothing,” said Degei, pointing to its bright, hand-handed turbana, dark suit and a bright shirt.
"We used to carry only leaves on the body."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population live in poverty, and the levels of child mortality and literacy among the worst in Asia.
But it's also an Indonesian gold land.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grassberg, which belongs to the company Freeport McMorann in Phoenix, is only 60 miles away from Pania, a high-hore province of about 153.000 people in New Jersey.
Only in 2015, the Freeport company obtained gold and coppers at approximately $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua can be praised by forest stocks of $78 billion.
These wealths, however, have brought for the papuas one misfortune, guaranteeing that the powerful armed forces of Indonesia maintain their drowning presence here.
According to the New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, the Freeport company paid to local military officers and units nearly 20 million dollars, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands of greater autonomy by the papuas threaten the existence of this golden housing and are unjustly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 papuas were killed since 1969, and thousands were raped, tortured and deprived of freedom.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass murders in indigenous inhabitants of Papua High Bureau in the 1970s can be considered genocide.
Only last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peace protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything”, the report published by the Brisbane Eparchy in 2016 contains evidence of the wickedness committed in the preceding year, such as the executions without trial, torture, especially the parts, as stated in another report, rape and defeat by the electricity flow, and the cruel suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because the events occur every week,” said Andreas Harsono, studying in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The Gaiki had been delayed because Papua's resources attracted the inflammation of migrants from other areas of Indonesia.
3.5 million province populations of 83 per cent consist of Christians, but demographic indicators are changing from the arrival of Muslim economic migrants from the husted Indian islands - Java, Sumatra and Sulavesa.
The Javan lambs, “warungs”, sell baked chicken and mixtures of ‘gado-gado’ fruits that are supplied with nut sauce.
Local inhabitants are trying to endure competition.
“The Immigrants began to sell chicken and vegetables cheaper than the indigenous in Papua”, explains Abeth Jou, a twenty-four-year-old Pania, who moved to Jayapur, the provincial administrative centre, because of work.
“It is why the indigenous inhabitants of Papua, Mother-Mama (Women) Papua, have lost their market.”
The President of Indonesia, Joco Vidodo, known as Jockey, swore to engage in inequality and violations of rights in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Palais Palais Castle in Jakarta, the former carrier engaged in support of 27 of 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But in Papua, there was almost nothing to change, and locals feel loyal.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jockey, expecting it to fulfil our hopes for reconstruction of justice," said Jou.
In fact, only two months after the October inauguration, Joki Paniai survived the tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas techniques at the Enarotala island when two Indoniesian soldiers broke out of the dark.
Intimidated children told them they were supposed to turn the lamps on.
According to the local pastor Javedt Tebai, one of the soldiers insulted their tongue and came back with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who were drunk were chasing children and beating their examples of guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
A child, a sixteenth-year-old Julian Amo, was beaten so much that he fell in coma.
A few hours later, someone burned the Government's electoral commission nearby, and the next day the situation increased.
About a thousand papuas men, women and children gathered in the football field in front of the local police station and the military command to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting ports and fulfilled the White, the dance of the Papuas tribe of my pago, running rounds and illustrating the bird singing.
Some protesters began to throw stones into police office and military base.
When the situation came up, the internal radio soldiers were commanded: “If the crowd would resist more than three times, shoot them,” he sounded as officially claimed in the document that the TIME magazine had seen, but not published in local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Jeremyas Kayamé, head of the area of Kego Koto in Enarotala, felt the danger and called for calm, asking a crowd to walk away from home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I returned, my left wrist suddenly got a bullet," he told the TIME magazine, standing on the shelter of his brightly decorated wooden house.
Kayama still doesn't know who was shooting, but he says that the bullet arrived from the sherengs of the soldiers.
"There was a crowd, there was a lot of shots," he added.
The local resident of Alfius Jowah had been arrived three times, as his cousin, who was witnessing the shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that it is," said the TIME magazine Johannes, which, like many Indians, only uses one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
General Yotze Mende, Senior Inspector of the Police of Papua, told the reporters that his officers were just “protecting” their base because it was attacked.
"We must be protected when people threaten to kill us," said in 2015 the representative of the Police Commissioner Pujo Sulistio.
"It is a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and much more injured.
The news about murders came to Jacarda just the next day.
Three weeks later, Jockey made a ruthful speech in Jayapore, expressing his compassion for the families of victims and swore to deal with historical abuses of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it will never be repeated in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister for Security Viranto said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical violations of human rights.
But almost immediately, the reply came.
“The majority of the violations have happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 90s or at the beginning of the zero.
The point is, we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures to go," he said.
Viranto then renounced his words, speaking to the TIME magazine on 5 June in Jakart, and said that he did not plan to establish an organization for complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "All will be resolved through the court."
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of “a crime against mankind” for more than 1,000 deaths during the bloody vote of East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the incident in Pania.
Families of victims in Panya have met such statements with dark confidentiality.
"In the last three years, I was questioned four times, but there was no change completely," said Johannes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later he still lives in fear.
"I am terrified," he said.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'm shot."
His brother Jacob also felt that the inhabitants of Pania were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by soldiers after he helped bury four victims.
After we buried the bodies, the soldiers came after me," he said.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot rural residents in the neighbourhood of the District of Deia.
During the struggle between village residents and the construction manager who refused to help take a man without consciousness to the hospital, one person died and another 17 were wounded, including children.
A man, a 20 - year - old Ravianus Dove, who was drowned during fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
The angered rural residents protested in front of the construction site office of the company.
Policemen said that the villages were throwing stones into officers who responded to warning shots.
However, locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indoneian Special) began to shoot the crowd and killed one person.
"We were in such panic, we are afraid of revenge," said the TIME magazine of the twenty-five-year-old Doming Budya, who lived near the hospital and saw the wounded rapidly delivered.
"I was hiding at my house for two days."
The parliament Deiai requested the officers involved in the incident to respond, and the mobile police brigade was withdrawn from the region.
Pania was always a sick place for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of significant development causes displeasure to the tribes of mine, mony, data and damas all over the territories covered by the green central high mountains of Papua.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army, which claims that protects the rights of papuas by advocating sporadic attacks and attacks with abduction of people against Indian soldiers.
Some of the highest OPM leaders are from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Whoa.
As a response measure in the past years, thousands of people in Pania were arrested and unjustly detained under the proposal for “protection of national independence”.
Some have never returned.
Among the population of Papua Paniai is considered “a sad place forgotten”.
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
A small harvest of rice sold in Enarotala is too expensive for local people.
The bread is unavailable in the same degree.
People grow everything they feed here -- mostly notes, as well as some fruits and leave vegetables.
Agriculture is a work of women, each of which can care for four or five potato fields.
Usually, they maintain a majority of fruitage for the family, and the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten club notes are only 10,000 Indian rupees (75 cents).
The economic inequality between indigenous papuas and new migrants has increased over time, which arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new airlines to Nabir Airport.
A few existing vacancies are usually more educated and rich migrants.
Papuas have rarely enough money or skills to manage their own competitive business.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there is no job or money," said John Gobai, chairman of the Tribal Council of Paniai.
The isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
Furthermore, international media restrictions remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists, Frank Escudi and Basil Lonchan, were deported from Papua for “insufficient harmony with relevant organizations”, despite their rare permits for video recording.
According to Felim China, the Deputy Director of Asia of the Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the Jokowe pre-electoral campaign to cancel the media restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"Now, foreign journalists who are trying to report rebellious Eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and Western Papua, face new dangers: visa refusals and black lists," he said in his statement.
Insufficient attention from the press means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is primarily limited to direct neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “variable and widespread violations” in Papua, including the shooting in Pania.
The same countries in the past supported the OPM.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arramanat Nasir, dismissed the statement of the group, informing journalists in Jacard that “in Indonesia, there is still a democratic system and there is a free press, so to hide the evidence of human rights violations would be difficult.”
Local inhabitants want more foreign governments to focus on the situation.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Netherlands Human Rights Ambassador, Kyes Van Baar, visited Jayapur on 4 May, the local inhabitants violated the silence, please, “We want freedom”, as said the source that also attended the meeting, but wished to remain anonymous.
There are new presidential elections in Indonesia in 2019, but the papauas say that they would hardly vote for Jockey again.
"Jocovi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people involved in the shooting in Pania," said Gobai, chairman of the tribe Council.
He wants Jokow to know that the inhabitants of Panya, except that they live in the shadows of the greedy army, are poor, and education and health are in a pity.
Gobai said that the inhabitants of Pania, like the other papuas, considered their voice dedicated to Jockey's debt to pay.
"They don't need money; they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the victims of the shooting families in Pania have brought up the last symbolic act of non-compliance: they buried the body of one of the victims in the ground in opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice is likely to never enforce, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
“They have been killed by a member of our family”, says Jacob without raiseing their heads.
"What else were we supposed to do?"
The second time fire covers the Dubai Sky of the Fackel
The fire caught one of the world’s highest dwelling heavens in Dubai on Friday, forced hundreds of inhabitants to leave the seventy-fifth floor structure at 337 meters high.
This is the second fire that has been carried out on a high building, which is, in coincidence, called Fackel in two years.
The building had been evacuated, human victims were not reported, and there was no operational news about the cause of fire.
"We slept and woke up from a fire alarm and people's screams.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor,” said the Reiter resident of the heavens called George.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence Management, fire teams fired at approximately 4:00 a.m. on local time (h. Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that he was working on providing asylum to the victims.
The incident may return to the agenda the security issues of materials used in the exteriors of high buildings worldwide.
During the investigation by the Fakel administration after the fire, in 2015, it was found that the plaque was most affected — the external panels used for the formation and isolation.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that the isolation system and plaque panels of the Grenfel Tower building in London could accelerate the dissemination of the fire that occurred there in June, resulting from some 80 people.

He has not yet commented on the rumors, but today he has placed a piece of article of the News newspaper of 1 August.
The picture of Malachov signed the tag "boss of milk-sock."
The article on how to prevent the " burning" of the worker and pay attention to his condition.
If you recall numerous reports that the leader could not find a common language with the new arrived producer, which has started to reform "Let them speak", it is clear that he has so transparently implied, it says "CP".
The television leader, Andrew Malachov, was now on vacation and did not sign the application for release from the First Channel.
The situation of dismissal may be clarified in the coming days.
Five soldiers died in Afghanistan when the car exploded
At least five troops died in the explosion in the Afghan province of Gilmend, RIA News reports.
According to the police, the minised car exploded by the army block on the street.
It's known for 20 deaths.
There was a new PP in Giriška on Friday morning.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
Shooting between attackers and security forces continues.
Dyver took his shark's taste camera on the video.
The Dyver and researcher Greg Scomal (Greg Scomal) took a tape on a video shark that bit his ecchen camera GoPro.
The Rolique presented in Facebook the US Fisheries Agency in the state of Massachusetts, whose staff is Scomal.
The incident occurred on 2 August at Cape Code Sealand in the northeast of the United States, clarifying the Necn portal.
The man was trying to take the shark off the camera he held on a special stick.
When a man was noticed, the animal long more than three metres came to him.
The shark took a bit of a camera, not trying to attack a scientist.
Smoal explained that the predator did so to determine whether the gadget was eaten.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also observed that such a sea animal’s behavior had become new for scientists.
The cause of mass struggle in the Ural Military Centre
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District had arrived in the Elanie Training Centre, where a mass fight occurred.
Some details of this debate have already been known.
According to Mash's list on the WContakte page, the contractors of the Ural Military Part No. 31612 were cruelly defeated because of the unmanaged bed.
It started with the demonstration of a soldier named Sayan to ignore the officer's order to fill the screwed sheet.
The officer's side of the officer was set up by the soldiers of the sixth mouth.
Sayana supported her first mouth.
In half an hour, 140 young men were destroyed in the bed and canvas, exploded glass.
More than ten people were injured in the mass fight.
The CBI has denied the information on the knife.
The study showed that at least one of the five passengers in the United States were transporting prohibited items into a plane.
The study showed that more than 20 per cent of passengers were conscientiously or accidentally transported into the aircraft through the United States Transport Safety Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 per cent, were situated in a plane, under surveillance with prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Almost 1 percent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally weapons, ammunition or explosives.
Study conducted by the Charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and over 1,000 people also showed that young passengers are more inclined to break the rules.
From the respondents who recognized that they conscientiously tried to fly with something that was prohibited by ATC, 19.7 per cent were millenniums compared to less than 15 per cent of the generation X.
ACB staff consciously carry food and water mostly.
More than 3 per cent have recognized that acute items have been carried out through the surveillance, and 2.2 per cent of women's respondents and 3.7 per cent of men's respondents have admitted that they were conscientiously transporting prohibited medicinal products into the aircraft.
The company stated that she studied passengers throughout the country to find out how many of them were accidentally carried out by surveillance in airports and how conscious they did.
It is unlikely that most of all, conscious or unconscious, smuggling is provoked through the surveillance of those who fly most.
According to the company, the ATC rules are quite complicated and confused.
People often don’t know exactly what fluids they can carry and how much.
Therefore, it is not surprising that most of what ATB chooses is forbidden liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB could be considered prohibited to carry the book.
Liquids are allowed in internal flights, but not international.
Chapter EPA Pruitt refuses to delay the implementation of the emission reduction rules adopted in the Obama
The following day after the request of 15 states, the head of the Agency for Environment has cancelled its decision to delay the implementation of the rules adopted in the Obama to reduce the emissions of air pollution and the education of capacities.
Pruitt explained his decision by explaining that his agency was now more than in previous administrations to the needs of the environmental regulators of individual states.
He did not mention the case against his previous position filed in the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute was deployed on 1 October, to which States should ensure compliance with ozone standards in 2015.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone their respect for one year to give his agency more time to explore the plan and avoid "relevance to local decisions or obstacles to economic growth".
Pruitt, who was appointed President Trampo for his current position, was the prosecutor-General of the state of Oklahoma, long ago known as a consistent opponent of environmental improving standards.
Once he moved to Washington Pruitt, he blocked or delayed the introduction of standards against chemical or gas oil industry.
The unexpected exchange of course on Wednesday is a regular legal defeat taken by Pyit to return to previous standards.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA chapter exceeded its powers in order to delay the implementation of the rules adopted by Obama on oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce the emissions of methane.
In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Pruit suggested that, sharply changing the ozone standards, he had simply fulfilled the obligation of EPA to cooperate with states in the integrated timely implementation of new standards.
"In the previous administrations, EPA could often not be incurred in the deadlines, and then he waited for a complaint from activists and other persons and discussed the deadlines during the settlement of the case," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen claims against the EPA at his previous post.
"We do not believe in regulation through trials, and we are seriously dealing with the deadlines.
We also take seriously our statute and the authority that it gives us."
However, the statement of EPA states that Pruitt may at some point reuse its "supplies to delay and other law-based powers" in order to ensure that the standards of "cyjdfys" are in clear course and in all available information.
The Republicans in the Congress insisted on a broader review of ozone rules.
The draft law approved by the Chamber of Representatives last month seeks to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted.
The prosecutor-General of New York Eric Schneiderman, who was headed by the coalition of the states sued against the EPA this week, said that the group was intending to continue legal pressure.
"The change in the EPA course, after our trials, is an important victory for the fight for health and security of 6,7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly influenced by their cities," said Schneiderman.
New York's case joined California, Connecticut, Delaver, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rod Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as Colombia.
Ozone at the ground level occurs when ordinary pollutants from cars, electrical stations, oil processing and chemical factories and other sources enter the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting could cause serious breath problems in sensitive people, leading to thousands of early deaths a year.
The health protection and environmental defenders welcomed the unexpected change in Pruitt course.
"It's gross to think about how much pressure it took to achieve this completely logical step from a man who is assigned to protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of Tramp's administration and to protect those who pollute air and their special interests."
Congress IAAF extended the elimination of the Universal Federation of Light Athletics
The International Association of Legal Athletic Federations (IAF) voted for the extension of the elimination of the Universal Federation of Light Athletics (WFLA).
The Congress thus supported the IAF Council on the Restoration of the WFLA, which issued a report on Monday, in which it recommended that the removal be removaled.
166 people voted against 21 for the extension of the withdrawal.
The report of the IAF Council stated that BFLA had made substantial progress towards the achievement of the conditions set out by the Restoration Board, but these conditions have not been fully implemented.
Because of the disqualification of BFLA at the World Championship in London, Russian flags were forced to speak under the neutral flag.
The team included 19 people allowed to be IAAF primary.
In 2015, the IAF was disqualified indefinitely.
The report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound was then published, in which there were numerous violations of the WADA Regulation authorized by Russian officials and sportsmen.
For more details on the last report of the IAF Council, read in "Y" IAF extended sanctions on the VFLA.
Violent defeat
During the threeth round of the Fonbeth Personality of Russia, the new Moscow Chemic had a trip against the FC Caluga.
For more than 10 days ago, rivals played between themselves in a cup of Russia, but this time the game was completely different.
Chemic did not stand up to the opponent, but secondary relaxation at the end of the match led to an insulted naked and fiasco.
After the recent defeat of the colleagues at 0:3, many previously prophesied the easy victory of the masters.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the new Moscows have forced themselves to count and act from the defence, but from the position of force.
In one time, the collužans built more and had the advantage of having a ball.
Another very quality match had been held by Alexi Syrotine, who several times reflected the dangerous strikes and gave confidence to his partners.
Unfortunately, in the Chemic attack, there was no effort and happiness to put the Colugi defense in the trap and to hit the first goal on the way out.
After the break, the game began to run at the meeting courses.
The New Moscows played more actively in the attack.
The alarming calls for our team were defence errors that allowed the colleagues to create a number of sharp moments.
10 minutes before the end of the meeting, Chemic took over the territorial advantage and had had several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the colleagues played its role -- they were more literally and coldly ending, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After the dangerous attack, Chemic transferred the ball to the corner, which was transferred to the gate without resistance.
The naked author was Yuri Dubrovin.
In the reporting meeting, Chemic has demonstrated a good game, but he has suffered an injurious defeat.
Our team is waiting for another trip to Moscow on 11 August at 19:00 at the Torpedo stadium named Edward Arrowsov, the New Moscowers will fight the Favorite of the Center of the Ararat Group, which is represented by Roman Pavluchenko, Marat Ismailov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come back to Chemistry!
Place and time for the meeting of the new Moscows - 6:30 a.m. next to Magnolia shop (Eastern, d.2, corp.
Chemic composition: Syrotin, Manochin (k), Romašenko, Shajunov, Homutov, Gogia (Oreškin), Dudaity, Rižov, Holidays, Belian (Adoevcev), Andreichenko (Lygin)

According to telephone decryptions, Tramp pressed Mexico on the payment of the wall on the border
The Washington Post issued the decryption of phone talks between US President Donald Tramp and Mexico and Australia leaders.
On 27 January, during a telephone conversation with President of Mexico Enrique Peny Netay Tramp insisted that he would stop publicly claiming that he would not pay for the planned wall on the border.
The President of the United States convicted him for speaking publicly against the wall, and, according to the information provided, he said: “You can't say it to the press.”
Tramp began its pre-electoral campaign with the promise to build a wall along the Southern border and swore that Mexico would pay for the project.
His first phone conversation with Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Ternbull, was also decrypted.
Tramp told Ternbull that the agreement that the United States should accept refugees to Australia ' s ' funny', ' disgusting' and ' dumb', and insisted that due to the agreement concluded by Obama's administration, it would look like an idiot because he was intending to stop the displacement of refugees in the United States.
Tramp concluded the conversation, saying to Ternbull, "that was the most unpleasant conversation all day."
Tourist bodies in Abkhazia have sent a plane from Sochi to Petersburg
A plane belonging to the Russian airline, on which the bodies of the dead in Abkhazia of Russians are located, flew out at 20:15 a.m. from Sochi to St. Petersburg, TASS.
At the end of the tracking point, the board will meet the ritual agency and the city's officials, and the reporters told the Deputy Minister for Court and Tourism of Abkhazia Astamir Ahba.
Previously, the ICS representatives of the Republic stated that all costs related to the delivery of bodies back to Russia had taken over the Abkhazian Government.
Furthermore, the official Suhum intends to pay compensation to the families of the victims of 500,000 rubles.
According to Ahba, Abkhazia ' s leadership was willing to pay the victims of the tourism explosions and residence in the Republic, but the relatives sent only the confidence in the right to local authorities to act in accordance with the order set.
At approximately 16:20 in Moscow time, two explosions were detonated in the village of the Primorian Goodautic Area on the arms of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic, and there were explosives in the large-caliber arms and other ammunition.
As a result, there was a combustion of a warehouse that caused uncontrolled explosions of different modification missiles.
As a result, two citizens of Russia - Elena Poljakov died in 1970 and Elena Timothyv, born in 1962, who were at rest near the serum source.
64 persons, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 Abkhazian citizens, were delivered to the Republican medical institutions with different gravity injuries.
At present, there are seven people left in the stationary, others are out.
Study of the Russian impact on American elections will take place by a large jury
The Russian Prosecutor, Robert Muller, convened a great jury in Washington, which would study the impact of Russia on the elections of the President of the United States in 2016, reports the Wall Street Journal and the Reuters Agency.
The great jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The collected materials will be explored by the Special Prosecutor and would decide whether they were sufficient to charge.
The summon of a great jury gives Muller additional powers to collect testimony.
One of the investigations of the jury's colleague, which began several weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son, then a candidate to the Presidents of Donald Tramp with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselica.
To verify the details of the meeting held in June 2016, Mueller also promised.
They're already studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Tramp, the younger, expanded the state of his lawyers.
The Junior Tramp previously told him that he was waiting for a compromise to the headquarters of the candidate from the Demparty, Hillary Clinton, but no disclosure documents were presented, and the event was adopted.
At the beginning of August, a number of media reported that Trampa Junior's meeting statement was literally directed by the Senior Trampo.
In the White House, it was cleared that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, as any father would do.
Deputy Mayor Penza has been detained at the workplace
The Vice-Chairman of Penza Irina Shirshina was detained 48 hours on the task of the Investigative Committee at its workplace, reports RIA News.
The official communications from the law enforcement authorities have not yet been received, but the SSC press service assured them that they will soon follow.
There's no comment in the Mayor of Penza yet.
Irina Shirshina is one of the five Vice-Chairpersons of Penza.
It has been in the city-building and land relations, taking this post since April 2015.
She has been a long-term manager of the State Department of Pensen Inspection.
Irina Shirshina raised three minor children, noting that the next time she became a mother a year ago, she resigned and returned to work.
Of course, there's no cosmodroma or carriers in Mexico.
However, a space agency was established in 2010 and the desire to develop its own space programme.
And the installation of Yuri Gagarin's bust is the reverence of the first man who was in space.
In contrast to the monuments of the Soviet period in some countries, the Memorials of Gagarin, on the contrary, are “shopping on the planet”.
In 2012, the monument was established in the US Houston near the former headquarters of NASA.
In London, the monument in the territory of the Royal Observatory was established at the honor of the 50th year of the first flight to space.
There is a monument of Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfut, where our cosmonaut was attended in 1963.
The monument in Karlova Varaya (Cheechia) emerged in 1992 through public protests and was transferred from the city center to a square before the local airport.
In the 70 ’ s, Gagarin in Riga, the monument of Yurius Gagarins appeared.
This is the name and name of the first astronaut in Latvia, and it looks like he's 70 years old.
Morse Ford's murder: Activists will lose the Lynch courts on the scene to call for justice.
Ford Mercury traveled to the village of Monroe in Georgia in 1948 and screamed to a small bridge of Morse Ford.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns stopped her way.
The medium-year-old man in a costume in a thin strip - took a cigarette and looked through the windscreen.
The seats inside were trembling from fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" said a man.
Get him out of the car!
The pronsible screams broke the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this horrible scene, which took place on 22 July, was just an inscription.
But when Roger's neck was thrown on the neck, almost all the spectacles really kept their breath.
Since 2005, activists have returned to Morse Ford Bridge to rehearse the night when in 1946 the puppies linched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malkom and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted for these murders.
"It is impressive that in all these years, no person has been arrested -- although we see them next to us; even though we know who they are," said Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the construction.
"It's a spot in our history and it's a stone on our souls."
The 71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Georgian Congress, who has been fighting for human rights all his life.
For him, the spectacle is a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder to Monroe people that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want investigations, we want completion, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must obtain justice," he said.
"We can't go to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of one of the victims of lending at Morse Ford on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBI, more than 50 people in Monroe and the neighbouring counties were suspected of the participation in linching.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects remained free for decades, human rights defenders say that the city had always been well aware of two linked motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court's decision for the first time allowed black citizens to vote for the primaries that had to take place in that summer.
Approximately during the same elections, according to the FBI, the black consumer, Roger Malcolm, hit the knife of Barnett Hester, the white landlord, apparently because of the woman.
Brooks said that Hester was sleeping with Malcolm Dorothy’s wife, and that the child she was supposed to be born was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landlord, paid $600 to release Malcolm from prison.
He went to jail with Dorothy and their cousins, May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove out of jail and approached Morse Ford Bridge, the lending crowd surrounded the car.
"It is clear that he organized and commanded the murders of Harrison," the conclusion is made in one of the reports of the FBI.
"And it is obvious that there was an agreement between the law enforcement authorities of the State and the city, which did not only participate in murders but also destroyed evidence and hid witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt on electoral rights," he said.
"They were killed to send a signal to the black people in the city: if you register and vote, it will be the same with you."
For almost ten years, Cassandra Greene has been running the annual spectacle that plays the lending at Morse Ford Bridge.
Its spectacle is supervised, he captures the audience and tells him about the deep racism that many wished to believe was no longer in America.
It's hard to see and harder to turn away, but Green thinks that it's the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own uglyness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear what I've been through."
The spectacles of this year began in June, and in the first day, almost 30 white actors -- dozens, the rest of the black -- gathered in the room and listened to the play review over the years.
Wade Marbo was a director with Green.
He played the role of the chief member of the clan for several years, but he said that the role has not become easier.
"I feel like I'm screwed up because it's not the person I am," said Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to come back at that time."
In the premises of the actress, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The spectal begins with that Malcolm is angry that Hester sleeps with his wife, Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nigger, get out of my house!"
Screams Rascon in reply.
It's a stroke.
And at the same time, all (at least all black actors) are hit by hohot.
Green laughs louder than anyone.
"What's wrong," asks Ascona.
He's worried and embarrassed.
Am I overwhelming?
"No," said Green through laughing.
"I just don't think the whites said "nogger."
"Yes," one of the black performers laughs.
"You've got to make a firm 'r'."
Also, energy changes in the room: discomfort changes the sense of society.
Everyone has to do everything right, not only for the play, but for the memory of four dead people.
The scene begins at first.
This time Rascon says the word "n", it becomes clear and sharp.
No man laughs.
The Spectacle ends cruelly and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in a sad black clothing stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billy Holiday's sad song "Strage Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted through the word.
In hundreds of yards from her, half a hundred viewers wipe the tears and sweats out of their eyes.
Among the viewers is almost equal to the number of black and white.
One couple arrived from Taka, New York, to see the show; many live around.
They all endured the severe spirit of Georgia almost eight hours while Brooks led them to a pilgrimage to Malcolm and Dorsey's grave.
So far the murders remained only history, but now that they are standing in the same place where people were linched, their ghosts seem to be in the air right now.
When the last note of the song is silent, Green invites people to come closer and look at the bodies.
Children slope to their heads, touch the paint of blood, and the immovable bodies, and whisper.
"They are not really dead," a little boy whispers, like to remind himself of it.
In a few minutes, Green thanks the viewers, and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw the ropes out of their neck and tears out.
Bradshaw's hugging Marbo, a man in a suit who played the chief doll clone.
Nick Rascon embraces two other actors, and suddenly, crying, falls in their arms: the emotional load of the spectacle finally struck into it.
"All right," one of the women whispers.
"We know your heart is good.
You had reasons for that."
Later, the audiences are sitting for dinner with the actress.
At the same table, a white couple in Atlanta deliberately discussed the spectacle with the black couple they just met.
Denise Daplinsky barely searches for words to describe how she feels after the spectacle.
"It's hard to listen to these horrible, horrible words and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"Then I think the linens are still happening," she adds, "only now it's called police shooting."
In another corner, the rooms were generally accompanied by Tyron Brooks, who remembered the work of a human rights defender.
He said that he had already planned the presentation next year.
"The arrangement encouragings us, because it does not only describe the fear of what we have experienced but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it might happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are condemned to repeat it."
The Court has punished the Naval for violations in the "agitation sabbath"
The Simonian Court of Moscow punished Alexei Naval by 300,000 rubles for the violation of the order of the organization of the myth.
The oppositionist was recognized guilty of committing administrative offences provided for in paragraph 8.2. of the RF CoAP “Return infringement of the order of the organization of myth”.
Previously, Judge of the Simon Court of Moscow, Hysir Musacaev, had finished its consideration of the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of the oppositionary headquarters of Alexei Naval, who was responsible for the same article as Naval.
Wolf was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 rubles.
In that amount, Judge Musacayev evaluated the dissemination of postcards at the “agitation Sabbath”, which Naval's parties held in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
After seeing the agitmaterials following the Saturday's participants, the police believed that the organizers of the activities had deliberately hid its real substantive public action (for which the capital authorities had to be authorized priorly).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers, Ivan Ždanov and Alexander Pomazouev, requested the cessation of administrative production in connection with the absence of the offence and indicated that the police allowed certain failures in the drafting of the protocol.
Volkov was not detained at the most “agitative Sabbath”, but he had received a agenda in which he was obliged to appear at the police office to tell the event carried out in his active participation.
The same agendas were received by Naval and another opponent Nikolai Laskin.
In Mordoba, the shooter of the bride and three wedding guests were arrested
The Court in Mordavia arrested a local resident who shot four people at the wedding, including the bride.
This was reported in the Republican Office of the Investigative Committee.
The incident occurred at night on 29 July.
During the fight, a 42-year-old resident of Saranska shot several times in visits of events coming to the rural pond to bath.

Attack to the convoy in Cabul: Nato's soldiers died as a result of the explosion of the mortal
According to official sources, the terrorist mortal attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Cabula, killed one soldier of NATO and wounded several others.
Five soldiers and translator were wounded, as said in the NATO report.
According to uncertain data from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the city of Karabah.
This explosion is the last of the affected Afghanistan in this month of bloodshed: more than 30 people died on Tuesday as a result of the explosion in the sword in Gerat.
On Monday, the mortal terrorist killed two people near Iraq's embassy in Cabul.
According to NATO, the explosion occurred on Thursday night, when the joint convoy with the army of Afghanistan was attacked by the “transferred man of a self-explosive device”.
According to the report, all wounded are stable and are treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents report that the increasing power of Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IG) in Karabaha is the main source of concern for NATO forces located near Bagram.
UN reported that at the first half of 2017, at least 1662 civilian victims in Afghanistan and about 20 per cent of them were in the capital.
At the end of July, the explosion of a mortal terrorist on the car was caused by at least 30 people in the area of Shia in Kabul.
Taliban stated that they had attacked.
On 31 May, more than 150 people died in the centre of the city — the most serious number of human victims in the country since in 2001, the United States troops had removed Taliban from power.
Violence stresses the unreliable situation in Afghanistan, while the US President Donald Tramp appreciates the need to increase the number of US military forces assisting troops and police in the country.
According to correspondents, the terrorists in Kabul, which have been in recent weeks, have also created a crisis of public confidence to the Government, its conduct line, and especially to the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The Environmental Protection Agency, after judicial proceedings, cancels its decision to delay the adoption of air pollution law
The American Environmental Protection Agency has cancelled its decision to delay the adoption of the Obama ' s law, according to which States should limit air pollution emissions within the day after 15 states were supplied to the agency due to this step.
On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement so-called ozone measures 2015, emphasizing that this step shows the willingness of the Agency to cooperate with States.
"We believe in dialogue with our partners in states and respondability to them," said the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency, in the statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to delay the measurements of ozone in which the existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it should be reduced to comply with the strict air cleanness standards for one year until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a 15-State group, mostly democratic, and the Federal County of Colombia filed a complaint, which claimed that this intention was illegal.
The Administration of President Donald Tramp is trying to reverse the broad scope of environmental regulations introduced by the previous President Barack Obama, within a broader programme targeted, according to Tramp, to a brilliant economic growth.
However, actions in this direction have caused a resistance by democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the potential impact of large emissions on the health of the population.
The Environmental Protection Agency website states that the use of ozone air breathing can “intensify the function of light and increase respiratory symptoms”, for example, asthma.
The European Business Association has spoken against new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association expressed disagreement with US economic sanctions against RF.
The AEB believes that such measures may lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
The AEB statement states that business is one of the important linkages between countries and people, so it cannot be limited to the principles of free trade.
The European Business combines more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls upon the Heads of States and Governments of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of behaviour that would enable business to be separated from policies and to find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and consent.

They said he lived a "great life by success in the movies, theatre and television in 70 years of his career."
Hardy was born in 1925 in the Cheltnam city of England.
In 1959, at the Royal Shakespeare theatre, he played with Lawrence Olivier at the Tragedia on Corriolane.

Mikes Garcia and Vasilius Lomachenko are meeting for the first time, discussing the possibility of a decisive fight
Vasilius Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are allegedly moving to take the most exciting box match in the weight of up to 147 pounds in the near future, first met on Thursday.
They took separate rooms in the office rooms of the ESPN channel in L.A., while Garcia, an invincible champion in the lightweight of the World Box Council, did not go through the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the champion of the World Boxing Organization in the second half-weight.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over the former world champion in four weight categories, Erian Bronner on Saturday at the Showtime channel, both boxers are in five of the best boxers outside the weighing categories.
Garcia stretched his right hand and said, “How are things, champion?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko protects his belt in the fight against Miguel Marriagoy on Saturday at seven o'clock at the ESPN channel.
When the boxers posted for the photo, the manager Lomachenko Egis Klimas noticed that the potential decisive fight between them would be at the same time.
“I was in a semi-level weight,” Garcia recalled.
“I got up to the category for Bronner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not so big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to go down to the midlight.
And he's got to get up to half-light [to 135 pounds], and then we're going to fight.
That's what cheerleaders want.
Let's do this to them."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Box needs this fight."
Climas asked whether the fight should be translated through the PPV service, as part of the strategy that he was adhering to, so that Lomachenko had carried out his debate in weight 135 later this year, to appoint a meeting with Garcia for the next summer (37-0.30 nokautes), which also was interested in combating the winner of the battle between Horhe Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the title of the world champion in the light of the Arena of Forum on 23 September.
"The fight may be on the PPV, because all the cheerers asked for it," Garcia said later, expressing the willingness to fight on the channel that would offer the best financial conditions.
"We are the main names.
No other names will cause such interest.
As soon as they are ready...”
Garcia said that Lomachenko considers a “incredible boxer” and may visit his Saturday battle.
But Lomachenko didn't immediately suck Garcia with commendations and said that he thought the champion in three weights of Riverside was "a very slow, sorry, Mikey... you were asking for a knockout."
Garcia said he was focusing on showing the power of a hit and then a box.
They both said that they felt the tension of their own fighting.
"This fight must take place.
No other struggle causes so much interest or conversation.
I am more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for one of the top boxers, and there he is, Mikey.
This will be a great fight."

Putin ordered the prosecutor to check Baykal.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, ordered the General Prosecutor of RF to verify the Bajkal territory for the facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities.

Furthermore, the Russian leader asked for measures if the facts of violations were identified.
New results of asylum-seekers tests were published in Sweden
The recent asylum seekers tests in Sweden, which were subjected to a new health assessment method, show that more than 80 per cent of the tested were evaluated as persons older than 18 years old, but not all trusted the precisions of these results.
The Swedish National Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
They were developed to make the age assessment more precise in the asylum process, after the Swedish Migrationverket Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) criticised that it was unable to determine the current age of some refugees claiming that they were minors.
At this point, Migrationsverket has sent 6 880 cases for testing, and the Judicial Medical Agency has now published 2 481 tests for the period between the middle of March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of the tested were evaluated as 18 years or older, and for another 25 cases, the Judicial Medical Agency evaluated that the tested “probably 18 years older or older”.
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was “likely less than 18”.
The tests are conducted only in cases where human ages cause doubts.
According to Johann Geransson from the Judicial Medical Agency, the results were in the past months.
"We do not observe a great difference with statistics in the past months, numbers are quite relevant," he said to the Local portal.
The high proportion of cases under which people had been evaluated as a reaching 18 years does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, “the age of 18 or more years.”
However, after reviewing 581 published results, the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper found that in 243 cases, a person openly stated that 18 was fulfilled this year.
The medical assessment method of the age to make the wise teeth and topics and to analyse them to dentists and rentgenologists has also criticised in some instances.
One of the skeptics is the endocrineologist from the Caroline Institute Claude Marcus, whose work is a evaluation of the biological maturity of people to determine whether they have been sexually mature before or later.
"I had reasons to think about it, and I don't think I should use the way the measurements are being used right now.
The biological age is thus very incorrect.
If we cannot determine it with confidence, we should not pretend to do what we can," he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Geranssen, from the Judicial Medical Agency, expressed the exactness of the tests: “In general, the risk of taking a child as a adult is wrong.
We face the greatest risk when a person is 18, in that case he is about 10 per cent."
I'm going to think if you're going to be president.
During a working trip to Buryathia, Vladimir Putin said he was willing to consider whether he would vote for the President of Russia at the elections in 2018, transmitted the Interfax.
This statement was a response to the request of the inhabitants of the village of the Burath region.
During the video conference on the elimination of the fire in Burettia and the Irkut area, the interviewer called to Putin, saying, "Vladimir Vladimirovic, we have a request for you: when the next president's elections, we all ask you to vote again at this post."
"Okay, I'll think, thank you," said the President.
On 28 July, the press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitri Peskov, commented on some media statements that the pre-electoral headquarters of Vladimir Putina would be headed by the leader of the RF administration, Anton Wyno.
The sandow has referred to these assumptions as "none based, hypothetical reasons."
"No headquarters are there, until the headquarters are established far, until the election campaign is far away," said Peskov.
" Until this is on the agenda," said Peskov.
Governor of Western Virginia stated that he was moving into another party
Governor of the West Virginia, the representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Justis, announced on Thursday during the meeting with the President Tramp, which is moving into another party.
“Do you like it or not, but democrats have gone away from me” said Governor Justice.
"I tell you today with many prayers and many thoughts... today I tell you, the people of West Virginia, that I cannot be more helpful to you by remaining Governor-Democrat."
The myth exploded by applause.
“So tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republican”, added Justice.
"As a coach, I would tell you that it's time to play differently."
Rather, Tramp promised that an important statement would be made at the west Virginia meeting.
Tramp won 42 per cent in West Virginia, and Justice did not support a candidate from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which, according to Forbes, was the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he belongs to coal mines in five states, since he inherited coal business from his father.
His condition is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the National Committee of the Republican Party made a statement on Thursday night that “The transfer of Governor Justice to another party is another strike on the Democratic Party, which rather impedes the work to make our country large again”.
“In view of only 15 governors and the control of the minimum number of state legislative authorities in history, the statement of Governor Justice is only another refusal from the party that does not have leaders from the top of the bottom and is unable to find a positive, uniting communication,” said the representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Ronna McDaniel, in the statement of CBS News.
Mr. Beautiful found a house thanks to the social networks
The Pittsboro (North Carolina, United States) built a cat named Mr. Beautiful weight more than 14 kilograms after he became famous by the Internet.
This is what Mashable reports.
At the end of June, a picture of a cat was published in the fetish account in Facebook, requesting to find his owner, because he was obviously feeding him before.
In comments, the users noted that the expression of a animal's mortar could be a new memo.
The publication has obtained more than 3.2 thousand liquors and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens have expressed the desire to hire Mr. Beautiful.
As a result, it was given to Angela Frazee (Angel Frazee), who promised to take care of her weight.
In an interview with the WNCN radio, the American woman said that she had already had this experience: she took a cat weighing around 10 pounds home, and now it weighs about five.
In July, the Reddit users focused on a cat from Australia with unusual long paws.
The post with an animal photograph collected over 68,000 reviews.
The commentators noted that it could make a career in a model business.
Kou commended Russia ' s " sincere apology" for the doping scandal
On Thursday, the international expert for Light Athletic Sebastian Cou commended what he called sincere apologies by Russia for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the right time to allow the country to participate in sports competitions.
The Russian Federation Representative of Light Athletics, Dmitrij Puttin, reported at the International Association of Legal Athletic Federations, which had before the World Championship on Light Athletic, that the disposal of his country from sports competition was fair and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He apologised “all sportsmen who had stolen gold and silver medals in the competition”.
Despite its comments, the International Association of Legal Athletic Federations voted for the removal of the withdrawal set out in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on the found evidence of the use of the doping funded by the State.
"I felt that today's response, today's report was very sincere," President of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations, Kou, told the reporters.
“All Councils and Congress were pleased... that the Russian Federation itself recognized that she had experienced extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the Federation.”
Kou said that he also “rejoiced ” that Russia agreed with the criteria of its recovery.
"I believe that this was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but the Congress supports the recommendations of a special commission that is not time to restore Russia in rights," Kou said.
"In the next few months, we have to do everything we can to solve this situation.
Our leading principle was our desire to separate pure sportsmen from the intimate system," he added.
Nine Russian sportsmen, respective to the strict criteria of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations, will participate under the neutral flag in the world champion of light athletic, which will begin on Friday in London.
The Chief of the Special Commission of the International Association of Legal Athletic Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements were still to be met to restore Russia.
As he reported to the reporters in London after the report made at the Council of the International Association of Legal Athletic Federations, drug testing is still not carried out in sufficient volume, and removed coaches are still doing their work quietly.

The Boursini patrol ship entered Libya's territorial waters to stop the illicit migrants with the IMS.
The decision to start the operation was adopted by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed it with the internationally recognised Government of Libya, which, however, does not control most of the country's territory.
The opposition to the office and the Libyan parliament based in Tobruk accused Italy of the violation of the sovereignty of Libya.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarchal Haftar, gave his subordinated order to counter Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they claimed that they did not believe these threats and intend to send another military vessel to the Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the European Libyan office, Faiz Sarajah.
The authorities of Italy went to the establishment of a marine mission to combat illicit migration after statistics on the number of illegals in Libya were published in July: 95,000 people from the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that migrants ' receipt resources were exhausted.

Olga Earthak and Olesia Pouch, specialized in a short-distance race, are excluded from the composition of Ukraine for the world-2017 championship in London.
This is reported on the Federation of Light Athletics (FLAU).
Such a decision was taken by the General Organization in connection with the incitement of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations (IAAF) of disciplinary products against teenagers.
The Ukrainian delegation was also excluded from the Coach of Earthik Sergei Basenko.
As Sportarena reports, IAAF suspects a sportsman of the use of the doping.

How the financial rules of football will affect Neimar's movement to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unlimited waste from European football clubs will not interfere with the world record of Neimar's transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Pari Saint Germen.
Any consequences can be followed by the chain, for the Pari Saint German of the UEFA, the Governing Body of the European Football, in whose power to prohibit the teams of participation in the prestigious championship League.
The financial rules of the Fair Play introduced by the UEFA in 2011 should show that the AGF would eventually have to show that the transfer of Naimar was financed without large losses.
Barcelone paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) only to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Neimar would receive a complaint that would reach tens of millions a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neimar's transfer to France.
The PSG can certainly be delighted to hire Neimar and add it to the galaxy of other stars, if it takes into account the funding of the team by the rich energy of the managing family of Qatar.
The clubs have the right to spend large amounts on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them with legal income sources to reach the threshold of rental in their football business.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini after its election by the President of the UEFA in 2007.
Former French footballist believed that clubs that entailed in huge debts in their pursuit of success, in fact cheated and risked destruction in case banks or owners cease funding.
In 2011, the FFP stopped focusing on the debts of the clubs and instead switched to track their losses.
As a result of this change in business model, which Roman Abramovic first used in Chelsea in 2003, was to buy a club with good capacity and then to spend seriously to improve the team and create a world brand, it became a difficult plan.
During this three-year evaluation period, 2018, the clubs may lose 30 million euros.
And despite the embarrassment of Platini from the presidential post in 2015, his successor in UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to resist excessive waste.
"Of course, the FFP is alive, and we will continue to reinforce the rules," said the Associated Press Agency, Andrea Traverso, who controlled the FFP in UEFA last week.
At the same time, though the PPG will pay for the purchase of the Neimar contract, it can allocate this amount for accountability at the time of its contract.
Neimar signed a five-year treaty, so the transfer value could be shown annually as an amount of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years.
During the first wave of the FFP sanctions in 2014, the hardest sanctions were applied to the Abu-Dabi.
The PPG was fixed in 60 million euros (for this course it was 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros and was recommended to limit the composition of its team in the League of Championships during the period 2014-1015 by 21 players instead of normal 25.
The UEFA tracks clubs that can try to oversufficient its financial inspections by deploying its income for companies associated with the owners of the club.
At least the Katarian company could offer a PSJ, but if the amount of funding was considered to be higher than the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered legal income.
That's what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the funding of the CAP by the Qatar Tourism Office was broken down.
It was reported that a part of Neimar ' s earnings in the PPG could have been made as payments by the organizational committee of the World Championship 2022 in Qatar.
However, PSJ and Qatar-2022 deny that Neimar would become a champion of the world, and that manoeuvre could easily be identified by UEFA inspectors.
The previous sanctions imposed on the CAP mean that UEFA would follow more carefully any attempts to overcome the rules.
As reported on Thursday, UEFA had not held preliminary discussions with the PPG on the transfer of Neimar.
They have communicated with the Associated Press Agency under the conditions of anonymity, since they are not authorized to discuss the situation of the PSA.
According to the latest issued reporting, more than 10 million euros were earned in EUR 542,4 million in 2015-1016.
The accountability for the last financial year has not yet been published.
The PSJ expects Neimar's arrival to be a favourable soil for sponsorship transactions, selling attributes and shirts with the team's logo.
The club suggests that traffic will increase by at least 30 per cent as a result of a new player's rent.
It is undoubted that one of the best football players left, the Spanish League tried to stop Neimar's transfer, claiming that the PSJ would violate the Finance Fair Play.
“This is an obvious case of the “financial doping”, with the club and the State”, said President of the Spanish newspaper La League Javier Tebas, considering that the final owner of the PSJ is Qatar.
Arsenala Trainer Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to the American Sport Magnate, shares the La League's doubts about the financing of the club by the State.
"It is all the consequences of a declined participation, and it has completely changed football landscape in the past 15 years," said Hungarian on Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It is very difficult to observe the financial fair play because the country may have many ways and many reasons to be presented by such a serious player.
The order and place of swearment shall be defined by the President
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear to the faithfulness of the RF, the President will determine such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law was drafted by the Committee of the Legislative and Hospitality Committee.
A week ago, the deputies planned to directly determine the order of the vow in the law.
The solemn oath will be released by children up to 18 years and incapable, from the advanced text of amendments to the RF Citizenship Act (here are the Notifications), which the Committee will consider before its second reading at its meeting on 11 July.
The idea of the introduction of a oath at the entry into RF nationality instead of formal signature of documents, the President Vladimir Putin supported the meeting with the Speaker of the State of Vicheslav Volodin on 6 June.
The deputies made this idea amendment to the second reading of a bill, providing annulment of the decision on the issue of citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted for a number of terrorist or extremistic crimes: for public calls for terrorism or public excuse in the media or on the Internet (No. 2 p. 205.2) and for theft of aircraft, train or water transport, but only if this act is related to terrorism (No. 4 p. 211 of the UKF).
According to the draft law, its logic was such: making documents for citizenship, a person is signed under the promise to comply with the Russian legislation -- put in the way of extremism, he violated the promise.
The Law on April was introduced to the Government by the leaders of the Huma fractions of Vladimir Vasilev (United Russia), Gennadi Zuganov (CPRF), Vladimir Žirinovski (LDPR), Sergei Mironov (Just Russia) and the speaker of GD Vecheslav Volodin.
On May 19, the deputies accepted it in their first reading.
Last week, the GD Committee on Hospital and Legislation approved the text of the draft law for second reading, but now it has been reconstructed.
It now states that the oath order will establish the President of RF.
The parliamentarians had before been going to describe the procedure directly in the RF Citizenship Act, pointing out that the ceremony should be held in the celebration in front of the State Herb and the Russian flag in the presence of the representative of the IMD.
However, it was not clear from the text of the draft law where such an event should take place -- a list of places where the gerb could be placed, regulated by the Federal Constitutional Law.
They include courts, offices of the heads of the authorities of the State of the State, municipal entities, judges, prosecutors, heads of the federal authorities of the executive authority, etc.
Probably, it could be the Zaxas.
To make a solemn oath that will receive RF citizenship after the officials check their documents.
However, the Russian passport will only be received after the oath comes from a complete text.
A week ago, the draft said that the oath should be before the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia will be sworn from 18 years, not from 14.
There was a rule where the vows will be released by the unable or limited defective, as well as those who cannot make, read or sign the text of the oath.
Furthermore, the President of the RF has the right to free from this procedure and “other persons”,
The updated law also provides a special order for adoption in the Russian citizens of Ukraine, which are considered the hosts of Russian.
They will have to formally refuse Ukrainian nationality by submiting an appropriate statement to the authorized authority of Ukraine.
A notary of the statement will be made available to the Russian officials.
The refusal of foreign nationality, as is now, will not be necessary if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible "with the reasons that are independent".
An amendment to the law was proposed by the Group of Deputies, including the first vice-speaker of the D.D. Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Poklonska, Paul Krašennikov and Irat Farrahov (all of the only Russia).
I think many of you know that it's not real, it's impossible.
Accordingly, many await their destiny on RF citizenship, explained the head of the Thinking Committee on Hospital and Legislation, Paul Krasheninikov (ER).
Furthermore, the text clarifyed that restrictions on certain posts for foreigners would not be circulated to those who had writtenly denied " other" citizenship and passed the previous passport to the IMD of Russia, but "will no longer be considered as a citizen of another country.
Foreigners are now forbidden to take offices at municipal service, to work for facilities and organizations whose activities are related to the security of Russia.
Also, a person with double nationality or a kind of residentiality of another country cannot be a deputy of the State or member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force since 1 September 2017, and the necessary sublegitimate acts should be prepared.
Nostalgia becomes a nurse in "American Hot Summer" and "Detective Company"
The current iteration of history reminds at the same time of the glorious days of characters in the 80s; about the age of the 90s (approximately when the excellent Master David Wayne and Michael Shawlter made a comedy of "State" for MTV); and itself, it is about 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller and Paul Radd, moved to more serious things.
As the fact of the culture, it is at the same time the elevation of our age with its constant Facebook reminders.
But as franchise, it seems to be an anachronism.
"The first day of camp" was amazingly good, not only because of the absurd humor (including the original story of the speaking bank of vegetables that H. John Benjamin had heard).
The result doubles the main joke: mid-year-old actors play sexually concerned children who have just reached their age; it makes it impossible to return to a part of a joke.
"Ten years later," where adults have already played adults, have less deep emotional roots, and its parodiality is more irregular and includes reefs from the Stalker films of the 1990s, such as "Rukes scrambled".
In one episode, the character gets Apple Powerbook, four-wheel rollers, and a lot of other things from 1991.
Many historical moves are the same.
The charity of Coop, now a writer, has not yet achieved mutuality from Cathy (Margarit Moreo).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not quit virginity yet.
And there's a crazy and evil plot in which Ronald Reagan (i.e. Shawolter) is now incited by George Bush Senior (experienced parodya in the fulfillment of Michael John Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is derogation from it.
Especially fun to see a young Radd, who sings Matt Dillon's song from the "Solitch", whose character, the former big man, Andy looked like an old man now.
This franchise could succeed in accidental madness in the spirit of the recursive serial Seven Up, until it came to the fact that it would be the logical end of the " Hot American summer: 20 years later", where in the last stage, the entire company would go to the movie at the "Hot American Summer" premier.
The Detective Facility in Amazon addresses another type of nostalgia: the remembrance of cold war from the Americans, the Explosive Blondess, or even the Flash with its images of the East and West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gateswood and Alessandro Tanako with director Reese Thomas, is a television: Romanian police drama in the 1980s about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and Marxist Lenin.
The main roles of Gregor's life and Joseph's idealist -- are Florin Piersic Junior and Corneliu Street, and their dialogues in the English Chenning Tatum (he's an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levit.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are several visual jokes (police spend time watching a chess game like Americans could watch football).
The team of famous voices -- Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Seviña -- allows you to play a "auth the voice".
But the Detective Comrade is like that of the propaganda drama - there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask, which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are delayed and funny are not often.
If it had been made shorter, "Detective Comrade" could have better dealt with his satira in the spirit of agitprope; for example, every time Gregor and Josef come to the US Embassy, there are two fat men sitting in the hamburgers.
The imaginary Communist viewer says that the Western culture is capable of making a pipe from anything.
The artificial Romanian film authors are not so wrong: we do so even with our recent history, and also with them.
The soccer fund for the Supercub of Russia on football between Spartacus and Locomotive will be about 30 million rubs.
The President of the Russian Football League Prime Minister (RFPL) Sergej Predkin reported this on the press conference.
According to the RFPL chapter, the winner will receive 70 per cent of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that tickets for the match were almost not left until now.
The Spartak-Locomotive match will take place on Friday, 14 July, at 21:30.
As TASS notes, Spartacus is an active RF champion, and Locomotive is the owner of the Cube of the country.
Two young Uthimians cleaned the furniture price of 200,000 rubles
A 37-year-old man who had a furniture company has been contacted by the police.
The man stated that the robbery of expensive instruments had caused serious damage to his production.
The stealing of the thief was a total of almost 200 000 rubles: two quarrels, perforator, hydraulic, swan.
The guards of order approached the search for criminals and soon departed from the residents of the Baskortostan District, friends of 23 and 24 years.
According to the press service of the IMD republic, the companions broke into the territory of the enterprise, broke the front door and delivered tools.
Right after that, the boys sold stolen techniques the first crashed car service.
Theft has already been raised, and the law guards have been able to return to the legitimate owner only a part of the kidnapped instruments.
State Department commented on the words of Medvedev on the relationships of RF and the United States
The United States and Russia should be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of the State of Heather Nauert, in response to the words of the Prime Minister of RF Dmitri Medvedev on the relations of two States.
Previously, the head of the Russian Government stated that, taking new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and announced a full trade war.
In commenting on these words, Nauert recognized that the Russian-American relations were at a " low level", but noted that it was necessary to seek "districtions for interaction".
"Look at the reconciliation in Southwest of Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
“It is an example of good cooperation in the United States and Russia”, states the RIA News diplomat.
However, the representative of the Foreign Political Office refused to comment on the Russian Prime Minister ' s statement that sanctions were equal to trade war.
The new sanctions Act on Russia, Iran and UNDR President of the United States Donald Tramp signed in the past environment.
He recognized, however, that the document was unsuccessful and contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior raised roses from ametics and Quartz
The jewelry unit of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - completed the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
They have five new rings and three cocktails on the bars.
In Rose Dior Pré Catelan, two new ringes and rings of ametics, pink quartz and diamonds carried out in the gliptic technique (manual cut by stone) and respect and devoted to the 70th year of the house.
Chief Dior Joaillerie Victuar de Castellan was inspired by the roses growing in the Granville modeler Christian Dior and Paris Gardens Bagatel and Pre-Catelan.
Tramp found a deterioration of relations with Russia
The President of the United States, Donald Tramp, expressed a sharp criticism to members of the Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have resulted in a deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relationship with Russia is not at a low and dangerous level.
"You can thank the Congress, the same people can't even give us medicine," wrote the president at Twitter.
Before Donald Tramp signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and UNDR.
In particular, they will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House subsequently circulated the president ' s statement that the law would not allow the United States to conclude profitable transactions and will bring closer RF, China and North Korea.
The Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
The entrepreneur from Belarus, Victor Prokopenia, revoked a request from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBC) for the purchase of a daughter of the Sberbank.
The businessman's decision explained the RBC's intention to “concentrate on other our planned investments and projects that we are working on”.
Mr. Prokopeni said that such a step would be “best time-investment” despite the investment attraction of the Sberbank daughter.
Mr. Prokopenia became the main claim for the purchase of a Russian bank in Ukraine after he rejected the application of the NorvikBank Gregory Guselnikov and the Belorusian company Saida Gucerieva in July.
The Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after the President of the County, Peter Porošenko, introduced sanctions on their daughter structures in March.
One of such financial organizations, in addition to the WTB and the External Bank, became Sberbank.
Novak called the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
In the Ministry of Energy, RF referred to the cause of a blackout in Crimea.
Explanations on what happened were made by the head of the Department of Alexander Novak.
He said that the peninsula was lost from electricity because of the road traffic accident in the territory of the Redland.
The carriage in the DTP has been electro-trafficking, resulting in the deactivation of Cuban and related crim networks.
The collapse in the electricity of large Crimean cities has been fixed last week.
Specialists have removed disorders over a few hours.
It was initially reported that the cause of a blackout could have been an anomalous heat.
The Bank of England will maintain the interest rate of 0.25 per cent
It is expected that the Bank of England will later announce that the interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weak inflation have made rumors about possible increase.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain irrelevant and left interest rates without changes among increasing pressure on family income.
Specialists of the Bank ' s Monetary and Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted with 6 to 2 for the preservation of 0.25 per cent rates, with less members of the Committee expressed in this month to increase the rate, as the weak economic growth weakened the support of increases.
In its quarterly report on inflation, the bank limited its forecasts to increase 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018, and warned that the family income pressure would continue, while the falling inflation is still expected to be up to about 3 per cent.
However, the Bank warned that the increase of the rates in the next few years would be necessary to control the inflation caused by brexy, and said that the costs for loans would probably have to be increased stronger than expected in the financial markets.
Members of the Committee also voted to reject the part of the universal complex of economic development measures launched a year ago as a result of brexity.
Starting from the next February, the bank will close the urgent funding plan, which it provides cheap loans to banks, although he has informed that it is now in the framework of that plan to provide another 15 billion pounds to 115 billion pounds.
In the bank ' s decision-making protocol, the bank said: “In accordance with the main predictions of the MPC, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) remains slow, while the pressure on real income of families continues to affect consumption.”
On the question of the rates, he repeated that in order to stop the inflation, “some financial policy will need to be reinforced”, as much as markets expect.
The markets are now predicting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank emphasized that all improvements would be “progressive” and “limited”.
The prognosis of the Bank to increase this and the next year are below the forecasts made in May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank has left its projection for 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After these news, the sterling fell in relation to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and 0.4 per cent to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was adopted after the recent uncomfortable growth rates were weakened; GDP then increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter against 0.2 per cent in the past three months.
According to the Bank's representative, growth is allegedly going to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase a little at the end of the year.
The latest report of the Inflation Bank gave little reason to rejoice households with high inflation and slight increases in salary: the pressure will be strengthened before decline.
The Bank added that the financial policy “can't prevent” has been deducted from earning in the next few years, but expects the salaries to be “significantly” to be recovered at the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also focused on growth as a result of increasing demand for British goods, which is due to a low-course pound, which compensates some of the lower consumer costs.
The decision was taken a year after the rates were reduced to 0.25 per cent last August after the shocking results of the European Union's referendum on the exit of the pound.
The bank will probably take four years to fully influence prices and economies.
Before the Bank made its last decision on rates, the noise rose around the estimated increase in the rates, since the inflation was increasingly pressured on and so experienced strong household pressure: three experts requested to increase rates to 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month, the inflation fell to 2.6 per cent of 2.9 per cent in July, although, according to the bank, the fall was expected and the next months would be recompensated.
According to the bank, a higher indicator compared to the 2 per cent planned totally is the result of a low pound rate.
Andrew Montlake, director of the Coreco Hipotective Brokers, said: “If considering the recent fall of the councils, the mortgage market would seem to be more competitive, as creditors demand business opportunities and count on a good end of the year.
The market appears particularly favourable for those approaching the conclusion of their existing treaties, as credit refinance, often with the absence of the commission and with a low rate, becomes popular as ever.”
The State Health Service will prescribe a dispute from 10,000 people from HIV
From September, patients will receive access to a “revolutionary” prevention medicine for HIV after the battle in the High Court on the financing of the Medicine of the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that pre-expository prevention of HIV (PREP), a pre-experience tablet, which has been proven to reduce the risk of persons in the risk group, at average 86 per cent, will now be provided by health services during the initial three-year testing period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the test after the Court of Appeal supported the decision of the High Court last year, which claimed that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay the PREP, despite its statements that it had to be financed by local authorities.
This step, announced on Thursday, was called “the most important innovation” by the President of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National Office for AIDS-proliferation (NAT) called it a “return moment”.
Before the full launch of the programme throughout England by April 2018, veneral dispensersers in London, Briton, Manchester, Liverpool and Chieffield will start registering people, and more distributors will join the programme in October.
Pre-expository prevention (PREP) is the course of HIV medicinal products taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies show that the PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infections among people in the risk group.
At the time of taking the PREP before sex in the human organism, there are sufficient amounts of certain medicines to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicinal products can be administered daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients who have the right to obtain the medicine include homosexual and bisexual men, transgenders and people whose HIV partners are positive and are not successfully treated.
Dispensers will receive appropriate participants who agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenders and persons whose partners are not known whether their HIV status is sustained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and administered to a general practice in England will also be able to file a request for potential participation in the nearest venerological dispenser who participates in the programme.
The programme would cost 10 million pounds, and the National Health Service of England signed a drug-supplier treaty on the international tender this week.
The study was thus built to evaluate all the possibilities of the PREP on the collection of clinical data on who is the target audience of the medicine, its accessibility and the use of a large extent.
"This important innovation should complement and strengthen widespread and more successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another weight in over three decades of success in fighting one of the largest health threats faced by humankind.
Deborah Gold, President of NAT (National AIDS Dissemination Control Office), stated: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
REP, if it is literally aimed at people in need of assistance and risks, gives the opportunity to change the situation of HIV epidemic in England.
Starting on September, people who are in the HIV risk group, through this study conducted in England on the National Health Service, will receive access to the new opening of the new tools that human application can control by itself without discussing this with the partner, leading to improvement of many lives.
We warmly welcome this news."
Ian Green, President of the Terrens Higgins Fund, said: “Now we need to make sure that the test turns quickly across the country and that none of the HIV risk groups are forgotten.
Now that we are provided with the PREP experimental product, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people in the HIV risk zone.”
Shadow Minister Shadow Health, Sharon Hodgeson, said: “We welcome the start of the PREP test, it has been very late for months of delays and pillars by the Government.”
The data show how revolutionary this medicinal product can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and cease transmission of this year infection.
This test will bring us closer to the full understanding of the advantages of PREP.
It is now important that the test is as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect HIV-risk-based persons and to move us further to the end of the spread of HIV in society.
The World Congress of Tatar adopted a resolution on the support of the Tatarstan and Russia treaty
The sixth meeting of the World Congress of Tatar (WCT) adopted a resolution noting the importance of presidency in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the “recommendable form of the organization of the Supreme State Authority in the Republic and expressing national interests of all the Tatar people”.
The meeting also emphasized the importance of the Treaty on the Distribution of Authorities between Russia and Tatarstan in the resolution.
According to the document, he "has played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and public-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole."
Recall that a treaty between Moscow and Kazanya has been concluded for 10 years since 24 July 2007.
On 11 July, the Tatarstan deputies requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and maintain the title of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only entity of the Federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only position called the President.
In Russia, there have been difficulties in obtaining international drivership rights
The GIDD units experience the deficit of international driver's certificates (IMO).
In order to obtain such rights, a number of weeks should be expected, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to leave abroad on their car or take it there.
It should be noted that the situation with international driver certificates remains contrary.
The IMU was introduced to make the foreign police easier to understand what was written in the national certificate, as it explained the information in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Roadway, but in countries ratified by the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized.
However, it depends on specific police or procurement offices: some require the IMOs, and some have sufficient national rights.
In order to ensure that the drivers of international rights are still receiving, but it should be taken into account that in non-ratified countries (e.g. the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities are entitled to do not recognize national rights or IMOs.
The problem with the banks is currently being seen in almost all GIDD units, reports Commersante, conducting a study in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow, the UGIBD units just don't show the plates, the blancs are missing for four months.
You can log in on the website, but the queue has already been broken up to mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, the IMU cannot be obtained "for technical reasons" without being detailed, in the Samaria area, it is fairly said that there are no blancs, the same situation consists in other cities.
Many Moscows have already encountered a problem, and the social networks are frequently reported as follows:
Irina Burmistrova: " Guess why international rights cannot be obtained in Moscow?"
That's right, because all GIBD offices have ended up.
Elena Podkolzina: "The question of the people who know."
International rights must be obtained very urgently.
In Moscow, it's still far ahead, and the tapes are not issued at all (but there is, but it can't give a talon).
It's like a portal of the servants showing that the time is free before the fuck.
Has anyone tried to get in another city?
Does it work?
As explained in IMD RF, the requirements for international driver's certificates have changed, so delivery of new banks is carried out in the Gosavto Inspection Unit.
The deficit may be linked to this, indeed, not clear of what changes it refers, has not been reported before.
The Blanki purchases a special road safety centre (CEDAW) and then puts them in GIDD units.
In recent years, all contracts were made with AO "Goznak": nearly 200,000 IMO banks were made in 2014-2015, 15,000 banks were purchased in 2016, and 90,000 in 2017, but the last contract was concluded on 18 July with OOO "The First Print Court" for the manufacture of 70,000 banks.
There is a version that the CSN just failed to make a tender in time, which resulted in deficiencies.
However, there are other insufficient versions of the lack of prints: because of the crisis, many people have started to ride themselves, not to Europe, but to the cheaper Asian countries China, Thailand, and so on.
What rights have been accepted there, uncertainly, so people are also protected, so there has been an appreciative demand for international " shorts " .
It has recently been known that professional drivers will have to pass a test to confirm their qualifications.
This proposal was made by Mintrans.
The International Driver Certificate (IMO) of the new sample has been operated since 31 May 2011.
Ukraine's Minister for Justice refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine, Paul Petrenko, stated that he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a Bridge in Krim.
About that on Friday, 4 August, he said in an interview with the "The Observer".
No respecting international company would even put a talk or a chat in there because it risks losing its business in the EU, the United States, Japan, in countries that joined Russian sanctions on Crime.
"I mean, in my deep conviction, there are no prospects for this project," said Petrenko.
He added that Russia was unable to implement the large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia can not build smaller objects normally.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, the entire stadiums have already been destroyed.
"So I believe that the best instrument in this situation is the sanctions against companies that have proved so unfair to join the project," the official noted.
On 31 July, the construction officers completed the construction of the ark of the Crimean Bridge.
The Carchen shore has completed accumulated arch of the Crimean Bridge: its accommodation has been closed at 45 meters from the design.
"At the same time, the builders prepared a railway arch to install for the falvater resistance," said the project information centre.
In April, head of Mintransa, Maxim Sokolov informed the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, that the establishment of the object was taking place with the precaution of the schedule.
The Crime bridge will unify the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar Land.
In Spain, a official who has not been at work for 10 years was fired
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to the public service) should the chief of the Spanish official Carles Resio have?
Permanent walk has been extended for 10 years.
However, Mr. Resio was fired.
But not his direct chief.
What is not happening in the bureaucratic world.
Citizens seem to have used to all the mess of the people.
Nevertheless, the officials have been able to surprise those whose taxes they live well.
This time, the "sensation" regretted from Spain.
There, the Valencia archive officer, Karles Resio, has managed to stay out of work for ten years.
He received a regular complaint.
The total solid amounts to EUR 50,000 per year.
And then Mr. Resio's strange times are over.
He was fired by the decision of the Valencia legislative Assembly.
In the investigation, it was found that a angry walker came to the office at 7:00 a.m. every morning to be marked in the electronic system.
And then he went home.
Once again, he appeared at work at 4:00 to mark again in the system that he left.
And so, ten years.
It was also known that all the free time the walker devoted to the drawing of comics at home.
Now, the Valencia legislative Assembly deputies think how to punish Mr. Resio's direct chief, who could not not know how to work actively in his workplace.
Judges are invited to protect from chairpersons
The Presidential Human Rights Council (SCH) on the commission of Vladimir Putina developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judicial branch.
The WFP suggests that the chairpersons of courts be limited and that they are elected.
For the Appeal and Castation Courts, the HRC wishes to introduce special districts that will not be bound to the administrative and territorial share in the RF.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals under the presidential commission.
The SME has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by Vladimir Putin on 3 January 2017, which the President gave after meeting with the members of the Council.
At the meeting with the members of the Council on 8 December 2016, individual cases of trial were discussed, as well as the issues of public control in the detention of citizens (see " Y " of 9 December).
The outcome of the work was 25 proposals relating to both the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors and the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of cremevian human rights defenders is the limitation of the powers of the chairpersons to increase the independence of the other judges.
If the judge's candidate has successfully contested and has been supported by the Judge's community, then the Chairman of the Court, in the opinion of the SME, should submit it to the appointment without the right to deny how the law now allows.
It is also suggested that the Chairman of the right to distribute cases for consideration between judges.
To do so, experts may allow a specially written computer programme.
The Chairman also believes that the Chairman is not entitled to “determine the results of the judge's qualification assessment, initiate his involvement in disciplinary responsibility, decide to establish additional material payments”.
The Presidential Council, however, considers it necessary to move to the " Chairperson's election by the judges themselves" and "to give them powers for a relatively non-continued period with mandatory rotation".
All the chairmen of the courts (from the Republic and the district) are now appointed as President of the Supreme Court of Justice of RF for six years.
In order to prevent the judges from pressure from regional administrations, the HRF suggests a new appeal and casssation in the courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and territorial division in the RF.
The SMEs say that “need to ensure that individual appeal and cassation vessels are organized, not at the level of circuit judiciary in RFs, but in the judicial districts”.
Experts are based on arbitration practices.
There are “judicial districts”, which do not coincide with the administrative division in the RF, but which guarantees large independence from regional officials who are difficult to use the "phone law".
The World Judges invites the CPC to strengthen the national judiciary in order to consider certain " categories of civil and administrative affairs " .
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of work, the protection of honor and dignity, the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
"It is only our proposals," explained the "Y" member of the ACP, the Constitutional Court judge, resigned by Tamara Morstakova.
She also recalled that the President ' s commission was not only related to the SMEs but also to the Supreme Court (WC), which has not yet disclosed his proposals.
There is still a time to fulfil the mandate of the WF (mean the prosecutors of the General Prosecutor and the Human Rights Officer in the RF).
To report to Vladimir Putin on the effectiveness of the independence of justice in the RF, the President of the WC Viceslav Lebedev must be required by 1 September.
Living high-life: Half-Fall and Fancy Designers have turned this small apartment to the Earls Court into a spacious housing
Joan Lee, a former real estate banker, moved from a space house to Nightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a beautiful type house in the style of Queen Anne, and for the new design, Joan says that she didn't gather her things or move again.
“ I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge on a much larger square, ” says Joan.
"I've been looking for something comparable for my money.
They showed me this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high roofs.
I fell in love with her and offered the price the same day."
Since the first review, the place of the square feet of the area has been fully reconstructed.
At first, it was an apartment with a single complex planned bedroom -- to get into the bedroom, it had to go through the kitchen -- and Joanna wanted to add spaces to store things and halfstairs to make the maximum benefits from the generous height of the ceiling.
“I wanted high roofs, big windows, a lot of light.
It was my requirements," she said.
To this end, she hired Erphana Azadi from the Notting Hill architectural Design Study, Duck & Shed, to use the roofs at 12.5 feet high and create an apartment that would not only be a successful project but would be worth Joan for life.
The ceiling was insufficient to establish two rooms over one another, so the architectural task was to create a half-edge where it could be fully grown.
Erphane had to think creatively to deal with the briefing.
"The work with steel structures is very complex," he explains.
“We had to place the rooms so that they were above each other, and we had to keep them away.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but to avoid designs so that they were at the right height and to allow the use of rooms from top and below.”
This decision enabled Erphane to set up two full-dimensional rooms above each other in a visited space, and much more interesting.
From the half-stairs, the retrouvius candidate window is opened to a beautiful living room below.
The mirror furniture with a golden office, silver accents and the serge Muy lighting devices give the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding vision, space and light.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors to make it look longer.
The mirror defense panel in the kitchen looks like a window into the other room.
In the entrance, the mirror closets serve to keep all Joan's vessels.
In order to create a more luxury space, the beauty of the living room can block the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new in the kitchen stores.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's moving up the door like in the garage.
"The engineering art has been activated here," says Erfan on the armed steel of the wooden wave of the shield door.
"She is equipped with the antiweight, so when you push the door up, it is very easy to slip."
With reasonable use of space and places for storage, Joan received additional 16 square meters, additional bedroom and improved planning.
"In the end, the field of gender is exactly what you will sell, which is what your real estate is evaluated," said Erphane.
“Grubly speaking, the real estate trade agent will enter and make calculations on the basis of the field of gender.”
Here they have been able to increase the area of genders using quality materials that give the space of luxury shadows.
"The materials are what we touch, so they help to create an emotional relationship with the house," said Erphane.
"No one falls in love with an electrical pipe in the walls.
It is important, but does not affect the strings of our hearts."
This serves as a witness that, for good design and an increased metrage, the apartment can turn out of something incredible.
Actually, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of a Cultural Policy Commission
The Government of Russia approved the establishment of a public cultural policy commission.
The relevant decision was published on the Government ' s website.
According to the document, the Commission will be the main task of developing and adjusting strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policies.
The Commission will also develop drafts of a cultural policy strategy, improve the tasks and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The Chief of the Commission was appointed Vice-Chairman of the Government of RF.
The composition of the Commission will be approved separately.
The Prime Minister of RF Dmitri Medvedev adopted a plan for the implementation of the public cultural policy strategy until 2030.

Inflation in G20 has decreased to eight-year minimum
The increase in consumer prices in countries in G20 has decreased to the minimum in the last eight years, reports the Wall Street Journal with reference to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
OECD estimated that the inflation rates in June 2016 were 2 per cent lower in October 2009, when price growth index was 1.7 per cent.
Rather, Rosstat reported a decrease in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1 per cent.
Thus, the Office established the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation Target in Russia, according to Minfin, is 4.1 per cent.
The mineconomics, however, believes that the target has already been achieved -- according to the version of the agency, the indicator is 4 per cent.
Putin warned against the illicit cutting of bajkal taiga
The Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, warned against illegal destruction of forests during the meeting on environmental development of the natural bajkal territories.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergei Donsky, noted that the draft bill was previously prepared.
It authorizes the wood cutting during the elimination of fires, and the Government plans to take it on the fall.
In turn, the President stated that the project had to be monitored so that it would not "free all in order to exclude everything."
Donsky noted that the draft bill provided for control by the ICB and supervisory agencies.
Media: Fighters from the command are dealing with Donbass' mutuals
There is a regular telephone link on the line of armed opposition in Donbass.
The fighters of counterparts have been constantly in contact with each other on mobile phones, and they do not know about this in headquarters.
Fighters and generals of Donbass have gathered mobile phones secretly from their high command.
The Party.ua reports on this on 4 August with reference to military operations in Donbass.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units are well aware of the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and daily communicate with them on the phone.
The communication is not at all: the commanders are trying to reach some "tactical arrangements".
Particularly, the result of such talks is the reconciliation at a certain front area.
The journalists were aware of the occasions when congratulations on the birthday of a officer received from his formal enemy from the front line.
Fighters and DDRs and LNRs are sitting on a diversion line from the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a war operation against Donbass.
MID disturbed the blocking of UNCC statements on attacks against the RAF
The Russian Foreign Political Office is disturbed by the actions of individual Western diplomatic representatives blocking UN statements in the press condemning the terrorist attacks of the Embassy of the RF in Syria.
The Russian MID reported this.
The Office recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on 2 August was third time a monthly minimal shooting by terrorists of the Hayat Tahrir Ash-Sham (ex Jabhat an-Nousra), prohibited in RF) and "Fileak Ar-Rahman".
Recognizing that the international community is unanimously qualified as a terrorist organization, and the UNSR resolutions call upon to counter the structure, the MID RF noted that " it would seem, of course, that the Nusra terrorists should meet universally unconditional and decisive convictions, and there should be no bisentiality in the assessments of exits against diplomatic missions."
However, as emphasized in the Division, “the third time a monthly diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Nations, France and Ukraine in the Security Council have blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard summary draft of the Security Council ' s statement to condemn terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital”.
Notwithstanding to demonstrate diplomatic solidarity with us, let these delegations be consented.
"The most disturbing fact that the inability of the Security Council to condemn terrorist acts encourages them to new provokes and terrors, allows them to feel impunity," said the MID and added that "I would not like those barbarians to be convinced that someone in the Security Council was with them."
Vladimir Putin spoke to limit the number of extra-plan business checks
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, during the Investment Project Meeting in the Dale East, stated that the number of extra-plan checks of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30 per cent of the number of plans, and said that the need to limit the inspection period by ten hours.
“International checks are generally carried out without appropriate consensus with the prosecutor; only 2-3 per cent agrees with the prosecutor, all the rest goes on on its own”, quoted by the TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be prohibited from excluding servers and hard drives in business.
Furthermore, the president believes that business associations should have the right to protect the interests of their members in the court.
"I hope that this will make some positive in dealing with entrepreneurship cases or in violation of the entrepreneurship law," said the head of the State.
As “Y” reported, the moratorium for plan verifications increases the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs.
In May, a business ombudsman at the President of Russia, Boris Titova was conducted a survey, resulting in the fact that the substitute of plans had been unplanned (the amount of 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), by prosecutors (16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), as well as civilian statements (15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).
Details on the business checks in the "U" "Some Business" material came on the other hand.
Brothers fight for the real empire of more than $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of the largest empires in Victoria's state in real estate, worth more than 500 million dollars -- forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
The former director of the Carlton football club and the Constituent Colin de Lutis lives in the Turkish palace three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a suit against him to the Supreme Court on the division of property and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court still has a hard dispute on the conditions of divorce.
Together with their mother, Anna, the brothers own 87 facilities worth more than half a billion dollars purchased since their family bought a Smit Street store in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family founded the Westco Jeans company, which grew up in a network of 160 trade points.
It was sold in 1999 for 85 million dollars.
Money was incorporated into real estate, and the list of the family's property of De Lutis included today office buildings, building stations in Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments on the Golden Shore and Mount Buller and the predecession centres.
In agreement with the dead father of Colin, Paul described as “the main motion force and the dominant identity of the family of De Lutis”, it owns about two thirds of the company's assets, and Paul is about one third.
According to the court, this means that the property of Colin is 316 million, and Paul is 176 million.
The division of property and money has become a controversy stone for Paul.
"The section proposed by Cole gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of property," he wrote in his first statements in 2015.
The first hearings in the Supreme Court took place on Friday after several failures in reconciliation.
Brothers are now arguing who will control the existing business -- from which Paul believed that Colin had excluded him.
Colin claimed that it was not, but he accused Paul of incompetent management of certain objects.
In the testimony, Colin's data at the beginning of the process, he said he was hoping to solve the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider the family a high priority," he wrote.
The judicial costs are growing as a snow com: hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and reports of companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer; both parties attracted the most famous lawyers, including the royal lawyer Alan Myers, and the best scatterers.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; since the end of the 1950s they had managed breast bars and gastronomies, and in early 1970 they bought a shop in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a collingwood shop in which Colin opened the first family shop of jeans.
Colin said he had launched Westco when he was "in the last school class, and Paul was a boy (about 10 years old).
Anna de Lutis said that they were with Louisi, who died in 2012, hoped to give their own possessions to their sons without conflict.
"Luigi often told me that she didn't want the brothers to deal with it in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group; Colina says that Mark received 10 million when he left the business and Luke 26 million.
Paul, Luke and Mark said that they were "not satisfied with the financial conditions of their office."
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the Board of Directors of the AFL Club and, according to the biography published in 2015, Eddy McGira, the best friend of television.
The Ferfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin, a text message in which it was said that since the case was not yet discussed in the court, "I have nothing to say very much."
"I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to file a lawsuit against me and whisper the name of our family in court," he wrote.
In mid 2016, Colin wrote in his statements that he tried to meet his brother’s requirements.
"Our father wouldn't want to see Paul and I argue in court," he added, "and he still hoped for the resolution of the conflict."
On Friday, this hope must have dissolved.
"The decision on our case will be brought by the court soon," wrote Colin.
The new chapter of the Trampa apparatus plans to limit the accession of information to the President.
Others tried to do so and suffered defeat.
Maybe John F. Kelly will really do it.
Then he'll be the first.
“Politico” reports that the new Chief of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to the President Tramp, including the news messages from the media, hoping to keep the boss in a more calm state.
That's what reporter Josh Douzi reports.
"A meeting held by the new head of the White House, John F. Kelly, with the leadership of the equipment on his first working day, marked the main problem in the White House with President Donald Trampe, whom he hoped to resolve: bad channels of accession to the President."
Kelly told the staff that information should go through it -- in paper or in briefings -- because the president would make better decisions if he received the correct information.
The diagnosis of Kelly is absolutely true, but others have already failed to reconcile Trampa by tracking his information.
President Tramp's relations with television have been made several decades ago -- and now that he is in the White House, his habit of watching television is still strong.
"When Tramp, as a candidate, was disturbed by unfair lighting of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he had received fair light in the publications that could be reconciled," said Sam Nanberg, former electoral headquarters advisor, in February.
Tara Palmer then wrote to Politics that “the six former members of the election headquarters, in order to control Tramp's habit to write on Twitter, had to be monitored to ensure that there was a constant flow of praise in the coming information.”
Okay.
But the idea that Tramp's habit to write on Twitter was ever under control, it's just funny.
Maybe these members of the electoral headquarters know something we don't know, for example, that if they weren't, the Twitters of Tramp would be even more provocative.
We may never find out about Tweets that Tramp has not published.
If his employees kept him from trouble at least several times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has ever been able to keep Tramp from pouring butter into fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into competitive fractions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by providing Tramp material reliable or not, which reaffirms their views.
"Politico" -- just to that story -- wrote in May on the tendency of advisers to keep the president's doubtful information.
Here is one example described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"The current and former Tramp staff say that Tramp can react very severely to the negative press reports, especially with dangerous information flows, and will not be calmed until he finds who was behind them.
This happened at the end of February, when someone posted the president's printing of a article with GotNews.com, Charles K. Johnson's web site, where the Deputy Head of Cathy Welsh was accused of being “a number of escapes” in the White House.
Doesn't matter that Johnson has been in Twitter forever for aggressive behaviour, that he did not present specific facts or that he had initiated false accusations in the past and then rejected them.
Tramp read the article and asked the staff on Walsh."
Goldmacher adds that then the Chief of Raines Pribus and the Secretary of the Rob Porter apparatus tried to build a system to manage the flow of papers that Tramp receives and document them.
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly's trying to do the same thing.
It may be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Tramp still has impulsive nature, and his assistants continue to fight each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly a challenge very difficult.
The Tumen Prosecutor combat HIV Dissident
The prosecutor contested the decision of the Calinin Paradise of Tumeni, which ceased the criminal case against a local resident who had lost a minor daughter from the HIV.
As the result claims, the child died because the mother was HIV-disident and was dismissed.
However, the court released her from responsibility for reconciliation with the father who was injured.
The Prosecutor believes that the crime cannot be left impunity in order to prevent precedents for other HIV dissidents.
The case with Tumenian inhabitant was excited at 1st p. 109 of the UK RF (provocation of death on non-caution) in April, after her three-year daughter died from HIV infection of 4V.
According to the prosecutor, the mother itself is HIV-infected.
"Women did not treat herself and refused to treat the daughter, considering that there was no HIV infection," explained the Tumen Prosecutor.
The Criminal case entered the Calinic Paradise of Tumani, which decided on 25 July to terminate it.
A request was made by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that “forgiving his wife, no claims, she was injured and apologizing.”
The prosecutor did not agree with the court's decision and filed an appeal, requiring annulment of the decision to terminate the case and send it to a new review.
The girl died, and the crime caused is impossible.
A HIV-infected mother, opposed to the recommendations of the doctors, has refused to survey the baby and treat her from dangerous infection," the prosecutor's press service reported.
In the opinion of the supervisory authority, it should be punished or other HIV-discidents will follow its example.
As said in the Tumenian AIDS Centre, now around 12 children with HIV patients are not medically reliefed because of parents' refusal.
"And the situation has already improved -- half of the parents, who have categorically refused to treat children with HIV, have changed their views -- allowed diagnostic, had taken medicines," said the press secretary of the Centre for AIDS Elena Loseva.
She said that it was not possible in a legislative manner to affect parents, and not all HIV-infected children were able to be detected -- mothers do not survey them, hide, run away with children from hospitals.
What danger are HIV-disidents
At the end of last year, Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first study in Russia of the so-called HIV-disident movement.
HIV-disidents call people who deny HIV and refuse to take medicines.
Medicines and activists of AIDS-servicing NCO call these views anti-medical, and they see serious threats in their dissemination.
The horrible photo session, which ended by the tragedy, took place on Thursday, 3 August, at the railway station of Greece in Chmellinko.
The cheerful company of young people walked over the railways, where the cargo train was standing.
One of the friends had a idea to make an effective self on the roof of the vagon, reported FACTAM in the police communications sector in the Hmellica area.
The guy started coming down from the train bridge, but because of his immediateness, he stuck behind the line of electrical transmission and immediately got hit by the current.
Fortunately, this case was known to the station manager who immediately called an emergency.
Before the injured doctors arrived, they were transferred to a safe place and then hospitalized to the Hospital Hospital Chamber of the District Clinical Hospital.
Men were diagnosed with tual burns of 1-2 degrees.
The doctors now appreciate his condition as stable.
Legislatives recall that recently, extreme selfs have been acquired on the roofs of multi-stairs, transport bridges.
The police calls on people to be alert and to avoid such photoses, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists allowed oceans to exist in ancient Vienna
There could be oceans in ancient Vienna.
The French scientists made such a presumption.
Specialists created a computer model that demonstrated the water education process on the surface of the planet, says Science News.
It turns out that in the beginning of its history, oceans had 10 per cent more water than now on Earth.
Previously, "Arguments of the week" said that according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean could exist on Mars 4 billion years ago.
Foreign experts during their studies concluded that the water object was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.

The Gypsies have overcome the bow and returned to the street of millions.
Some of the most rich homeowners of Western Midland again conflict with crucial Gypsies who have overcome the municipal authorities of the rabbit to reopen the field next to their homes.
The Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in the field bordering with the rich street of Solihall, which received a jokeful name “Millioners Street”.
When they brought with them horses, babies and a lot of houses on their wheels, they returned after they were expelled no further than in May, and they had no obstacles from the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a break in defence facilities and resisted its vehicles through the stations that were left unflawed to leave a place for the road.
The angered inhabitants attacked the Solihall municipality, saying that it was “incapable to solve this problem”.
The anonymous local inhabitant said: “They came here on Monday night after they were expelled from Bentley Hit, where they were throwing stones into passages.”
Municipality should be ashamed and forced to act because they are unable to solve this problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were expelled, and then they came back.
There's been more Gypsies last night, and maybe even more today.
"The Burmingham Municipality knows how to solve this problem, they receive long-term judicial decisions to protect their parks," she added.
I live on the Streetbrook Road, and I don't like to keep paying a municipal tax, and the municipality can't even end it."
One local inhabitant who wanted to remain anonymous said: "This is funny, we just saw these Gypsies leave last time, and here, please, this attack continues."
This time more of them, and we even saw a horse falling on the lion."
The representative of the Solihall Municipality stated: “We know about the illegal camp on earth near the Streetbrook Road and cooperate with the Solihaal police; we are taking the necessary legal action to enable them to be expelled as soon as possible.”
In order to help us gather witnesses, it is important that as many local people can report any anti-social or criminal conduct to the police on the phone 101.
This allows us to draw up the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crime shares the champagne wine factory "New Light"
The GUP of the Republic of Crime ' s Champagne Vines ' Facility ' New Light' is determined to act, converting to the OAO the Champagne Facility of the New Light ' s Champagne Facility, the Minister for Property and Land Relations of Crime, Anna Anuchina.
100% of the shares of the company will remain in the state of Crime.
The constitutional capital of the shareholder society will be 595.5 million routines and will consist of 5.955 million normal shares of nominal value of 100 rubs each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crime stated that if there are no funds for the modernisation of the company within the next three years, the factory would be threatened to stop.
The main funds for enterprises are about 60 to 70 per cent.
The modernization of an enterprise requires 1.2 billion rubs, and it is obliged to pay 50 per cent of the revenue of the budget.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"It is difficult to get money from the owner, to talk about loan funds of large credit organizations," said Mr. Minselhoza Crime Sergei Petelin in April this year.
The Crime Parliament included an enterprise in the project plan for privatization for 2017.
Its action was proposed and was made available to trade.
The source of Interfax in Crime authorities evaluated the possible sales value of $40 million, the contribution of the investor to modernization, in $30 million.
In 2016, the New Light increased the production of graphic wine by 2.8 per cent compared to the level of 2015 to 1,52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New Light was intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by the Prince of Lev Golicin as a grass wine factory in the acquired name of the New Light.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Downtown third-classers destroyed more than 40 nadgraves
The IMD staff on the Neighbourhood have established citizens who destroyed 46 nadhrobs on the cemetery of the city of Liscovo.
Those who were intelligent were a third grade student.
The first statement that the grave plates were damaged by unknown have entered the OMVD of Russia on the Lyskow region on 27 June.
24 people were addressed to the police in this regard.
As a result, a criminal case under article 244 of the UK RF " Destruction, damage or distortion of places of buried".
As a result, the police had established suspects, two schools aged 8 and 9 years old.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing the monuments falling, and it moved them to huliganic acts.
Children and their parents have been conducted preventive activities.
Italy has accelerated the tone of NGO ships saving migrants.
Italy warned NGOs belonging to rescue courts in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue their work unless they were subject to new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new code of behaviour, it is hard to say if they can continue their activities," said the Minister of Interior, Mario Minniti, in an interview with the Turkish daily newspaper Stampa.
The warning of Minnity sounded the next day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Yugend Rettet suspected that his crew actually cooperates with traffickers and facilitates illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which worked for a year, rejected the comments on the substantive detailed charges against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrodjo Cartozio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains a higher priority, so we regret that we cannot now continue in the search and rescue zone," said the social network statement.
"We can evaluate all the charges that have been made now, only after we gather all the information and we can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been watching the Juvent vessel belonging to Jugend Rettet since October.
His crew is suspected that all the rescue ships were taken to the ship of migrants whose traffickers were sent directly to them and allowed the smugglers to leave with the boats they could use again.
At least one such meeting was expected to be only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, as stated in the materials of charges published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violation of the provisions of the Italian coastal authorities that control rescue operations in this area, rather from humanitarian zeal than by any other motivation.
The Code of Behaviour suggests that the Court of Justice of the Juventa will have a Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
While only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue operations agreed to comply with the Code "Save Children", the Maltese MOAS and "Pro-Activ Expanded arms" from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that the new rules were unnecessary but acceptable, provided that they would not make any " significant changes or interference" of its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign the Nobel Prize was the Nobel Prize Organization " Doctors Without Borders " (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minnity said that a rapid reduction in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support the Libyan Coast Safety and cooperate with local mayors were fruitful.
"In the last days we began to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He reported plans for further negotiations with the Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants left in hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to associate from any of the sides of the conflict."
The RF authorities have recently reinforced their policy in the Lebanese direction, and with visits to Moscow, delegations of anti-Libyan parties have participated.
The Chief of the Russian Integrity Contact Group on Internal Settlement at the MID RF and the State, the Assistant Head of the Czech Republic, Lev Dengov, told the " E" objectives of Moscow in this region and on whom it is in charge.
The contact group on Libya, which you are heading, is almost unknown.
Let's say that the Ukraine contact group knows everything about it.
And here's a secret curtain.
What exactly are you doing, what goals are you pursuing?
The contact group was established on the initiative of MID RF and State thought.
Its activities are undermined by the Deputy of Foreign Affairs of Michael Bogdanov and Adam Delimhanov (Deputy of Doma from Chechnya. - " Y").
The latter was authorized to work on the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the State of Viceslav Vladin.
The detention in Libya of the Russian tanker Mechanical Chebotarev (September 2015), 11 people were detained.
We've been thinking about helping the crew.
The group of military specialists, representatives of the State, was then established, and our work was supported by Chairman of Chechnya Ramzan Cadirov.
And how did it happen that you were the one who led her?
Since I worked for Libya since 2008, I was asked to head the group.
Our activities were not limited to the exemption of the seafarers from the Chebotare Mechanics.
We have managed to establish contact with representatives of all the major groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and by Tripoli (which is based on the United Nations Government, headed by Faiz Saradž. - " Y") and with Tobruk (the residence of Parliament, which opposes the Government and supports the marshal of Haftar, which controls the eastern regions of Libya. - " Y").
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metiga (Vice Prime Minister of Libya-U), we were able to agree quickly on the release of Russian seamen.
It was then decided to make these contacts more effective, to establish a contact group.
Its task is to analyse the environment, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties of the conflict.
I would like to emphasize: In Libya, we do not want to associate with any of the parties of the conflict, we have dialogue with all.
How many people are involved in the contact group, and how many of them are constantly in Libya?
Five people are now involved in the contact group.
Among them are people who have experience in force structures, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also want to integrate a group of experts on the region, representatives of the Middle East Institute of RAN.
There is no one in Libya all the time, but there is no need.
Is there now Russian military advisers in Libya, instructors.
And if so, whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications are not in line with the reality.
But your contact group, former troops...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot points.
Or closed up to a certain moment for us, such as Missurata (which is based on teams of generals that played the role of the Libyan leader Muammar Kaddafi in 2011, and which have been significantly intensified in the coming years. - " Y").
We arrived in Missuratus in January this year.
We were frightened, said there were all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important that we evaluated the situation there itself, to examine the real military potential, which is responsible for why the rumours are actually the role of Islamists.
In Missurate, we met with all the representatives of the teams that were engaged in the destruction of IG in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was marked by the warriors forbidden in Russia of the Islamic State - " Y").
We wanted to look at them, meet these people, check the information that they played a crucial role in the destruction of the IG in Libya, not Kalif Haftar, who had awarded these credits to themselves.
And what is your conclusion?
Islamic State in Libya won no Haftar?
That's not what he was doing.
Haftar performed operations on another front, in Bengazi.
And the IG in Sirta combated the structures of the Government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited people who conducted this anti-terrorism operation to Russia.
And they arrived -- visit extended from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Lebanese delegation adopted the Federation Council, Doma, MIDE and Rosguardia.
You, as we realize, are in all the Libyan regions and are likely to represent the mood of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, the elections reached at the end of July in Paris, Halifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or again, as this has been happening repeatedly in the past, will the agreements be collapsed, the fighting will resume, the parties will try to capture power alone?
For us, it was a good signal that Saraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting, not so long ago.
In the past, both leaders responded very negatively to each other.
With regard to the position of Russia...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftara, and many believe that.
We faced this situation when we were in Missurate, and Haftar was on board that day, the Russian Avian Aviation Guideman Admiral Kuznezov.
It was a coincidence.
But they didn't believe in Missurate in coincidence.
We were told, "You must be very brave people who came to us today."
But our task is to show that we are not only supporting Haftara, we have a dialogue with all the key participants of the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar were in contact.
Does it facilitate understanding with the Russian partners at the human, emotional level that he had studied twice in the SSSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
If he knows Russian, it's very relative.
But what he was learning from us, of course, makes it easier to talk with him.
Not only with him, by the way.
When we communicate with troops in Tripoli and Missurate, we meet generals who have been studying either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And here they speak beautifully Russian.
And they're drawn to Russia, somehow, they're attached to nostalgia.
Do you consider that the arms embargo for Libya is likely to be urgently revoked?
Are your Libyan interviewers interested in the delivery of Russian weapons?
They are interesting, of course, but, as I said, we do not take a side in this conflict or want to arm one another to harm others.
We would like everyone to be in some equal positions.
With regard to the arms embargo, the Libyans are constantly calling for Russia to make it possible.
In Libya, the constitutional process is now actively progressing.
We hope that the parties will make compromise decisions, reach internal consensus.
The elections should then take place, as was said at the meeting of Saraja and Haftara.
If the elections are held and the legitimate authority (and no party is currently in such status), the issue of the withdrawal of the arms embargo can be raised in the United Nations.
To raise this issue now is meaningless and dangerous, it will only lead to the escalation of the conflict.
The media was informed that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees from Libya, felt abandoned by allies from the EU.
Is Moscow able to help Italian partners in this situation using their links with the Libyans?
How realistic is, for example, that Haftar's teams will set control of the coast and end the business of smugglers transferring immigrants to Europe?
It's a very timely question.
We're working on it actively.
The Italians need support from Russia, because Moscow has dialogue with Haftar and Saraje and with Missurath and Southern.
The tribes in southern Libya play a great role in this matter, and they are willing to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about the Southern to cross migrants' streams on a long way?
So, in terms of condition, were the buses that were going back to Nigerian migrants?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in continuing the flows.
We hope to facilitate the South in the negotiating process between Sarajah, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But first, we would like to see the unity of the opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saradž.
The head of the Government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered Islamist, a party to the introduction of sharia standards in the country.
How much radical views does he hold?
Would this not be an obstacle to building relations with Russia or the West?
I'll express my personal opinion on him.
In my view, he's the opponent of the radical Islam.
But Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya must be a totally normal country - moderately Islamic, open world.
He also actively fights terrorists.
Why does he have such a reputation?
It was created by those countries that were not interested in the communication of Russia with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, there is a legislative, executive and judicial authority.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other state structures.
Of course, some countries were interested not to go in there.
And we mixed all their maps and started actively with Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we already have the fruits of this work: Rosneft has concluded an agreement on cooperation with the State oil company of Libya-NOC.
Director of NOC, Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Rosnefty head Igor Secin concluded a deal, himself from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, there was the first load of the Libyan oil of Rosneft.
What will Russia do to her?
I guess to sell again.
What other economic interests have Russia in Libya?
In the plans, the contracts concluded with Muammar Kaddafi are signed.
This is, inter alia, the previous arrangements in the transport area (the construction of railways), the energy (electricity) and some other.
Do the Lives have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
So, like Iran, is the oil scheme in exchange for services?
I don't know what the scheme is going to be, I don't do this directly.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not essential.
We are actually doing peacekeeping work there.
For us, it is essential to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans agree, so that they can set up order, and Libya has no longer been a favourable environment for terrorism development.
For Russia, this is the main task of helping the Libyan people and pushing terrorists from there.
Do you have any information about the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical warriors from Russia or other countries of the former SSSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with the representative of the Lebanese Committee for State Security, which said that there is no Russian and other countries of the former SSSR for this day.
He said that he had about 50,000 phone records of representatives of Islamic and radical groups (in Libya).
And from what states are these warriors?
I don't want to get into these details.
Then let's make a different question.
How many of the Islamist warriors in Libya themselves?
There are almost 5% of the Libyans.
The rest are coming.
Can Moscow hold internal negotiations like Paris?
That's the plan.
We have active negotiations with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have announced our willingness to return to Moscow or Grosny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say now.
There must be a few visits, and I hope that there will be clarity about the time and place of negotiations.
In the Czech Museum, charities collected money for a dear gift to a sick boy
A nine-year-old Sasha Macola boy in the sub-square museum of Melihovo, who has the DCP, the brain hydrocephalia and the full blindness, will receive a specialised runway present on 5 August.
A useful present will be provided by the Minister of Culture of Moscow, Oxana Kosareva, and the Director of the Constantine Bobkov Museum.
Money for the training was gathered during the charity marathon "Do not stop doing good," which went in Melich on July 15th of the Day of Chechov.
Before the marathon in the museum, Sasha, who lived in the village of Manuskino of the Czech Republic, received a letter: "I don't have eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I would like to get a runway to get my legs strong, and I'd learn to walk a little bit."
And then Sasha's dream came true!
After delivery in the Museum Commander, the Concert Postscriptum will take place, a famous pianist, an earned Russian artist Alexander Gindin, will perform popuri from popular classical productions.
During the charitable marathon in Melichova, the Hors of the Davidow Desert, the Illia Drozdichin bellers, the students of the Moscow Conservatory of P.I. Chaikovski and Russian Academy of Gnesini, the artists of the Melichovian Theatre " Chechow Studio " .
There were auctions for visitors, book sales and charity sales of suvenir products with marathon logo.
The Museum Commander of Melichovo launched the Focus Day on 15 July for a single day of charity in all Podmoskovian Museums.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevska of the Citomir area near the local football stadium shot several times into the adolescents that were there.
According to the suspect, he was angered by the noise, reported by FACTAM at the Citomir police Communications Division.
After that, a man went into a cafeteria nearby.
He had a conflict in the building, during which a man used a tire bullet device to shoot, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old person was provided with the necessary medical assistance, no threat of his life.
The police and the ambulance came to the scene of the incident, but the arrows have hid.
The law enforcement officers established his identity and detained the same day, on 2 August.
The man couldn't explain his actions.
He's got a tire bullet fire device to be sent to the expertise.
The Criminal Code of Ukraine has begun by this fact.
The detainee is threatened to be deprived from 3 to 7 years of age.
Recall, a shooting attack occurred in Kiev at Lucianovka at Tatar Street at night on 28 July.
Michelle Carter's sentence for communications that caused Conrad Roy to suicide
The resident of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years of detention because she was using text messages and phone calls incentives to suicide her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michel Carter, who is now 20 years of age, will have to be 15 months behind a prison and another 5 years of testing.
Carter was recognized as guilty of the uninterested murder of Conrad Roy in June, who killed herself on 13 July 2014.
Father Roya said at the hearings on Thursday, "My family was killed by grief.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free before the appeal.
She was in danger of 20 years, but her lawyers said she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red pants and cream blouse, listened to the sentence of standing, shaking her hands and putting his eyes down.
"She has killed Conrad Roy by its actions," the prosecutor stated.
"She interrupted his life to improve her own.
She has not accepted responsibility," she said.
"She has not shown regret."
But attorney Carter said that it was a tragic case she was deeply sorry for.
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that it felt that "her age, maturity or even mental illness had not significantly affected its actions."
The prosecutor read Roy Lynn Roy's mother's statement, which says, "I hadn't passed any day when I would not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I do - I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever," he says.
Sister Roya Camdin Roy said that she was inherently persecuted by the thought that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become aunts of his children.
"It's a pain to stay with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This case would seem to be a legal precedent, since no law in Massachusetts would be responsible for the advice of a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roya was found dead in the car with signs of poisoning carbon gas, Carter was 17 years old.
The case attracted the attention of the country when it was known that Carter had been triggered to suicide.
"You can hang, jump off the roof, slap yourself with a knife, I don't know a lot of ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before he died when he rested with his family.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "You only have to turn on the burning, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monice said that Carter wanted to pay attention through Roy's death, and forbidd her to communicate with the press so that she could not get what she wanted.
The views of the lawyers were divided.
One of the few who protected Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for the murder of her British neighbour in Italy and justified two years later.
A 30-year-old Knox published her special opinion in Los Angeles Times, saying, "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and assistance, not prisons."
Eugene Bogachev: "I let Langford go as a high-level bird."
One of the best basketball players of the One League of WTB 33-year-old Keith Langford left UNICS.
The withdrawal of the American Protector ' s Notifications' commented the President of the UNICS Eugenei Bogachev.
Keith took this decision on family circumstances," said Eugeney Bogachev.
He's got a little child, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to the house.
I decided to go meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved another relationship.
He played three seasons in UNICSE and showed a high level in each match, all 100 per cent.
So I let him go as a high flight bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in the family life and the game career.
Keith Langford played three years in the Cain club, conquering the silver of the Single League-2015/16.
In season 2016/17, he was rewarded to the most effective player in the Euroliga season.
He picked up 21,75 points in the middle for a match.
This result was second since 2004 when the reward was established.
Langford, who also won the prize in 2014, became the second player in Euroliga history, who received this prize more than once.
Langford will soon sign a contract with the Chinese Shanchen, informed Eurohoops.
The American is expected to conclude a two-year contract of $5 million.
Langford will be the second after July the Euroliga star, which is turning into a Chinese championship.

The tourists from Podmoskovia were evacuated by a helicopter in Adigea
Adigeus rescueers today have evacuated from the mountain region the submotive tourists who had received stronger sunflows.
The man was resting at the Fisht shelter at a height of 1.6000 meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had increased pressure and a difficult breath.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The leader of the tour group, who told the rescue, said that the men had been burned in a march.
Audi will be modified to 850 000 diesel cars
On a day before the Audi announcement, BMW stated that it would propose to update software in more than 350 000 vehicles.
The President of the BMW said that the company considered “there are more intelligent ways than restrictions on driving”, in view of European cities, including München, where there is BMW, which considered the possibility of prohibiting or restricting the use of air cars.
Dumbler said on Thursday that the Mercedes has modified three million cars in Europe to reduce their diesel explosion.
None of the companies have called their step back.
European autoproducers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to facilitate compliance with the coal gas emission rules.
But nitrogen oxides that throw diesel engines are considered to be cancerogene and can cause astma.
The value of autoproducers to install equipment that neutralize diesel gas gas is also increasing, and supporting the competitive price of the vehicles becomes difficult.
While the German autoproducers are under remark, the Government of Chancellor Angela Merkel also accused it of the influenced autoproducers and ignored the signs of the problem.
Companies try not to repeat the errors of Folkswagen, which hid the use of so-called " defeat devices " which could fix the number of damaged gases during the testing, so that it would comply with the rules and would be disabled under normal driving conditions.
Several Folkswagen leaders were sentenced in the United States, others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the Termodynamic Division was arrested in Germany as part of the Audi engine development group.
Former director Zacheo Jovanni Pamio, Italian, is therefore not protected from extradition and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi has been under German criminal investigation with the Folkswagen participation after the authorities accused the Audi system of the establishment of the European Emission Rules and extended the investigation that had previously been focused on the United States.
The Inclusion of Audi in the investigation can create serious problems to Folkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is the source of an unproportionately large share of Folkswagen ' s income.
In Astrahani, a cafeteria visitor paid for false money
The police received a report from the bank office to find at the list of the funds made from the public, a suspicious banknote nominal of 5000 rubles.
The study conducted at the Expert Criminal Centre showed that it was false.
According to the UMVD of Russia on the Astrahan area, the banknote was paid by one of the cafeteria visitors who bought the shourme.
It should be noted that the tape was not equipped with a tool for determining the validity of the coupons.
The police are currently established by persons involved in the production and acquisition of a fake CBF ticket.
Such crimes are punished by deprivation of liberty for up to 8 years with fines of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the IMD calls on the residents of the Astrahan area to be careful when carrying out financial operations; it is recommended that trade facilities be established to verify the validity of the money obtained.
The astronomers found a planet of hell that even iron can flood.
For the first time, after studying the properties of the giant exoplanet strategy called WASP-121b, the astrophysics were very surprised by its temperature that was able to eradicate iron and other metals.
Specialists noted that the water molecules are so warm in the light of the stars that they have infrared radiation.
The Hubble's telescope marked the lighting of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes water in the atmosphere of the planet to shine infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to so-called " burning jupiters" - gas giants, by size and mass compared to the largest planet of the Solar System, but located ten times closer to the parent star.
For this year, only 1.3 " ground" days are held on the exoplanet, and its gas shell is at nearly 2.500 degrees of Celsia.
Climate change threatens the lavande in Provance.
It became a symbol of Prowans and Southern France, but now it is feared that climate change threatens her.
Labanda has grown worse because of dry weather and insect-related diseases; this has caused the constant headache of scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert from the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Prowance, said: “Lavanda in Provanse is really threatened, because in recent years this plant has felt the effects of climate change: spring and especially rainfall has become much less.
This affects the life of the labanda.
There are also small cyccades jumping on the leaves of insects carrying microbacteria; in very dry weather they become very many."
There's a lot on the map.
Lavanda does not only attract vacations; the oil of labanda is very demanding in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Shas says, "Instead of very long wheels with a large number of colors, we have small, undeveloped, weakened or missing.
So we have less parts of ether oil."
The decisions currently being considered include improving the distribution of water and the slowing of soil, as well as the spraying of plants with the defensive mixture of clay and water, and the delivery of more sustainable to drought.

The words of Medvedev were commented in the State Department
The official representative of the United States Department, Heather Nauert, commenting at the briefing of the words of Prime Minister of RF Dmitri Medvedev, stated the need to find “districts for interaction” with Russia.
She said that such areas should be found to " improve bilateral interaction".
An example of such successful cooperation, Nauert referred to the Syrian Peace Agreement.
We're two nuclear supernationals.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other," said the diplomat.
However, Nauert refused to comment on the statement of Medvedev on the full trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said that, of course, she has the right to speak, but I cannot say anything more about this," said the representative of the State.
Previously, US President Donald Tramp signed a draft law on the exacerbation of sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the head of the Government of RF Medvedev stated that Washington announced a full trade war to Moscow by putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that the United States sanctions would work for decades.
Furthermore, the Prime Minister considers the American exhibition of the Trump.
The missing in the Submoscow of the Bodibilder found on a foreign record of the lost memory
Bodibilder Shamil Hanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on 25 July, under very rigging circumstances: he came out of the car salon to go to the bathroom.
Seven days he was unsuccessfully searched for by acquainted and local people.
And Shamil was found on a strange house in Ramenia.
He was completely naked in his toilet.
The Daguesian sportsman could not explain how he got here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and his passport was missing.
The identity has helped the announcements of his disappearance.
The medical arrivals have reported that Hanmet's partial memory loss and brain trauma, reports the Mash pub.
The sportsmen are probably waiting for other surprises.
Victims who kidnapped Shamil may have already been in his apartment, which was also stolen from.
Oil income of July exceeded 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, oil revenues received at the end of July 2017 exceeded the estimate of 7.4 billion rubs, reports the Ministry of Finance.
The excellence, as explained by the agency, has been primarily due to the higher exchange rate of US dollar to the rubl compared to the average monthly value of June used to evaluate, as well as to the excess of the actual gas delivery and exports of oil products projected by the levels.
"The refusal of oil revenues of the federal budget from the monthly assessment corresponding to the Federal Act on Federal Budget for 2017-2019 is projected in August 2017 by +40.2 billion rubs."
Thus, the total amount of funds to purchase foreign currency in the internal currency market from 7 August to 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion rubs.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of foreign currency will be 2.07 billion rubs.
The Foreign Currency Bank of Russia will be attracted to the purchasing operations.
Each working day during that period, the CB will conclude agreements on the purchase of foreign currency in the organized trades of the Moscow Bank during the trade day.
The acquired foreign currency will be based on the Federal Carriage Accounts in the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes that Mexico is getting more dangerous.
Workers of the weekly newspaper Riodose are usually meeting on Wednesday to discuss the plans for the lighting of recent violence crimes in Sinaloa, related to organized crime, corrupted officials or the continuing military drug dealers.
But today, when they were depressed by their own tragedy, they met to discuss security.
They were told that they should change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed more safe: taking children to the office where they had already dropped the grenade in 2009, or leaving them home.
Security experts wrote on the board hanging in the room, three words: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - no evidence needed, suspicions and internal feelings would be sufficient.
These are drug dealers, policies, businessmen, journalists suspected of their contents in the government or cartels, the whole list of narcotics, which have caused the work of mexican chaos to be dangerous.
Violence does not rest, and among the bodies that are multiplying in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Committee for Protection of journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nyeto took his post in December 2012; 589 people after attacks and threats are under federal protection; and this year at least seven have died in seven states.
Among the last are their publisher and inspirer, the Co-based Riodose Javier Waldes Cardenas.
"The greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Waldez wrote in one of his numerous books about drug-related violence.
His absence feels very sharp, although his presence is a wide picture of Waldes, showing the medium finger, with the "Factory" sign hangs on the Riodose building; two reporters over 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, are wearing shirts on which his smile, the face in his glasses or his firm panama.
The seminar goes less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, their sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although the Office of the Special Federal Prosecutor was organized in 2010 to investigate journalist cases, only two cases have been investigated, according to the Committee for Protection of journalists.
As in the case of the majority of thousands of killings per year related to drug trafficking and organized crime, journalists are rarely suspected.
Riodose journalists insist that they will write about violence in Sinaloa, although they are killed by grief, although around them is much more dangerous.
Without information about the killers, without justice of the security talks at meetings, Ibarra said.
"It's very stupid to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"We don't know the reason, we suspect everyone."
In the morning of 15 May, Waldes left Riodose's office at the capital of Culiakana.
He only passed a few blocks before his red Toyota Corroll was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means the Twelveth River.
The shooter left on his car and broke it nearby.
Waldes was 50 years old.
He had a wife and two adults left.
The hearings are usually rapidly spreading around Culiakan.
But they're almost all silent about Waldes.
Since Guzman was arrested and issued in the United States in January last year, Sinaloa became one of the most bloody fields of the battle in the country, as competitive fractions are fighting to fill the formed vacuum.
Let's not talk about killing one or more people on the streets of Sinaloa every day, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated two floors of mawzoleys of drugs, which are more than homes of many living people.
Forget for a minute that the state of calm is just when one of the cartels takes control of the Naval State with important ports and roads of drug trafficking in the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Waldes knew well about the dangers of his work, Ismael Bohorkes, 60-year-old co-based and Riodose director, was disrupted by the feeling of guilt for his failure to protect a friend.
He thinks the murder was helped with two mistakes.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the competitive cartel fractions that fought with Guzman's sons.
The publication could be angry with the sons; people who were allegedly members of the gang have gathered all the copys of the publications as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he had not forced Waldes to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper was captured, who wrote about the same story.
Waldez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was estimated as a regular deficit in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He was leaving the danger so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter in Norroest and in 2003 he and five colleagues founded Riodose, selling his 50 dollars.
In Sinaloa, "the journalism was impossible without dealing with drugs," said Bohorkes.
In time, the newspaper earned the reputation of bold and honest publication, sales and advertising income.
The journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, but the readers attracted them to read about what no more dared to write.
Eight years after her foundation, Riodose received a prestigious prize of Maria Murs Cabo for reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Waldez won the International Press Freedom Prize for the courage to investigate Mexico's drug trafficking wherever it leads.
He honestly confessed that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ premium.
Trade of drugs in Sinaloa -- "it's a lifestyle," he said in October last year at the Rompivento TV interview.
"You have to take the tasks that lie on you as a journalist, or you're just a fool."
I don't want you to ask me, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you tell me what's going on?"
Riodose's workers miss Waldes, a joker who was arguing like a truck in the port, a friend, a generous hug and counsel, a teacher who knew how to live.
They relied on their order.
He was always supposed to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, bar against the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they're asking: "His love for one-time order was destroyed?"
His death also made them doubt about how better to do his work and remain alive.
"They don't like to know about their wives, children, their legal business and underground airports for drug carriage.
"These things were beyond the line," said Bohorkes.
The result, even in the best times, was the high level of self-conservation and the desire to maintain self-conservation.
We have to trust our instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says the editor of Riodose, Andres Villiareal, is that "the fear can be deceived... and then happens what happened to Javier."
The old rules, he said and others, are no longer acting in Sinaloa -- as in Tamaulipas, Veracross, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mixture of profitable smuggling ways, weak government institutions and corrupt officials.
Landshaft is changing all the time.
The room where Riodose staff were gathered for security training, suddenly it was forbidden to bring mobile phones: a few days earlier, it was known that the spy programmes sold exclusively to Governments were used in Mexico to monitor journalists and public activists.
Outside, two policemen are hiding in the shadows of a tree from a 104-degree heat (40 degrees to Celsia).
They were assigned to the State Government to protect the Riodose office, which was located in a four-third building in the Couliakan Burguas block.
Some journalists were half-laughting whether these policemen were involved in those 50 per cent of the servants of order, for whom the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that de facto was under control of drug trafficker gangs.
The next room, Riodose, counted on three main topics.
It's a murder in Sinaloa's brother of the former champion in the box of Julio Sezar Chaves.
They also had the disclosure of government costs concentrated in the Governor ' s home city.
And there was a group kidnapping of people in one of the most expensive Culiacana restaurants, a neighborhood from the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so we had to be careful when it was time to write that everyone in the city knew that it was the favorite restaurant of drug dealers and authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered on behalf of the policy belonging to the ruling institutional and revolutionary party (PRI), which was dominant at all levels of power during almost the past century.
Several Governors of the PRI have recently been accused of corruption.
Villiareal asked journalists to write about the previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the son of El Chapman slipped off the army.
A few months ago, the readers would have searched for a column of Waldes with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
"We'd have known what happened before," said 46-year-old Villiareal, for his filthy body called El Flaco.
"All communication channels with our sources are broken today."
Valdes's office is now used as a storage store for posters and stickers with protests against the murders of journalists, because the staff have become what they never thought to be: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
The journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posts and went to the local prosecutor's demonstration next morning.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in Michoacan in the west of the country three days after Valdez was killed.
They found the burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
The journalists throughout the country began to speak louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the trips and walls of homes.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, trying to provide international support in the demand of justice in the case of Waldes.
At the meeting with Governor Sinaloa the next day after the murder of Waldes Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
Then she asked her not to give more tasks to light the government, fearing that her anger would damage its objectiveity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "occupied" by organized crime, its co-operators in the Government and the indifferent society.
He wrote in his last book " Narcotics Journalists " that reporters are not just killing drug trafficker gangs; they do so on the orders of politicians and security services in a conspiracy with organized crime.
The Press Protection Committee, Article 19, believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were committed by police and government officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," said Ramirez.
Of course, murders scare people.
Everyone remembers the death of Maria Elizabeth Massias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body found a note written by Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and the earrings were lying next to its head cut off.
Some publications preferred to close as El Norte's newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent Miroslav Britch was killed in March.
Others continue to be like El Manyana from Nuevo Laredo after her leader was killed in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Sudad Juares publicly contacted drugcarders through a drafting article on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists left their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they continue to look at danger on the streets.
And sometimes they were killed, as it was obviously happening to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 with four women in the apartment in Mexico three months after the escape from Veracrus.
Those who remain and continue to work have a daily balance between risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits he's afraid to write about drug dealing.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for printing, the publishers of Riodose sat on the trip next to the office and had a beer when their phones called at the same time.
A series of shootings between gangs and security forces close to the Masatlan court city left, as confirmed, 19 bodies.
The war continued to rise, as it was promised in a series of letters from cartels found in this area.
By sitting on the trip, they gave news on Riodose's website.
The next day, the first page had to be reconstructed.
The sirens were raised nearby -- another shooting in the area.
The Bohorkes saw if they were ready to defend their police guards.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the dead founder of their newspaper, whose average finger was exposed to the perspective of all Sinaloa, Riodose staff continued his case.
"How can you think of shutting up," said Bohorkes, "if the day Javier was killed, the practicer asked me to send her out to report?"
Dinosaur used a camouflage to avoid enemies
At first he seemed to be a statue, although a horror.
Researchers reported that the first unbelievable remnants of a nosorog size found by the Canadian miner have been so well retained that the experts called it "Mona Lisa among dinosaurs".
It was so well stored that they could even determine that the color of his scratched skin was red and brown - and say that he had, in some way, a "familiar past".
The report published in the modern biology magazine described as “the best stored from Tyreofor in the history of findings and one of the best copies of dinosaur in the world”.
This is the recently found copie of nodosaurus living in the middle of the mill period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His unbelievable well-being was amazed by researchers who called him “really great”.
This grass-eating tireophor is the best preserved species in the history of findings, according to articles in National Geographic.
He was found by Sean Fank when he was working at the Millennium Millenium of Sancore near Fort McMurrey, North Albert, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He encountered something that seemed different from the surrounding race, and decided to look more carefully.
The armed was sent to the Royal Tyrrellian Paleontological Museum.
The next six years worked on the discovery of an animal within the earthly depth of 2500 feet (1100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the complete result can be demonstrated.
"It's only a little harder and it's practically possible to believe that he's sleeping," said the leading author Caleb Brown, a scientist of the Royal Tyrrell's Paleontological Museum, where the creation is demonstrated.
“He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-saved copies of dinosaurs, Mona Lisa among dinosaurs.”
Studying his skin, researchers found that it was grass-eating, despite the fact that it was covered by the panciers and reminded of the walking tank, apparently, had been a significant danger from meat dinosaurs.
This mighty dinosaurus armor used red-white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as a protective paint, which is also used by many animals of our day.
This would allow him to combine quickly with the environment and avoid enemy meetings, say experts, assuming he was hunted by bigger dinosaurs.
This is the creature aged 110 million years of age relating to the Nodosaurus family was widely enlightened in the print in May, and now is on the exposition in the Royal Tyrrella Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and gave him the name Borealopelta markmitchelli to the museum lab of Mark Mitchell, one of the participants of a group spent more than 7,000 hours behind his scratch.
The incredible preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and the international group of scientists to document the painting and form of garlic and pancil plates on his body.
They found a protective color, a widespread protective method in the kingdom of animals, which means that the top of the creature was darker to the bottom of it.
Although the protective color is well distributed, the discovery has become unexpected because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is significantly greater than the size of living animals now with a protective decoration.
It could be assumed that the dinosaur was so actively hunted by meathole dinosaurs that evolution had preferred to mask the confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals with protective decoration — such as deer, zebra or armor — are significantly smaller and are more accessible, which indicates that nodosaurus had to fight seriously for survival.
“The serious threat of predators to a massive, powerful dinosaur pancircury has shown how dangerous the predator dinosaurs of the Mel period were," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the garlic of dinosaur also indicates that his skin had to be red and brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the preserved content of its food tract to find out what he had eaten during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where he drowned and backed down the bottom of the ocean.
At the time in Alberta there was as warm as in the southern Florida, and the rivers and oceans were likely to spread far further to the land than now.
“This nodosaurus is indeed observing that it is fully covered by the preserved leather skin, and, at the same time, he was fully preserved in three dimensions by preserving the original animal form," said Brown.
“As a result, the animal looks almost the same as it looked in the early mellow period.
There is no need to be particularly intensified to rebuild it, but a little bit to be stuck, and it is practically possible to believe that he is sleeping.”
The flesh period is an era when giant teropodes, meat-eating dinosaurs standing on two feet were walking around the earth.
Although the most wonderful of them, the tirannosaurus of Rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, a tireopher could be hunted by one of his horrible ancestors.
They include acrocantosaurus, a monster length of 38 feet (11.5 meters) weighing six tons.
Scientists whose recent openings are published in the Modern Biology magazine believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after death and mumified.
The creature was found by Sean Fank when he was working in Millennium Millenium's mine near Fort McMurrey in northern Albert, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to the museum staff, it is the most well preserved tireophor in the world, along with the skin and the pancier, and it is aimed at, from the cock to the bone of the bone.
In the mean, these substances reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kilograms).
Their characteristic marks were two twenty-third slippers from the shoulder.
Researchers believe that this grass-eating tireophor has been hard on the fact that Canada is now until the floating river has taken it into the open sea.
But the submarine of the dinosaur kept his pancircuit with precisely to the smallest details.
The stone remnants of this specific copy have been so well stored that the skin’s remains still cover the buggy pancircuits along the dinosaur’s skull.
As Michael Greško wrote in the article for National Geographic, the preservation of “relevant, such as winning in the lottery”.
The longer I look at him, the more impressive he seems.
The stone remains of the skin are still covering the buggy pancircuits that swing the animal’s skull.
His right front leg is stretched along the side, five fingers on it are turned up.
I can count the squirrels on his suitcase."
Michael Saacashvili has been able to get to Poland without documents
Michael Saacashvili, former leader of Georgia, and then the Odesian area in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
He did so without a document that confirms his identity and nationality.
The arrival of Saacashvili was reported by the Polish Television of the Republic, which placed a video on its YouTube channel.
Saacashvili spoke at events on the anniversary of the Warsaw rebellion against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to speak in this language, he had to speak English through the Polish translation.
During his speech, the politician touched themes of Georgia's cooperation with Poland and spoke of Ukraine.
The fact that Ukraine's migration service deprived his citizenship, the oppressive politician found out in the United States.
How exactly he was able to make a transatlantic trip without documents yet unknown.
Previously, the former Governor of the Odessa area, Michael Saacashvili, stated that his signature on the survey for Ukraine's citizenship was fake.
Politics emphasized that he didn't fill any surveys.
Date of investigation on the case of Weinzicher and Olhowik extended until January
The period of preliminary investigation on the owner of the Renova Group of Eugene Olhowik and heads of the " T " Plus " , Boris Weinzicher was extended until 2 January 2018.
Thursday, 3 August, the Basman Court addresses the prolongation of the accused domestic arrest.
The representative of the CC at the meeting reported the decision to last extend the preliminary investigation period.
"The specific complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need for extraction and expertise of a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigations in the territory of several PF subjects," he said.
He added that suspects were regularly bribed to the Comi leadership.
Their total size is estimated at least a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinzicher, Olhowik, as well as former WHO leader of "Complex Energy Systems" Michael Slobodin, who led the Company "Impel" by 5 September, were transferring bribes to the highest officials of the Republic of Komi for the establishment of maximum benefits of warm and electricity and for the establishment of favourable business conditions.
Weinzhier and Olhowik were detained, staged at Siktivkar and arrested for two months, and Slobodin hid the investigation and was declared a federal search.
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Which streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shaken.
Only a day after the arrival in New York, the descendant of St. Louis sat on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb by seeing the Facebook tape on the phone.
She's been pushing on the post of someone from high school.
It said: "The police have just killed an eighteenth-year-old child, and he is still lying in the middle of the street."
Noting that none of her tapes had taken this information confused, she closed the Facebook and opened a twitter.
There was a lot of variations in her tape with no one @TheePharoah.
The Reper from the Great St. Louis in a real-time regime highlighted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a picture of Brown's lifeless body, spread in the street where it would be four hours.
"It's wildness," thought Ferrell.
But death wasn't something new for her and her circle.
She postponed the phone, and later tonight she returned to the Tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the signal tape and the screaming people and the man who claimed that he was Brown's father, who was plaqued by saying: “Ferguson's policeman just killed my unarmed son! ”
She viewed the direct transmission of police officers in front of a group protesting with a lazy dog.
On the other video, the other policeman said, "I'll kill all of you... animals!"
"It is a non-standard situation," Ferrell then said on its own memories.
"It's not such a murder as those we're used to and which we can call typical.
At that point, I felt shocked.
I was angry and crying."
She took a ticket to the back flight and flew home the next day.
After landing at 11 a.m., she took her six - year - old daughter from her father’s house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next almost three years has become a theme of the new documentary film “Which streets?” that will come to the screen on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, strength and persistence in terms of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrell traveled to Ferguson with her daughter dressed in flowers and veins under color, they recalled a conversation that had led a number of times before this morning, “the experience of black people and their situation.”
She recalls saying: “Do you remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed?
We are now going to Ferguson, because the policeman killed an eighteenth-year-old boy, and that was wrong."
"I couldn't keep it," Ferrell said later.
"What's happening today is the culmination of what's happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it and grow up on it.
It should not only be well dealing with activism and organization but also understanding the various levels of experience and their provisions and what we must do to become free to be free.
Even if I can provide her with an environment where she does not face herself with obvious racism, she's nothing different from any other black girl.
I feel that I would have done a bad favor to her if I had prevented her from this."
When they arrived in Ferguson, they first stopped in South Florissant Road, on the roadway from the police station, which became something like a chamber camp, while activists were waiting for reports of the ultimate non-conviction of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who was cooking lunch packages.
They were collecting packages and helping to distribute them to protesters.
A little bit in the consciousness of Ferrell has a new type of activism.
"My activism has changed fully after 9 August," she said, noting that as a student of the University of Missouri-St Louis, she was president of the Association of Sanitary Students, representatives of national minorities, and was engaged in food justice and inequality in the field of health among black communities.
“I had no experience with the organizer.
This came by itself."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaa Folayan, one of her companions at the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that she and her chief operator, Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer, were just "willing to document" events.
Ferrell came to mind, "Do you want to document or try to find a story that can be played?"
This skepticalism was accompanied by numerous people, often white, who arrived in the community in order to benefit from its pain and endurance.
As she explained in the recent interview of Folayan, “We heard that the voices of people who were born and grew up in Ferguson did not fall into the center of attention, and we wanted to do so otherwise”.
Folayan has already joined her co-sponsor Damon Davis, a local artist known for its activism on the issues of death sentence.
Its participation awakened the empathy for the Ferrell project and six local residents with whom the team of the " Whose streets " had been in contact for years after Brown was killed.
"The documentary film does not speak for us or to us, it is our own talk," said Davis.
"It was most important to me as these people will be represented, because this is how I will be represented."
Although the project was aimed at not focusing on Ferrell's experience, it was to show that the movement “is not about a rescue leader, but how the community is united”, as Folayan said, it was the most openest part of the film.
As a result, the Fairrell's personal aspects of her life have been shown in "Which streets?", for example, how she fell in love and married to her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said, laughing to tell me how I first saw a prepared product.
"But I realized that when you do such work and manage black people, there must be some level of vulnerability."
Furthermore, Ferrell's history again discusses and stresses the role of a black homosexual woman in the broader context of the "The Black Life" movement.
Two of the three founders of the motion -- those who created the #BlackLivesMatter in social networks after the killing of a black teenager, Travon Martin, in 2012, are homosexual.
"The black homosexual women in leadership support all this movement," says Ferrell. "And all because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all these burdens."
Folayan agreed with that claim, noting that “the movement, in fact, is supported by black women and many homosexual black women”.
However, she insisted that “is not a case of positive discrimination” and that Ferrell was not elected by the central character of the film because of its distinct characters.
"She was the person who woke up that energy," she said.
“Of the other hand, it is not a coincidence that it was on the first plan, because when ”
We can feel its energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, there have been no filmcams for a long time, but complicated racial relations between the community and the police remain.
The Ferrell will be at the test time for closing the road during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of a place called a home, just "Bardak".
She's still holding up for the speech she learned when she walked out of Ferguson's streets three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Two El Salvadorian footballers disqualified for US players
El Salvador's footballists, Henry Romero and Darwin Seren, have received long disqualifications for non-portional behavior.
During the fourth-final game of the Golden Cup of Confederation of North and Central America and the Caribbean countries (KONACAF) the El Salvadorians bite American players.
The first one was Henry Romero's protector.
The El Salvadorian bite the attacker Josie Altidor, and then he was stuck behind his chest.
The semi-defense of Seren, when the coal was delivered in his fine area, bite the U.S. Protector Omar Gonzales.
As a result, Romero was disqualified at three matches, and Seren was six.
The meeting itself concluded by the winning of Americans with account 2:0, transmitted by Goal.com.
Similarity: Artist creates portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the center of the hall in the Gallery of Friedman in New York, there are white, black and brown faces of people who are inexperienced.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist of Heather Dewey Harborg from cheek and hair cuts sent to her Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent circumcisions from Fort Levenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst is 35-year-old for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams on WikiLeaks' website.
The new exhibition, which appeared on 2 August, is called "Evolving a similarity".
This is the result of a two-year commission between Dewey Harborg, whose art is uniting technology, information and art, and Manning, a woman transsexual and a famous disident whom Barack Obama had mitigated the sentence only three days before the end of his presidency.
By analyzing the DNA computer programme obtained from Manning and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of persons who might have such a genome, Deuie Harborg created a deep, although difficult for perception of the manifestation of not only DNA plastic data, in different ways of interpretation and inherent determination of these interpretations, but also the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born with Bradley Edward, but since her teenage age, openly said that she considered herself a woman, was sentenced by 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Act of Spying, Computer fraud and thief.
Her photos were not available in prison, so only one photograph was known: a grain-white black-white self, on which Manning, in the platin's shadow of a feather, was obviously embarrassed, sitting behind the car; with that photograph, it became associated.
In 2015, Duy Harborg successfully completed its 2012 project " Visions of strangers " .
In it, the artist produced portraits of unknown people by means of judicial evidence of the type of oaks and gum rubber, pulling the DNA out of this garbage and creating images of how these people could look.
And then she got an e-mail from the Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dewey Hagborg at the preliminary show of a new press exhibition.
At that time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait of her DNA.
In such an unusual way, the artist and her muse prisoner became friends on the listing and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote the book of the Shoiled Images comics, the illustrated Shauli Canungo, who pictured the way the president would mitigate Chelsea's punishment in the future and that could visit the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning only a few days after the exit of the book was a pleasant surprise after seven heavy years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong and that the exhibition is opened right now when Donald Tramp declares war to people revealing secret information in the government and invents new ways to burn the enemy on Twitter, which it is intended to mitigate.
When Dewey Harborg asked about the coincidence of this all over time, she said "nothing happens accidentally."
In the statement of the artist written on the wall of the gallery, the huge signature of Manning below (with a heart instead of a point above "i" in its name) calls upon the end of "automatic division on the basis of sex, race, sexual orientation and culture".
On the opposite side, its mitochondrial DNA, long gussenic from the pencils C, G and A.
Includes 200 letters (or nucleotypes, as scientifically expressed by the artist), Dewey-Harborg hoped to show how remarkably we are, in any case, similar to our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey-Harborg; its 2007 "False Memories" is also presented here.
"The DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories here."
The last part of the exhibition in the same room is the above-mentioned comic book.
It has Manning, like King-Cong, appeared over the United States Correct Casarm Building with a loud speaker in its hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win."
"So never shut up."
"This is the direct quote from the letter that she wrote to me," said the artist who welcomes us from Philadelphia.
"I still have ants on my skin when I'm talking about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally -- as it was predictable in the comicles, but when it comes, it will be welcomed by masks in the center of the room, its own genome simulacles gathered as a crowd of protesters.
It is also intentionally done, as all on the exhibition, up to the height (5'2, Manning growth), on which the pencil was drawn by the genetic gaplo-groups.
"I'd rather hang them on the walls, but now I'd like them to look like a crowd of people," says Dewey Harborg about the portraits.
"I wanted them to be like a mass movement that formed around Chelsea, as a movement behind her release."
Professor of the Northwest University and Oxford University Officer is looking for police charges for murder
According to the police, there is a national burglary on a professor of the Northwest University and a staff member of the University of Oxford, who are searched as suspects for the fact that a luxurious number in Chicago was found a slaughterman.
According to the Cook Court's records, on Monday, warrants were detained for predicted murder without the right to exemption from the 40-year-old Windem Latem and the fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, the 26-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after he had been injured by multiple wounds.
The warning issued by the Chicago police office indicates that the body was found on 27 July.
The police received a call, they arrived in the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found a victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranlo was pronounced dead at the scene of the crime, and now the detectives are investigating death from knife wounds, considering her as a murder, while the police are looking hardly for two suspects.
Latham has been an adjunctor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwest University since 2007.
Alan K. Cabadge, Vice-President of the University of Communications, reported in an e-mail statement that Latham was at administrative leave and that he was not allowed to attend the Northwest University campus.
"It is now a criminal case investigated by the authorities, and the Northwest University is cooperating with the consequence," said Cabadge.
Warren is a senior staff member of the Oxford University Financial Authority.
The representative of the university and Somerville College reported in an e-mail statement: “We have communicated with the British police and are willing to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. investigative bodies.”
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues were in shock and wanted him to surrender.
The Chief of Chicago Police Management Anthony Gulhelmi said that he strongly advised suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have allegations of their location, but our attempts to find them are increasing”, said Guillemi.
According to Guillema, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find suspects.
According to Gulhelmi, the police had called the Administrator of the Grand Plaza Building, who had just received a mysterious report that something happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene awful.
Guillelmi said that it was not clear whether the incident occurred on 27 July itself.
He said the video cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latem and the victim were linked," said Gulhelmi.
The Grand Plaza Guide has issued an appeal to the lodgers in which it was reported: “The police are currently working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information on the victim and considering a number of motives, including the possible home incident.”
Russian Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the WADA road map soon."
Russian Vice-Prime Minister Vitalij Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for resuming the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be implemented soon.
"A certain stage in compliance with the requirements has been carried out, Russia has had the right to plan and conduct tests with UKAD (UKAD Anti-Dining Agency).
The VADA road map was updated accordingly," said Mutko on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the VADA road map on the reconciliation of the Code, which lists the conditions for resuming the work of RUSADA and was recently published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could be difficult for Russia.
"All was announced, everything will be completed.
The results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (MOC) and VADA soon," he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that the Russian pending structures should publicly recognize the results of the VADA ordered by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren investigation, which claimed that the doping in Russian sport was controlled by the State.
With regard to this issue, Mutko said, "We are investigating, because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programmes, and we will not admit what has not been."
He reiterated the words of Vitalia Smirnova, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
The same morning, in an interview with the Russian Rsport edition, Smirnov recognized the previous problems in the Russian anti-doping structures, but added: " We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain dispute positions and provisions.
No one will accept this report without requirement," Smirnov added.
VADA removed Russia from the doping control in November 2015 after the doping scandal.
However, in June this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate the testing under the monitoring of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following the visit to the Moscow Office of the organization in July, the Director-General of VADA, Olivier Neggli, stated that Russia " moved in the right direction" to restore its work.
Fire in the 79th floor tower in Dubai
A huge fire that took place in one of the world’s highest housing buildings, the Torch Tower, was collapsed, transmitted by Reuters.
It is noted that firemen have managed to deal with all flames of burning by 4.00 at local time (3.00 MSC).
Local authorities reported that the incident was not affected by anyone.
During the fire gas, the streets near the sky were closed.
The reasons for what happened are not yet known.
Previously reported that in Dubai the 79th floors of the Torch, which is one of the highest buildings in the world, was burned.
All inhabitants were evacuated in time.
Insensitive Booze's clothing of fans: pants not covering cowards
The scandal leading reality show "Dom-2" Olga Buzova hit the viewers of the European Plus Live Festival by dancing in the pants.
In the eyes of thousands of fans, the newly presented singing duet with Nastie Kudrie fulfilled the song "We'll be hot."
Both girls went to the scene in provocative pants, sewed in such a way that it appeared to be a lower singing underwear.
The pants of Buzov and Kudry were made.
It has previously been reported that changes in Buzov's appearance have been commented by an expert of a Moscow plastic surgery clinic.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported on Friday, 4 August, by Radio 4 news, with reference to foreign media.
He said that the Russian authorities were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO gensek also criticised Russia for the situation with Crime and "destabilization in the east of Ukraine".
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia, however, would be possible, but the further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Previously on Thursday, the President of the United States, Donald Tramp, stated that the relationship between the United States and Russia was at a dangerous low level, and accused the US Congress.
The Metro of Ecaterinburg acquires a new payment method
In October, a banking card will be paid to the Ecaterinburg Metropolitan, stated Director of OAO, Paul Vedernikov, in an interview with the District newspaper.
Our goal is to introduce a soccer championship in 2018 as well as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, the Neighbourhood and Novosibirska.
"We want the mundial guests from other countries to be able to use the metropolitan with their banking cards without acquiring chetons and not standing in the turn," he said.
The startups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Ehrette wanted to evaluate the level of satisfaction among its e-commerce startup staff, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often spit, useless, or worse, unexplicit.
And even though she promised anonymity, some officers did not trust the process.
“He has never been sequential and objective”, said Ehrett, managing 75 people in San Francisco, who have dealt with electronic haircare trade.
It therefore requested assistance from third parties.
A new type of startups in the field of work with staff that helps companies to find out how their staff feel.
Developing and licensing the software designed by the measurement of staff involvement, they allow companies to make express inquiries, contact certain teams and demographic groups, to offer staff anonymity and hot lines for complaints, and in some cases allow the informants to mine the top management and direct directives.
"We now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-based and Glint's chairman from Redwood City, whose analytical programmes are used by companies to measure the involvement of staff.
Errett said that she had achieved more understanding of what her staff think and feel in three years of use of Glint.
In addition to the express inquiries and surveys of certain teams, the product offers a heat map of the company and shows in a supervisory form which units have more complaints and which managers have low approval ratings, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are aware that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become another Uber, which was involved in the scandal when the former officer published a post in the blog in which he described the aggressive situation in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For startups such as Glint, it is the desire to control the situation as an opportunity for profiting business.
On the Internet portal, “Let's talk about the payments” dedicated to financial technologies, the global governance, regulation and conformity industry could cost more than $18,7 billion by 2020.
The Convercent launch from Denver, Colorado, helping companies to prevent and identify bad behaviour, noted a small increase in interest and activities earlier this year in the fall of the reputation of Uber.
The Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
The Uber has recently appeared among clients.
Like Glint, the Convercent allows companies to send individual staff reviews, collect confidential responses in real-time mode and review the heat maps of the problems zones.
It also provides a hot line for anonymous text messages that allows staff to report bad behaviour.
And if the top manager is touched, the complaints go straight to the directive.
"The Court of Public Opinion has taken over the power of the inspectors," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of the Convercent company.
If it turns out that the company is treated badly with staff or acts unethically, even if the inspector does not interfere, the company may face expensive consequences in the form of boycots by customers, the flow of staff and the judicial courts, the Queenlan reported.
“Ruby Tuesday”, a network of restaurants where more than 25,000 employees worked in 500, used Convercent for over a year to make sure that the staff are aware of the rules and procedures and suggest a simple way to contact the company's head office.
Earlier, if the staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to search for a phone number or email of the head office, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be serious.
It was often a scary and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, head of the Ruby Tuesday legal administration, saying that there was no normal way to follow the complaints of staff.
Now that the company is using the Convercent Service, problems that have previously been hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states -- such as discrimination, aquaculture and unfair labour payments, you can quickly find and take care of them.
"I can draw closer to the full, comprehensive understanding of the situation of staff," said Vitrano, who runs the Risk Management Group, Ruby Tuesday.
“And we protect our shareholders from trials with staff.”
According to Quinland, companies began to deal more seriously with ethics, values and involvement of staff in 2002, after the accounting company Arthur Andersen had crashed because of ethical violations resulted in the case of Enron.
But only when “social networks have received mass dissemination”, companies realized that they would not be able to keep their dirty underwear from the viral spread in the network.
“Before the use of technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
The Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking regular wages from companies for their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity to endorse the venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, the Convercent received funding of $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, resulting in a total capital of $47 million.
Glint received 10 million dollars in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, resulting in the total capital of the company of $60 million.
These investments are not surprising if it takes into account the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing volume of research shows that today's staff expect more jobs than they were before.
The markets with severe competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, are just a minimum.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in companies, they feel that they are heard and that the work they are doing is a result, they are more trying to make such a company successful”, said Nina McQuin, vice-president for global benefits and satisfaction in the LinkedIn company, where Convercent and Glint are used.”
Investors get income when businesses from their wallets go well; business is good when staff are loyal and involved.
If the third-party ' s analytical instruments promise to increase the loyalty and involvement of staff, it is not surprising that they find support.
Cultural experts in the workplace claim that the staff involvement data is important.
But the data are useless until the company's guardians take action.
In fact, if the company requests back-link staff, it can make an impression that changes have been ruined.
And if the changes do not come fast enough or not, there may be disappointment, and the staff will lose their interest.
"If you are going to ask for 4000 proposals, you should be prepared to make 4,000 talks," said Russell Rat, the consultant of the Officer's Officer Cotter International, who had to see companies making a mistake too relying on data collection.
"Why, if you don't go to the end, the staff will think: ‘ Did you really hear me?
You don't care?
And if you don't care, why should I not care?"
According to Ehrrett, the company Madison Reed, which is currently conducting monthly staff surveys, is able to take action on the same day when someone reports the problem with the Glint.
And, after collecting reconnections from staff dissatisfied by decision-making and communication quality, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to address the problems.
The Ruby Tuesday company is receiving new knowledge of its staff and hopes that in a long-term perspective, these knowledge will help more effectively maintain staff in the industry known as high-level personnel.
"If you do not try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
If you're losing people, you're losing customers.
And if you're losing customers, you're losing companies.
In Barnaule, a new asfalt is opened in the Rednoarmean Avenue
Barnaule had taken cardinal measures to address the cause of asphalt failures in the Krasnoarmean Avenue.
The place where the gaps of the recently embedded portion (the crossing with the Youth Street) were twice raised, it was decided to "recover".
Recall, a small area of the road near the tramway routes was caused by the land in the area of unemployed network.
According to the Vice-President of the City Committee on Road Management, Management, Transport and Communications, Ivan Harmat will conduct a detailed survey and elimination of infringements.
Depending on its results, necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected to require reconstruction and concretion of non-house communications.
This is reported on the official site of the country capital.
The team of Bruins has to work longer because the National Student Sports Association has cancelled training twice a day
Time approaches the eleventh evening; the California University of Footballers in Los Angeles is delayed to talk on one side of the new training fields of the team located in the campus.
Some of them pulled their shirts, shining their backs from sweat after the tense day of the sports camp.
For many players, the teams are a break in the middle of the day.
The players recorded for summer classes will be sent back to rooms after three hours of training to prepare for final examinations, and next morning they will return to the Football Centre of Wasserman for a meeting at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned on Tuesday, the trainer of the team of Bruins Jim Mora said: “The next three days of these boys are waiting for meat.”
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the load for players, actually extended their working day, at least until the examinations were completed on Friday.
The first three trainings of the California University team in L.A. were therefore appointed at 7:15 a.m. to put them in a thick schedule of players.
A side effect from the lack of two training a day has become more days with one training, and Bruins moves the beginning of the camp for almost a week compared to the past year and conducts training during the summer school for the first time in the six seasons of the Sea in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they have to conduct 18 trainings until 20 August, before starting official preparations for the first game in the season against the Texas University of A&M in September.
Mora said that it supported the modification of the rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that another item has occurred in the density of the players.
"In three or four days we give them this huge burden, it is a serious test," said Mora.
"And they just overcome it, they work, they're great guys.
I think that when we live until Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
When the camp ends, the University of California in L.A. will train closed; this is a difficult task, since its fields are directly visible from the nearby parking and from the neighbouring Laskin Centre, a expensive hotel, which has already been bombed with footballs over the defensive network behind the gate.
The Bruins players should take the hotel from these weekends, but Mora allows that when the rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
"We will have security," said Mora.
"It's a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger, assuming anyone could take off the room, sit there and record the training on the video.
If you have a tape of training, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security at parking lot 8.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan."
All victims of the terrorist attack in Petersburg are expelled from hospitals
All victims in the Metro in St. Petersburg are expelled from hospitals in April.
This was reported in the press service of the Vice-Guverner Anna Mitianina.
According to the end of July, three people remained in the stations, transmitted by the TV Centre.
Recall, the explosion in St. Petersburg's metropolitan has passed on on 3 April of the current year.
Bomba was bombed by a terrorist-dealer Akbarjon Jalilov.
15 people were killed as a result of the terrorist, as well as the executor.
In the criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, were arrested.
Recall, in advance, Rossenger recommended that the Petersburg metropolitan review the plan of transport security activities, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook strengthens the fact-awaiting in the fight against fake news
Facebook would frequently send texts suspicious of miscrimination, independent experts, and show their conclusions under the original posts, said on Thursday the largest social network of the world, which is trying to combat so-called Fairy News.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to identify possible mixtures, send them to check and perhaps show the results of the fact-checking under the original post.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main ways of spreading so-called fake news, which many believed to have influenced the presidential elections of 2016 in the United States.
This issue is also actively debated in Europe after the French voters were misleading false communications before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany before September's elections, they stated the support of the plan to punish social networks unless they were quickly removing the posts of hatred.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German Facebook reported the testing of a new fact-Cheking algorithm that was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"Besides seeing what messages are disputed by independent checkers, people want to have a broader context to make reasonable judgments about what they read and what they are shared," Sarah Sue, the Facebook Tape Manager, wrote.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the function of " linked articles" and work on other changes in the newsbar to address the problem of fake news.
Create a comic novel: One castle in English history
In the past, the small castle of Scotney was taken in the Squeeze music video and served as a harbor for Margaret Tatcher in the 1970s and 80s.
But 700 years from his comfortable place in the valley of Buel in Kent County, he was watching a storming history around, and now he inspired Jamie Rhodes, a yorkshire of land hair and a tendency to historical documents, a novel comic book.
"I think it's so beautiful to see a man who died 300 years ago," he said.
"You feel so personal when you keep that letter in your hand."
The Castle in England covers the period from the mid-century to the ewardian era and describes the families living in Scotney; every history is illustrated by one of the young British artists, Isaac Lenkewich, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rhodes based on archive data: in 2014 he wrote "Mrtwhole teeth and other stories" - a collection on the papers of the British Library; this project suddenly touched it to the depth of the soul.
"I could just be thrived by a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written by a double agent working for Jacobs in the 1700s," he said.
"This is his fingerprint."
And the letters always smell smoke, because there was a fire for lighting.
And in 300 years, in the future, you feel like you're there too.
Oh, how I love the archives!"
For a man who is so passionate for old papers, to receive support from the National Fund and the English Art Council and to live in a castle for four months ((Fearly, I have been a little accommodated there) it seems too good to be true.
Rhodes has been studying the new Victorian castle for days, walking through the archives and examining numerous treasures of property and old things -- such as the heads of hyen on walls or bottles, centuries laying down.
He was walking through the park and on the ruins of the old castle, talking to forests, gardeners, and sometimes with artists working on illustrations to his book.
Then at night, he was drinking whiskey and sitting down to write.
The history of the castle of Scotty was not very explored because the National Fund received full access to it only in 2006 when the last successor, Elizabeth Hassie, died.
When Rhodes arrived there ten years later, his staff were just starting to deal with the archive, which he described as "the aristocrats who had been falling down to the shelter for centuries."
The journals, the letters of the times of the British Empire, the maps showing who possessed, "You think the land disputes are boring," said Rhodes, but there were two families fighting for this coast.
It's happening, guys!"
In some stories, the castle collector becomes an extensive point for broader searches in English history: for example, in Worker, the hero departs from the built castle to join the Royal Revolution of 1381.
"There are information on the rebellion that happened in the castle in 1380, in the book entitled "Knights of Kent and Sassex family," said Rhodes.
"The Christian rebellion began in these places, and I thought the rebellion was the right beginning.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other stories are strongly linked to the history of the castle, for example, the Priest, in which it relates to the priest of Jesusuite, whom the family of Darrelov hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or the Contrabandist, the smuggler of the 18th century, Arthur Darrell, who believed to have instructed his own funeral by loading a trumpet of stones (this was discovered several years later when the tomb was dignted).
Darrels are the loved Rhodes family of all who were living in Scotney: "The gentlemans seemed to be a perfect liar, have always been in debt and waste money for what they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darryl's men have solved their debt problems, marrying rich older women - I imagine them as a company of cute boys who can care for heirs of great states."
After the end of the work in the Rhodes Castle, he is looking for other possibilities for a unique writer experience.
He lived two weeks in the Finnish deaf, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elijamjaki, a place where the sanatorium was in the early 20th century, and then he grew up again in the forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he said.
"I felt like that, damn it, I have to go back to real life."
Fifteen biggest banks choose Russia.
The Russian Bank Association Conflict (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, WTB, WTB-24, Alpha-Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhozbank, Binbank and FC Opening, seven other credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, at least 80 per cent of the market will be shared with the ARB.
However, this is not just an exit -- all banks claiming a breakdown with the ARB have negotiated with another public organisation that combines credit institutions, the Association of the Regional Banks of Russia, which is headed by the known Politics Anatoli Aksakov, the Chairman of the Committee on the Financial Market, recognised, by the outcome of the last session and the most effective leader of the Thinking Committee and the Deputy on the number of drafted laws.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was held during a discussion at the Council of the Federation, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new draft laws, in particular proposing the new classification of banks depending on the size of the constitutional capital.
Then Garegin Tosunjan, President of the ARB, stated that the Association considered that the biggest banks had been adopted in favour of the biggest banks that thus attempted to limit the capabilities of small and medium banks in regions by overtaking their clientship.
Among other claims was the criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunian, did not always justify the revocation of licences from some banks, which, indeed, followed the objection by the representative of the CB: many bank-related managers, in particular the External Prombank, were involved in the ARB leadership.
Apparently, this exchange of inter-exclusive views in very sensitive relations with the main banking regulator and has become a clear reason for the 15 largest banks, in contingency with the ARB policy, to begin preparing for the accession of the Russian Association, noting that the “effectiveness of the ARB work is at a low level and the constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually carried out”.
The cartridges will be better
What's the end of the case?
Answer immediately the main issue that is arising at the smallest conflict or in a banking sphere or nearby: nothing threatens the investors, rather, to the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Heads the “Russia” Anatoli Aksakov, known for its vaccine in all of the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional in the Central Bank: almost all BC leadership is present at annual association activities and all the significant legislative initiatives of the regulator ' s regulator ' s regulator ' s expert assessments.
It is obvious that there are no special shocks in the staff-organization plan.
No doubt, the ARB is in an urgent financial and management situation after such powerful and powerful participants with their contributions and lobby capabilities will be lost.
However, this older organization - established in 1991 - the banking community ' s interests - has a great potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the scope of money-credit treatment as a whole.
It is not possible to say that also in the Russian Association with the widespread arms are prepared to accept under any conditions of new members, according to the response of its manager, Anatolia Aksakova ("may wish too much"), which was still 21 July in the press centre of the parliamentary newspaper, said that " literally the representatives of the ARB banks asked me to consider the possibility of increasing the capacity of our Association " Rossia " .
Their proposals are to strengthen the vote of bankers in the Association Council and to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiating process, the proposals of both parties are being examined, the agenda for an extraordinary assembly, which will take place in Sochi in the middle of September under the international banking forum.
That's where we'll be determined.
Furthermore, Anatolius Aksakov stressed that “not held behind the chair” had called the potential new leader of the updated Association “Russia” Georgia Luntowski, who left the post of the Vice-President of the Central Bank in September, highly emphasizing its business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatolius Aksakov, who is currently resting in Crime, plans for one day to abort the vacation and arrive in Moscow, at an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association of Russia, with a view to considering the agenda for the extraordinary meeting of the “Russia”.
Cars with gas engines to large towns of Russia will not be limited
The Vice-Chairman of Mintrans Nikolai Asaul stated that, in contrast with the media, the entry of the vehicles with a gas engine into the large towns of Russia is not yet limited.
This is a radical form of our concept.
Our concept that we need to gradually increase the environmental class.
And there's a concept to go to zero emissions right away.
I don't think we're technically ready for that.
But the question is, from what year?
That's a slozzing phrase, let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Are we gonna close the whole city?
"In 20 years, I don't know, maybe that's what's going to happen," says Prime of the Minister's words.
Previously, the Reports reported that by 17 August, Vice-Prime Minister Arkadia Dvorkovic was assigned to explore the proposals for the possible options of the master of electric transport submitted to the Government by the Director of PAO CAMAZ, Sergei Kogagin.
The paper suggests that the use of VAT vehicles in large cities and in the places.
Washington is changing the rules of receiving a grincard.
According to the media, President Donald Tramp said that the new U.S. immigration plan would be adopted, changing the rules of obtaining the grincard.
The plan provides to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for the provision of temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The draft bill will be discussed in two Congress Chambers.
"The law will reduce poverty, increase salary and save billions of dollars to taxpayers, and will do so for the change in how the United States issues funds to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide advantages to candidates who own English have money that allow them to maintain themselves and have skills that will benefit our economy," Tramp said, according to the US media.
Sex robots' appearance is real, and it should be anxious for us.
We failed to think that 2017 could not be worse, a new report on technological success in the production of sex robots.
Yeah.
Sex robots are now in the center of attention.
The Responsible Workshop Fund (FRR) recently issued a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharky, the earned professor of robotics and artificial intellectual intelligence of the University of Sheffield and the FRR co-organizer, we must address their appearance seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of robot eyes, the shape of boobs and the type of nails.
"People are hiking about this, but the companies are already sending them to consumers, and we will soon see them much more," Sharky said at the presentations of the new report.
Modern sex puppets have evolved from their pushing companions in robots with silicone skin, warm to scrap, and with almost human replicas managed by artificial intellect.
The users can also "construct" their robots on their own taste by choosing everything from the color of the eyes and the form of boobs of robot to the form and colour of nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "person" compared to which the Stepford Woman would seem very progressive is even more concerned.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot company allows users to adjust the quality of robots that they find attractive, for example, shameful.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by "True Companion", which are delivered with already programmed individuality -- such as "Cold Farra" makes an impression of shameful, and "Dick Wendy" has a "crashful" character.
"Roxxxy Gold has a nature that is perfectly approaching yours," says the True Companion website.
So she loves what you love, and does not love what you do not like, and so on.
She's changing her mood during the day as a real man!
She can want to sleep or talk, or she can be in the mood!
There is a lot of concern in the appearance of sex robots -- not in the latest because they replace real human relations -- but most of all concerns the subjected attitude of a woman, the association with rape that causes the control of the Cold (read: opposition) of Fara.
Roxxxy is compared to the vibrator only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) has a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?", says the site.
But these sex robots are not just fetish or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity indicates something darker and deeper in our culture, to derogation from the ideal of gender equality to the desire of sex with submission as an optional addendum.
Most men will not buy sex robots, and although the FRR marks their growing popularity, they remain on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery may be very instructive about the meaning of the age in which we live.
And many people are not stupid or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
This is not a coincidence that these complex sex robots appeared just when women's rights worldwide were threatened when the President of the White House was praised by women.
The most scary in the "Rassca servant" television is not graphical images, scratched bodies and exhausted eyes, just how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an overwhelming, but now it doesn't seem so big.
The aim of the sex robot industry is to achieve such physically similarity to real women (only with porn star proportion), which technology allows.
Their creators want them to seem human to copy the movements of the human body.
But the robots are not like real women.
They can't break up with their partners or leave them.
They have no life, no biography -- nothing that could point to independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of complete dependency.
In other words, they're beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, servants.
The harvester of Los Angeles Eugene (Puh) Jetter, who has been speaking for the collection of Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the basketball champion of Europe, whose final part is launched on 31 August.
The BeBasket Portal has been interviewed by the Director-General of the Son-Yellows, Andrey Lebedev.
We tried to negotiate with Jetter, but unfortunately, he would not come under family circumstances.
We're going to Eurobasket without a naturalized player because we don't want to get someone we don't know.
"It will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
Recall: In the direct participation of Jeter, Ukraine's collector took a recorded sixth seat in Eurobasket-2013 and for the first time had reached the world's basketball championship, where the Yellow-Blue was unable to overcome the group stage, and the U.S. creamed at the average of 15.4 points, made three choices and gave 5 transfers.
Jetter stopped speaking for Ukraine's assembly since the departure of the chief coach of our national team, American Mike Fratello, who left this post in 2015.
The male Eurobasket-2017 will take place at the same time in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold its team tournament on the Promised Earth.
Eugenia Murzina will have five fights in group B: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3th), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our male assembly conducted two controls in which the Dutch and Belarus took place.
Big Tramp's move?
Seems very reasonable to be Mita Romney.
In the Trampa era, the fact was that some families were broken by political disputes that polarized the American Electorate at the microlevel.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the American newspapers posted columns about how to deal with the horrible relatives voted for Trampa.
Looks like we're all so tense that we're gonna break up soon.
It's less about Tramp's ability to connect families.
I write about it because my cousin, my left views of poets from Chicago, who was on the knives with the Republicans in her family, came to New York this week.
She reminded me that the union in the fight against the common enemy could have a strong effect.
In Trampe in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother, with whom she had been arguing about the policy for decades, suddenly and strangely argued on the same side.
At dinner, it is certainly good; but I can't think that in a broader context, it could be quite dangerous.
Tramp sighed forces into the left flag, but the deforming effect of his rule could move us all to the right.
Speaking of Trampe and normalization, we mean a little possibilities that one day we're gonna stop surprised by his departures.
However, there is a more suspicious scenario in which Tramp "normalizes" the rightst Republicans, who will suddenly be displayed by a model of healthy sense.
I caught myself that I missed my old-fashioned crazy Mitta Romney today -- with a dog on the roof of the car and a 14 per cent income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looks) -- compared to Trampo and the other, it seemed very small.
When Tramp leaves, the next candidate of the Republic will be just in mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to the carcel in the Central Park, the biggest carousel in the Department of Parks of New York, and the best way to spend three dollars in the city if you don't need a caffeine.
The horses are terrifying and huge, pictures of the glasswake on the central drums - clowns and animals that, avoiding, look at their back, are extremely creepy, and the sounding music, as strange, is exciting.
So many of the famous things in this city are disappointed that the species from the sky are older, the forces of buildings have come too far to be shaken, and the reality of the city does not succeed in dreams.
Thirty-five years ago, and I'm still worried about the day when I found out that the Suiss-Cottage area is actually not a Swiss Shale (thematical pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not in account), but a large circuit crossing in North London.
And the causal in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a child is two years old, a 11-year-old child and two women in forty can have a great time.
If I could make a estimation, I'd put five, but fortunately, no one asked me.
And in the university this week, I was asked before I had a terminal card, to evaluate my "experience" of scaling from one to five stars.
In a caffee at my street corner, the same thing plus the option to accompany the tea assessment in 15 per cent is an order at the stand.
As a result, neutral interaction is not only delayed, but also had to make personal relations in a situation that does not imply it.
The poor seller in the university smiled confusedly while I was tired of assessing my experience of giving her credit card to five stars.
Oscar Pystorus was transferred from prison to hospital for breast disease
Pystorus leaves prison for the second time visiting a doctor.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of wrist cuts, which, according to the prison administration, he received as a result of a fall in the cell.
The Pystorus was convicted of deliberate murder after the appeal of the prosecutor for the initial sentence of uninterested murder.
He killed Steencamp early in the morning of the Valentine Day in 2013, shooting it several times through the door of the toilet room in his house in Pretoria.
Pystorus stated that he accepted his friend as a night thief who was hiding in his bathroom.
The prosecutor stated that the intention of a further protest was this time against the pretorius' six-year term, which, she said, was too soft.
The General Prosecutor stated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal would be considered this year.
Pretorius can increase for 15 years if the prosecution has success.
There's no death penalty in South Africa.
The suspect of the beating of NTV journalist has been selected a subscription for failure
The capital law enforcement officers chose a measure of interruption in the form of a subscription for a man who had attacked NTV television journalist Nikito Rajejeva during a direct airline from the Gorky Park on 2 August.
TASS reported this with reference to the official representative of IRD, Irine Volk.
“In the framework of the criminal investigation under paragraph 116 of the UK RF (“Battle”) against a 32-year-old man who hit the person of a reporter in the Central Cultural Park and the rest of the name of Gorky, the suspect is a suspect of a suppression in the form of a subscription for non-exit and proper conduct”, said the Wolf.
The representative of the IMD added that the suspect was composed of a administrative protocol for the non-compliance of the police.
On Wednesday, on 2 August, during a direct emission to the VAT Day, a non-hearted man approached the correspondent and hit his face.
Later, as it was found, the huligan has nothing to do with VAT.
According to the Roadway itself, the descenters were trying to detain Moscow.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal parliamentary parking
According to the B-T-Vi television, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for an illegal habitat parking.
In the morning of 1 August in Sithony, a group of people who placed tents in an unrequired place, including two Bulgarian citizens, was detained.
They were released on the same day, while the consequence was still conducted.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the B-T-Vi television that Bulgarian citizens were later released.
The Greek authorities have strengthened the control of free camping and are already imposed serious fines to all who have been caught during the parking site not intended for this place.
The verifications will be conducted throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may appoint a fine.
MID of Russia accused US Vice-President in the rhetoric of the cold wartime
The statements made during the European tour of the US Vice-President Michael Pens were criticised by Russian MIDA.
"It must be regretted that Washington is increasingly depthing to the primitive ideological images of the cold wartime, which are completely distracted from reality," said the Russian Foreign Political Department's statement.
Thus, in the MIDE, Pens had responded to the words of the “Russian threat” and the attempts of a violent crossing of the borders in the Subgorice.
The Russian MID indicated the destructiveness of the election " either with the West or Russia" and the invisible tissue on the apparently non-alternate entry of all South-Eastern Europe to NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that the United States had violated international law by applying the power to distract Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another tension.
"We call upon American colleagues to stop the russian shumming and its external policy line, which is constantly based on respect for partners and the readiness of joint constructive work, on mutual learning of interest," said the Russian MIDA statement.
Feldsher was injured at the DTP with "fast" in Podmoskovje
The DTP took place in the submotive Stupino, as a result of a struggle with the Feldscher's Emergency Caret.
About 08:10 a.m., the car struggle with an ambulance in the city of Stupino of Moscow.
"After the collaboration of the rapid machine, " TASS stated in the IMD press service on the Moscow area.
There are law enforcement officers at the scene, and the circumstances of the event have been detected.
In the area of Odessa, a woman threw her newborn son into a celophane package.
In the evening of 3 August, the police department received a message from the local inhabitant that he found a package with a baby in an unconstructed private house.
"The scene of the incident has been departed by law enforcement and doctors who have immediately delivered the child to the medical office," said the Chief of the National Police in Odesa.
Medicines found that the boy was born a few hours before he was discovered, as evidenced by the existence of a puppy.
During the primary operational and investigative activities, the identity of the child is a 36-year-old resident.
It is also established that a woman has three other minor children.
As noted in the head, in the field of law enforcement, the family had not previously arrived and had not been taken into account.
The police are now setting out the circumstances and reasons that offered the woman to do this, and the processual decision will be taken.
The baby is now under surveillance of doctors.
As reported earlier, a 21 - year - old woman threw her undernown child into a trash.
Gregory Leps: "I'm fighting, although 55 is not 30."
One of the most successful Russian estrade artists, Gregory Leps, will celebrate his 55th year in the next Sunday.
Before the feast, the singer contacted the Singer with the Newspaper.
I remember your "colleague" marking.
The special tent in the Lynnics, Gloria Gynor sang for the nameman, a strong salute over the Moscow River.
You must have pretended to spend your next five-year-old.
Did the plans come true?
Speaking of the profession, it was a good time.
I worked a lot, I traveled with the country three times, gave 120 to 30 concerts a year.
He released two good albums.
Of course, now I'm not the one that, say, 20 years ago.
The biological clock will not be deceived.
Singing as I sang at my 30s makes it harder.
Still, I'm fighting, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going to a different level.
You're writing a new album with them, first in three years.
Yeah, it's working on it right now.
In fact, we've already recorded everything in my studio and now we'll send it to Los Angeles.
It's called "Why are you so serious?" by one-named song that was written together with Timati.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't taught her anywhere yet.
Let's do it later when we take the video on it.
And we'll introduce the album in November to the series of my anniversary concerts in the Moscow Crocus City Hall.
Your new plastic was handed by a great American bubbling Chris Coulman.
You think you'd like to get him in your gastrol?
In my view, Coulman is one of the most excellent drummers in the world today.
He came to my studio, recorded his parties.
I offered him to join my group, and Jeremy Coulson (known drumman participating in various projects. - Notifications) suggested.
But for the continuing work in Russia, they had, eagerly, excessive conditions.
This was about $35,000 to $45,000 a month.
Then I thought that in the post-Soviet space, I would find worthy musicians.
And he found a great bubbster Max Malychev.
In fact, it is better to feed yourselves.
Sometimes, I want to get to some of them, not for what.
For example, the guitarist Fedor Dosumov is high at the international level.
It is written by Western musical magazines, invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Vaj, listening to his game, said that there was a new generation of guitarists, with another executive technique.
Your album is in L.A., American musicians cooperate with you, but you can't still come to the United States?
Are you trying to remove that ban?
Now, honestly, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers dealing with this matter.
As a musician, I really regret I can't get to America.
I've told you I've been studying there.
The more you communicate with these professionals, the more helpful.
We're not stupider than them, but we don't have such experience, school.
Our executors of popular music for 70 years did not have the tasks that American musicians have always decided.
They sought to make the sound of the best quality.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, Britain has refused to join me for ten years.
But I'm still going to give visa documents every year to the British Embassy so that I will be allowed to go there again and the most important thing to do is to work there.
The rest of Europe treats me favorably.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not a procurement, but an appointment, right?
Yeah, there's a good Sporting Hall in Monte Carlo, I've been there once.
They were invited again, and as far as I know, all tickets for the concert have already been sold.
On "Lyme Waycule Randewa", which starts on 20 July in Yurmal, will you go?
She invited me, and I, of course, answered.
Lima is a wonderful singer and a brilliant woman who knows how to surrender herself and with a beautiful vocal, even whispering.
After the gastroles and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you're looking at the creativity of Vladimir High.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discograph.
When's the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But it'll be completely different.
I want to write about 80 to 90 songs of the High in the same file as he did.
Only the voice and the guitar.
No other arrangements.
I'll be composed of our famous musician Timor Vedernikov.
I'll try to engage in the album and Alexander Jakub Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about this, we have a good relationship, but he's a person busy, so let's see how it works.
You and Boris Grebenschikov's songs have gradually entered your repertoire.
Why don't you write the album of his stuff?
Boris Borisovic is a lovely man and a great musician.
I intersected with him a few times, and I asked, can I sing his song or his song?
He said, "Gregor, I write songs to be fulfilled."
Please, try, sing.
I guess it's interesting to write that album.
Not yet, but in the future, a year or two, if Boris Borisovic doesn't mind, I may do that.
If you don't focus fully on your manufacturer's business.
I guess until you realized his potential, have you signed the contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of executors I'd like to have under my wing, but they're self-employed people.
Do you understand Sergei Lazarev?
Sergeja's a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may disagree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and has his development strategy.
And now, in my center, there's Alexander Panayotov whom I've been running at the Voices.
We made a deal and worked with him.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It will be truly regretful if he does not reach the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to pick him up a repertoire, take the videos.
I hope it's a good result.
I also try to advance other artists of my center: I buy them songs, I cry for poets, sometimes their tracks are in the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they are not high, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical completion.
They'll get a recorded album, a few videos.
And then, if they want, they can go their way, and I won't insist that they return their money.
Although I would be pleased if one of them had a commercial success and paid me the interests we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to cover the oxygen.
Let everyone work, try, prove, like I once proved.
If you'll be offered tomorrow to run a tour in Ukraine and guarantee entering the country, will you go?
I'm still invited there.
This is mainly about closed activities.
What about the big tour...
I'm the man of my country, the Russian, on my own conviction, flew to Syria on the same plane that then broke down.
If tomorrow they say we have to fly to another point for the State, I'll go.
And I don't care what bloggers and other criticism will think about me.
I regret that we had this situation with Ukraine.
Because I believe we are one nation and we must be together.
I'm sorry that that's hardly gonna happen, at least in the nearest time.
I used to give 40-50 concerts in Ukraine for a year.
We met like nowhere.
A very grateful audience.
And with several Ukrainian artists, he cooperated: Annie Lorak, Holy Loboda, Artem Loic...
In Ukraine, a mass of gifted people, and sincerely regret that they can't fully tap their talent for the broad Russian audience.
Music should combine and entertain people.
I would like to invite some classic Ukrainian executor to Russia, such as Slav Vakarchuk, and make a joint concert with him.
But I don't think it's...
Andrea Olopkov was transferred from cosmodroma
As the Technical Director of the Eastern Andrey Olopkov cosmodrom has become known as the Technical Director of the Eastern Andrej Chlopupkov has joined the State Space Scientific Centre (CHNPC) named Chronicva.
He had previously worked on the construction of the Eastern cosmodrome, but because of the disagreements with the Centre for Land and Space Infrastructure (CENCY) was transferred to the company in the Moscow Fils, where it would coordinate production.
Mr. Ohlopkov will not have a substitute: the technical director may be emptied and the functional is being dissolved by CENKI units.
The fact that the Technical Director of the East and Deputy Director of CENKE on Technology Development, Andrej Ohlopkov, was moved to work at the HNPC named Chruničeva, " Y" told the top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as the Government's staff.
"He has been working on a new post for a few weeks," the interviewers in the industry clarified.
CENKY ' s operational commentary failed on Thursday, and Mr. Chlopupkov was not available for comments.
However, the information " Y" has been officially confirmed in the GNPC.
He decided to move to the Director for Coordination of Manufacturing, said to the enterprise. - Andrej Hlopkov had fully implemented the task of providing the minimal minimis for the first launch in the Eastern cosmodrome.
Mr. Ohlopkov moved to work at CENKA in 2013, having a space troop service, in particular in Bajkonure, and in Plesecka, in the northern cosmodrome, took the first commander in the name of the Colonel.
In 2009, Andrej Ohlopkov became a criminal figure.
The investigation accused him of bribery: it appears that the regional commercials received the orders for dismissal, but did not fulfil the commitments taken to clean up separated parts of the carriers in the Archangel area and the Republic of the Commission.
In 2012, the jury court recognized him innocent.
The tasks in the CENCY on technological development were allocated to various projects, but the main was the construction of cosmodroma in the Dale East.
The head of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Stapenko, at the interview of the " Y ", was direct to say that the situation in the East was " critical in October 2013".
The point is that a strategic error was permitted in planning: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Union-2.1 rocket was planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
In order to implement the launch by the end of the year, the construction was decided six months earlier and the deadlines were postponed from December to July 2015.
In order to accelerate the process, CENCY experts began a parallel installation of technological equipment on unconstructed facilities.
The main part of this idea was Andrej Chloppkov.
Despite the existing risks and yet the transfer (instead of December 2015, the Union flew only on 28 April 2016), the idea justified itself, said the source of "Y" on the cosmodrome: "Inay we would have not yet carried out any rifle from the Eastern, but we would be building."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitri Rogozin, who was chief of the creation of cosmodrome, jokefully called Andrea Olopkov his "space Susanin", but he almost always asked for information on the construction.
Mr. Ohlopkov and directness: For example, at the interview " Y " he suggested to deprive the Federal Special Building Agency (Specstra) the status of the only executor in Eastern and directly working with the sub-contractors, " Why should we all have to put the eggs into one specimen?"
This idea has been supported by the Government.
Since 2017, CENKI has assumed the responsibility of the general contractor to complete construction and construction work at the starting and technical complex to the fourth quarter of the ports.
According to Mr. Oclopkov ' s new jobs, the CENCY leadership had had a disagreement on how to complement the construction of buildings and cosmodroma complexes, as well as the methods of working with sub-system organizations.
"It was decided to be best for all," said one of the top managers involved in Eastern.
The Government's worker, in turn, calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best experts, finding an equal replacement would be difficult."
According to E, this will not be necessary: the post of the Technical Director of Cosmodrome will be emptied and its functions will be discharged by CENCI.
A two-specific training programme will be presented in musical schools
In the future, children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Ministry of Science and Education, the Ministry of Science and Education of the Ministry of Sacred Golubenko rereads the repeating disciplines to students, and the issue with the payment of other secondary lessons to decide through special grants, is transmitted by the " RIA News " .
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue to control, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will allow two specialities, but will not contradict the current educational legislation," said Pigeonko.
Last Friday, during the Neday Talk, Vladimir Putin with the children of the Syrius Child Centre, student Maria Andreeva reported that she was forced to pay repetitive items for second specialty in the CMS at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told me she was studying violin and piano class and has awards for both directions.
The head of the State recognized its question as very relevant and pledged to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian who was stuck on the wall on the sky sky
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russian Cyrille N., who climbed on the roof of the high building, reported the El Universal portal.
The incident occurred in the capital of Mexico.
The young man, with two unknown men, crossed the three-metre fence to the Nestle office building complex and went on one of his towers.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
Young man's been held on the roof.
Officers of the Ministry of Public Security have dropped him on the ground on a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
It finds whether the youth is legally in the territory of the country.
In the meantime, a video with a young man coming up to a high level has become popular in the Network.
The users called the young man a spider.
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate can help to facilitate the WC.
Red meat and chocolate is considered a nightmare for your food tract.
Recent studies, however, refer to the reverse: a diet rich in meat proteins and breast products can help to facilitate symptoms of those who suffer from inflammatory diseases of the wormhole.
This insecurable disease, which affects approximately 1.3 million people in the United States and 30,000 in Britain, leads to the quantities and shoes of the stomach, chronic or bloody bearings, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
Usually, for the mitigation of symptoms, it is advised to avoid meat and milk products, but researchers at the University of Washington found that the main amino acid of protein triptophane contributes to the production of immune cells that increase the tolerance of the wheat.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells in the wormhole are watching the harmful microbes that come from food not enter into the body.
The cells capable of launching the fuel process are balanced with cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body and not harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too severe in the direction of the inflammation, it may lead to inflammatory diseases of the wormhole.
Experiments have shown that mice with a certain bacteria in the wormhole have increased tolerance of cells.
And this bacteria needs triptophane, one of the protein building elements, to launch the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: " We have established a link between one type of bacteria -- Lactobacillus reuteri -- which is part of the normal carbon microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more triptofan was contained in the feeding of mice, the more these immune cells they had."
He assumed that the same would work with people: the combination of L. reuteri and rich triptophane of the diet could contribute to a more tolerable and less agitated to the inflammation of the environment in the wormhole.
Dr. Louise Servantes-Barraganwas, studying the variety of increased tolerance of immune cells, found that one group of tested mice had these cells, and another group that belonged to the same line, but contained separately, had no cells.
She assumed that the difference could be caused by microbioms of the miceholders -- the communities of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms, which usually live in the stomach and carpet tract.
The DNA of the Mouse Creator cells was sequented and six types of bacteria were found present with mice with immune cells but absence of mice without them.
The mice grown in a sterilous environment without a good microbiom and not developed this type of immune cells received L. reuteri and their immune cells emerged.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers raised L. reuteri in the fluid environment and then transferred small liquid porculations, without bacteria, to unencumbered immune cells selected from the mouse.
Immune cells have become tolerant cells.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it was an side product of triptofane processing known as indol-3 milk acid.
When the researchers doubled the number of tripthane in the mice food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the tripthane levels were doubled, the number of cells also fell twice.
Dr. Servantes-Barragan explains that people have the same increased tolerance of cells as the mouse, and most of us have L. reuteri in their stomach-pocket tract.
It is unknown whether the adverse products of L. reuteri development of cells have been advocated in the same way as with mice, but those suffering from inflammatory diseases of the wormhole have been detected defects in triptophane genes.
She says, "Maybe we need to strengthen these cells, since these cells depend on the inflammatory processes on the internal surface of the worms.
The high levels of triptophane, when L. reuteri is available, may potentially lead to the increase of their population."
According to José Mourinew, Manchester United hired “geny” in the face of Nemanja Matich
The Manchester United hired “geny” in the face of Nemanji Matich, considers José Mourinew after the semi-protector debutted in the game against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
The player, acquired for 40 million pounds from Chelsea, began with the winning of 2-1 in Dublin in the last pre-season match of the UEFA Supercub against Real Madrid on Thursday, and impressed the role of a semi-protector, while players like Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke forward when they were greedy.
However, since Matic did not participate in the Chelsea seasonal tour in Asia, he was seriously lacking preparations for the game, and he lasted only 45 minutes, which, according to Mauritius, requires improvement before the start of the Prime Ministerial League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, the genius, the way he thinks, he thinks football," said Maureen.
"We will help him prepare sooner than late."
Like Matic, his new players, Victor Lindelof and Romell Lukak, started a game at the Aviva stadium when Maureenew began to form his main composition to the beginning of the next season.
The Independent newspaper reported this week that Maureeny wanted to hire three more players, but emphasized that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire first.
"I am grateful to the club for the three of the four," he added.
"I will be more pleased if they get me four of the four, but they have done so hard for me."
Former Lithuanian Social Democratic Leaders Consulted them to remain in the ruling coalition
Former Presidents of the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party, the former Prime Ministers Algirdas Buccavicus and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former speaker of the Chaslaus Yurshanas Social Social Social Affairs, called on the uniparts to remain in the governing coalition.
According to the Parliamentian newspaper, the discussion was initiated because of the trends with the partners, the Union of Roomers and Greens, in the Social Democratic Party, whether it should remain in the governing coalition.
The three senior experienced companions, therefore, addressed the two parties with an open letter, which, inter alia, states: “The disappointment of the election companions is understood, but the coalition with the " crystals" has created for us not very easy, but still the conditions for further implementation of the objectives of social justice, which, on our initiative, are provided for in the Government's programme, and for the preservation of the political domination of the left centre over the right parties”.
According to the former leaders of the Party, the discussion has yet “recognized the expression based on emotions without concrete arguments”.
The authors of the letters fear that their party could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability by unreasonable actions.
Anthony Mamaev has been awarded a fine.
Mosgoroud mitigated the punishment of an invalid carrier, Anton Mamaev, from four and a half years of detention to a fine of 200,000.
The previous decision of the Timirazev Court was released from the SISO.
Mosgorsud confirmed that the defendant was a criminal because he organized the breakdown and kidnapping of a engineer from the former specialist.
The Mosgoroud had decided to mitigate the penalty of Anton Mamaev to 200,000 fines.
"Mamaev is an organizer of fraud, which also constitutes a crime, and, accordingly, such a person must be brought to criminal responsibility," explained the press Secretary of Mosgourdus Ullian Solopov.
In this case, the Court took into account the condition of Mamaev’s health, the factual circumstances of cases, the lack of difficult circumstances.
Furthermore, the court applied p. 64 of the UK RF to appoint a punishment below the limit.
With regard to the Assistant of Mamaev Vasilij Seroftanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would be the basis for a change in the category of gravity and change of the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself stated that he remained dissatisfied with the Mosgorsud decision.
I'm disappointed in the court's decision.
The only legitimate solution would be an excuse, aiming to continue fighting for justice.
His lawyer, Andrej Orlov, did not exclude the conviction in the Mosgorsus and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the bullets to the European Court of Human Rights," he said, "Ria News".
Recall, the 28-year-old Moscow Anton Mamaev, who suffered from the back of the muscle atrophia, became a criminal figure last autumn.
Invalid claims that he bought a motorcycle from a friend of 160,000 to sell.

UNF will prepare an environmental report to the President
The Final Forum of Action (UNF) of the Common-Russian People ' s Front (UNF) will be devoted to environmental issues in 2017, reported the UNF's reporting source and reaffirmed the head of the general movement of Alexei Anisimov.
He said that, as a result of the Frontovic Forum, the president had planned to prepare a report on the problems of national environmental issues and to offer a strategy for their solutions.
Interviewers in UNF note that the report to the head of the State will contain " depth analyses" on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to the Notifications, the UNF outcome forum will take place in the autumn.
The exact date of its conduct is not yet defined -- it is generally set under the schedule of the President, who is the leader of the movement and traditionally attends key activities of UNFC.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, on one by two federal districts, in Rostovo na Don, Kaliningrad and Kirova.
Summary will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Buryau Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals expressed and expressed in these activities, we will also set up system proposals to address environmental problems,” said the UNFP interviewer to the Notifications.
The Chairman of the Central Headquarters of the Movement of Olga Timothy, head of the Committee of the Environmental and Environmental Protection Committee, said that “frontwicks” would report to the head of the State on the work carried out within the Year of Environment in Russia.
The outcome environmental forum and the " Forum of Action" of UNF will probably be combined.
In a year, we were a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, saw gaps in legislation, stopped dozens of law violations.
All of this will come into a report that we are preparing to the President as the leader of our movement.
Furthermore, “frontoviks” are also reported on UNF's priority projects,” said Olga Timopheev ' s Notifications.
She said that a special representative of the Head of the State on Environmental Affairs, Environment and Transport of Sergei Ivanov would also be invited to the forum.
He had already participated in the UNF Mediaforum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
A few months later, the Year of ecology will go into history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they will work for years.
In order to avoid these issues from the agenda, Olga Timothyv added.
The head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Institute of Social Research (EISI) Andrej Colladin noted that by raiseing environmental issues, UNF operated on the basis of the Presidential Agenda.
Many things they offered as experts in various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the President," said Andrew Colladin ' s Notifications.
He emphasized that the economic capacity of the environmental agenda could not be excluded today, which could give the region an additional impulse for development.
Further with UNF regions will be able to develop not only the solution to their environmental problems but also the development of ecotourism," added the expert.
The current environmental theme demonstrated the " direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the Chairman was asked about the waste debris in Balashia (just closed) and the coal dust in the port of the city of Nanadka (the law on the prohibition of open coal transmission in the settlements, one of the authors, Olga Timothyva).
Eco-economic experts believe that the legal framework for addressing the environmental problems in Russia is generally established, the issue is in further law enforcement practice, as well as in civil society position.
A clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State is needed, the head of the charitable fund " Environment for All " Leonid Bochin.
Member of the SME, head of the non-governmental organization of the Greenpeace of Russia, Sergei Chiplenkov, in the discussion with the Notifications, emphasized that a responsible approach of society and business needed a few legislative efforts to address environmental problems.
As soon as society and business realize that the solution to environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change,” noted Sergei Chiplenkov.
The expert emphasized that the tendency to break the trend was that the violation of environmental legislation was a economicly profitable decision for business.
The British inventor used a microchip to get into the house and the car with his hands
The British inventor became the first person in the country to set up a microchip so that he could open the doors of his house, enter the office and even build a car with a simple whiskey.
The thirty-year-old Steven Northam has earned a small chip between large and pointing fingers and now, through his company, "BioTek" offers this service to companies and private persons who want to simplify their lives for technology.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, anesthesiologist from the Royal in Winchester, in order to ensure that the application procedure is carried out in accordance with the medical standards.
Technology is like a microchip that takes only 30 seconds for cats and dogs.
The Nortem company also replaces castles in houses and machines compatible with a $300 pounds for one castle.
A married child's father has already established technology in his home and his BMW Z4 car, which works when his hand is lying on the wheel.
The requisite for the White House was worth thousands of dollars to taxpayers.
According to the records of the armed forces provided by the TIME magazine, the decision of the White House last month to recruit a marine helicopter to the Southern Lunge to the event devoted to American industrial production was worth $24,000 taxpayers.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the board is a president, became the central element of the activities held on 17 July in the White House, on which the American construction programmes were demonstrated.
President Donald Tramp, Vice-President Mike Pens and Higher Officers of the White House have examined technological products from all fifty states.
The helicopter made in Connecticut was exhibited next to the ship from the State of Man, a fire car from Wisconsin and a car loader from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Escadry of Sea Maritime Marine (HMX-1), the Department responsible for the management of the helicopter, the White House Military Office ordered the presence of a helicopter in private order, or FRAGO, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the Southern Lodge on the event of “unusual” event.
"I just wanted you to make sure that you know, because this is an unusual press-based event," the commander HMX-1 wrote in his e-mail to his chief, the first vice-in-Aviation Chief of the Sea Marine Corps, before the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South River at approximately 7 a.m. on 17 July to participate in a 3-hour event, and would remain there before the grass will be released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, the second crew will be required to fly backwards in accordance with hours of work.
The first crew was accompanied by a helicopter during the event, and the security officers remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records received by the TIME magazine, it remained clear whether the second crew was required.
Hetch's law prohibits federal officials to use public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 has indicated whether the event was contrary to this provision.
"We have asked whether this is a violation of the Hatch law, and they said not to us," said the commander.
"Sounds like you have nowhere to go," said the Deputy Chief.
The event in America was declared a White House as an official event, and the Hatch law was not distributed to it.
But even official activities have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to promote the health reform that had been in the work of the Senate at that time, and commended efforts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
The Presidents are prescribed to use them for travel.
But only for photoscaping is unusual.
Tramp was already subject to discussions in February when the presidential plane went back during his first pre-election event in Melbourne, in Florida, and his account in the Twitter was charged with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
“The White House is admired by the presentation of America, which represented products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials”, said the Under-Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews are frequently performing training flights around the Washington Aglomeration and the Southern Lodge to train the President of the United States to the White House with preciseness to inch.
When Tramp was at the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 held 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight carried out for America ' s activities was calculated in respect of the necessary training flights per month.
Helicopters also ran into 11 additional hours on that day as part of " non-Presidential support tasks " .
According to the White House, taxpayers had no expenses for any of the other exhibits presented in the event.
The representative of the Sikorsky company said that the company had not participated in the organization of a helicopter demonstration in the Southern Lodge.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for presidential flights and determine the exact amount spent on the event is difficult.
However, according to the time rates of the Ministry of Defence for 2017, the reimbursement rate of VH-3D is $24,380 per hour of flight.
The records indicate that the aircraft time was 30 minutes on each side of its aircraft based on the Quantico marine airborne base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual value of the use of the helicopter is much below the rate.
“To calculate the value for taxpayers, based on the model reimbursement rate, is completely wrong” said Walters.
“These sample rates include the personal composition, service and many other non-return costs that are included in annual appropriations.”
According to the study conducted by the RAND Corporation in 2015, the reimbursement rates do not include the value of the personal composition, but, indeed, take into account the value of fuel, service and costs indicated in the treaty.
At the time, the former Press Secretary of the White House, Sean Spiser, spoke to protect the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to demonstrate the things that were done in America this week," said Spiser.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that they exist, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job is dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we're all proud of this helicopter and other military technology that has been working on.
Therefore, it is perfectly appropriate to pay attention to this."
It was irrelevant whether Tramp was interaction with the helicopter by exploring the Southern Swarm during the event, but he was surely sitting in a driver's place in the fire car.
Inside the White House, Tramp addressed the representatives of the Sikorsky company, joking with the press on its own fleet of products of the company.
"I know Sikorsky well," said the President. "I have three."
Moscow will allocate grants for urban hospital reanimation offices

Electricity is cheaper for both the inhabitants and for the producers of the goods of Buryath
The efforts of the Soviet and Post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryau (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for consumers of electricity began to benefit.
From 1 September, 25 per cent, electricity is reduced in low voltage for industrial recipients.
The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service in accordance with the Rules of the Rules of the Government of the Russian Federation, on the amendment to the Optical Market of Electric Energy and Power and in the consolidated projection balance of production and electricity (power) in the framework of the Single Energy System on the Subjects of the Russian Federation (from 17.07.2017 No. 842), set indication prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buretia.
As a result, the value of electricity for burratian goods is reduced by a quarter, which will make life significantly easier for small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the Republic have lived on the thresholds of the Moscow offices in harmful attempts to equate the region in tariffs from the neighbouring Irkut area with the Angare hydroelectric cascade from Bajkal, the main watercover territory for which Buratia is.
And only this year the moves started.
In March, electricity tariffs for the Republic are reduced from 4.24 r./kWch to 3.93 rub./kWh, or by 7.3 per cent.
With the inclusion of Buryau on the decision of the Federal Government to the List of Territories of Optimal Market Pricing Areas, for which the features of the functioning of the optimal and diversity markets have arrived in the row of industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, since the Irkutian population pays for kilovatt/hour 1,01 rubles.
However, no one is daring to call for at least the approximate date of new tariff movements for Burettia.

National union of unqualified, municipal and cold workers (GMB) is concerned about capitalization in McVitie's factory in Glasgo
The trade union requires guarantees from the managers of the MacVitie producer 's on its long-term production obligation in the Glazgo factory.
The Scotland GMB reported that the company had been silent with the question of future investment in the Tolcos object.
In the manufacturer's factory, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies, more than 500 people work.
The company Pladis, owner of McVitie's, reports that in recent years, she has invested in an object more than 5 million pounds.
The company adds that, if any change in the operation of the facility, the staff and representatives of the trade union “will know first.”
In a letter to the head of the company, the Scotland GMB requested the McVitie's response to anxiety that the financing would not be allowed to modernize production lines.
The Senior Organizer Drew Daffy stated: “The members of our trade union are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarified from the Director-General of the Business and Investment Plan on the Future of Tolcross.”
The families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is large in local society and the territory of the Great Glasgo; this is the most important pillar of worthy work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, salaries and prosperity, and in the background of Brekzit, the growth of the living minimum and the chronic decline in production, East End Glasgo desperately needs the prosperity of production in McVitie's factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, “The Tolcross Officer received a letter from the Scotland GMB only yesterday, and the company will respond immediately, since we appreciate our continuing cooperation with the staff and representatives of the trade union”.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives in Tolcros, which openly discussed a number of issues.
We talked to the staff that, as all companies working in the terms of the maximum competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions -- and that concerns all our objectives and directions -- to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tolcross object, especially in production lines and improvement of functional indicators.”
We fully realize the value of Tolcros as a productive object, and if any change in the work of the site, the staff and the trade union will know first."
Putin stated that the authorities would not give guidance to Rosnefty and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin stated that the issue of gas supply to the Eastern Oil Company (WNHC) should be connected to Cremel and the office of ministers, but the Guzprom instructions as well as Rosnefty would not be given.
So the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, responded to the request of Igor Secin to facilitate the disagreements.
The Head of State noted that the relationship between Rosnefty and Gazprom should be addressed exclusively on the basis of market principles.
Previously, the chapter of Rosnefty, Igor Secin, at the meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District, said that the lack of agreement with the Gazprom on gas for UNHCR was in danger of the implementation of the project.
Sichin noted that the dialogue with the Gazprom was ongoing.
" Gasprom" suggests finding gas resources from the Rosnefty perimeter, but we do not have such resources," added Secin.
Recall that Rosnefth asked her to allow it to use gas for the East Oil Company from the Kyrin Gazprom Place, located on the Shelf of Sahalin.
In June, Gazprom stated that the negotiations on this matter continued, and there were no sharp corners there.
Has Barcelone been warned of the transition of Neimar three years ago?
La League Participant may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
" Parry Saint German" will not stop pursuing Neimar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona about the world flight record, held three years ago?
The sensational proposal revived the summer transfer window when the League 1 club was prepared to beat the World Transitional Record, more than twice exceeding the previous marking related to the return of Pogba to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds.
When the transition is completed, Neimar will become the most expensive player in the world and the most highly payable professional sportsman in the world, since the PSJ offers him more than 500,000 pounds a weekly clean wage.
It is known that the Barcelona and the rage of the proposal was made and how Neimar broke the contract, despite the insisting of the source close to the catalan club, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the soccer world warned of this possibility three years ago by the President of the PSJ?
When Manchester City expressed his interest in the rent of Blaze Matthews in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi warned each club who would like to overcome one of the best PSJ players.
"I am not concerned, because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will speak against them, we will make proposals to their players," said Al-Helaifhy.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, their consequences will be.”
Apparently, Barcelona crossed the line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed its interest in a semi-protector from the PSJ, Mark Verratti.
The PPG has made it clear that it will not let the Italian player gathered under any conditions, and now likely Barcelona feels the consequences of his proposal as a loss of one of its most valuable players, Naimar.

At first, Putin released a few boys from the bag.
Then he dragged a special slipper on the container's shelter and released the others.
Also during the journey, the leader ordered to deal with the environment in Baikal and build a road on the island of Olchon.
According to Minstroy, it is necessary one amount, and it is likely to provide for another amount.
"I want to figure out what, by the way, happens with financing," the Russian leader emphasized.
Recall, the populations of Buryathia, Irkut, the housing houses and house buildings were destroyed during the forest fires of 2017.
In Ukraine, they were invited to send Russians to prison for illegal crossing the border
