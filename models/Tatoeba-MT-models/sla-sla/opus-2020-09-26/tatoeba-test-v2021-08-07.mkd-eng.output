I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like the way your hair looks.
I really like wine.
I like your website very much.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss mom's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I really want to learn French.
It would really be nice to keep your mouth shut.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the type.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember meeting the Queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I cried one.
The iron is stronger than the gold.
Isaac Newton died as a virgin.
I said I'd bring it.
I said it might rain.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Anybody in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is there anything missing?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him right now.
I saw him play cards with all of them.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister kicking the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sunshine in the washing room.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far?
Buddhism is religion or philosophy?
Does Dan know what he did?
Are the potatoes caloric?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see," the blind said.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are they all busy?
Are they all happy?
Are they all having fun?
Is everything there?
Does he breathe?
His aunt eats apples or banana?
I got my head flipped.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
I should be sorry for them.
I need to take her home.
I need to pack.
I need to go change my clothes.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done that without you.
I shouldn't have eaten that ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should've been more cultural.
I should have checked.
I should have done that yesterday.
I should've known you're gonna be here.
I should have refused.
I showed her my room.
Is it cold outside?
Is it over?
Is it far from here?
Is Daddyba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I've got a pinch on him.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I'm sleeping stools.
I slept like a slaughter.
I slept in the cuno.
I slept in the bus.
I cut the sandwich across.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic drinks?
I smiled.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that too much?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy you a house?
Isn't this awesome?
I kind of like it.
I've been cleaning snow all day.
Is she a cab?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really so beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I was staring at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I got something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a retorical question?
That means yes or no?
Does that word even exist?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that Sarcasm?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks it happened?
Did you do that to them?
So there's Tom?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Are you paying for the delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there any food?
Anybody else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a prize?
Is there something specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is it a diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this right in English?
Is this Jupiter or bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is this your radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is this place free?
Was this all the excitement?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
Somehow, I still can't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Does Tom contribute?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying from cancer?
Is Tom fun?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is Tom looking for them?
Is Tom bothering you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Are you talking to Tom?
Is Tom alone there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I burned a sybrid in the dark.
I'm learning art history.
Suddenly, I felt old.
I'm suffering from astma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we concentrate on the demanding exit from the cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm starving you to get down.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's what I doubted.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I swimmed in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't even catch up with you, and you'd be the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Is the freezer still working on you?
Is your head full of slam?
I use a chance to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my advisors about what items to take.
This whole thing makes sense.
It seems to be pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't be a coincidence.
So, no, no.
It's not possible!
It's for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Never, but it could never have happened here.
There's no way Tom would be.
That would be a disaster.
It'd be good.
You didn't mind me.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get so bad.
It's disappointed.
It would look good.
Don't bother me.
It's not gonna get better.
It doesn't seem much different.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; anyway you have to.
It doesn't matter.
Looks like it's not helping.
It doesn't sound like who knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I teach him English.
It's just me.
That gave me an idea.
I have something to do.
It had to be made.
It must've been created somewhere.
Depends on your decision.
It happened too soon.
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's cold.
It has nothing to do with luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
He's got sentimental value.
I've been thinking it all day.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think she's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one of those.
I think I'm cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
I think I'll go visit Tom and see how he is.
I think I love you.
I think I made a nice statement.
I think I'm writing pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think it's possible to sneeze.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak pretty good French.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it'd be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time to start preparing.
I think it's time to go.
I think it's time to start preparing.
I think it would be a mistake to borrow Tom's money.
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
I think I was wrong.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive for you.
I think that's awful.
I think that's ridiculous.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's insensitive.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom's brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's beautiful.
I think Tom's cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's mean.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's tiny.
I think Tom's a chain.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's scratched.
I think Tom's slight.
I think Tom's intelligent.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I'm saying Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's going.
I think we can get him.
I think we better not drink water.
We'd better not go out on a storm like this.
I think we'll join.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've eaten enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you'll have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should pick her.
I think you should do this yourself.
I mean, you're gonna help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should handle this yourself.
I think you helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought there were bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask for help.
I thought I lost all the money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought it'd hurt me.
I thought you already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom was retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom would be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to come with us.
So we didn't agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we were going to visit the museum together.
I think you're gonna have a lot of work to do.
Well, didn't you like the prize?
I thought you found another.
I thought you lost your hand watch.
So don't you hate him?
We seemed tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you were only dating girls that were lower than you.
So didn't you know how to play piano?
Well, didn't you say you know how to swim?
So didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you were better playing chess than I did.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you'd live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning to stay in bed all day.
I thought you weren't gonna be busy.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
I'm terribly hurting here.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the cup on the bowl.
It's a multifactory process.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no theoretical way to do the job in one day.
Today's less wet than yesterday.
It's not cold.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use it?
I'm paying.
He doesn't come into consideration.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It's starting to get into our mind that we can't ignore the nature.
It's warm today since yesterday.
It is worth quoting a famous paragraph of his esej.
It's written on the head.
It's written on his face.
It seems kind of wrong to me.
I just don't feel safe about that.
It just sounds boring.
It's happening all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be Christmas soon.
It'll be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
It looked terrible.
It looked funny.
Looks like you're right.
It looks very delicious.
Looks different.
It seems familiar to me.
It looks like eggs.
Looks like I've had too much drinks yesterday.
Looks like these two are in a relationship again.
Looks like these two are calm.
Looks like we'll have snow Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
Looks nice.
That's what I got close to Tom.
He's scratching me.
I'm worried.
It could be dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
Maybe it sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe it'll rain tonight.
Maybe it seems weird.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It might rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It must be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them and told him.
I informed the police that Tom was with me that time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I couldn't.
I told you it'd be hard to get out.
I told you my father died when I was 13 years old.
I told you this would get tough.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went to a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I woke up.
I'm back on the bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants are scratched.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally understand.
It's probably not worth waiting.
It rained two days ago.
You've gotten a lot of difficulty.
I tried to explain to him, but he didn't push.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to make him come.
I tried to make them stop.
I tried to pretend I'm something I'm not.
I'm honestly sorry about that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
He's ready to rain.
It's a classic.
It was a real disaster!
It is recommended to check if you have any negative effects when drinking alcohol while drinking the prescribed medicinal product.
It's a child game.
That's a good system.
There's everything in the file.
It's all in the room.
It's all over.
It's all over now.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all very weird.
It's almost over.
It'll be midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's gonna have to go for a while.
It's really fun.
It's seven o'clock.
It's eleven o'clock.
It's already open.
It's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle that you survived.
It's a honour.
There's nothing to think.
It's a shame you've ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
It's a reasonable compromise.
It's a fake trail.
It's a risk plan.
Too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
It gets fast to walk.
It's a simple thing.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a wonderful idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They split it up.
He just pushed me up.
It's been raining for a week, up and down.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is incredibly warm.
It'd be best if you didn't talk that much.
You better be alone.
Better be optimist and fool yourself than be a pessimist and be right.
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's no one.
It's time to close.
Studies here.
It's generally known that you don't like Tom.
It's dark here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to evaluate his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier like this.
It's easier not to end up in jail than then to escape.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
Looks like I misjudged it.
It looks like her style.
I think that's the only possible conclusion.
Looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's evil to be psyched.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
That's what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
She's dressed.
It's dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's gonna be a beast.
It'll get cold.
It'll happen soon.
Good to see you all again.
That's a good training.
It's okay.
It's improved.
It's very fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's warm here in hell.
That should be possible.
It shouldn't even take a long time.
It matters to me what you think about Tom.
It's impossible for him to quit smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
He's in great condition.
He's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's a simple question.
It's just invented.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It's made of skin.
I decide, Tom.
That's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring such gifts.
It's nice to feel that someone needs you.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's noise here.
It's none of your business!
It's not a secret that Tom doesn't agree with you.
That doesn't have a big priority.
It's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not back.
That wasn't exactly what happened.
It will not be easy to do so without great help.
It's not hard to emphasize if you're surrounded by fools.
It's no big deal.
It's not just guessing.
It's not usually a pen.
There's not enough light to read here.
It's not that we're doing something.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not a spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It's not up to you.
It doesn't happen much to anyone buy a thousand dollars hat.
It's not worth much.
Snow was falling last night.
It's obviously a print error.
For everyone, it's obvious that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
Sounds really hot.
Sounds very good.
It's our job to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
Probably still got it.
Probably still available.
It's messed up.
Actually, it's very common.
That's delicious.
It's very possibly I'm wrong.
It's quite possible that Tom doesn't help us at all.
It's very simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really nasty.
It's a shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's hot!
It's a law!
It's so obvious we don't need evidence.
It's getting dark.
It's still dark outside.
He's still on sale.
He's still working.
It's not good yet.
It's still growing.
He's still there.
It's strange how people in tropical zones eat coated food like kari.
It's stuck.
His surface was equal as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best puppet I've ever tasted.
It's a spider cake.
I'm so scared!
It's time for you to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them at their place of choice.
It's pretty strong.
It's bullshit.
It's completely wrong.
It's not sustained.
It's unique and unreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom urgently.
She's very relaxing.
It's very simple to understand.
It's warm in here.
I guess I don't.
There's a wind.
It's from work.
You're losing.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
The water takes only three minutes to scream.
It lasted all night.
It took a lot more than I thought it would take.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're unexpectedly beautiful.
I turned the ventilator on and directed it to the wall.
I turned the lamp on.
I turned off the TV.
I refused Tom.
It was a great honour to be asked to make a speech.
It was so beautiful.
That was embarrassing.
It was midnight.
This was an all-day.
It was a great series.
It was all my idea.
It was okay here.
Everything was so easy.
That was an amazing night.
It was a trap.
It was a terrible view.
It was an honor.
That was a offer I couldn't refuse.
It was my pleasure to spend the evening with a smart, funny, beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
That was a surprise.
That was a wonderful experience.
It was a hard test.
It was a warm night.
It was a lovely day.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful night.
Such behaviour was childish by him.
It was awful.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was one of them.
It was fun yesterday.
He was sleeping all night.
It was dark.
It was ironical.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
It was nice of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn't easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It is proven that dogs living in dogs jump higher than those living in cats.
It was awesome.
It was pretty funny.
It was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
He's been blowing a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to go up the mountains.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
You were still there.
Tom gave me the picture that was hanged on the dim.
It was Tom.
It was too little.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was unacceptable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very drowsy in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Better.
It was worth it to try.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It's not gonna be enough.
I'm not gonna be lonely here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Lies won't help.
That won't help you.
He's doing good.
It would be very normal to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I catch you to explain everything.
I need you urgently.
I've been watching you before.
I've dreamed of being a balerine before.
I hated you before.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I've already packed.
I already read it.
I already wrote everything I had to write.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
Someone always helped me.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get to one like this.
I always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked everyone.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked her cake.
I baked them cake.
I've been after them for a long time.
I was a little burdened with another.
I turned the whole town looking for Dom.
It was much worse for me.
I was betrayed.
They informed me.
I was robbed three times this month.
I've been calling for hours.
I was unreasonable.
I was insane.
I can't wait to meet him.
I was gone for three weeks.
I was happy here.
I've been offering her help.
I've been offering help.
They hired me to find them.
I was kidnapped.
I've been living here for years.
I've been looking for him for a while.
I was pretty busy.
I've been looking for you for a while.
I've been studying French since I was 13 years old.
I was thinking about your problem with Tom.
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I've seen it before.
I came for them.
I came to bring him a gift.
I cut my finger off.
I decided to contribute exclusively with Spanish sentences all month.
I decided to forgive him.
I decided to forgive them.
I decided to go on the train.
I decided to go.
I decided to let you get back to work.
I decided to stay where I was.
I've fallen in love with you.
I finally found you.

I think you can tell us where to find him.
We tried to make them come.

You better let me do that.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a higher wage.
He deserved better.
And you would've done the same in my place.
You've done a bad job.
You did your job nicely.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
You haven't listened.
You didn't see anyone coming in, did you?
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
You told Tom about it, right?
You already did it.
You've done everything you can.
You don't have to like everything.
You don't even like fish.
It hurts you, isn't it?
Do you have a key accidentally?
You don't have any idea how long yet.
You don't have to be crazy to work here.
You know my motherfucker.
You don't know anything.
You dream you know.
You don't really like Tom, do you?
You shouldn't be present for this.
You shouldn't go.
You don't need to panic.
You shouldn't wear anything.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
You don't understand your business.
You don't want to do anything that reminds them you're not really big enough to be here.
You don't want to go, do you?
You don't work here.
You're driving me crazy.
You forgot your backpack!
You scared Tom.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
You're right to a phone call.
You go pick up Tom and go back.
You guessed one thing.
You're wrong, people.
You were right, guys.
Your hair is a break.
You hate us, don't you?
You've got a great job.
You're biting your conscience, aren't you?
You have a habit that I don't like.
You've got little chests.
You have beautiful lips.
You were a great mentor for me.
You were busy.
You have sweet eyes.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
I respect you.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
There's no reason to be afraid.
You don't change your mind, do you?
You didn't see that, did you?
You haven't solved this problem, did you?
You have a really good manuscript.
Your hands are soft.
You have to answer the question.
You have to ask them first.
You have to buy them a gift.
You have to go home.
You have to help him.
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
You have to resign.
You have to sit down.
You have to stay away from him as far as you can.
You can't lose your condition.
You have to try, Tom.
You have very beautiful lips.
You've got a lot of slippery eyes.
You just heard.
You just got back from the vacation.
You almost missed him.
You almost missed Tom.
You don't get involved in this.
Kids, stay here.
You knew, didn't you?
You know I'd do anything for your red eyes.
You know I'm not eating meat.
You know me better than you think.
You know me too well.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You're learning fast.
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get ill.
You left me in despair.
You let Tom escape.
You want your life, don't you?
You'll be all right.
You're gonna be confused.
You'll be in danger.
You'll be my guests.
You'll be familiar with time.
You'll feel better.
You're gonna get a copy.
You'll be better.
You'll get them back.
You're going to have a whiskey.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
You're going with me and the point!
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You're gonna have to learn better next year.
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
You're gonna need a ticket to travel the bus.
You're gonna have to sit still.
You'll never find her.
They'll never accept you in that club.
You'll never guess.
You'll never know.
You'll understand when it's time.
You looked beautiful.
You look familiar to me.
You look beautiful.
You look pretty bad.
You look so good.
You look sad.
You look imaginary.
You look very handsome, Tom.
You've earned something.
You gave your word.
You're worried me.
Maybe you're gonna need it.
You can go anywhere.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
You can sleep here.
It wouldn't be bad to slow down.
You met my sister, right?
Maybe you can help them.
You have to be careful.
You must be confused.
I'm sure it made you feel much easier.
You must've jumped.
You must be very proud.
You must be strong.
You have to show yourself first.
You have to forgive me.
You have to help her.
You've got to watch the kid.
You can't give up.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
You have to learn worthy.
You need a friend.
You need a good wife.
You need to buy some sugar.
You should do it somewhere else.
You need to make him listen.
You need to grow up and grow up a little.
You need to help her.
You need to help me find him.
You need to hurry.
You should do this to work.
You didn't ask why.
You didn't give us a chance.
We only have one life.
One is life.
You need to create a habit to wash your teeth at every meal.
You should go to the dentist.
You don't owe me anything.
You're paying me very well.
You chose a good one.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
It's gone red.
He ran as fast as he could.
Your car's burning.
Your car's burning.
Your complaints upset me.
Your offences disappointed the graves of your ancestors.
Your demands are unreasonable.
Your desserts are attractive, but we're sick.
You're ready to cry.
You're absolutely right.
You're a real man-ass.
You're acting weird.
You're a brook.
You're a fraud.
You're after them.
You're a good son.
You're a kind man.
You're all scary.
You're all the same.
You're really good.
But you lied to her.
You really need a psychiatrist.
You really should have let me call a cab.
You're always tired.
You're a moron.
You're nobody and nothing.
You're a pig.
You're a prisoner.
You're a racist.
You're such a scrubber.
You're smart.
You're a discreet man.
You're a wise man.
You're mean.
You're busy, aren't you?
You're capable, but you're screwing.
You're brave, aren't you?
You're nasty.
You're unorganized.
You're mean and denied.
You're experiencing.
You're righteous.
You're beautiful.
You're free.
You're a faggot.
You're gonna need help.
You're gonna need this.
You're doing this good.
You're in the middle of the nightmare.
You're hurting me.
You're not kicking me.
You're impressive.
Now you're responsible.
You're in power.
You're incapable.
You're influenced.
You took my place.
You're in no danger.
You're interesting.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
You're weakened to me.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're lucky.
You're lying to me.
You're angry with me, I can know.
You're great.
You're worried about Tom.
You're my neighbor.
You're not my friend.
You're not so young anymore.
You're not a freak.
You're not a woman.
You're not dressed.
You're not gonna find me.
You won't find them.
You won't find us.
You're under her level.
You're under his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not so horrible.
You don't suggest we give Tom all the money, do you?
You're not that old, Tom.
You're not too old for her.
Now you can go.
You're crazy!
But you're smart.
You're our guests.
You don't have any more alcohol.
You've got too much to do.
You're special.
You're part of our team.
You're a pessimist.
You're poor.
You're predictable.
You're tight.
You're absolutely safe.
You're really nice.
You're great.
You're very lucky.
You're laughing.
You're funny.
You're incultural.
You're disturbed!
I'm attracting you so much.
You're very dramatic.
You're very serviceable.
You're very passionate.
How negative you are.
You're a little rude.
You're kind of rude.
You're so intimate.
You're so talented.
You're stronger than Tom.
You're such a bug.
You're such a pig.
You need to help them.
You're pissing me off.
You're horrible.
You're the only one who can laugh at me.
You're the only one who met Tom.
You're the owner.
You're the prisoner.
You're the problem.
You're weak.
You've ruined your whole life.
You're too smart for that.
You're not trusted.
You're disgusting.
You're very smart.
You're very good with kids.
You're so lonely.
You're very direct.
You're so brave.
You're so cut off.
You can wait here.
You're among friends.
You're with Tom, right?
You misjudged it.
You're wrong, Tom.
You're lying, Tom.
Eyes look strange to you.
Your future begins today.
Your hair smells like spring.
You're too squeezing when you're shaking.
Your health is very important to me.
Your house is very beautiful.
You're a good memory.
Your moon's coming back.
Your mother put your collage in the top drawer.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
Your path is hard.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
Your excuse is up-down correct.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
Your faith is disgusting.
Your role here is so important.
Your shelf is full of books.
There's yours.
Your sister's sleeping.
Your sons are pretty handsome.
All your things are here.
Your wishes are my command.
Your patent is unticked.
That's what you said about an hour ago.
You told me to call anytime.
You said we'd never catch her.
You said you'd help.
You said you'd write me a message at night, but you lied to me, obviously.
You saved my life.
You look disoriented.
You seem to already know the answer.
You look like you're cold.
You seem to have an infection.
Looks like it's hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
Do you share his interest in this book?
You need to ask for help.
You should ask Tom.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Be careful not to exaggerate.
You should be happy for them.
You should be proud.
You should eat less red meat.
You should eat more.
You should feel flattered.
You need to get a good sleep.
You should give him some space.
You should give them some space.
You should go help him.
You should go to bed early.
You just need to talk to Tom.
You should pay your rent in advance.
He found who to talk, you only got 65.
You should try it.
You should try this.
You should try writing respects.
You should have asked her first.
You should wear a helmet while you drive a motorcycle.
You need to write a letter of thanks to Tom.
You smell like shit.
You sound like it makes you feel easier.
You sound very safe.
You've got your neck.
You're so beautiful.
You're really talking a lot.
You're talking too much about Boston.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
Traitor!
You two are very cute together.
You used to be so funny.
You used to love Boston.
You're back.
They drunk you.
You've experienced a traffic, but you'll be fine.
We missed you.
It was very helpful for us.
You're right from the beginning.
You were making white again!
You bought something to Mary.
You beat me.
You beat them.
You've done so much.
You scared her.
She's overwhelmed her!
You've got a rash.
You're loaded enough with anxiety.
You got me completely wrong.
I promise you.
You got it now, don't you?
You have to let me send a message to Tom.
You have to let me go home.
You have to work together.
You unfortunately collapsed Tom.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen much worse.
You've been delaying this for too long.
You saw what I could do.
You were incredible.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
You were lucky to survive the attack.
You made a mistake.
It's not that you were wrong.
You were right, Tom.
He drove fast.
You were great.
You're not sleeping all night, are you?
He was very brave.
You were wrong about the picture.
You'll do as I command you.
You'll find your toys and books.
You're not gonna need that.
You're not gonna make it.
You won't win.
You're too worried about him.
I wouldn't want you to be late.
Yeah, I'm angry.
