Father Joseph Vitko: I saw Jesus in a white dress
He's a charisma.
The sacred Mess of Liberation and the healing of him, they pull out the crowds.
He was 12 years old when his life began to happen unexplainable things.
Today, by means of a French Canan, others experience this.
To be carried by O. Holy Mass on Liberation and Healing, the crowds are pulling out
Once the parents of a seven-month child who had a hole of 7.5 mm in the heart came to him.
It was supposed to be surgery.
Father Joseph Whitko prayed for him.
The same day the boy was taken to the hospital for treatment.
The doctors were surprised to say: “Operation is not required, loss is only 1,5 mm. ”
My parents were crying for happiness.
After another prayer, the French hole disappeared completely.
The spiritual unusual activities of the Creator began to experience as a teenager.
In his dreams, cleaning souls came to him with a request for help.
I was awaken at night and prayed for the dead and those who died at the moment, he recalls.
He also experienced the presence of a bad spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits a mortal sin.
“My body began to change.
I lost human qualities and started taking up the animal's appearance," she says.
The invisible force took him up, and he couldn't get his voice out of himself.
He felt he was lost.
Then God showed him a salvation.
"From the waters of the river symbolising holy baptism, I have been released and returned to human form..." he tells.
He didn't tell anyone about these weird experiences.
It was an adult call in it.
He was 16 when he came to the French.
He wanted not only to tell about Jesus in his preaching work.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the Charisma Community Renewed in the Holy Spirit
In the father’s healing missions, Vitko participates in many who are counting on getting rid of the disease.
However, the spiritual emphasizes that their primary goal is spiritual healing, not fleshly.
First Failure of Kolping FRAC Jaroslav
Today (September 26th) the afternoon team of Kolping FRAC earned the current Master of Poland Dartom Bogoria Mazowiski Grodjesk within the 3rd row of LOTTO Superliga of Table Tennis.
The Jaroslavians in such a personal composition they represented with the citizens have no chance to win with the sovereigns of the League.
It was victory showed a fight with Darth Bogoria.
The team still lacks a team called for a team leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps with him, the jaroslavians would have reached a third triumph in a new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han has not yet grown to win with tuzs such as Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Paul Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most perspective Polish, or Mark Badowski.
Hellady's rival was the biggest battle star in the MOSIR hall at Sikorsky Street in Jaroslavi.
Both at the start of Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was a class for himself.
After three units of Kolping FRAC drove 2:1.
Kou Lei must have covered Mark Badowski, and Daniel Gorak after an emotional, five-set fight, Paul Siruck.
But then he was worse.
Gionis didn't give Lea a chance.
You could still have hoped for winning for two points, but Qiyao Han didn't match Badowski.
There will be no additional studies for seniors.
Why?
According to Rafala Traskowski's prophecies, a free preventive programme for seniors aged 70 and 80 should be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not obtained the adoption of the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Tariff.
In reason, the Agency explained that the target group was misconducted.
“The following actions may even affect the detection of individual sickness units, which may contribute to improving the difficulty in access to NFZ contributions and have a negative impact on the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a falsely positive result of the research”, stated.
The resort's decision doesn't understand the President of the capital.
"The money is ours, we have foreseen it.
Only the government is afraid that if people examine, then they will go to a doctor, which is absurd, because it's just about to lead to a situation where prevention can be done faster.
All experts know that this helps with the burden of the health system, because it helps to quickly identify diseases and genuine health approaches.
The government has a very strange position here which I don't understand," said Rafal Trasskovski.
“I find it hard to imagine that the running experts say, ‘ Let's not examine, because there will be longer queries in the doctor, and if such experts advise the government, I'm not surprised that there is a health service in this state’s condition,’ added Po politicians.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all so far agreements
The Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced on Thursday at the General Assembly of the United Nations that it will break all agreements with Israel if the future government of this country attempts to fulfil the Benjamin Netanjah's prophecy of the occupied Palestinian land.
"If the Israeli government has come up, it will join the implementation of this plan, we will discontinue all the signed agreements (s Israel) and retreat from all the commitments taken," he prophesied.
"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely," Abbas said.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible measures -- not very important to what the consequences will be -- to engage fully in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism," said the President of the Palestinian Autonomy, who had already made similar declarations in July.
Netanjah, the so far Prime Minister of Israel, after the elections of September 17 receiving a government mission.
On a week before the elections, he prophesied that if he wins them, he will announce the anxiety of the Jordan Valley and intends to include all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank.
In the early 1990 ’ s, Israel and the Palestinian leaders, Jaser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements patronised by the United States.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised during the General Assembly of the United Nations to take place in the lands of the Palestinian general elections.
The last was in 2006.
"When I return to the country, I will call in the West Coast, in the Gaza Area and East Jerusalem local elections and all those who oppose them will have to answer their actions before God and the international community," the Palestinian President declared the celebrated.
Abbas also defended in his talk of Palestine's rights, treated as a permanent observer in the United Nations, for the use of the privileges of “complete members of the United Nations and all its bodies and institutions”.
The Palestinian leader finished the talk by calling to the international community to “force Israel to fulfil with respect to the provisions of the United Nations”.
Israel’s Ambassador Danny Danon answered briefly to Abbass' speech, saying that the Palestinian leader “will focus on the UN efforts of the Palestinian Autonomy against Israel rather than to fight the calls for terrorism in Autonomy under his leadership. ”
Danon, however, noted by the agencies, did not refer to the surveillance of the occupied Palestinian lands in Netanjah.

Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to steal Casper Dolberg's clock
It happened on September 16th.
Dolberg, who at the end of August arrived from Ajax Amsterdam to Nicea, realized after training that his watch disappeared from his dress.
Not much, because it's worth 70,000 euros.
The angry Danish next day didn't show up at classes, interpreting stomach problems.
It was a mystery thing from the beginning.
The footballs in the dress have private safes, and the club area is monitored.
According to AFP's agency, he finally confessed to Diaby-Fadiga.
The 18-year-old apologize to Dolberg and other colleagues from the team and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised the Dunjan to return the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most perspective footballers of the young generation in France.
He arrived in Nicea as a 13-year-old to debut in the first team three years later.
In this season, he showed up in seven matches.
He recently signed a professional contract, but, as the newspaper L'Equipe said, the club will probably solve it with the immediate effect.
For now, he has initiated a disciplinary proceedings against his competitor.
Nice, at least officially, refuses comments on this matter.
See if you can wash your hands well.
We all know that they need to be washed (e. g. after coming home or before eating).
But not everyone knows that if you really want to get rid of the diseases, you have to do it the right way.
This is important especially now when the autumn infections are coming.
It takes at least 30 to 40 seconds to remove sufficiently dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands
And most of us are washing shorter!
It's enough warm water and ordinary soap – it's not true that it has to be antibacterial (a lots of doctors even advise them).
By washing it, we wash not only the bottoms and the tops of our hands, but also: the ends of our fingers (connected or single) – shave them with colstible movements in the inside of the second hand, the space between your fingers (pass your hands, shaving your fingers) and the fingers – we cover each finger with another hand, and in that arm we turn it a moment to the right and left.
In an emergency situation (when you can't wash your hands) we should wipe the hands with a wet cloth and then use an antibacterial gel (in roads, from 5 zls).
When you use the public toilet, don't touch the washed arms of cloaks or doors (recommendation of the Main Sanitary Inspector).
Open it through the paper towel.
President of Iran said he rejected the proposal for the US talks, Donald Trump denies
Teheran did not talk to the US party during the United Nations General Assembly in New York, despite the offer made by the Americans to withdraw sanctions, President Hasan Rowhani announced on Friday.
The President of the United States Donald Trump commented that the Iranian site asked for revocation, which he disagreed with.
According to President Iran Hassan Rowhani, the Americans suggested that all the sanctions imposed on Teheran in exchange for negotiations on the new international agreement.
It should regulate both the Iranian nuclear programme as well as the balistic missile construction programme.
Rowhani: Iran won't talk in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The President of Iran stated that he did not agree to take these conversations because of the “toxic atmosphere. ”
He said he met with the American diplomats because he was in favour of France, Germany and the Great Britain.
However, he emphasized that Iran would not talk in the atmosphere of “maximal pressure. ”
"And even if we want to negotiate with Americans in format 5+1, no one can predict what the final outcome will be," Rowhani said.
On the day earlier, the Iranian leader said he did not exclude the U.S. talks, and the European Parties to the Nuclear Agreement rejected the acceptance of American sanctions against Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the United States appearance of the nuclear agreement are “the preliminary condition that does not allow” to establish a dialogue.
If we can endure this preliminary condition and if America endures the sanctions and the maximum pressure, then, of course, we can talk to America – he declared.
He added that he did not exclude a meeting with US President Donald Trump, although he did not agree on such a conversation during the week during the United Nations General Assembly.
Trump: "Iran asked, I said no."
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he rejected the Iranian request.
"Iran wanted me to endure the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said no! ” the President of the United States said.
Atomic agreement voltage in the background
France, Germany and Great Britain are trying to mitigate tensions between Washington and Teheran in order to save an agreement with Iran of 2015, which were signatories.
It stated that, in exchange for the discontinuation of Iran's economic sanctions, it would quit the nuclear weapon building programme and the nuclear sector will be subject to the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the US agreement in May 2015, its signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to maintain an agreement in force.
Well, for now, it didn't work out.
Washington uses the maximum pressure tactics on Iran and sanctions include full embargo on Iranian oil.
Teheran foretold that if he does not receive the export licence of a raw material, he will limit his obligations resulting from the agreement every 60 days.

The Judge of the Warsaw Administrative Court of Warsaw and the husband of Emilia, who, according to her words and screens from WhatsAppa, participated in the prosecution of judges, was restored to the NSA on Wednesday.
The reason is: no disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against him and there is no basis to support the WSA President Vojciech Mazur to dismiss it from his responsibilities.
At the end of August, the Judge of Chromic Jerze, the Disciplinary Prosecutor of the NSA, introduced an explanatory procedure against Schmidt, but it has not changed against him until now.
Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must take care of the decision of the WSA President within a month after its publication.
In this situation, the judge, who publicly told his wife's mental problems to discredit her, which was removed from the CRC's office, will return to a judgment on behalf of the Polish Response.
Judge Schmidt denies his share in the heater group.
He claims that there is no evidence to it except for fake screens and the words of his wife, which he divorces.
Exactly the same claim is that the other judges associated with the Cast: they are all innocent, there are no evidence.
And it's quite possible that they're putting on their own.
Because the prosecutor didn't swallow a finger to secure evidence from their electronic messengers, he also silent about the contents of Emilia Schmidt's phone, who stopped this phone in June in another case.
The police didn't chew their fingers to secure the devices of the persecutors he indicated in February, Judge Waldemar Žurek.
There's no evidence - there's no case of Schmidt, there's no Casty case.
There is also no case with the chief of NIK Marian Banasia to rent a stone stone and hide income.
CBA is checking his property statements.
And he'll see when he'll check.
However, the Commission of Ambassador's Embassy will not be concerned with Banas, because the Seima is suspended (but the Commission of State Control has somehow gathered to take a curiosal decision to revoke Banasia and to call as his lawyer, although the law does not predict such a strange combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie, an American mistake, about the way my wife comes home and she gets her husband and her lover in bed.
She's so surprised and crushed that she can't crush the words.
She's standing in the door of the heemala, and at that time a lover jumps out of bed, dresses and leaves.
And my husband was laying a bed.
When a wife gets her voice back and shouts, what is it?
Who is this woman?
My husband asks calmly, what woman, honey?
Only about Casty or Banasia, the parody of the country.
And that's not funny.

Moravecki Cornel is in a severe state hospital
He got to the hospital, and the doctors define his condition as hard.
He's conscious and conscious.
"We believe it will come out, and it will win again.
We all pray to get back to health," said an anonymous closer person to Cornel Moravecki in the conversation with journalists of the Super Express.
In the coming election, the Prime Minister's father candidates to the Senate.
"The nearest family and politics keep me in life," Cornel Moravecki said in an interview, which he gave to the journalists "Super Express" two weeks ago.
In January, “Super Express” informed that 78-year-old Cornel Moravecki went to the Military hospital in Wroclavia.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms, and I went to the hospital.
Turns out I've got a yellow.
But the worst thing was before me.
When an examination was carried out by the computer tomatograph, it was found that I had a cancer of cancer...", the prime minister's father passed.
A few days later, the MSBIA hospital in Warsaw, Cornel Moravecki, passed a serious operation.
As Moravecki told, President Andrej Duda sent his personal priest Priest Zbigniev Krass to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and went successfully.
“I know that many people prayed for me for what I thank you very much.
Fortunately, I don't have any leverages.
I don't know if I'm going to go through chemotherapy yet.
I give myself to doctors of specialists who are rather good thoughts.
For now, after this severe operation, I have to get back to some state of use.
I hope everything will be all right," said Cornel Moravecki in January in a conversation with "SE".
"If I surrendered too late, it would have been a tragic situation and I'd say goodbye to the fall," I added.
Knights: 14-year-old missing

Anyone who has any information about the missing is asked to contact.
She disappeared on September 26th night, she left the place of residence, and until now she has not returned or had no contact with her loved ones.
She was last visited at the old Guest Street in Krakow.

When she was last seen, she was dressed in a blue, gray pants and shoes.

The power of the Olaw jumps.
The title of the amateur sports competitions played on Sunday afternoon 15 September at the hypodrome at Oleandra Street in Olava, may be mistaken for some.
To the real power, the road is far away, but that is the name is one of the types of horse competition...
The jumping competition is to overcome the rider and horse’s increasing obstacles, which are even two metres higher in the most prestigious international competitions.
It is worth adding that the long and still unbeaten world record, established in 1949 by Chilian Albert Larraguibel, on the horse of Huaso, is 247 cm.
So high in Olava, of course, no one jumped, but the results of the best local Amazons at the level of 135 cm also don't belong to the worst...
Contests organized by the untrusted John Sienkiewich and other JKS actors “In the side” were a show part of the “Trust riding competitions ” on page 22.
Eight Amazons who trained the ride in the Slovak JKS were competitive.
Four competitives competed in dogs and four on big horses.
In the first group, Nicolas Soldra, who was the best in the first group, was sitting with a crazy Sprinter.
This small, but how a dynamic rum began with the overcoming of the obstacles of 40 cm, and ended only at the top of the upper white steel distant from the ground by 125 cm.
However, he did not easily surrender and only after three further refusals, the jury had been removed from further competition.
The second place in the popcorn jumps was Amelia Pawlak, who was seated by "Fami", and the third Lena Borun in Harmider.
An ambitious fight was the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Axman, screaming and jumping through obstacles on a small carmen stick.
Even more emotions were accompanied by the running Amazons and the viewers during the competition with large horses.
Aggressive declines included Paulina Šewczyk, the “Declaration” and Anastasia Abramenko, who was on the Lotce.
Fortunately, there was nothing wrong to the horses, except for minor disturbances or Amazons, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with the introduction of the young Vineta parking had the Veronika Luczkievic.
It needed either a coach assistant, or another horse to a pair, behind whom a little crazy Wineta screwed.
After the parking obstacle, she was also swift, so at times in the boxes and at the discharge, it was dangerous. “ Everything is under control! ”
From the beginning of the big horses' competition, Marta Masalska was beautifully presented in the parking lot.
This valuable stick, in a couple with an experienced Amazon, after the second approach in the final phase as the first skipped 135 cm and this was the best result of competition at this point.
After a moment, however, Paulina Šewczyk was also included in the “Declaration”, Veronica Luckiewicz at Vinete and Anastasia Abramenko on the Lotce.
In the decoration of the flo and after the receipt of the awards in the form of a riding equipment, all these competitors left together, and eventually together with Amazons on the ponches in the Radecki march, they made an effective honour round, ending with these interesting and emotional competitions.
Thank you
The Sports Club “In Siodle” thanks the sponsors of the jumping power competition during the 16th “Trust Training Facility”: the City Office in Olawa, the Facility of Water Trainers and Canalization in Olova, the Civil Administration and the Mustang company.
Max Colonko is cut off from KWW Patriotical Revolution Max Colonko
KWW Patriotical Revolution Max Colonko is the name of the election committee under which the political form #R Revolution of the Major Max Colony would go to October's parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal especially to young voters on right-hand views.
Before the elections, the Colonko proclaimed collaboration with Mark Jacob, or Paul Cookies, but none of these coalitions occurred, and the KWW Patriotical Revolution of Max Colonko could not even collect enough signatures to put the lists in any circuit in Poland.
Now Colonko informed on Twitter that he completed collaboration with the KWW Patriotical Revolution of Max Colonko.
"I will expect from in/in the KWW to remove my name from the name.
Please, please, disconnect my person with the in/in the mentioned entity," he added and predicted that more information will be provided soon.
For now it is not known whether the journalist will continue his action, whether it is the end of the formation #R Revolution.
On July 4th, at the American Day of Independence, a journalist in the United States, Mariar Max Colonko, informed about the creation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Colonko was famous of running the YouTube channel Max TV, which commented on events in Poland and in the world.
"We have plenty of politicians, quite your stupid games, your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities of the country to take over the nation and rule for the benefit of the people," he then said, Colonko.
In the party's programme, there were, inter alia, legal issues (i.e., must be chosen in general elections), tax changes (reliable amounts for all), military reparations (in the form of military assistance for the Eastern NATO flank, with special consideration of Poland), the implementation of a referendum on the possession of weapons, the reduction of the number of ambassadors or the introduction of one-end election circuits.
A few days after the announcement of the new political formation, Major Max Kolonko joined Marc Jacob.
At the end of July, Colonko put on his profile in social media information suggesting that #R will connect forces with the movement of Kukiz'15.
However, none of these coalitions has eventually occurred.
UBS: Golds close to the balance point
"The euro course will be maintained in the nearest months in the area of the ceiling 4.35 evil, which will be accompanied by a weak association in global markets," Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management announced.
"The expectation of maintaining a solid growth rate and stable monetary policy speaks to stabilize the gold notes on the current ceiling," the Bankier.pl estimates.
In spite of its clear inflation pressure, the Money Policy Council does not decide to raise foot in the environment where the vast majority of central banks mitigate the policy.
“If the gold is actually evaluated – the euro notation should be maintained in the nearest months in the area of the ceiling 4.35 zl – it considers that the Polish bonds are so little attractive.
Much more favourable profitability than Polish papers offer bonds from the emerging markets," estimates Michael Bolliger, head of the asset allocation for markets emerging in UBS Wealth Management.
According to a specialist, the major threat to the Polish economy is the worsening of the world's conjuncture.
“Global slowness can still be deeper, but it should not occur to a severe recession, and at least to the departure of the GDP’s dynamic less than zero”, Michael Bolliger states.
“Investors should disregard global actions that may be harmful to the lack of the perspectives of the solution to the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including the procedure of Donald Trump's impeachment and brexit.
Among the stock markets, Europe should behave relatively weakest," the latest letter to the main author's UBS Wealth Management of Mark Haefel shows.
"Actions from the euro area should be worse than American countries, because they are more substantial in terms of increased uncertainty about global trade and fear of slowness," the document reads.
Michael Bolliger believes that after the hosso at the most secured countries' markets, the German 10-year-old profitability even to minus 0.74% is still possible to increase the decline of profitability.
However, long-term profitability of long-term papers should no longer fall, but only short-term, with the relief of monetary banks.
The largest field to lower the feet has the Fed, which should lead to the weakening of the American currency in the next years.
The long-term balance point for euro notes is a trap of $1.29 USD, which would mean a 19 per cent potential to strengthen the shared currency to the dollar.
We expect further declines from the Fed's feet, which will result in reducing the differences in monetary policy in the world.
"To keep the dollar force in a long term, the deficit may not be allowed on the current and budgetary account," Michael Bolliger said.

More than that, the investigations have made it possible to find only a single part of the lost equipment.
Martina Renner summarized the effects of these actions as "poor balance".
It also criticized that the composition did not indicate whether there was also a weapon found in the investigation of Lieutenant Bundeswehra Franco A. In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening State security and violating the rules of law governing access to firearms.
The officers have been accused of preparing murders against the leading German politicians from extremely right and racist initiatives.
On his “black list” of goals that had fallen into the hands of the prosecutor, heiko Maas from SPD, Claudia Roth from the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, the defenders of human rights and the founder of the foundation of Amadeu Antonio Stiftung in Berlin.
Franco A. entered illegally in possession of four firearms, over 1,000 ammunitions and more than 50 explosives.
The crying children in the plane.
How can we avoid them?
There's a solution
Japan Airlines has recently used the function designed for persons for whom traveling in a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the web site, the aircraft will be able to be able to check the locations in the aircraft.
If a connection travels to a minor year of age, the “icon of the child ” appears on a specific, reserved by parents or seatkeepers.
Consequently, the person who uses the carrier services has the opportunity to choose a place away from that of the kid.
The BBC indicates that the lines have already informed the failure of this solution.
‘Icon of the Child’ will not appear at the time when the ticket was reserved by a third party or if the aircraft has changed at the latest.
As expected, the idea divided the internauts.
Some Twitter users indicate that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved with noise reducing listeners.
They're kids, and we used to be them.
"We must learn tolerate, because we will soon start to need maps of sitting places for breathing mouths, sliding or drunken," said G Sundar user.
Another internaut observed that he once had been disturbed by crying children in a plane, but he changed his mind when he became a parent.
There are also no missing members of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
"Thank you for warning me from screaming children during the 13-hour journey," said Rahat Ahmed.
Major counts losses after the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook's travel office
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not arrive in October for a vacation on Majorka, as a result of a bankruptcy announced on Monday by the travel office of Thomas Cook.
As the autonomous representative of the Balear Marc Pons informed on Friday, among the 25,000 temporary people who will not be able to use the October vacation in Majorca, there are also those who were to travel with companies directly linked to Thomas Cook, for example Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80 per cent of the expected timelines, which due to the fall of the British company, had to resign from the rest in Majorca next month, are German citizens and skandinaw countries.
However, as Pons claims, since Thomas Cook did not guide tourists during November-April, losses for the local economy will be less.
He revealed that the Government of Balears had already launched negotiations with international operators on "the entry into the Majorka market" after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to Diario de Mallorca, there is more than 1,000 people who will lose work in October because of a tourist crisis in Majorca.
About 800 are fired employees of Thomas Cook's office in Palma.
Others will lose job mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, with the announcement of decline by Thomas Cook in many hotels, Majorki owners of facilities demanded from the guests to pay additional residence fees.
This situation was experienced by several dozen tourists from Poland.
The Government of Balears estimates that by Thursday, several ten hotels in Majorca sustained the activities at least by the end of October with the announcement of fall by Thomas Cook and cooperating companies.
The Friday magazine Diario de Ibiza indicates that most hotels that worked with the Thomas Cook group are not intending to close places in the next few weeks.
The newspaper recalls that on this balear island, the British bankruptte cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous authorities of Balears announced that they would return to the Spanish government to support the region of 100 million euros to cover the losses caused by the bankruptcy by the travel office of Thomas Cook.
They revealed that the most damaged in this tourist architecture, some 36,000 people, is located in Majorca.
According to the Balear Government, Thomas Cook is dependent on local tourist companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of agreements on July-September 2019 about 5 million euros.

‘Rz’: Smog has oppressed the government
"The Effects of the "Clean Air" program are null, and the coal pieces will collapse this winter as if nothing", we read on the first page of today's "Rachpositive".
“To this time, the Air Clean has submitted 82,000 proposals for a total value of 2 billion evil, of which 48,000 decisions were positive.
The accepted proposals are summary of over 915 million evils,” states the Rz, referring to information from the Minister of Environment.
As the newspaper indicates, only part of the costs paid are returned from the programme.
The results of the programme's pronounced noise, the journal estimates as "correct".
The self-governers quoted by “Rz” are observed by the failures of “Clean Air”, including in too large bureaucracy.
“The programme should be much simpler: electronic notification, sending invoices by mail, possibly exemption control.
This would improve the action," says Lizbark Warminski Jacek Wisniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog alarm note that in the first year of action, less than 1 per cent of the target for the exchange of 3 million coals.
As Rz notes, although the programme budget is 103 billion evil for 10 years, or 10 billion evils annually, this amount is virtual.
“In the budget of the National Environment and Water Economy Fund for this year, a raptom of 1.4 billion evils has been reserved”, we read.

The US Congress agreed to sale Poland 32 of the most recent F-35 aircraft.
"This is one of the last steps before the contract is concluded, but it is not the end of our work," said Mr. Blastak in Twitter.

Contract in Polish F-35
Polish air forces have 32 target F-35 Lightning II hunters produced by Lockheed Martin.
In the mid-September, the Department of the United States expressed consent for their sale to Poland.
The Communication emphasized that the investment will support national security and foreign policy by improving the security of the NATO ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
The information from the Department of State shows that Poland is to pay $6.5 billion for hunters.
However, this is not the final price.
The Department of State noted that the contract would also include supply of replacement and repairs, training equipment, engineering, logistics and staff services and related elements of logistics and programme support and training.
The Lockheed hunters Martin F-35
F-35 Lightning II, produced by Lockheed Martin, is a one-way and one-way hunter of the fiveth generation.
The plane is capable of executing close support missions, bombing and typically hunting air fighting tasks.
With the use of stealth technology, the hunter is undetectable for the radars of close range.
The F-35 hunter recently bought Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the old F-16.
The purchase of US fighting planes should also be considered by other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Barbie versus stereotype.
Gender Dolls
Barbie producer introduced a series of sexual neutral dolls to the market.
That's how he wants to fight stereotypes.
Barbie producer introduced a series of sex-neutral dolls
Besides Barbie with different colors of skin, figures or hair, the Mattel company led to selling sexual neutral dolls.
The games with the "Creatable World" are wearing feathers.
So children can decide whether Barbie should have short hair or long.
Their dress consists of pants and dresses.
In a moment, dolles can become boys and be the opposite of girls.
They are also available in different colours of skin and with different clothes.
It was also quit by emphasizing the characteristics of sexual characteristics – gender dolls no longer have full mouths, long grains and a thin tail or, in Ken, wide arms.
The company believes that children don't like when their dolls have abandoned sex standards, and some parents and feminists are convinced that the toys made with a specific sex prevent the ambition of girls and strengthen traditional stereotypes.
"The new dolls will allow all children to feel free," states Mattel.
The Doll Barbie, who appeared on the market in 1959 in a bath and high shoe, was repeatedly criticised in the past for promoting “healthy women’s stereotypes, ” such as an unnatural body proportion.
The concern responded to the criticism and already introduced a doll market with different colors of skin and more rounded shapes.
The dolls also showed up in the hijaba.

"I believe that the result of Lewis will be very good, because we feel that people are bound to hope that Levica is not only right, but also strong," he noted.
According to Zandberg, the left may have 60 to 80 ambassadors.
"This may mean that around the club or the club together will have several ambassadors.
But it depends on Poles and the Poles.
I will not guess and tell you how this will happen," he said.
Asked whether Levica will have a separate circle together, Zandberg answered: “We are scheduled to be diversity, and we will not pretend that there is no diversity.
I think this diversity was rewarded by the Poles because we showed that by differentity, we could deal with the common program."
Asked whether the biggest beneficiaries of the common start is the leader of SLD Vladimer Charzasty, Zandberg answered that he believed that the biggest beneficiaries were central and left electors.
On the other hand, the SLD will receive the entire subsidy, and he said that “the purpose of the political party is to represent its voters”.
Zandberg admitted that he would vote on himself in the elections to Seima.
In the case of the elections to the Senate, he said he was wondering.
"The offer is a variety and the offer is the candidates and candidates to which my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart continues to be," he stated.
"I will, however, be very honest and clear that if I had found myself in the 44 Senatic District, I would take a vote and vote in another circuit," politics stressed.
“I don't think I would try to make a vote to Minister Kazimerovski (Ko - PAP candidate),” he added.
In this district outside the Ujezdowski, the leader of RP Paul Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PIS are launched.
Dakar: Opened the biggest machete in Western Africa
Thousands of thousands of people in Senegal gathered together on Friday in the capital for the inauguration of a huge machete considered the biggest in Western Africa.
The Muslims arrived by buses, cars, and walks to the neighborhood of Bopp, where a new machete was able to place 30,000 faithful ones.
The object was built by the Mouride Brother, belonging to the Suffix Nurt of Islam, which dominates in Senegal.
The work on the machete began ten years ago in a wet area of six hectares transmitted by the government.
The name of the Massalikul Jinan machete (‘Paradise Paths to Paradise’) comes from the title of the sequence of Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th century founder of the brotherhood, worshiped as holy.
The machete is situated in a cararian marble and has five minaretes.
The highest of them is 78 meters.
The machete in the middle places 15,000 faithful ones, and the second one can be on an external esplanade.
In richly finished inners, you can admire the golden kupole, giant lirandols and manual decorations carried out by workers in Morocco.
Builders claim that the machete is the biggest in Western Africa, but the mushrooms are still not compared to machetes in other regions.
In Morocco, the machete of Hassana II in Casablanca may include 105,000 faithful ones.
The construction of a machete cost more than 30 million euros has been financed from private donations.
The government, in addition to the land, funded lighting, sanitary devices and financed road jobs of €10.5 million.

Later, the kilting recorded two remissions and six failures, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 with Deep Lubin in the 1/32 final of Poland Puchar.
“I am optimistic that in the last seconds of the ballball game, the footballers were fighting for the gate, they wanted to remode.
Their fall on the wall after the last whistle did not result in a breakdown, but it was a fall of anger because they were so close," Smyla said.
As he noted, Slosh has very strong wings, so he will allergize the team to play in side sectors of the field.

These trees can completely disappear from Europe
“42% of the species of trees on the tree of Europe is threatened”, warns the International Union of Nature Protection (IUCN) published in Friday “Red Tree Book of European Trees”.
The lists are headed, including castano and wooden.
IUCN, a organisation in Gland, Switzerland, publishs a list of the European trees in danger for the first time.
It was compiled by specialists who, based on research, concluded that between 454 species of trees in Europe (and other places of the world) 42% are “a highly threatened”.
The Red book exchanges rapid growth in urban aglomeration and global climate change.
However, those trees and stomachs are most in danger, which only or mostly occur on our continent.
With regard to the typically European tree, IUCN specialists are in danger of 58 percent of species and 15 per cent, i.e. 66 species of trees and bovines, are threatened to disappear.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red book exchanges errors in the wood management, accelerate urbanization, too intense drought, and further forest fires and changes in the European Ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, many European species of bovine, moss and rise are also in danger.
"The consequences of human activities lead to a gradual disappearance of European species of plants and create in Europe the danger of extinction of important and underestimated species that are the basis of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet," the report of Luc Bas, which runs the European IUCN office, summarized.
Gregorz Schetin: I don't promise 600+
"Today, the PIS wants to borrow the Poles, offering them a loan for freedom, which will have to pay for future generations," said Gregorz Schetyna in an intelligence for "Recpospolite".
He says, "the whole PS policy is a pic."
At the same time, the politicians promise that “what is given will not be taken away”.
Shetina assures Jack Nizinkiewich that he has an idea to overcome the Law and Justice.
It's about mobilizing the electorate at the electoral urnas.
He believes that the opposition has more potential in this regard than the Caczynski Party.
“ Today, people who want to live in a normal country are more than PS servants, a party that has confessed to the values of the preaching, such as humility, humility, transparency," Schettina says.
The leader of the Civil Coalition and Chairman of the Civil Platform also noted the basic foundations of the KO Election Programme.
"Firstly, nothing that is given will not be taken away, but it must be given a direction to the future, because the PIS is only dealing with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which you can see after dramaticly low investments," he stated.
Secondly, it is “the movement of the Polish energy, the assistance and investment in those who work firmly - and those who are entrepreneurs”.
Shetina explains that in the KO program, there is an project that, in particular, the least earning Polacima will give more than 614 gold on hand, and more earningers, also a few hundred.
The politician also noted that he didn't want to race a broadcast.
As he said, he'll do as much as he can, but he doesn't promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek option, where the rulers are liquidated with the opposition to the broadcast until the financial country has finally fallen," he emphasized.
Schetin in the RR interview also stated that Jaroslav Kaczynski and Matheus Moravecki feared to debate with him and the Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonia.
"We'd have acquired their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
"The pride moves before the fall.
Kakinski is a man of state like Banasa is crystal," he added.
The leader of Po also said that he has not yet decided whether to seek to guide the Platform.
Argentina: Six dead large condors
In the Argentine province Santa Cruz, six dead large condors were found – TVN24 informs.
Specialists believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
The big condors were probably poisoned by means of killing predators like pums, foxes or wild dogs.
Animals could have eaten a toxic rain.
Besides one young person, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
"It is a huge environmental loss, because the condor must reach 10 to 15 years to become fertility and reproduction.
So we lose the protected species, the species threatened," says Luis Jacome, director of BioAndina Foundation, the Argentine Environmental Protection Organization.
"I think that the use of toxic bait and poison is not only at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health," he adds.
“Rz: They want jewelry for the President
They've been working on the confession of the head of the precious state chain.
The idea was supported by Andrey Dudy's office – we read in the "Rachpospolite".
As the newspaper explains, it is a golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignation officially called during the period of the military bill of the Realypospolite.
It's probably the last time the President of Ignacy used it.
“Rz” indicates that such a chain may soon affect Andrey Dudy's arms.
The Senacka Commission for Human Rights, Legality and Petition voted on a Wednesday proposal for a newization of the Law on Orders and Markets in order to restore it.
The Journal states that it is not also the first attempt to restore this chain to the State's head.
In 1992, the Senate proposed such an amendment, but it disappeared by one voice.
This time, the work is lightning.
At the beginning of August, the Senators devoted this case for a few minutes, recognizing that they will reach the opinion of the Bureau of the President.
This one came in half September.
"I will be polite to inform the Office of the President of the RP of no comments to the position presented in this petition," said then President Andrej Dera.
On Wednesday, the Senatic Commission continued and devoted a little time again.
"The President's office answered us shortly: it's behind to restore it," said the chief of the PIS Commission Robert Mammotow, quoted by Rz.
It submitted a proposal for legislative work that the Commission supported.
Police will teach drivers how to ride through crossing.
The police action will be carried out, inter alia, at the Al. Hepatic from Al. Pilsudski crossing.
The uniform actions have some kind of connection with the recent complaints of the city's authorities against drivers who are not always able to act appropriately on crossing.
On Friday, September 27, the police start the prevention of the Prevention Cross.
It's about eliminating difficulties in the movement: crossing without a trip, non-compliance with light signals or road signs.
"We often think that we are alone in crossing, and we actually make life difficult for other drivers," Marek Ustrobinski, vice-president of the city, said a few days ago.
His words appeared at a press conference of a council, where the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate movement of cars after crossing, which in effect creates corridors.
At that time, the President appealed to travellers to reason on the road and, for example, to move faster on lights or not to write messages during the ride.
The theme was kind of overwhelmed by cops who have been starting the “Present Cross. ”
What's the matter?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of restricting crossing by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing driving.
This is a frequent offence that contributes to strengthening difficulties in moving and creating steps.
It is threatened by a mandate of 300 evils and 2 penalties.
Furthermore, uniforms will pay attention to non-compliance with light signals or road signs and the incorrect parking in the crossing area.
They will also observe the lack of liquidity, late movement under the signals, free crossing and leaving too large distances between vehicles.
What crossings will be carried out?
Lisa-Kuli from Jagiellonsk; al. Heeplinsky from Al. Pilsudsky; Al. Targ of Al. Pilsudski; Sreniawith Place of Dubrovski or Hetmansky from Warsaw Rebels.
This type of action in the capital of Podcarpacia will be carried out in the next Friday of October.

According to the accounts of the attendees in the class, the world's champion trainer was awkward.
As Haynen Assistant Michael Michko Gogol noted, this time the main task was not the training of sitting elements.
"We went to the hall, but mostly it was time for the team.
It was about spending him more together than training.
Talk, think about how to rebuild it as a team," he related.
He confirmed that half-final failure was a painful lesson for both rivals and training stakeholders.
“We have been violently brought to the ground.
Without two sentences, we're disappointed.
We still believed we'd be back to this game.
We discussed this game in the headquarters, coach talked a lot to the players.
As two main causes of failure, I would indicate ineffectiveness in the attack and much worse than usual to deal with situation balls.
The Slovenians were much better in this regard than we were," he analysed.
He believes that the “White-Red” has not been obstacle to stress, linked to the event that has been supported by a loud and numerous publicity to the tournament companions.
He confessed that the world's masters could sleep a little smooth way to the semi-final.
"Maybe if a group fatal failure occurred to us in a similar way, it would be faster to analyze this lesson and then otherwise we would play a further stage of the tournament.
But it's just a hunch," he warned.
Gogol hopes that the wrath associated with the Thursday Failure of Polacima will be able to aggression in the brown game.
"I hope we will then show our real face.
There's something to fight about.
The ME medal we fought last in 2011," he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is a third country visited by the Poles during these championships.
In the group phase, they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, and at the first two group phases they went to Apeldoorn, and they moved to Lublana.
Nick Kyrgios: raw punishment, but suspended
The Australian tennisman received a 16-week launch ban and a penalty of $25,000 in the semi-year suspension – for cruel words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournament.
The ATP World Tour actors are losing their patience to Kyrgios, but they still give him a chance to improve.
Summary of the most unrearned professional tennisman recent years seems to be dangerous – 16 weeks of break plus fever, but both penalties are suspended for six months – a period of testing in which a poor sportsman will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been working for a long time and has made his own tennis record of the world – he had to pay the highest in the history of discipline for breaking the rules of behaviour and beside it.
Volume curses, strange gestures, non-sport behaviour, insulting judge and viewers, breaking two rockets during the lost game with Karen Chachanow -- all after the August ATP Masters 1000 in Cincinnati paid $113,000.
In the US Open 2019 he also played no long, but he was able to publicly say that the ATP actors were “corrupted”, which hurt the authorities of the organization so much that they conducted a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and, after a few weeks, the verdict on the suspension of launching and another penalty.
However, the words of corruption were forgiven, after hearing the accused and the knowledge of the context of the statement.
However, in reason of the tennis actors, the investigation showed that the conduct of Kyrgios throughout the past 12 months in many cases was a serious objection and was almost a continuous violation of the rules that he had insulted in a volatile manner of tournament and viewers, from here on high punishment.
However, ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately deferred the execution of the judgment, ordering the fulfilment in the next six months of several conditions: at the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios tour can no longer violate the rules of procedure of the existing professional tennisists, in particular cannot curse more, destroy rockets, dispute with judges and publicity, nor any other way to be adherently and vulgarly.
He also received a recommendation to seek “continued support ” from mental trainers during the tournaments and also consulted with those specialized in addressing the problems of sports who do not deal with the right behaviour.
The first comment (in social media) of Nick Kyrgios to the verdict was: “Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just have to control my behaviour, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, since his injury of the bark in the Puchar Lavera has ripped, so he had to quit the nearest starts in Beijing (30 September to 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).
In the ATP Kyrgios ranking, it takes 27th place.
This year he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, he earned more than 1.3 million dollars, so even after his fines he will have a lot left.
GUS: In Poland, it's getting better
From the report published by the GUS on household budgets on Friday, it shows that as a good or rather good material situation, it evaluated up to 44% of them.
The year earlier was 37.2%, in 2016 33.5%, and earlier, since 2009, when the statistical authority for the first time examined the subjective assessments of households – never exceeded 30%.
In 2009, he considered his material situation bad or rather bad in the general of 8,1 per cent of households, compared to 11,2% earlier and more than 20%.
The best is the material situation of households working for their own account.
In this group, it is good or rather good for more than 70 percent of the respondents.
On the second line, households of rentists are households, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The subjective assessment of the material situation of households has also a major impact on the number of children.
The worst thing is for parents who are alone in the childhood, from which the good or rather good material situation declares 32%.
Among the pairs with children, this percentage is qualified (depending on the number of children) between 55 and 60 percent and 48.8% of householdless households.
In these statistics, the effect of the 500+ program is clearly visible.
Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst material situation was assessed by the parents alone who raised children and multiannual families (with at least three children).
The improvement of the subjective material assessments of the Poles is reflecting the rapid growth of income, especially from work.
However, this is not all, because the percentage of households that think their situation is good, increases faster than real income.
Furthermore, at the level of leadership there is no clear dependence between income levels and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best assessments are formulated by the people of the Opolean leadership, where their situation is good or rather considers 48.9% of the studies.
There are still Lubua (47.7%), slassian (47.6%), Mazovic (47.3%) and Western Sea (47.1%).
However, the regulatory income in Opolsk (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) was in ub.r. incompletely 94% of the average national income, and in Lubusk 98%.
The highest income of the Mazowiec inhabitants (120% of the average national) and Slovak (104%).
In the middle of Poland, the person’s regulatory income was 1693 zl in 2018.
In realistic terms (after price change correction) increased by 4.3% to 2017.
In the background of the past years, it's pretty low.
In 2016 the income per person increased by 7% and a year later by 6.3%.
Although income growth slows down, it also inhibits the increase in expenditure.
Those, in the case of a person, were incorporated in ub. 1187 zl, which means that they decreased by 0.7% in reality.
This is the first case since 2013.
In 2017, the person’s expenditure increased realisticly by 1.9% and by 4.3% in 2016.
Studies of household budgets suggest that the statistical household is currently at 70.1 per cent of its regulatory income, while it has exceeded 80% in 2014 and has exceeded 90% by 2006.

United States: Three suicides among the aircraft
Three sailors committed suicide on the USS ship last week, George H. W. Bush, informed the American Marine Marine.
In the last two years, five members of the ship have killed.
The previous suicide was still in July this year and previously in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each event occurred on the ground when USS George H. W. Bush coasted at Virginia's coast.
Until now, the participation of third parties has been excluded.
Furthermore, death should not be associated with each other.
"I need everyone to engage in presenting suggestions and ideas, how we can prevent another suicide.
I want to emphasize that there is no stygmatization or other repercussions related to searching for help," wrote Captain Sean Bailey, Commander of the ship on Facebook.
Nesolovski criticiously about the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing
In his conversation with Peter Lekshitski, Stefan Nesiolovski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition actors.
"Everything of his opinion was accepted."
Later, some of his actions have been criticized.
“To me, the fact that John Paul II was unable to eliminate the harmful work of the Ridge, it is a great shadow on his pontifiation.
Because this redemptorist, the damager of the Church and Poland, has developed his media in the best life of Pope Polak," he translated.
The former Po politician admitted: “There were the darkness of dissatisfaction, the pope said something, once he did not accept, but he had authority and for politicity he could just throw him out of the Church or send him to New Caledonia or Fijia to collect money for poor people.
However, John Paul II did not do that, like his successor," explained Nesiolovski.
"In addition, this fatal matter of pedophilia and the action of the Church has come up and, in fact, their lack.
I got a little on my mind, but I wanted to pay attention to his whole life.
We know about the pedophilia scale in the Church from relatively recently.
The question is, how is it possible that John Paul II, as the head of the Church, did not know about these ugly things," he said in his conversation with Nesiolovski journalist.
In the assessment of the former Politician PO, the Polish Church is a PS ally.
"The church was our most important ally during the Solidarity period.
All the feasts began with the sacred mess, and the crosses were hanging everywhere.
Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of the dictatorship — a sign of the writing regime.
I repeat: One of the greatest unpleasant surprises is that people like the Rider Threat by the Polish Church that John Paul II did nothing about this and that the Church is a PS ally today.
This is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which the elephant will come to pay him," he convinced Nesiolovski.
"I hope that Pope Francisek will chase Yadrashewski, Rheader and a couple of other types of things," summarized.

PZPN's punishment for boarding at stadiums.
Disqualified Gryph
The launch in the Poland Puchar between Gryph Wejherovo and Lechia Gdańsk with small hair did not end tragically when the whabitants of the Weyherova race passed an opposite team locker, Zlatana Alomerovica.
After this incident, the game was stopped for 20 minutes.
The study of this case, the PZPN committee, measured Griff's severe punishment, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to run in Poland's Puchar in season 2020/2021.
Furthermore, the kibice will not be released into the nearest game on its own stadium.
They won't be able to leave groups on League games by 31 December.
The boards on the Vision Boat stadium also called the Wroclaw Slosh.
However, there was a milder judgment, because the Slosh warned that there could be similar events and allerged the relevant authorities in this regard.
Nevertheless, services allowed the boat whales sector to be thrown off by race, burning chairs and forsaking the household sector.
This game was stopped for eight minutes, and the intervention police had to use the water armor.
SZPN punished Slosh by one-time stadion ban in the nearest game in Poland, and prohibited the organizing of goals on the games including the next PP issue.
Extraclass League matches were also banned, but it would take until 31 December.
Names of foreign cities on road marks also in Polish
GDDKiA plans to exchange labels on the whole managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Riches
The implementation of the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on i.e. writing names of foreign cities on road marks also began.
For example, "Lions" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our leadership, modifications will be made on 94 road signs set at the A4 highway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it's going to be easier, more readable and easier.
The new guidelines result in the update of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on the specific technical conditions for road signals and road safety devices.
"We should remember that the names of the town in neighbouring countries are often replaced by Polish.
Thanks to the change that we have prepared for almost will eventually appear on the roadways in our ways.
The introduction of a new label starts with the subcarpatic segment of the A4 Highway," the Minister of Infrastructure, Andrzej Adamczyk, informed.
The Subcarpate will make changes on 94 road signs set at the A4 highway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment costs?
200,000 worst.
In the first order, the new label will be implemented on the A4, which is planned until 1 November 2019.
What's the idea going to look like?
It's going to be without the exchange of tables, in principle, a sticker.
They will replace the currently functioning names of the new places written in English in the already existing characters.
Both names will be recorded in one row – first in Polish, then in the original, in the brand.
This will be a great facilitation for those who do not know the written names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are placed.

Somebody shot the swab from the windscreen.
In the casting in Zamačko, the inhabitants noticed a labud with wings.
After catching and visiting the veterinarian, it turns out that someone had arranged a goal from the animal — in his body, a windfish was found.
“He received information about the early bird from the villages of the Rescue Centre of Wild Animals in New Sola.
The report indicated that the animal had broken wings.
We've gone to the place.
It was right there that something was wrong with him.
We worked quickly and precisely so that we could not hurt him and not endanger additional stress.
The labud was caught and transported to the veterinarian.
After the first picture of the RTG, it was known that someone made him a shooting shield.
In his body there were fragments of screw," said Marcin Walasek, President of Malpol, managing the centre of rehabilitation.
Retired in the centre
"The wounds were cleaned, the bird was given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the center where it would spend all the winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He's not able to fly for now.
The release would now be linked to the fact that the winter would probably not survive," Walasek added.
The personnel intends to release him on spring to the same stock.
The authorities of the municipality of Žukovice, after receiving information about the cause of the animal's bad health, intend to inform the prosecution.
Event happened in Zamka.
Govin: “We must incite Polish, small trade”
"The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the small trade problem, it will be necessary to consider whether the State has any instruments to incite Polish trade," said Vice-Premier, Minister of Science and Education, leader of the Jaroslav Gowin Agreement.
Govin during the talk at the "Signals of the Day" in the Radio Unit found that trade is controlled by international networks that initiate Polish producers so low margins that Polish companies cannot actually develop.
Given that this problem is very difficult to fight, Vice-Premier recalled that the PIS government tried to measure it at the beginning of the office, but he received “contrast from the KE”.
"We won before the Tribunal of Justice and I hope that if the United Rights wins the nearest elections and forms the government, we will return to this subject," he said.
At the same time, he noted that “the effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish and thus a small trade”.
"It will be necessary to consider whether the government, the State, has any instruments to incite Polish trade," Govin said.
In May, the EU Court considered that the European Commission had made a mistake considering that the Polish tax from the retail sales is inadmissible public aid.
The Tax Act provided for the introduction of two tax rates from trade: 0.8 per cent from income between 17 million zles and 170 million evils per month and 1.4 per cent from income above 170 million evils per month.
The tax was to be valid since September 2016.
In September 2016, the EU law was violated by Poland.
Brussels then argumented that the construction of the tax may favour smaller shops, which may be considered public aid.
It then concluded that Danina was implemented in a way incompatible with the law.
It also issued an order to suspend the use of the tax until its analysis was completed by officials in Brussels.
Poland disagreed with this position, but tax collection was suspended.
The EU's May decision opened the way to re-establish taxes, but it has not finished the case.
The Commission made an appointment at the Court of Justice on 24 July.
On Thursday, the TSUE press service submitted the PAP that the case is now in writing, where both the European Commission and the Polish Government present their arguments in writing.
For now, it is not known whether and when the oral procedure is being ruined, which is the hearing of the parties and the possible proceedings.
It takes a few to a few months after the appeal to the announcement of the sentence.
"That is an average year," said the PAP source in the Tribunal in Luxembourg.
How can a child be dressed for baptism?
We raise a few practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of the baby and his parents.
It is often the first opportunity to concentrate the whole family around the child, together celebrating its appearance in the world.
It is not surprising that the newly baked mom and daddy want their comfort to look the best of the day.
However, before you make a final decision about the child’s clothes, consider whether it will also be comfortable.
In the shops you can find a lot of dressing sets that do not provide a small man with good comfort.
What, then, should the attention be drawn?
The basic criterion of choosing dressing for baptism is the age of a child
Until recently, several weeks of baptism were baptized, set up in white sets and placed in the same beets or large woods.
Today, children who come to damn are often older: several months, yearly, and even bigger.
It is not difficult to imagine that such a great comfort needs a little more dressing for baptism .
Therefore, if your child will have 3 to 4 months on the day of baptism, he will probably spend the feast in a wheelchair or on his parents or baptized hands.
The best way to do this is to make him comfortable, cottoned sleeping or accommodation.
Although this element is considered to be a daily clothing, it's enough to search for its excellent options, for example with a halbank or a crown.
For the boy, the perfect body will be displayed with mushrooms and shelves.
In the case of older children, you can afford a greater fantasy in your clothes.
The girl's gonna look beautiful in a straight, tile dress.
Many of the young girls are looking to the richly decorationed, falbanias dresses for baptism in a complet with flat, belts and caps.
Unfortunately, a large number of producers use artificial, non-disching materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In looking for the appropriate clothing, it will be better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant clothes on cotton suits.
Easy, tile tiles, satynic dresses, crowns, apps and charming sets will make your daughter look beautiful and comfortable.
Perfect dress for a small gentleman: cotton suit
Until recently, boys’ parents had a fashion for suits as a copy of “an adult ” models.
Polyester navys and pants, tight collars or coats often made young elegants to show their dissatisfaction loudly.
Fortunately, today they have been embarrassed by comfortable, cottoned sets.
Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, which is soft, dry pants, and to that handcuff decored from the front to the model of the vest.
These machines look extremely remarkable, and they do not disturb the movements of the world of the kid.
Cristina Pawlovic published the property statement
Cristina Pawlovic made a statement at the end of the office.
As a result of it, the PIS ambassador gathered 110,000 evil savings.
Let's remind that Paulovic predicted the departure of policy.
Finishing the cadence, it has 110,000 Zlo
As indicated in the statement made by the Member, it retires a monthly value of 4.7 thousand worst.
Pawlović has a apartment of 570 thousand zl and a little less that he rents by taking 880 zls per month.
The messenger also invests in industrial metals, evaluating the investment of 150,000 Zl.
Earlier, the property statement was also published by Jaroslav Kaczynski.
Voting over a break during the conference of the Conservative Party
The British parliamentists voted against a three-day break in the Gmin Chamber's meetings during the annual conference of the Conservative Party's Conservative Party, which the government has requested.
For 289 ambassadors, against 306.
Usually, the Gmin Chamber does not rejoice during the party conferences so that the ambassadors do not have to quit either participating in them, nor the parliamentary meetings.
However, the opposition parties considered that at such a key time as the last weeks before the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt.
289 ambassadors made a break, against 306.
Two opposition parties after conventions
No consent for a break can be taken as a political revenge of opposition at Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday, the Supreme Court considered it incompatible with law and independence) and for not apologizing for the judges.
After this decision, the Chamber Gmin resumed the session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson’s event and the next burdenous debate.
Johnson refused the opposition to block brexite and avoid pre-term elections.
"There's time to realise brexit.
It needs to be realized to respect the results of the referendum.
Brexit needs to come so that we can take care of a contract on citizens' priorities, health service, life costs.
Brexit needs to be implemented so that we can unit this country," said Johnson.
The Conference of the Conservative Party is to begin in Manchester next Sunday and last by Wednesday 2 October.
The two main opposition groups – the Party of Work and Liberal Democrats – are already held.
One of the reasons that Johnson made to explain such a long suspension to Parliament was partial conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semic attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semic attacks in Poland are a response to the anti-poland retoric of Israeli leaders," the foreign media writes.
The President's rapporteur definitely demented these reports.
"It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter Light Spychalski.
The Israeli media, including “Haaretz” and “Jerusalem Post”, referring to“Jewish Insider”, say that Andrej Duda, during the meeting with the Jew diaspora representatives of RP consulate in New York, said that Israel was guilty of the last antisemic attacks in Poland.
The President said that the increase in antisemic attacks in Poland was the response to the anti-polyan retorique of Israeli leaders.
He referred to Israel’s Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, who said in February that “Poles sucked antisemitism with mother milk. ”
Andrej Duda said that he regretted that Israel did not apologize for his politicians’ humiliating statements.
He also mentioned the aggression of the Ambassador of Poland in Israel, Mark Magierovski.
In May, he was attacked by a attacker who cried: “Polac, Polak. ”
“The quotation is not only incompatible.
It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter Light Spychalski.
He emphasized that Duda “he never said that Israel was responsible for the last antisemic attacks in Poland. ”
The Pychical Portal says "he made it up."
According to speakers “JI” during the meeting, there was also a dispute between the survivor from the Holocaust, marked by the Cross of the Commander’s Order of Employment by RP Edward Mosberg and the rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg would agree with President Duda's words and say that they are the Jews of Israel “such as Israel Kac” are responsible for an increase in antisemitism.
According to the source of the Boteach portal, Mosberg's statement was to be interrupted.
Who's Banana and what did he blame?
The stone suite's rental led a journalist to find neglects in the proper statements of Marian Banasia.
We summarize another affair that shook the ruling camp.
The TVN journalists have revealed that Marian Banása, President of the Supreme Control Chamber, has not inscribed a 400-meter-stone declaring statement in recent years.
Furthermore, his rental had sex business in the stone mentioned (and therefore rented rooms for hours).
In turn, the building itself was apparently the security of the loan payment since 2016.
Incorrectly, Bertold Kittel pointed out in the Superwizer program.
The journalist revealed that from Banasia the stone was hired by people associated with the crime world to use it as a place of “erotical meetings. ”
The clients were supposed to be men using prostitute services.
The charges of Banasa were answered incredibly and vulnerably.
Interestingly, the stone’s hired stone suites led a journalist to find neglects in Banasia’s property statements.
The stone itself was described uncertainly in them, and the income from its rent was to be declined.
“The mother of Marian Banasia and his wife may be worth between 6 and 8 million evil.
In fact, the marriage can commend two homes, three apartments, savings [...]," says Money.pl.
And as shown in the portal analysis, Banasia's stone itself was worth about 3 million evils.
The Central Anticorruption Bureau is currently inspecting Marian Banasia's property statements for 2015-2019.
Banacha prophesied that until it was completed, he would suspend his activities in the NIC. “I will go out to your marshal for a free vacation,” he assured.
The opposition requires explanation.
"We do not hear CBA to expand its investigation or accelerate the examination of Marian Banasia's property statements.
That is why we are forced to deliver state authorities and notify the possibility of committing a crime [...]," said Po-KO Mariusz Witczak.
"If the normal Polac has rented its property so lowly, he would have already had 10 controls, tax and penalty proceedings," he added.
He went high, fell low.
Marian Banada is the new president of the Supreme Chamber of Control.
This position was established on 30 August 2019, for a six-year mandate.
His candidate was announced by the Law and Justice and by the votes of politicians of the party.
Rather, Banasa was associated with NIK in 1992-2005, acting as a collaborator of Lech Kaczynski.
During the first governments of PS (2005-2008), Banásha was the position of the President of the Customs Service and also the Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015, he has resided on the table of the head of the Customs Service and has managed the National Treasury Administration since 2017.
Banana has been serving the Ministry of Finance for three months in Mateus Moravec's government.
Cooler Master introduces graphics card captures on the market
Graphics cards can now weigh really much, and this naturally makes a place for the category of products that would be vain to look for on the store shelves a decade ago.
Such a solution – a graphical graphical map ELV8 RGB – presented by Cooler Master.
The new model of graphical card capture is not just a functional solution that allows for a certain maintenance of the graphic card without relieving only on the sustainability of the PCI-express slot.
Cooler Master ELV8 RGB also has an additional task – decoration.
"Rachpopopolita: ignoring the police's command will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregarding the order of certain conduct issued by a police officer should be a new type of crime, threatened by penalty, arrest or restriction of freedom.
That's what police union wants to make.
The idea came to the Commission's season for petitions.
"The case is serious, because it is now more than half a million offences to Polish courts every year," we read.
“Réchpospolita” has concluded that the petition, which the Independent Police Professional Union writes to the messengers on the change of the code of offences, has a chance to be successful.
The authors of petition propose new replacement of Article 54a of the Code of Crime.
It should be said: “Who is not subject to the request or order of a public officer issued in the borders and under the law, is subject to arrest, penalty or restriction.”
“Article 3 of this Regulation refers to the same punishment for those who do not carry out the orders will prevent or disrupt the performance of the service activity”, the journal states.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski said “Réčpospolite” that, although he agrees with the main proposal of the regulation, he fears that if it is implemented, it can be used in political cases of manifestation.
"In the situation of freedom demonstration, it would be inadmissible and instead of mitigating the situation, even to sharpen it," he adds.
The newspaper statistics show that 86 per cent of the citizens have evaluated the interventions of the police in 2018 and that each month service takes 1,5 million interventions in the city.
Bouras is worried about Europe

Narration is imitating the dodascalia, and the heroic talks create this world.
The scene is that Europe is full of concern about its future, but also the constant questions about the past.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for an opinion
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an extraordinary offer prepared for the arrival of the German Görlitz.
Action should help to combat the progressive decline in the population.
Görlitz is the most eastern city of Germany.
Beautiful Pastel Ancient attracts 140,000 tourists annually.
However, as the Guardian says, the city faces significant problems.
In Görlitz there are the lowest salary in Germany.
The city also combats the permanent loss of the population.
After the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, most of them left west of the country, which was 25% of the city’s population.
In 2013, it amounted to 54,000 people.
To fight the depopulation, officials came to the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
As long as 150 proposals have affected the programme.
Two thirds of them were built up in large towns.
The programme was also interested in persons from Hungary, Czech, the United States and the United States of Great Britain.
"When we applied, we thought the program was to convince people to move to Görlitz," said one of the participants of the project.
"We now feel that it doesn't matter if we stay here for four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand free apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the average in the country.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move on permanently, the main objective of the programme is to obtain the opinions of the participants of the programme.
Information collected from interviews and questionnaires should help to restore small German cities.
"We want to learn more about what people need and if they decide to move -- what their motivation was," Robert Knippschild said.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas of attracting new inhabitants, offering encouragement in the form of accommodation.
The first of them was Detroit, which introduced a programme of payment for a promising young specialist for life and work in the city for a year.
Today these solutions are used in many places, from the Greek Antiquither Island to Candela in Italy, or in the US Tulsa, Oklahoma.
