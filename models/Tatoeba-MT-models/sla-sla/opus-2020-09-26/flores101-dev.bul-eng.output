People used chairs to hit the glass, but the windows didn't break.
The survivor Francis Koval said that one of the glass finally broke and they started to go out of the window."
Because of the energy obtained in the merger of hydrogen atoms (or merging) in order to create more difficult elements, stars emit light and heat.
Scientists work to create a reactor that can produce energy in a similar way.
However, this is a very difficult task to solve and it will take many years before we see the construction of useful synthesis reactors.
The steel needle is kept on the surface of the water due to the surface pressure.
The reason for the surface pressure is that water molecules of the surface of the water are strongly attracted to each other more than to air molecules over them.
The water molecules create an invisible skin on its surface, which allows things like the needle to swim from above.
The blade of the modern collar has a double edge with a depth in the middle. Both edges provide a better ice gap, even at a slope.
The edge, which is in contact with the ice, is also wrapped, as the bottom of the blade is slightly scrolling, while it slopes towards one or the other side.
This allows the sketch to scroll. If the horses scroll to the left, the scanner scrolls to the left, if the horses scroll right, the scanner scrolls right.
They must be rid of the additional energy that they receive from the light in order to return to their previous energy level.
They do this by emitting small particles of light called "fotons".
This process is called “a stimulated radiation radiation” because atoms are stimulated by bright light, causing the radiation of photons, and the light is a type of radiation.
The next picture shows the radiating photons of atoms, and in fact, of course, the photons are much smaller than those on the picture.
The photos are smaller even than the matter that builds the atoms!
After hundreds of hours of work, the spiral in the turkey burns, and it doesn't work anymore.
The turkey must change afterwards, and you must be careful when you change the electric bulb.
The switch for the lighting body or the cable must be excluded first.
This happens because electricity that flows in the contact where the metal part of the turkey is located may cause a strong electric impact. This can happen if you touch the inside of the contact or the metal base of the turkey, while it is still partly in the contact.
The main body of the blood system is the heart that has the function of the blood pump.
The blood is distant from the heart of the tubes called arteries, and returns to the heart of the tubes called "venny", and the smallest pipes are called "capilars".
The triceratopse could swallow with his teeth not only leaves, but also many hard branches and roots.
According to some scientists, the triceratopses have eaten cyccades that are a species of plant, often encountered during the creda period.
These plants are like miniature palm trees with crown of sharp, stabbing leaves.
The triceratopse could have used its healthy boat to wipe the leaves before eating the gun.
There are also scientists who argue that these plants are very poisonous and it is unlikely that any dinosaur has eaten them, although in our day, the lenives and other animals such as potatoes (seeds of dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
How would you attract me to the gravity of Yo? If you step on his surface, you will weigh less than when you are on Earth.
A man with a weight of 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth will be about 36 pounds (16 pounds) of Yo. Gravity, of course, will act weaker.
Unlike Earth, the sun has no core you can step on, all is built from gases, fire and plasma.
The gas is drowning away from the center of the sun.
The outer part of the sun, which we see when we see it, is called "fotosphere" or "calllight".
The Italian astronomer Galileo Galileo used a telescope to observe that Venus has phases, just like the Moon about 3,000 years later, in 1610.
The phases occur because only the sun's side of Venus (or the moon) is turned into light. Venus's phases support Kopernik's theory that planets circle around the sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, the English astronomer Jeremiah Horox observed Venera’s transit.
England survives a long peace period after Denlo's reopening.
However, in 991 the Ethelred faced Viking fleet, greater than any other than Gutrum's time before.

He originally named "Hunmin Jeongaum" the Hangeul alphabet, which means "the right human instruction sounds".
There are many theories of how Sanscrit appeared, one for migrants from the West Arians who brought the tongue with themselves.
Sanscrit is an ancient language and is comparable to Latin speaking in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world was written on Sanskrit. After the compilation of the Sanscritians just disappeared because of hierarchy.
As Latin is a source of European languages such as French and Spanish, sanskrit is very complex and rich language, which served as a source of many modern Indian languages.
With the completion of the battle for France, Germany is beginning to be prepared to invade the British island.
The code name of the German attack is "Silayan Operation." Most of the heavy weapons and ammunition of the British army were lost in its evacuation from Dunkerk, so the army was quite weak.
But the Royal fleet was still much stronger than the German fleet ("Kriegsmarine") and could destroy all the invasive ships sent through Lamansha.
However, very few ships of the Royal Marine fleet were located near the probably trails of invasion, since the Admirals feared that they would be flooded by German air attacks.
Let's start with the explanation of Italy's plans, which Italy was mainly the "little brother" of Japan and Germany.
There was a weaker army and weaker fleet, although four new ships were built just before the war began.
The main objectives of Italy were African countries. In order to capture these countries, they had to own a platform so that the troops could cross the Mediterranean Sea and invade into Africa.
In addition to these actions, Italian warships did not have to do anything else.
Just like Britain, Japan was an island country.
The submarines are ships designed to travel under water and stay there for a long time.
The submarines were used during the First and Second World War, then they were very slow and had a very limited shooting.
At the beginning of the war, they traveled mostly on the surface of the sea, but when the radar began to develop and become more accurate to avoid notice, the submarines were forced to swim under water.
The German submarines were called “podwater boats” and the Germans were very good in navigation and management of their submarines.
Because of the success of the Germans with the submarines, after the war, they are not trusted to possess many of them.
Yes, King Tutankamon, sometimes called King Tut, or "The Kid of King", is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian Pharaohs today."
Interestingly, he was not considered important in ancient times and was not recorded in most of the lists of ancient kings.
However, the discovery of his grave in 1922 turned him into a celebrity. Although many tombs of the past were robbed, this was left nearly intact.
Most of the items buried with Tutankamon are well stored, including thousands of artefacts made from valuable metals and rarely familiar stones.
The invention of spice wheels made Assyrian wheels lighter, faster and better prepared to run soldiers and other wheels.
The arrows of their deadly arbalets can break the armor of the rivals. About 1000 B.C.E., the Assyrians entered the first cavalry.
The cavalry was a army that fought on the horse. The Assyrian cavalry fought on the naked back of its horses, since the seat was not yet invented.
We know a lot of Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Omir - the legendary blind poet who created two works of Greek literature: poems “Iliada” and “Odiseus” is probably the most famous representative of this culture.
Sofokle and Aristophane are still popular dramatics, and their plays are considered one of the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematician of Pitagore, most famous with his famous theorem about the links between the sides of the rectangle triangles.
There are different estimates about how many people speak Hindus. It is considered to be between the second and the fourth most common language in the world.
The number of speakers in the local language varies depending on whether very closely connected dialects are counted or not.
Approximate estimates varies from 340 million to 500 million speakers and up to 800 million people can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu are similar to the vocabulary, but they are written differently; speakers in both languages usually can understand each other in daily conversations.
In the 15th century, North Estonia was under the strong cultural influence of Germany.
In their desire to approach God to local people, some German monks invented the Estonian literal language.
It is based on the German alphabet by adding one letter “Ö/õ”.
During the time, many words borrowed from German have come down. This was the beginning of the enlightenment.
More traditionally, the heir of the throne enters the army directly after the school is finished.

Learning to create an interactive media requires ordinary and traditional skills, as well as tools learned in interactive classes (storyboard, audio and video edition, history story, etc.)
The interactive design requires you to overestimate your perceptions of media production and learn to think non-lineally.
Interactive design requires components of a project to connect to each other but also make sense as a separate unit.
Focal complexity and the number of elements of the lens necessary to achieve a range of focus lengths is much greater than in the normal lens and this is the lack of increased lens.
This problem becomes increasingly smaller because the lending producers are reaching higher standards in the production of lens.
This allowed the objects to increase to produce images with quality compared to that achieved with the lenses with a fixed length of focus.
Another lack of increased lens is that usually the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is lower.
This makes cheap scale lenses difficult to use without light light light light light lightlights.
Among the most frequent problems in the attempts to convert a film into DVD format is superscan.
Most TVs are made so that they satisfy the broad audience.
So all you see on TV is cut off edges from top, down and down.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the whole screen. It is called an image that exceeds the screen frame.
When you make a DVD, his ends, unfortunately, will probably be cut off and if the video video has subtitles too close to the bottom, they will not be shown completely.
Traditional Medieval Castle has long inspired imagination, shouting in the mind of the images of tournaments, arrays and the knight's spirit of King Arthur.
Although stopping among the millennium ruins is not difficult to hear sounds and to feel the smells of long past battles, almost hearing the scattering of the peppers and smelling the fear of the underground pits.
But is our imagination based on the reality, why are the castles built, how are designed and built?
The castle "Curby Maclow" is typical for this period and is more like a strengthened house than a real castle.
The big glass windows and the thin walls would not have been able to last long on a decisive attack.
In 1480, when Lord Hastings has taken care of its construction, the country is relatively peaceful and needs protection only against small groups wandering maroders.
The balance of forces was a system where European countries were trying to maintain the national sovereignty of all European countries.
The concept is that all European nations must strive to prevent a nation from become strong, and the national governments often change their unions to maintain their balance.
The first war, whose main issue was the balance of forces, was the war for the Spanish heritage.
This notes an important change, since the European forces no longer have the pretext of religious wars, so the Thirty-year war will be the last war called “religious”.
At the pale of Herostrat on July 21, 356 B.C.E., the temple of Artemida in Ephesus was destroyed.
According to history, his motivation was at every price to achieve glory. The oppressed Ephesians declared that the name of Herostrat would never be written.
The Greek historian Strabo later marks the name, and so we know today. The temple was destroyed the same night that Alexander Great was born.
As a king, Alexander offered to take the cost of the renewal of the temple, but his offer was rejected. Later after Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.E.

The Sikh religion is from the Indian subcontinent, which originates in the 15th century of the Pundjab region from a sectarian division in the hindu tradition.
Sikhs view their faith as a religion, separate from hinduism, although they recognize her hindu roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which in Punjabi means “the path of the guru.” Guruto is a fundamental aspect in all Indian religions, but in sikhism he has acquired the importance of the core of beliefs.

Includes the majority of today's Pakistan and some regions in northwest India and northeastern Afghanistan is the civilization of the Ind Valley, which is bronze civilization in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent.
Civilization was prospering in the region of the Indian River, where its name came from.
Although some scientists speculate that since civilization existed in the pools of the already dried Saraswati River, it should be called Ind-Saraswati civilization, while some call it Harapa's Harapa Civilization, the first of its objects, which was exploded in 1920.
Medical development is helped by the military nature of the Roman Empire.
Emperor August begins to call doctors and even forms the first Roman medical corps to be used after the battles.
The surgeons knew various sedatives, including morphine extracts of mac seeds and scopolamine of plant seeds.
They acquire great experience in amputations to save patients from gangrene, as well as tourniques and arterial bonds to stop the blood flow.
For centuries, the Roman Empire has led to huge progress in the field of medicine and has formed a large part of our famous knowledge today.
Puerland Origami is an origami with the restriction that only one scroll can be made at a given moment, more complicated scrolls such as reverse scrolls are not allowed, and all scrolls have simple locations.

Kids very young develop understanding of race and racial stereotypes, and these stereotypes affect the behavior.
For example, children who identify themselves with racial minority, which is stereotyped, as not well in school, after learning about the stereotype associated with their race, usually do not work well in school.
MySpace currently has 54 million user profiles and is the third popular website used in the United States.
These websites have attracted much attention, especially in the field of education.
These websites have positive aspects that include the opportunity to easily create a class page that can include blogs, videos, photos and other functions.
You can get easy access to this page by providing only one web address that facilitates memory and writing to students who would have problems using the keyboard or spell.
It can be personalized so that you can read easily, as well as with very or less color, according to your wish.
The attention deficit syndrome is a neurologic syndrome whose classic determining triade of symptoms includes impulsiveness, distraction tendency and hyperactiveness or excessive energy.
This is not a difficulty in learning, but a school disorder; it “incides 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps up to 2 million American children. ”
Children with a deficit of attention (ADD) are difficult to focus on school work, but they can focus on things that they like to do, play games or write sentences without punctuation, or watch their favorite animations.
These children are inclined to get involved in many troubles, because they “have a risky behaviour, enter battles and seek the achievement of authority ” to stimulate their brain because their brain cannot be stimulated by normal methods.
The deficit syndrome affects relations with other peers, because other children cannot understand why they are acting like this or why they grow up in this way, or that their maturity is different.
Since the ability to acquire knowledge and learning has changed in that way above, the basic speed by which knowledge is gained has also changed.
The approach to receiving information was different. There is no pressure within the individual cancellation, now the focus is on the ability to cancel the text.
In general, the approach to learning and dissemination of knowledge is significantly changing through Renaissance.
Unlike other primates, hominides are already using their hands to carry burdens, swimming over trees and moving.
The hand and foot of the chimpanzee are similar to the size and length, reflecting the use of the hand to carry weight in walking with a bowl.
The man's hand has a more proper falang, and it's shorter than the foot.
The fossil bones of the hand of two to three million years reveal this change in the specialization of the hand from movement to processing.
Some people believe that the frequent experience of very artificially challenged realized dreams can be very exhaustive.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of clear dreams that increase the time between the states of rapid eye movement (REM).
With less REM at night, this condition in which you actually sleep and your body recovers becomes too rare and becomes a problem.
It's just as tired as if you wake up every 20 or 30 minutes and watch TV.
The effect depends on how often in the night your brain is trying to dream clearly.
In North Africa almost since the beginning, things did not work well for the Italians. During a week after the announcement of the war from Italy on 10 June 1940, the British 11th Hussar Polk conquered the Fort Capuco in Libya.
The British are captured by the chief engineer of the Italian tenth army, General Lastuci, in the east of Bardia.
On 28 June, marshal Italy Balbo, Governor General of Libya and Mussolini's heir, was killed by a friendly fire when he performed a desant in Tobruk.
Modern sports fechtovic is practiced at many levels - from students following university to professional and olympic competitions.
The sport is practiced primarily in the form of a duel, while one fechtower is dueled with another.
In the golf game, players use sticks to hit balls to holes.
Eighteen holes are played during a regular round, as players usually start from the first hole in the field and end at the eighteenth.
The player who takes the least hits or waves with the slipper to finish the track wins.
The game is played on grass, and the grass next to the hole is low and it's called Green.
Probably the most common type of tourism is the one that connects with travel by most people: recreational tourism.
When people go to a place that is very different from their normal daily life to relax and entertain, we talk about it.
The beaches, thematic parks and campings are often the most visited places of tourists for rest.
If the goal of visiting a certain place is to recognize history and culture, this kind of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists can consider different remarks in the country or choose to focus only on one area.
Seeing this activity, the colonists also called for backup.
The troops, strengthening the front positions, included 1st and 3th New Hampshire Colonels of 200 under the command of Colonel James Reed and John Stark (the two later become generals).
On the fence of the north end of the position of the Colonists, the people of Stark took place.
When the flood opened a slipper along the river Mystic River near the northeast side of the peninsula, they quickly expanded the fence with a short stone wall north ending to the edge of the water on the small beach.
Gridley or Stark were putting a wheel at about 100 feet (30 meters) outside the fence and ordered no shooting until civilians crossed.
The American plan predicted coordinated attacks from three different countries.
General John Cadwalder would have launched an attack against the British Garnison in Bordentown to block possible backups.
General James Euing will translate 700 troops through the river with the Tranton Feribot, take over Asunpink Crike and prevent the enemy troops from escape.
The main bullet team of 2.400 will cross the river 9 miles north of Trenton, and then split into two groups, one under Green's command and one under Sullivan's leadership to take the attack before the summary.
By changing the run of a quarter mile per mile, the speed becomes much smaller until the endurance becomes absolutely necessary.
Of course, the first-class runner of 800 meters, a man who can cross the distance for less than two minutes, must have a high speed, but endurance must be trained at any price.
A few cross-contri runs over the winter, combined with gymnastical exercises for the upper part of the body, are the best training for the fugitive season.
Only proper food practices cannot give excellent results, but they can significantly influence the common well-being of young athletes.
By maintaining a healthy energy balance, they have effective habits for hydration and understand different aspects of the use of supplements, sportsmen can improve their representation and increase their enjoyment of sports.
There are many misunderstandings regarding small equipment, which is required to participate in the run of medium distances, which is relatively cheap sport.
If necessary, products can be purchased, but most of them will have a small or no real impact on the result.
Sports may feel like they prefer a certain product even if it does not benefit them.
The atom can be considered as one of the main construction parts of the whole matter.
This is a very complicated unit, which, according to the Simplified Bour model, consists of central core and circulation electrons around it, something like planets around the sun - see Fig. 1.1.
The core consists of two types of particles – protons and neutrons.
Protons have a positive electric charge until the neutrons have no electrons at all, and the charge of the electrons is negative.
Before you check the victim, you have to look at the place first and make sure you're safe.
When you approach the victim, you need to notice his or her position and any automatic red flags.
If you hurt yourself while you're trying to help, you can only make things worse.
The study states that depression, fear and black views are mediated in the relationship between pain and disability in patients with pain in the bottom of the back.
Only the consequences of the disaster, not depression and fear depended on the regular weekly PA sessions.
Participants in the regular activity needed more support for the negative perception of pain, to distinguish chronic pain from discomfort in normal physical movement.
The vision or ability to see depends on the sensitive organs of the visual system or eyes.
There are many different eyes structures with different complexities according to the requirements of the body.
