There's a big return to the Czech Smolar.
Paul French has been called to NHL
The Czech hockey braker, Paul Francouz, who has been passing through a difficult period of his career in recent months, returns to NHL.
A thirty-year-old pussy family will be on the senior, so soon he can get into the gate.
The former brancer of Litvinova, Plizna or Russian Čeliabinska wounded himself in preparation for NHL in October this year.
It was exactly in the middle of the fight with Vegas, and since that time, he hasn't been presented on the NHL cluzis yet.
The incident happened when the experienced branner moved from one stick to the other.
"Paul French will be out of about three to four weeks with injuries in the bottom of the body," said the total from Denver in the beginning of October.
His return to the gate in NHL eventually extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning, the American time was called from the farm, where he grabbed four dueles and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he accorded 94.5% of the proceedings.
The hockey reservator wants to finally settle and confirm that it belongs to the best league of the world.
In the last year, he had problems with the pandemic, and he didn't catch the only struggle in a shortened pandemic year.
In NHL, “France” took 36 fights, its success is 92.3%.
Charles puts Camille's gun on Christmas wishes, William and Kate are positioned in Jordan
The British Prince William and his wife Kate as a Christmas wish this year chose a family photograph taken during their journey to Jordan.
He also published his wishes by Prince Charles, who used a photograph on which his house Camille helps put a gun on.
On its websites, the British rapporteur's station of BBC informed about it.
The wishes send to friends, coworkers, and funds that they cooperate with.
The photo came up somewhere in the desert land.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in a haki color and dress also has Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing as princes George and Louis's shorts and a shirt with a shirt.
Whoever took the photo, William and Kate didn't introduce, is not even clear when it came up.
Last year, the royal family for a photo designed as a Christmas wish posted on a package of slams in front of a bunch of wood in its rural village in the county of Norfolk.
The picture that serves as a Christmas wish also published by the successor of the throne of Prince Charles and his wife Camille.
The photographer Sam Hussein caught them in June at Ascot.
Charles, who's got a cylindr on his head and on his face, helps Camille put on her handcuff colorfully sweeted with light dresses.
Slavia by efotbal.cz promised Berbrow a million million for the title, the hard man denied it.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corrupt Case allegedly worked with the accused former Vice-Chairperson of the Football Association of C.R. Roman Berbr to have a promised million crowns from Prague Slavia for the league title in season 2018/19.
He informed the efotbal server that he reached the part of the police records.
The Chairman of the High Club, Jaroslav Tvrďk, said that the red-white were not allowed to do any corruption.
The server published a receipt of police hearings, in which Slavia figures mainly her former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended in the master club in summer.
Someday the influenced red-white functioner was in common contact with both Berbre and the former Sports Director of the Second League of Roman Rogos, who is also in the cause of the accused.
Criminalists reportedly worked with information that Slavia Berbrovi promised a financial reward for getting a title.
2019 won SK Slavia Prague title in the first lia.
The police authorities have been able to know that Roman (Berbr) should have a promised million payment from SK Slavia Prague, quoted by the server from the record.
A day later, according to criminals, Berbr met not only with Nemar but also with the President of Slavia Fortress.
According to the server, the police are still dealing with this information.
The claim refused any corruption.
In 2015 to 2017, we actively tried to change the relationships in the Czech football and offered an opponent alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal negotiations, we have not sought to influence judges in contrast with the rules of fair play and we have not provided any financial implementation in this regard," said the Court for the List of Report.
In the hearings, among others, Nezmar selectively insults some former players of Slavia dark skin and also taunts his former boss firm.
The cause of the alleged impact of the fighting through the judges has exposed police intervention in several places in the mid-October, including the FACHR Prague.
The biggest built in the affirmation is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football functions.
In the mid January, he was released from custody as well as the former Sports Director of the Hightown Rogoz.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping cold wars.
The works will be new, but in principle worse type (the artillery must wear bullets manually without cover).
Cars - Toyotes hi-lux - are new and good
Trailers and various pencil cars - at a fair level, further, they have been able to get rid of Prague V3S even for specialized units.
Aircraft: fight-decent, but at the end of the rent, transportation - too small with a short railway, but modern.
Drones - small and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have at all (but we're making and exporting abroad)
PVO: middle - cold-level, aged; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story like that.
I've got a chase right next to the city.
The river came from the nutrition, and they did the damage on the plants, so I was in the seat.
When I came, I saw a fisherman on the side of the river.
I didn't want to do a mess, so I sat down and the guy didn't think he noticed me.
I was hoping he'd leave before something came out, but, of course, the fox went in a minute.
I let her come 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost fucked himself, whispered his head on all sides, so I called him, that was on the fox.
Before I got out of the possession, it was gone.
I mean, and a loud man to be a pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it'd have to be a summary of a lot of coincidence to happen, you'd probably be seen in the termise that almost everyone has today.
So to the visible place, the dear things put to their feet in the spaccas and you should be fine.
Wars against Hamaček.
Inside, the respirators were much cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state responsible for the purchase and distribution of pipes, masks and respirators for professions closest to coronavir has issued billions crowns for their acquisition in the past weeks.
The server iRozlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during one day the amounts on the respirator were different to hundreds of crowns.
Why were prices so dramatic?
Which authorities have acted economically?
And why were others shopping a drunk?
Lenka Kabrhel speaks to the iRozlas Dominica Kubišt server editor.
I appreciate the soldiers and the army (because I'm not affected by the memories of the CHSLA that have done the older generations), but the CRC cannot benefit from the obligatory war.
We don't even have a lot of techniques that training can take, we don't actually have a modern technique for existing professionals, and the modern technology is still more complex, so the ability of the bookers will rapidly lose time.
The modern conventional conflicts, where they can put them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
And eventually, the applicants/territorial defence are of great importance to countries such as Ukraine, where it is going to lead a mass geril, and it is also an explanated need to remove the enemy.
There will be only a fight in the scope of this scope and intensity where the geril will be irrelevant, and we do not have any relevant geography.
Mostly, we don't have individual skills.
It's not even the worst.
The worst thing is, half of them play like they have it.
Then it's a situation that you're looking at like a dude who didn't hit the empty gate two minutes ago, he's going to attack himself between two or even three Swissmans and you say, "Twee and what do you think happens now?"
Well, of course they'll pick him up as a average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "to behave a defense" is so horrible that I'm captured that I'm sincerely surprised when I see that our attacker was able to play a player of a rival.
First patches
Covid's pandemia slows down, however, experts do not expect a major turnover for the next weeks.
The efforts in hospitals according to statistical models will last for a while and the pandemic equation has arrived, as we know, the new unknown: the option of omicrons, which is likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it cannot be absolutely certain whether it can cause more serious progress, as much as it helps vaccination or post-infection immunity gained by previous disease processing.
But this week also entered the unexpected phenomenon on the side of pluss: the possibility of treatment.
A new medicinal product has arrived in Czech Republic, an antivirotics of molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
Soon it should be complemented by paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports the success of even 85 percent.
The first supplies of molnupiravir to Czech Republic except for the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in combating coronovir pandemia also highlighted how the administration is prepared for the incoming medicines.
As it was said, the first of patients in the country will be given to Merck's monnupiravir.
The company ended on the tape first, and because the medicinal product began to develop long before the current pandemic explosion in order to find appropriate treatment for the virus disease of horses on the South American continent.
In these research, people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.) are often ignored.
are generally less open and openly do not share their views.
Therefore, Eastern Europeans, and in particular the Czech, we are used to speak "how the dental grew up."
See, you'll do research where people ask if they like Muslims.
In Czech Republic, most people without surroundings will tell you no.
In the West, they'll tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are a racist bastard.
And then they go and choose parties like AfD.
They're afraid to cancel culture, to say this publicly means loss of work and media linch.
Then it looks nice in the surveys, west good, east is bad.
But they'll really find out what people think.
It's only in France Le Peno and Zemmoura, both have over 20% research.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical by Czech Republic.
It's identical because of the rotation of units, so soldiers don't have to learn where it is again, so all the objects for hair are the same.
From one is the Atom Bridge Museum and the rest of the two are abandoned.
The fun is that the ssr did not want to have nuclear heads in its own territory either because of safety or speed of the head planting because of the western position.
In these underground covers (in each javor there are two) only the heads were stored not all the missiles as they say.
If it was necessary to put this weapon, a special unit came to pick up this head and mount on some nose device.
Besides the museum's javor, the remaining are in the desolate state.
At the second grade of the basic school, we had a classmate of Cigan, and we were with him for four years.
He was pretty cool, he was making a good joke, he often showed himself too much, but it was our maskot.
Everyone had fun with him, frequently walked and wanted to explain something, missing little, walked regularly, sported with us, stealing meals, or phones, walking cleanly dressed.
He was driving schools in nature, doing different monkeys, but he was fine, maybe never shit.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the brothers and sisters, the cigars, the same class, the other classes.
Shortly, the teacher was beaten, the police often dealt with something, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sell something to advertise (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I've been selling more often to Cigans, they always had money, they didn't try to drag me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold the car like that, the guy called in a month that he'd already overwhelmed it.
I'm telling myself that I'm not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as he acts as he belongs in a good society (he works, works, doesn't beat women, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, pulls his hand, resides in apartments and houses, he's just having a mess around, he's making problems, so it doesn't matter what color he has, but he's going to bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they engage, they start business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If he believes in Allah, I don't care until they respect my traditions and culture, I will be theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachaticka
"Young woman suffered severe multiple injuries and despite rescue care, unfortunately, she has fallen in her injuries in the place," said the Law spokesman of Southern Health Rescue Zuzan Faitl.
Havaria was probably guilty of the driver who took the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot mark was probably headed in the direction of the village of Zyževec to the community of Bavorov and has arrived from uncertain causes before.
After the crash, Scodou Octavia ended the Peugeot vehicle on the roof outside the car, describing the accident of the speaker of the Southern Czech Police Stépanka Schwarz.
The young driver of Peugota suffered very serious injuries in an accident.
It was a lot of injuries, and he remained wounded in the car.
After the exemption, he had to be given acute pre-health care, and in a stable state, he was transported airly to the Czechobudea hospital, established by Faitl savior.
She complemented that a man from the second car suffered a lighter chest injury and was transported to the hospital.
New rules apply to packagings from other countries outside the EU, customers often don't add data about them
Luke Neuheisl orders abroad even several times a month.
He acquires primarily collective cards.
"It can usually be tens of dollars, let's say, like, ten dollars higher, where it's still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free," the collector approaches.
Since October, the order of small consignments has been slightly irritated, the new VAT must be receiving and the mail shall transmit the data to the customs procedure.
His e-mail will come to him with a message that the customers are expecting a package to come.
It is then enough to fill out the data on the consignor, and if the VAT has not included the merchant at the time of the sale, it shall be measured by the customs office from the total amount for the shipment and for transport.
Where the addressee does not provide the customs procedure itself, the compensation for the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Luke Neuheisla, the whole process is not complicated.
I'll click one or two eruption boxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
It's mostly a question for me for five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all the shipments can be delivered smoothly.
For new customs rules, the number of consignments received from abroad from 60 000 to 15 thousand daily dropped into international mail in Prague.
According to the Czech Mail, the problem is also that people do not respond to the invitations to provide data necessary to complete the customs procedure.
Currently there are 30,000 shipments to be processed at international mail.
If people were filling all the information they needed and filling them in time, we would be around half here, says the speaker of the Czech Mail Matia Vitik.
Inflation solutions
See the title, how would you suggest solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% of inflation and its next growth is expected.
What should he stand in your opinion to slow this growth or compensate?
We see in Poland a reduction in food and pHM, is this a way for you?
What do you think happens, what's inevitable about where it goes?
Prices are growing faster than payments, I think it is unavoidable that people will not be able to afford common things, especially energy.
How much have you received added (who is the employee)?
I was added to 2% this year, which is ridiculous, but fortunately, I have a similar profit from the business I operate in employment.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why the proofly convicted violents send themselves behind the nets for only six months?
This just doesn't take my head on how the court can only send a animal like this for six months behind the net just to do it again, as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to his/her victim will have a trauma for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relations and relations in general.
And that doesn't mean the victim of rape doesn't have to remember it again.
Isn't this even a potential future report of rape of victims?
The man from the Death has burned his girlfriend from Costomlat
The man from the Grave has unwantedly helped the officers to ensure his entirely searched girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom the arrest order was issued.
He called them to her himself.
He went to it with a little bit.
First he called the circuit and invented a story that he was robbed.
The officers arrived after the call to the trouble line and didn't wonder when the alleged “the stolen ” told them that he invented everything so the officers could come to the place.
In fact, he just wanted to advise officers how to report to the CRC police.
In checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found out that the woman is on the list of searched persons, in full search, and she was issued a warrant to arrest her.
This is why the case deals with the PCR.
Honest question for people here, do you think our country is Slovak?
I personally believe that we are not ethnic or culturally, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with the memo, the shame that Churchil was unable to ensure that Prague was released :')
Of course, I don't deny that we have a Slovenian language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can really trust anything completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not personally consider such a case as true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there's an estimate in the world, if I'm not wrong, about ten thousand different religions.
Which god or gods should a man choose?
I would say it is quite likely that there is at least one god in one of those thousands of religions that punishes you unpleasantly if you believe in another god.
There is no other god than Yahweh.
So wouldn't it be more rational to stay out of faith in any god than risking to choose wrong from those thousands of gods and that one real god I just didn't hit, send me to hell or something like that?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is similar to me.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months per month) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If a man is doing good, he can get a professional offer.
All the ACR files would use something like that.
It could be done in collaboration with the University of Defence.
We can talk like this: Continue to misconduct between the education sector and the industry, the companies hunt in schools, and there is some sort of leaning when the workforce migrates from educational institutions into working conditions.
Not only when you grow up, but this process goes on constantly, each of us always learns something new, goes from one area to another, and so on.
Similar flows should work between the civil and military sector.
I also think of this as a way to build a relationship between the citizen and the army, the institution that guarantees that Russia, Germany or Mongolian rider will never break in here again.
I think it's funny how you think NATO is something that's dragged into a stone, we have allies, and they're going to defend us if it happens.
Well, please, please.
There are only one choice in the United States that will round their budget and the whole NATO goes to shit.
The English exchanges us for Russian money, the Germans exchange us for the Russian gas, and the Polaci showed up once that they would show them their back and take what they wanted.
The only thing that works for a long time as a guarantee of self-dependence is the armed army and the population who can control the military technique of their time.
And today he can fly remotely controlled funds every teenager, so he can't.
We don't need boundary reinforcement, that's ridiculous today, but a teenager playing behind a remote controller's knip can handle it.
How to not drown in boxes
Do you unpack gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're in the house with boxes and fillings?
This waste is used again by e-shops that lack the package materials.
So there was a map of shops that will welcome your used boxes.
And it's not just Christmas.
All packaging materials are proposed to endure repeated manipulation.
That's why it's a shame to treat them as a single waste.
Anyone can bring them into an integrated trade (KAMSNIM.cz project map contains almost 150) carton boxes, plastic or paper fill.
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste created and also avoid transplanted blue containers.
The marketing itself welcomes the packages currently on the market of shortages and saved money, since the packaging carton was 50 % over the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically sensitive customers, I also strengthen my mark.
One of these trades is TIERRA VERDE, producer of eco drugs and cosmetic eco.
Boxes and filling materials are driven by individuals who accumulate home, but we also have companies with which we have arranged regular bonds of postponed cards.
We'll use everything in packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we together create a more respectful world.
Our wish is to preserve the sources and beauty of nature for the next generations, says Petra Lopušnik of Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMSNIM.cz shows not only seals for package materials.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (which takes out of the house waste where you give the past medicines, tyres, servicing electricity, batteries, light sources, large volume waste etc.).
All waste can end in the right place, and reuseable things will find their second home.
In general, the project map contains over 100,000 such places.
“Increasingly there are collective courts, re-uses of the center, containers on textilles, food banks, charitable businesses, SWAPs and other places that help find use for things that would otherwise become waste”, Miroslav Kubasek, one of the authors of the application from the community, Purge Czech Republic.
I think it's a bad thing that technology is so simple and stupid today that children who use computer or phone play games on it, but they don't learn basic computer skills.
A problem has recently occurred (usually in English articles) that students of high school do not understand the principle of computer files.
Because maybe Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones generally simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and put everything on one screen in the application.
Let them use the technique since they were children, but mostly let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU presidency in January – and it was great.
Macron spoke over an hour during which he discovered the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans -- at work, on the street -- and mentioned so many actions that they can't be arrived in six months.
But French politicians like it, and they like the voters.
Macron's supporters of the proliferation between the right and the left are compatible with a little bit, but in Europe, yes.
And in France, the new choices of the head of the State will be in April.
The election calendar also affected the priorities.
The French leader mentioned, inter alia, that historians should write “one history of Europe” and France is ready to create conditions for such history work.
A number of commentators immediately accelerate with the criticism that Macron is about pro-European propaganda and writes history.
In fact, it's rather trying to rewrite history.
The extremely right candidate for the French President Éric Zemmour is now circling France with the fact that the Vicha regime, which collaborated with Hitler during the second world war, was not so bad, and it was quite successful with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of a history book seriously and let's not look at the event in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries learn a lot of history as a story we opposite them, and never like a story of the whole.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs find out who's beaten in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't know what the wider context of the event was.
The year's film is Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech Mouses didn't win.
The story that returns to a massacre in Srebrenica in 1995 also received appreciation for directing and for the best actress Jasna Duričić.
At this year's Karlovar festival, he was held on the first stairs of the spectacle.
The best actor in Berlin became Anthony Hopkins for the movie Father.
I'm not too young, I'm not too healthy, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "without grip/being dried" for a few days, and I didn't have the taste of smoking...
Against the normal flu, it was worse.
I don't have a diarrhoea with the flu.
I don't say everyone's got it.
Christmas book tips
The Christmas binary that comes out of 20 December will contain a traditional literary annex.
And the cultural advice will come with her.
These books to you, the surveillancemen, are already added to this digital edition so that you may have enough time to order books as Christmas gifts.
Prozaic texts that relate to the previous similar collection Peter Sellier & Peter Bellot.
Another portion of the world's observation and the description of the common things with uncommon poems of observation, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prose, the photographer Sixák tried to capture the essence of the small town and the Czech society.
The story of returning to the roots that turns out to be just an illusion.
The Bohemist and Comparatist transmits a fairy story about the Red Carculation to the culis of the current village.
Her use of brutality overcomes the human version and graduates in a horror of emotional emptyness.
And that the way back to instincts is shorter than a person willing to admit
The author in his last novel tells a lot less sentimental story of return from immigration than we used to listen to each other.
Those who stayed, and those who left, know too little about each other to give it to the common life.
The trains are starting to ride according to the new driving order, somewhere the carriers change
Since Sunday, they start driving trains in the railway according to the new driving order.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some trails, for example between Ustew over Labe and Kolin, where the Czech road begins to ride RegioJet.
For most lines only the time of departure is adjusted, where appropriate, softly and their routes.
There will be dozens of new trains on the railways.
The carriers started to sell tickets during the autumn.
The Czech trails plan to translate a day in the new driving order in the average of 6783 personal transport links, with a average of 478 remote trains daily.
The trains are eating during a new ride order about 118 million miles.
The roads next to the national bonds within the new driving order will also be driven to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, along with the new driving order, will plant tens of new trains.
The main news will be the InterJet trains that will ride on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains are transported to North Morava or Western Czech Republic.
The carrier also traditionally increases the prices of the ride since the next year, by an average by 3.2 per cent.
The roads take into account inflation in their tariffs every year.
The largest change in the RegioJetu driving order is the entry to the R23 Oste of Labe – Majlnik – Nymburg – Kolin.
The carrier here will replace the Czech roads after success in the Ministry of Transport.
On a day, RegioJet will transmit a total of 16 bonds, eight in every direction.
Other changes relate to remote links between Prague and Brn, which will be stopped in the Havičkov Brod stations from Sunday, the Ježir over Sazawa and the Colin.
Leo Express maintained his 16 bonds, two reverse links to Slovakia, and also the weekend link to Krakova.
According to speaker Emil Sedlarik, the carrier also tried to maintain as many times as possible for his remote trains, even though the planned exclusive work.
Without great changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should also continue.
The carrier will also be exchanged in some regional routes.
Changes are waiting for travelers to Czech Republic, where the Trail from Youth Boleslavi through Czech Lipa to Rumburg will ride trains Trilex of the German Die Länderbahn.
Travelers will also be able to use united railway rides in the second year.
Like the Czech roads, their prices are increased by inflation 3.2 per cent.
I have to disagree.
Are we not learning how to view the other side?
We hear everywhere how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to dwell, dying.
In my life, I haven't heard the teaching from the slave party's perspective or from then, no one's defending this, just condemning.
No one at school tells you that black people were often selling to slave themselves and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one at school will teach you that the colonists often purchased the land from the Indians, they're just telling you how brutally we, Europeans, killed them, and killed each other for a long time.
I spent a while in the United States, right in schools, in northern schools, and in the Southern.
I didn't see anyone intentionally shut the facts, but I've heard that it's happening before and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (you need to be a fair tabu from WW2).
My point rather was that history is not black-white and that we have the tendency to look at it from today's view, without understanding.
History doesn't care about feelings, it's just what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at something from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never repeat this again.
By the way, when we're in those Southern States, yes, the confederation flag and the famous slaves there are quite popular, on the other hand, they also had some of their good successes, and it came to me absurd to reject them.
Besides, North wasn't much better than a lot of people today idealize him.
And a lot of people also forget that not all in the south were slaves, and a lot of things also opposed them.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, deliberately ignore some facts, lie and manipulate, in addition, we don't have our views in them (in YT there was also a video from the TV where they turned out someone who started talking about our legioners and 1968).
What I thought at US schools was funny was the rising of marximism and idealization of communism, something that their land never experienced.
In general, I realized that in some universities it was awkward, these students were quite traditional, and those schools supported them in a number of times.
And if I imagine that these people will once be much older, I'm a little bit sick that this might be the voice of most because they're among youths and in the ruling elite.
I think the feminism may have achieved what he had, and it's not about the same thing, it's been traditional.
Currently, as feminists, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups like LGBT, leading to radicalization on the opposite side, where it often leads to resistance and to quite reasonable things.
Besides, the more people are radical, the more they hear it.
Anyway, I also did not see anyone to condemn me for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I met the wrong geographic, but that was mutually:D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's totally impetuous.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
Furthermore, the concept of nationality is generally undue in terms of personal identity.
If something is related to people like that, the views of the world and the shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic felony, one is Ukrainian and another Slovak.
The Slovene Pharaoh is a very cool man, he's having a preach about theology rather than about politics, but then he's always screwing up some dick about coronavir that everyone's ashamed.
Then, of course, there is a Church of Czechoslovakia gusit.
They're officially protestants, but in fact they were born from Catholic modern and are truly Catholic without the pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to God's service to the gusits, because it's theologically much similar, but members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically valuable functional temple on the street of Botanica.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michala at the Dominican Square belongs to dominicans, and even there every Sunday at 15:00 they do the Mass in Latin, as it was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Beclav — The flame in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts took him for the pandemic of coronavir, but even this time they did not go to Vienna, and in the morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues on the Reintal-Breclav border crossing.
He was taken over on the border last year.
Bethlehem’s light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we attend every year with the division, I look forward to it.
It's a honour to me that I was chosen to tell the present journalists, Amalia Budic.
During last year, the transfer was carried out on the border crossing of Mikulov-Drasenhofen, directly on the border bridge, now on the Reintal-Breclav crossing.
Usually, the scouts are driving the train to Vienna.
There's no change in the divorce of flame after the Czech Republic.
With the light of Bethlehem, the scouts went traditionally on the train to Brna, where he was handed over to the diet bishop of Vojtech Cicrelem.
The next light diversion will be taken care of the scouts who will travel by the chosen speeds and personal trains on Saturday 18 December.
They will take the light from the stations of local scouts or volunteers, who will then continue to spread flames in the Czech Republic and where they do not lead the streets.
Even this year, the scouts must comply with valid measures against the spread of coronavir.
It's just like last year.
We recommend both those courier teams and local organizers to wear routines, try to observe dissents, not to sing colleagues, simply act as safe as possible, describes the speaker's action of the Betlehemic light Zuzana Hrbk.
The tradition of the Betlehemic light traveling to Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time with the flame.
The Bethlehem light is a symbol of hope for the believer, the light that overcomes the darkness.
In Czech Republic, the scouts and skauts have taken care of it for more than 30 years.
The action stands on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of insecurity and human mutuality.
All updates, including a list of places where people can come for flames, can be found on www.betlemskelo.cz.
I don't have economic education, so I don't know the grounds of the economy that confirm that grants are cancer of the economy, but I don't think that granting as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water detention), health and education will use the money properly, but I do not understand why the money is put into agricultural, industrial and general businesses.
As mentioned -- it is produced by an undue product and invades the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work myself in a factory where the hallways are millions of "xy funded/co-financed by project xy" and that company is just artificially kept in life.
This isn't the company's support that gives work x people, this is a rapid development when this company is holding up and collecting orders/workers to companies that could grow and be more productive after its disappearance.
Complete consent, it's horrible.
Sometimes a person who has been born in the Internet is also caught in a trick or a trap - especially advertising.
I don't think the Internet advertisements are moving with me, but then I'm still going to think that they influenced me too - it's just so exhausted that a person doesn't always resist it.
Even for that reason, I support radical votes in the European Parliament, which are at the moment trying to ban the full programme (= targeted) advertisements...
It's all bullshit, classic words - I'd ban the Internet.
I feel that this source has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe something that most believes and makes sense, but I'm not the sheep, but I'd rather believe something less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I'm going to have my own original opinion that I'll say it's critical thinking."
2. "I'm not going to believe everything that the media say"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
The television has failed the trend of Christmas movies, the Prime Minister has two hundred of them this year.
Los Angeles – China, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English speaking countries have failed in the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will present them to their viewers in the premiere records over two hundred.
It was calculated by the IMDb film database operator.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years scores and significantly increases tracking, so these images are increasingly increasingly.
This year, four times more Christmas films have been filmed than in 2011 and twice more than five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those images that have the word Christmas ( Christmas) in its name, so it will actually be a lot more.
The movies that people traditionally connected with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, in particular, the tales are related to this period, the world’s popular pictures of Sam at home, the love of heaven or classic Christmas story Life is beautiful since 1946.
The right boom of Christmas images, however, launched until in 2009, when a special film series arrived by the U.S.C. Hallmark TV station, the BBC server recalled.
Her advent project called Countdown to Christmas (Delivering to Christmas) then included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station began to play on Christmas since 22 October and present 42 Christmas images.
The Lifetime Competitive Station has also contributed to the 35 new Christmas topics this year and to the total of the popular stream platforms, such as Netflix.
“In this magic period of history, it is not so important that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it snows," said Brandon Gray, author of the book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Films (I'll be home on Christmas movies).
"For the viewers it is a form of escape and a way to feel a little peace for at least two hours in the middle of all this holiday madness and world madness in which we live for the last few years," Gray added.
He says, for example, Hallmark’s television still uses the same prescription for his films that is uniform but successful.
You have two people to fall in love with each other, but then there will be about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding that will be solved well and those two will kiss.
This is the way it's all around, and as long as all the movies look similar and they have a similar atmosphere, people watch each other, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19, not affecting the final F1 race.
To the Great Price Abu Kill in formula 1 will only go nineteen riders.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19 and won't hit the last season race.
Stay Haas will send only one formula on the track.
In the last season race, he was supposed to attack a better location from the 20th qualifications he went.
However, Russia Nikita Mazepin from the Haas Station will eventually not hit the Great Price Abu Kill.
Because he was positively tested on covid-19.
At the starting railroad, only ninete cars will appear, from the last line, on the track of Mazepin's team colleague Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who runs with Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle.
Mazepin is relatively fine according to the Haas state and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita's physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will be followed by the guidelines of the competent public health authorities, and security will be a final priority for all participating parties," said its representatives for formula1.com.
He won't send a replacement rider to the Haas race, or he can't.
The competent replacement shall have to graduate qualifications or rides in another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 is not the first raceman.
At the start of just the ending season, Covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, last year, they were positively tested Sergio Perez no Lewis Hamilton.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: Price of the most expensive sweater!
It's a little like a transmitted jewelry and a creator put his half-year work in it and all his savings.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but a little experience, the sweaters never wore a lot at our home," admits Libanon, who spent 3,000 hours over his work for six months.
The silk bought in Italy, 24-carate gold threads in France and 2000 beautiful crystals added Swarowski.
Then the silver stars decorated 150 diamonds.
“ The foundation is the wave and cotton, but the silk gives the sweater height, ” he praises the creator's work that he does not recommend washing.
And it's got another hook.
"I'm completely out of the way, I have to sell the sweater as soon as possible," Libanon admits.
If he succeeds, he'll create a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago was “only ” 720 000 crowns.

The government approved up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Gentiles, researchers and pilots of drones could go before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to help Polish colleagues protect the border with Belarus and the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from the NATO States, in connection with several months of persistent actions of the Belarus regime, which invites citizens of the near-east countries in its territory with a false pledge to easily cross the EU border.
In the Polish territory, British and Estonian soldiers are already active.
Mutation Omicron is spreading in the south of Morava?
Hygiena is checking another case of a child from Adam.
“We are currently reported further suspicions of this option in another child of Adam, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the U.S. Adamov is not proven," Ciupek said.
Six cases appeared in the area in the week.
"We are still waiting for an official confirmation of the option in our six cases," the National Reference Laboratory for the Hydrogen and the Hydrogen viruss of the State Health Institute in Prague said the Director.
She complemented that it was two health sisters from one workplace of the Faculty Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, along with two 11-year-old students of the United States of America Adamov.
There's no connection between the cases of Brn and Adam.
Three of them have mild symptoms according to the director, four insignificant progress.
No one suspected of Omicron traveled to a foreign country.
None of those traveled to abroad, none of their families, even contacted anyone who would live in abroad.
The compatibility with the championship in the water field has none of those, said Cupek.
The principal hygienic of Paula Svrčina previously stated that an international tournament was checked in the water field, which was in Brno a few weeks ago.
There were also players from the South Africa, and one Belgian player after his return sick.
California will limit the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas in the ban of abortions.
The Governor of California Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday the plan to introduce a ban on sale and production of certain weapons by means of a legal mechanism that Texas used in his controversial law against abortions carried out after the detection of the heart rate of the embryo.
Then people would have the right to compensate for anyone in California who produces or sells attack weapons and a surveillance of guns made.
The Newsom Notification responded to the Friday opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court, which the Texas ban of abortions remained in force, being against the nearly 50-year precedential verdict, which set the right to abortion generally throughout the United States of America by approximately 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court has now not decided on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on the technical issue that is based on the innovative structure of the measure.
In this case, the prohibition was transferred to the public, thus the Texas Republicans disposed of its attack by a common judicial way.
"I am disturbed by the decision of the United States Supreme Court of Justice yesterday (February) that allowed the Texas ban on most abortion services and greatly supported the Texas maneuver in order to protect its law," said the Californian Governor.
“If States can now block their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He said he had authorized his subjects to work in cooperation with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice on measures that would correct the public's representative to exert the ban on attack guns and so-called weapons of spirits.
This is the way that weapons produced that do not have serial numbers and which may be used to circulate regulations.
Newsom wishes that “private citizens” have the right to require compensation for at least $10,000 (approximately 220 000 CZK) and court exhibits from anyone who would produce, distribute or sell attack weapons, parts to“arms of spirits” or fruits for their production in California.
"If it is the most effective way to keep these scary weapons outside our streets, to create a threat to private complaints, we should do exactly that," the governor of California said.
The AP applies that after decades, California has banned production and sale of certain arms styles, but in June, the Federal Judge has blocked the ban as an anti-constitutional.
If the State would now renew the prohibition by using the Texas template, the words of the Liberal Member of the Supreme Court of Sonia Sotomayor, who, in an unsupported opinion on the Friday majority verdict, would be confirmed against the extension of the legal mechanism to other American States.
However, the Supreme Court did not acknowledge full immunity against the judicial review and allowed the abortion clinics to continue in the complaints on the selected official of the Southern State of the United States.
Each emergency vaccine has its public test phase when it gradually finds how the vaccination scheme will look and also happens to improve vaccines itself on the basis of results.
For example, a 4-dose study has already been studied in Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients have a five-fold increase in antibodies, which has a long-term effect to you.
Just like every other vaccine will have its vaccination scheme after time, just it's too early for it.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, should be marketed shortly, which, according to the specifications of the manufacturer, promises up to 10 times more efficiency.
It teaches the quantity to keep.
But to reevaluate what he's learning.
Since Maria Teresia, our civilization and technology has a little improved and learning telephone lists and description of books in the sheets has no longer made much sense and it is actually a waste of time.

How can I legally watch the League of Masters online?
Do you know if there's any online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to watch the League of Masters for fee?
We've got Netbox home and I'm paying for a sports package of Telly for Spanish and English football league.
However, it does not include the League of Masters of EUFA.
I think O2 offers the League of Masters, but I don't want to change TV and Internet providers.
Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would have acted in contrast with the law if it had used the new powers and would stop Poland's payments due to the legal state.
The Commission has already deferred the approval of the Polish plan on the withdrawal of 36 billion euros from the Union Fund for the renewal of economics affected by covidu-19.
It is also under pressure by the European Parliament to move on and use a mechanism that allows EU subsidies to breach the principles of the legal State.
"Poland should respond to this extortion by the EU by veto in all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarna Poland, without its votes, the current government would lose a close majority in the Seyme.
“Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy that lead to drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justified, since the EU is illegally deniing funds from the common budget we also contribute to, the Polish Minister added to us.
His party in access to the EU takes more radical attitudes than the Ruling Party of the Right and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes made by the Polish Justice for the effect of Ziobro threaten its independence and subject it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobra, builds “never possible conditions, because its goal is not a legal State, but a change of the government in Poland”.
Warsaw faces the “political dictate of blackmailing and attempting to undermine the democratic decisions of several millions of Poles”, also said Ziobro.
He stated that Poland should be a member of the EU which is based on the partnership of the sovereign states, not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such derogations to Brussels, which would result in restricting the sovereignty of Poland.
"We will never agree that Poland has the status of the colony," he said.
But recognizing that... we have one kind of cheese in Lidle in four different places.
I didn't look at the other things, and I met one yogurt more times, I just needed cheese, parmazan, 10 minutes after milk regáls, I resigned and asked.
They had it, that's true, in that narrow sector, all the chosen, less common and special cheese, but it was between vegetables and the withoutlactose zone...
If he gets away, I don't even smell in any market anymore, acts of non-action, golden crate on the square, maybe there's no choice, but mostly they have everything I need, and it's got some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidle to take a vacation.
And I don't care.
For two years, I've been watching how it's been loaded with data as a gnost, most of the opponents of vaccination are just a little bit more than most vaccine vaccines.
Although a racial discussion at the professional level is being held, only extreme views are available into the public space.
All the time from the wall to the wall.
Binary consideration: vaccination will save us, vaccination is nothing.
To ban everything, to allow everything.
Colour pies instead of solid analysis.
Compare apples with breasts.
This state has it like this, and we have it like this.
But that data collection methodology is different in these two countries.
Fuj, so I relieved.
I'm sorry for the explosion and have a nice day to all of you.
I was punished by cook when I was a child.
It was never because of marks, mostly it was just that I refused to listen and was angry (she read instead of sleeping, was fighting with her brother, etc.)
At the same time, I have never been punished without a warning, mom always threatened that if I do it again, I will get a shot (sometime even after another "clear" cook just brought and put it down to see it).
Just after I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few wounds on my ass (with clothing).
I personally think that physical penalties (in reasonable conduct and measure) are useful because the child reacts to them much more than words.
It's important to me that the part with a warning, because it gives the child a way to choose whether he will listen and get it, or it'll be better and the punishment will not be.
In the end, I mostly had only a warning to start listening.
System defense
When a significant Czech lawyer and Constitutional Judge of Vojich Cepl answered the press question in 1999, what the Czech Constitution means for it — whether the holy letter, on which she swears, and which she learns at school, or on the contrary, the agreement that can be changed if necessary, was definitely attached to the first concept.
Once in the constitution, we agreed on the democratic rules of our life, which also define who we are as a State and its citizens, and the changes are better saving.
And imagine: Some nations even like their rules.
Like the Czechs like pig and grapes, he voted at the time the question of the Army Cepl.
However, recently, the opinion that the CRC's Constitution needs changes is increasingly increased among lawyers.
Years are tested by situations that her creators (which Vojtech Cepl belonged) could not predict, for example, with the behaviour of the direct president.
But one thing, Ceple was right.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interferences in their texts must be thoughtful.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then it can be the key to dealing with most of the crisis that companies face through history.
The Constitution is, inter alia, a rule of governance consisting of individual rules that lay down mantinel policies.
We are afraid that the power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we are connecting policies to bans.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to have their power.
Covid doesn't choose, in FN Brno they're fighting for life of a monthly baby.
Although the coronavirus is milder to children, there are also difficult cases with which hospitals are dealing most recently.
“We know that children are threatened and affected less than adults, they are speaking of 2 to 5 percent in comparison with adults," said the Newsman Prime Minister of the Children's Anesthesiology Clinic and Resuscitation of the Faculty Hospital Brno and the Medical Faculty of Masaryk University, Peter Dominik.
Progress is significantly simpler, lighter, often run without symptoms.
But there are children's patients who are severely ill with coronavir, which we see especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild support.
It's happening at the children's infectious clinic.
Really seriously ill children with coronavir have been on the ARU lately.
Children with postcovid syndromes have been at the doctor's department continuously throughout the year.
"It is now the growth of children with acute covid pneumonia, which means a lung inflammation that requires stay on a reconciliation bed," he said and added that this disease affects adults and adolescents and a few-monthly baby.
In hospitals, children are also in a difficult state because of coronavir.
"The child is currently lying in a several-month and adolescent age," the Prime Minister stated.
Of course, he is happy that no child's deaths have been observed in the FN Brno child hospital.
According to available data, six children of age 0 to 14 died at 6 December.
According to Dominika, he is in a child hospital — not only at the coronavir department — an integral part of the psychologist co-operation.
At the same time, he also notes that both in adults and children vaccination mitigates the progress of the disease and at the same time reduces the occurrence of post-vision syndrome.
“We therefore recommend the vaccination dose in children, ” the doctor added.
In a quiet zone, you can only walk on the marked roads.
But those calm zones aren't so big.
They are seen on map tourist maps.cz.
Generally in the national parks outside the quiet zone you can walk anywhere (but don't go over the fence to the fence).
Lizing/crowing bikes in the forest outside the marked road shall not be anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much watched outside the national parks).
How's the dirigent doing?
The music goes in my head, Josef Kurfirst laughs.
He's derived from the Liberian Opera and originally played the forest corner.
As a singer, he can sing practically all the repertoar and as a dirigent works not only in the Liberian Theatre F. Shalda, but also in Plzni, in the Theatre Joseph Cayetan Tyle.
He cooperates with a castle philharmony, film filharmony, or a sub-symphony orchestra.
China builds an impression of diseases managed and that the authoritarian regime faces the crisis better
Synologist Jirous: China is building an impression of the diseases managed and that the authoritarian regime faces the crisis better.
China went to medical and political observations.
A few months ago, Peking reflected his criticism for not able to stop the disease that turned into global pandemic.
Now the country reports a zero increase in the infected.
States including Czech competitions on Chinese protective aid and Chinese doctors are helping many to combat coronovir, for example, the worst infected Italy.
How do you feel Peking's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the Communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
He meets a friend of a friend and he says, "You don't want a elephant?"
I got it and it's great.
My wife loves it because she saves the grass, she washs the car with chobots, kids play with him.
It's just great.
If you want for 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Friend: well, let's screw it up, that's gonna be great...
After a while they meet, and the one who bought complains: Dude, what did you sell for elephant?????
The grass crushed, the giant shit everywhere, the car scattered, the kids frightened him, and the wife wants to let her divorce.
The one who sold says, "You're talking bad about the elephant, you don't sell a elephant like that."
The world's action is controlled by powers.
Although the equality of the sovereign states applys, they are just powers that determine the course of international action.
Europe can only be such power if it is working on its integration.
It is currently working at the economic and political level (in selected issues), but there is still no military integration.
Personally, I think Europe is heading for federalization.
It won't be 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, moods will be different and it will be done.
I thought it was too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not a Czech expert, so maybe I'm a speaker.
I'm just saying that the elipse usually includes two different units at the same level.
I will lend an example from another commentary of "Spanese orange and mandarine", when it is clear that it is both from Spain, whereas the "Spain fruit and mandarine" is not clear that they are from Spain.
Besides, I'm based on the fact that the sentence is "all American forces" including their weapons and that I know that American complexes are only operational to Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in this broad concept and it does not need to be defined in the American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just a wordman:
Whether it is, or whatever, it's a nonsense.
The earthquake of five degrees has been recorded in Tokyo.
Japan's metropoli Tokyo and the surrounding area affected the quake of 5.0 degrees on Sunday.
Witnesses stated that buildings were in the capital, but no damage has yet been reported.
There was no warning from the tsunami, notified by the Reuters Agency.
Vicki Holland of Britain tortured a monkey of Cosman Milly
The scary recordings show the moment the scared monkey screwed in the toilet before her insensitive owner dried her and laughed at her.
The Dutch monkey also feeded cocktails, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its real nutrition needs.
The Magistrate Court in Gwent has now forever banned her animal behaviour, informed the Journal of The Sun.
The monkey rehabilitation experts who take care of Milly after her harassment have declared that they have never seen such a frightened spaceman before.
Milly spent almost two years rehabilitating with Monkey World workers in Dorset, and now she's playing happy again with another saved monkey named Moon.
Four times the mother confessed to two accusations for the cause of unnecessary suffering to protected animal.
At the magistrate court in Gwent, she was sentenced for 12 weeks of withdrawal of liberty with a conditional delay for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a lifetime ban on animals and has to pay over 12,000 judicial costs.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team, who rehabed the animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue."
Milly took time to get used to people again.
She screamed and hid from everyone she met and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she's settled and satisfied with a male, the view of new people can still cause panic.
Psychical scars from the harassment will be carried out forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's force came out after the police in Gwent discovered scary recordings in her wife's phone after the crash in her apartment for drug charges.
You can hear Milly supplies vulgarly in the videos.
In the next video, the Dutch monkey offers cocaine and says, "Would you like cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) confessed to hold cocaine with intention to sell it.
In her house, cocaine was found for 1600 pounds (in count of less than 50 000 crowns) hidden in the Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland was sentenced for 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that line three times after yourself when you skip the 20th century bravely?
Like you're taking the same things in the first year like the sixth grade?
And all this kills the idea of bifling, when no one, honour of exceptions, cares if you can or understand.
Just write a test on 1 and then no one cares about it.
Go and on the street randomly people ask if you can determine the nature of the roots of the square equations and the coefficients.
Everyone's been through it, and the absolute majority doesn't even scratch out and tell you they're totally in the face.
So what the fuck's he learning about?
I'm a big fan of the general review and the fact is that people don't want and don't need it.
And at that point, it's useless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
It's partly learning for many people who need the thing.
But, like, the note that you really don't need this all to stand at the machine, I meant completely seriously... because you just don't need it.
Furthermore, we get slowly until we don't know is a punk mark.
(It is likely to be part of our communist past and anger against educational and elitics) However, the price of barbars to stand in these machines is just high.
If journalists were able to count, the covid probably never reached this size here.
Wedding at first sight: War of Kadri and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason why Switzerland can't leave right now," Andrea answered the Instagram in Stories to the most important questions of the curious fans, which disappointed her at Kadrim so that she decided to close all contacts and even block it on social networks.
Between Kadrim and Andrea, it's been scratched since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea would move to her, so at least until he returned to Czech Republic.
But she definitely refused.
And as it appears, their relationship was not only ending with love, but rather growing into mutual disrespect to hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! he was upset by the contrary to Kadri in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debts.
The alleged honesty of Kadri's ex-wife has not been liked by his sister Linda's younger.
She decided to stop her brother publicly.
I don't normally speak to such things, and even in my family, we have never said these things very much.
I don't want to make any regrets.
But when I see someone who's trying to hurt publicly and dirty the name of someone I love so much, I just don't get it!
I'm sorry I have to do it this way, but I'd like to thank my brother Kadri publicly for helping our family with the most needed when he was young.
I'm more sorry to have to read this incorrect information that is probably quite erased from the context.
I would very much wish to know Kadri just as I, our neighbors and the family, stand in a confession to Andrey's words.
I am truly grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the fact and we know how it really was, added uncertainly.
The drunk thief climbed the fasada to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
He started his robbery to Cchao at the parking lot in a residential neighborhood where he tried to get into a few cars.
According to the available information, he eventually removed from one vehicle in the recalculation of less than 330 crowns.
Then he had no better idea than climbing up to the 5th floor and entering the apartment with an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
On one security camera, he's then caught walking off the street from the crime scene and eating banana.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he found out that bananas weren't where they were, and called the police.
The Cchaa's subsequently detained.
The man admitted he had some alcohol on an incriminated day.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob in drunkenness.
The whole thing is still in the investigation.
The drunker climbed the fasada to the fifth floor where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Law is timely limited and effectively linked to pandemic emergency.
If it's cancelled, the law will not be effective.
The law limits the scope of business
Is that not enough for you?
The right to gather will be limited, but not cancelled.

What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign policy?
I think all that people write here you know well.
You're just playing a fool so you can have someone to argue with.
If not, it's sad.
I don't say Christians are degenerates or anything.
I even like a lot of church buildings from the estetical perspective (which eventually was the goal to look good).
And I don't care who believes in.
On the other hand, I don't care how much the church had in the middle of the century, how much money she buried, how much science's pushing, etc.
Not to mention all the wars that it has caused, for example, those 30-year-olds
Tl;dr: believe yourself in a spaghetti monster, but the state and church have nothing to do together
The man fell down the head of 12 meters.
He survived the concrete attack.
The unbelievable fall survived on Sunday night a man in Ostrava, who was interfered with the rescue rescue officers of the Circuit Health Service.
The workers of the District Operational Centre took over an hour after Saturday midnight a press call with initial information on the fall of a man from the height.
Two ZZS crews — medical and healthcare immediately took place.
After arriving at the site, they found that a seventeen - year - old man was supposed to fall off the window of the height of about 12 meters and catch his head on the concrete!
The coal was caught in Vitkovic.

The intervening doctor inintubated his breathing paths, secured artificial lung ventilation and after other measures within the preacency immediate care of his sanitation vehicle transferred to the next care of the island traumatological centre, the speaker ZZS MS region, Lukas Humpl.
I have more concerns than coronavir from inappropriate responses to the public and authorities
Enlargement of coronavir in Czech Republic means a challenge for politicians and officials, in the first line of fight against disease, but above all the medical and healthcare personnel.
How serious is the situation of their views?

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA experienced a great galavecher full of interesting results.
Because things were happening at UFC 269 tournament.
Outside girl Julianna Penya managed to defeat a legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who hasn't found a murderer for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in light weight, lead against Dustin Poirier's great scratch and defend the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly destroyed Cody Garbrandt by the first round of the Technical KO.
His rival also beat Sean O'Malley.
Surprise that no one expected.
This was brought by a woman's game of bantam weight between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Penya.
The American woman entered the battle of each other as an intelligent “package ” because Nunes did not lose for seven years and sneak her teeth into another triumph.
The beginning of the duel was also carried out in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes launched a trip to victory very actively, and the rival even saved the push kick to send her to the ground.
However, the penny did not make any other mistakes, and she failed to strike herself through a pack to the hand.
The second round was squeezing and very tense for MMA fans.
Both rivals admired a lot of excellent hits and hard hooks.
Furthermore, Nunes got Nunes on the ground where she started scratching her.
She had to surrender and strike away.
That's how the American woman made a huge shock for everyone when she became a new champion.
The top of the galavecher was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier on the title in a lightweight.
At the beginning, although Poirius was better, the card began to turn.
In that second, he tried to be more active than Oliveira, who tried to hit the rival with his hand.
Although he didn’t make it too much, he then made a big pressure, got a rival on his back and spilled him with a number of wounds.
That's why he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed rear naked choke, whom Poirier opposed for a moment, but then he had to knock the scratch away.
Brazilian so defended the title, Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley's sovereign triumph, who has already put on Raulian Paivu the hard right back in the first round.
Then he got it with a number of exactly measured hits and recorded the fifteenth triumph.
Then Kara-France managed to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
During the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, and now she lost after seven years.
The pinch or the pinch?
At first, it's nothing complicated.
Most of the significant names in Czech are expressed by only one gramatic family, and therefore there is no problem to determine whether it is a male, female or secondary family.
But then there is also a relatively numerous group of substantial names in which the family is not steady.
Such substantial names collapse between two homes.
Then two ends are acquired in the slope, and in some cases they remain in an inclined form.
For example, the words “switched ” or“ squirrel ” are a male and female, in which the first slope is slonged according to the model “song ” in the second, according to the model “song. ”
For other substantial names, different forms are already in the first fall of a single number, such as ‘request/reduction’, ‘kedluben/kedlubna’ or ‘potatoe/potatoe’ (in the meaning of food).
Both forms are written, they have the same meaning, and they are freely replaceable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, such as “coal” in the Czech Republic and “coals” in Morava, in this case, but the moravian option is incompatible, similarly with other Czech and Moravian couples of words: “shook” and “shook”, “cook” and “coubles” etc.
Some words that came into Czech from other languages were originally inclined, but gradually accepted the Czech endings.
The typical example is the expression “image ” that is a male and female, or the word“ buffet ” that remains unacceptable in the middle of the family, but has the ends according to the pattern “clock. ”
Turkey has opened a road for migrants to Europe.
How does the situation look at the Greek borders?
The Greek and Turkish border is tense because of the growing number of migrants trying to reach Europe.
Thousands of people began to be issued to the south of the Schengen space after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise Greece's support, humanitarian assistance is also prepared by the Czech Government.
What motivates refugees to the uncertain path?
And what's the situation right there?
We haven't seen blue sky for three months, and we've been strangled, describes a journalist from Sydney.
The ruining fires with which Australia has been dealing for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozens of people and hundreds of millions of animals and destroyed millions of hectares of soil.
How do the authorities and inhabitants of themselves compare with a disaster?
Could the government of Prime Minister Morrison do more to avoid the drastic impacts, as the critics say?
And what will the country in connection with climate change have to prepare for the future?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to a journalist from Sydney Iku Detrich.
Fake accusations have always been and are rare enough.
That's why everyone is always written everywhere.
For people, it's uncomfortable to deal with how sexual violence looks in our society and how extensive it is, so he's trying to book it.
I don't personally know anyone who was falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who were raped and experienced how they often treated their neighborhood or even the police.
The victims should always be believed.
Trend's finally opening the victims about their traumas.
But he still keeps too many people for himself.
Yes, they will find them who blame someone fakely.
It's disgusting and spit in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the thought that the "great part of the accusation is invented" and that it's "trand" you're only helping sexual abusers.
Czech Republic swimming homes, families have no money to finish
Building prices have increased by more than 30 per cent over the past weeks and months.
Many people have gotten into a huge situation because of this.
It does not have the funds for the completion of the family homes, and banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to the prices of material, the price of construction work is also increasing.
That is why people have no money to finish the already established family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely uncomfortable situation.
In a better way, people move to homes that are set up and unchanged.
In worse cases, houses are unused and families are forced to sell them because they can't afford to pay mortgages and pay rentals to that," says BHS Economy Stjepan Krek.
We'll build two to three family houses a year, and 50 percent of us have happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it's difficult to keep certain things in agreement, even though the material has betrayed.
So we're doing no money," said the building company owner Zednek Slivoň.
Many people will only have financial problems.
If they're counting on building the house, it's going to be seven.
I think some will wait," Slyvon added.
The material was most irritated by copper, iron, and installation and toping equipment.
Building companies are also fighting the lack of working forces.
In the Czech Republic there are no graduates of the construction sectors and the flow of foreign workers hampers pandemia.
It is only more favourable at this point for the issue of construction licence.
“The construction authorities issued 7 675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 per cent more than a year ago”, Herzek stated.
We're good and we'll get better.
Real vision but missing, says CRO commentator – mujRozglas
The entry into the new year, except for classic celebration, has traditionally implemented the manifestations of politicians.
This year they spoke to the nation other than the Prime Minister and President of ANO Andrea Babiša and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman and the Presidents of the Senate and the Parliamentary Assembly.
What's the essential thing we learned?
I've got a great diploma at this point, I have my own theme I have chosen, I'm connecting to the cottage, I've always been working on it for a year, and then in a week to two, I'll write a written part.
The states are all calm at us, if you're not a total macak, and something left in his head, the committee won't suffocate him on the theory for nothing.
I may have been studying at the station for a week, and when I was at the end, the committee always tried to bring me to some logical ride that I was right and I had it right.
Otherwise, I know people who pay someone to do that semestral project to them (we did it many times, really useful, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're older.
I think it's great when at the end of the subject there is a test to show the knowledge acquired in the project, not just the defense.
All right, but don't suffocate e-mails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be the same as they are.
These people in the embassy don't have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they'd take a lot of risks, so maybe they'd have to play with them because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can build a statue like Putin.
You should give it to Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta's throwing a stick to the artists under his legs.
Once you don't give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to a total minimum.
Furthermore, it still changes what function is more important, if the leak, commentary or storage.
It's awful bullshit lately, so maybe I'll have to get down to tiktock, where many artists in my business are successful, and they're not almost able to let it happen.
Finally, I'd like to see if there's something userly warmer that doesn't feel from artists all the creativity and energy.
Declaration of the Party working on Donbase
The Union – yes, the breakdown – no, expresses their views on the picture of the opponents of the SSSR breakdown.
Thirty years from the illegal breakdown of the SSSR.
On December 8, 1991, the biggest geopolitical disaster in the history of mankind.
Without any legal powers and violating the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuškevic, with an openly consolidated position of Michael S. Gorbačov, secretly, regardless of the people, signed the agreement that “SSSR's bond as an entity of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist”.
One crush of the pen “removing ” an enormous land with nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
The SSSR declines of tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens have experienced abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by 10 to 11 million.
Despite the loss of the Nerussian population of former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars together!
Even before, the same people who, during one session in the White Tower forest, destroyed what was built in the past 70 years, betrayed the socialist camp (formed by the price of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patrietical War).
Scientifically, they did deindustrialization, stopped agriculture, excluded from the largest world power of 14 republics, which had previously been economically connected into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the poverty of the population, the decline of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, the interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechenland, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the divorce of Yugoslavia, the Arab spring, the war in Syria -- all is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the surrender of the first socialist camp, and the Soviet Union.
There is a concept in politology like “vacuum of power”.
Everything that has been betrayed and surrendered quickly filled and won NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken mainly because of events from the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s of the past century.
The price of the product sold in the supermarket with a large reverse must not correspond directly to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket worth 189 Kč/kg.
I'll buy it with putting it in the fridge and making it dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality in which I don't buy the meat on Monday, it will be left to 99 Kč/kg on Tuesday - will you describe me a mechanism that will make the change of the meat of its prices an intensity for my livelihood system?
Or will I wait by Thursday and that meat will be levished 1 day before the date of consumption to 69 Kč/kg - what would this meat be different from what I bought on Monday about 120 Kč and left it three days in my refrigerator?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
These bullshits about that when something's cheap, it must be guaranteed bad, corrupt or unquality are so retarded to tell you the truth.
I've recently gone to Brna to Headas, and in the front door, the girls were handing up a brochure, I always take things like that to help the brigs, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of rural mind and conservative views of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I thought it would be such an agitation.
After reading, I found who was publishing it, and the scientology finally came out of it.
Well, like a good motherfucker, full of absolutely useless lessons, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a pizza.
It's a pity of paper, that's why the forests wouldn't have to go.
I've experienced something like this with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychical manipulation and emotional extortion will make you raise it because you like it without realizing how much it is in the situation.
She threatened me a few times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk out.
Or even when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she cried and asked me not to go anywhere on her knee.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
CCA year was a great relationship, but then the next six months ran, and it started screwing her up.
Then I closed the relationship with the fact that I told her I was breaking up and lied to her, but we could talk about it next week to calm her down and not catching some ammo.
Such a person is sucking out of you feelings, emotions, and total joy.
Better keep a distance
When the insurance is scattered in a furious way by buying a cloud of tests and go to the positive, who would not be able to be tested or even know about this terrible disease.
The only thing we reach is the complications for companies, carriers, and others, because their employees in a random number generator fell five days of home prison.
In the west, they stopped with the dumb, and they recognized that it was not worth dealing with the disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, War is new, and he has to steal something else and run his ego out of bullshit.
I'm seeing a good old motherfucker's coming back.
After a few years of collapse and repression of this little business, MLM recruitment returns to the expulsion.
I was one of the recruitors, I tried it (I was 20 years old, first-year-old to the VS), the initial promises of the education of products and business skills quickly turned into "that you don't have to care, especially get people."
I was sincerely interested in the products that I offered, since I wanted to help people, the training was rather about how to scare and talk.
When the first money came, the person quickly realized that if he wanted to make money, he had to get a few of certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgage were the only profitable, or then a man felt like a loop seller.
But what I can say, experience was valuable, a person learned that he shouldn't jump right on every peak and information carefully.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw everyone in one bag.
People in this business are successful and even benefitable to people, but they will certainly not be praised by expensive consumption goods or "fat" accounts.
In the corporate where I'm doing, I haven't experienced much of that.
HR is calm, the managers look at their managers and they don't push us much into anything.
The regular evaluation is happening somehow, in the form that this goes pretty well with us (determine some goals for the next year, we'll see what's done and what's not) -- it's rather self-estimation than someone would appreciate you according to some numbers, and so on.
Company actions are also unnecessary.
But even within our company, we're a little unique -- they're departments that are more corporate.
Sometimes a person feels like we're such a almost-startup that squats in the offices of the great corporate no.
But it doesn't work that way they don't bother us as long as the results are.
Czech Republic missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
Almost ten days the British police looked for the missing 32 - year - old Czech, who was lost at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12th, the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced in the demision of Jacob Kulhanek on social networks that the woman from Uherskogradish was found dead.
The British police today, unfortunately, confirmed our Deputy Office in London that she found the body of missing Czech citizens.
The cause of death is investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not communicate more information on the case.
Honestly condolences, he stated on Twitter Culhanek.
The young woman was last seen on November 28th in the bus on her way from work, and she was supposed to pick up the money from the bankomat before her showing up.
Her disappearance was announced by colleagues from work five days later.
Then the london police began looking for it, Interpol put it in between missing all over the world.
So it appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police have arrested one man a few days ago in this connection.
What he was supposed to play in the case and what he suspected, but didn't announce.

The processing of the results of Saturday elections symbolically closes a relatively difficult but successful year for us.
The new or repeated elections to the general representatives and primarily very monitored elections to the Parliament.
We had to work mostly in the harder epidemic conditions that were more eligible for equipment and personnel security, Eva Krump, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistics Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49 hours.
On Monday the vote results will be discussed by the State Election Commission and will be published in the Law Collection after approval.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a very dangerous illness at the beginning of the whole time, but it went without bigger disturbances.
To deal with how an idiotic part of the population gets into it on all its layers, I have a problem so far.
I look forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because it finally makes me less dependent on the fact that other people are not shit.
He would be rid of the president's function and eligibility to recharge it.
The chance that this really happens is how others mention a very small one here.
Besides, I'm not sure if the record's chart could be regarded as an excellence.
Velesrada is a act that the President of the Republic threatens the supremeness, territorial integrity, or a democratic nature of the State.
It must have been something more serious.
How pandemia affected intimate life: Increases the number of people to 35 years old, who are without sex all year
The more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
It's mainly religiously based people, according to the DailyMail Web journal.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, 35 people who denied sexual life were raised from eight to 21 percent.
Women between 18 and 35 years who indicated that they had no sex in the last year are more than ever before.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, showed the study of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them may be the economic impact of coronavir pandemia and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But it could also contribute to the presence of media, social networks or video games that make young people less and less priority for sex.
"Since 2010, the share of men and women between 18 and 35 years of age has grown rapidly," IFS researcher Lyman Stone said.
In people in marriage, sexual activity is more frequent, only 5% of them indicated that they were with no sex in the last year.
For free people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under 35 is only a small percentage.
The fear of predmanagement and religious establishment also contributes to the loss of sexual activity.
Although the probability of sexually active husbands is greater, the percentage of married and married 35 years continues to decline.
Young people are dividing the view of premarriage sex, about 30% thinks it's a bad thing, while about 70% thinks he's okay.
"It is true that among free individuals in this age are a minority, but their behavior moves this trend," Stone says about these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarriage is the cause of a religious foundation.
Since 2008, the rate of abstinence increased from 20 to nearly 60% in free people under 35 years, who are participating in religious meetings more than once a month.
The trend was raised from 10 to 20% among the “minor believers”, Stone declared.
Other factors, for example, less social interactions and particularly social alcohol drinks during pandemic, also contribute to the decline of sexual activity.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is smaller in people without work or with lower income.
Another reason could be the extension of digital media that apparently reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, making this need "replaced".
This trend was captured mainly by the lockdown at the time of coronavir pandemia.
The whole vaccination order against covid is whether the company should force a part of the population to be conducted that they do not want but which can save their lives.
It's a rather difficult question that I personally care about the issue of social conscience.
For example, the question is, if we don't order them and they die, it'll be our fault.
My argument is, for the death of an eighty-year-old man who didn't really know, we didn't explain it well, he heard some disinformation, and he didn't surrender himself and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think that we can be able to kill a strong vaccination opponent, who's crying about a screaming and totality state.
Of the statistics I mentioned, it is quite clear that most unexpected pensioners are likely to belong to the second group, so they will actually be able to do so.
Czech without snow.
How is the mild cold signed on the fight against drought?
This year's cold has brought one of the smallest snowpieces in the Czech Republic in the past.
The ski operators will not pass without technical snow, the weather may also complicate the preparation of the Jizerian 50s.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will a little snow mean for the fight against the drought in Czech Republic?
I'd have one story, but it's not about a pancake.
Once in high school, the teacher led us across the city to the shipway so that we could ride the boats across the river.
By the way, we went a pretty broad street, and we probably don't see in the middle -- the sect of Hare Krishna.
Of course they've been screwing up on us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but one friend and I talked.
When she left them, we asked her and her teacher what she told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she answered.
Everyone, including the teacher, was laughing all the way to the boat.
We're so spoiled.
It's not so much happening, but the system's falling down, says Orozovic.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after the previous visits of Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where Prime Minister Mateusz Moravecki welcomed him with military honours.
"We open a new chapter of mutual relations," Moravicki said at the joint press conference after the negotiation.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violations of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
The crisis caused by disturbing Russian troops on Ukrainian borders is, according to the Chancellor, to deal with the use of diplomatic negotiations, including within the “Normand Group”, which associates France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Moravecki stated that he informed the Chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexandr Lukašenko artificially called for the migration crisis and used people as live targets and guns, because at night we record a hundred attempts on (illicit) crossing borders.
The Chancellor has been dealing with other sanctions that the Lukašenkov regime and his masters in Kreml will finally understand that we are determined to defend the eastern EU border.
Scholz, according to the DPA Agency, assured that Warsaw was looking forward to German support in the fight with Belarus, and condemned the non-human treatment of the Lukašenk regime with runners.
The drunken Polish bullet was in an accident, trying to hide it.
After a while the car returned to the scene of the accident, the car was driven by another monk who tried to take guilt on himself.
When she was told by the police that she could lose a driver's license if she didn't take advantage in the ride and take off the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, the TVN24 station stated.
She confessed that another maid who asked her for help had hit the vehicle.
Then the cops came to pick up Sister Celestine.
She was subjected to the breath test, and after she found her blood over two miles, she was immediately taken from her driver's license.
At the same time, she was informed that she would be confessed from her acts in court.
Dog Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Shimovič didn't watch his movie.
The Czech family comedy creators looked at American stories about love dogs.
But they forgot about the important thing: the laws of the film art.
After the F. Brabce Gump film, the dog who taught people to live is now failing to watch another picture in the movies.
A script and director in one person Juraj Shimovic is freely attached to his previous film Here I'm watching from 2012.
On the scene, the speaking horsey Hugo and some famous figures around him are returning.
Julia and Ivan, the owners of the forest pension that's ruining, so they're going to invite the doggies, Julia's father with her partner and, in particular, her daughter Veronica.
She's not a little girl anymore, but a teen girl who's experienced the first love.
The director with Beatriz Shimovic partner (which is also a film producer) had been dealing with the history procedures in the previous dog picture, but at least children and dogs had fun there.
This time she wrote a creative couple a weaker scenario that causes the mixture of amazing and embarrassing feelings.
Let's take a summary.
Julia, though a scientist, is subject to the desire for a child of dark adultery and if the right “constellation ” comes, is collaborating with his forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are determined – on the car hat or church tower (of course during the excursion with the local guide), the colonel Mymir, despite the summer training, will shoot in the woods of his own daughter (Julia), which falls into a coma and is a family taken from the hospital to play a miraculous dog healing process in the heart of the forest.
Nothing against clean treatment of nature and the strength of animal lovers.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the spectacle is terrifying what contents of incredible situations and the figure needed for this message.
Two staff thieves, doggies competition, wooden charlatan, cops coming to seek "drogs" and discussing herbs about the drunken strength of bone flours – and whom a baked family in the pension of course drinks.
When a hero wakes up after a severe coma and regain sits onondulated and seated with a cigarette at the family table and requires the father's whiskey and flakes to heal a vegetarian can't be laughed.
The creator will explain to the audience that “this sometimes happens after a coma. ”
Shimovic's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of text work, the ability to build the nose situation, the feelings for characters and the point and direct management.
Active performances are unbalanced, cut unhelpable and total impression.
Anyway, Lucas Vaculik, Jitka Ježkova or Nela Boud is trying to stand up, they don't have much to play.
The only feature of the film remains the poetic recordings of the forest nature of the cameraman Vladimir Holomk and two of the horsemen.
It is not enough to plan a number of figures, a fancy confusion and dogs, while more human vulgarian expressions that the figures make.
Argument is not even an age membership in the Club of the breeders - as in the case of the producer.
The good intentions of promoting nature and human friendship with a dog must also be the knowledge of the booking if a person wants to tell a confidential story.
That didn't work in this case.
There's a little too much erotic and a minimal emotional for a genre for a good family.
Even as a canistrapy advertisement, this amateur-contact piece would not pass.
Yeah, respect, 'cause they have to listen to the continuous obsessions just from fools like you.
There's a difference between offering and force, here you see how shit you understand, but it's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always on the customer, if he doesn't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you were listening to such kids, you might have changed your mind.
It's a job like every other one, in which case a brigade for extra charges.
The near east suffers uncommonly dry months.
Winter is the only period in the year that rains.
“The full absence of crashes during November, as we recorded on certain stations, is unusual," the Israeli meteorological service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long - term collapse diameter in November.
The two-day rain of this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained for a long time.
It's also the right Christmas coulis, who was happy with the people of Nazaret Vasim Ashkar.
Israel’s struggles come exclusively in the winter months, they're hitting and irregular.
The winter rains are dependent forests.
Without them they dry and are inclined to fire.
It's not just forests, it's also the supply of drinking water and the cover for farmers.
The largest sweetwater source in Israel, the Galilean Lake, was filled on spring this year through three last rain winters.
Since then, the level's dropping.
Waterholders have warned about drying a long time ago.
“It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change here, there may be a collapse”, assumed in 2018 by the Israeli spokesman of the Uri Schor Water Economy Authority.
Israel can help technologies such as salt or recycling of waste waters.
It is worse for economically weak countries like Libanon, Syria, or Jordan.
In the streets of Jordan, Amman, there are tank cars.
The waters and private wells dry.
"The summer raised my orders by 70 to 80 percent compared to two previous years," Imad Sulejman, driver, said in September.
In Iranian Isfahan, conflicts between farmers and security forces broke.
The reason for the protests was dry.
The local river's coryto was totally out of water.
The region has the most dry November in many years.
Israel is preparing military invasion against Iran
Israeli Defence Minister declared that the Vienna negotiations did not make “no progress” and informed Washington about the preparations of the attack on the Iranian nuclear equipment.
Minister Benny Gantz announced on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli Army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis informed.
Gantz, who stays in the United States, is trying to convince the Americans to make their pressure on Iran, but also informed Washington about military preparations.
During the press conference in Florida Gantz said that nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring “no progress” and the world powers“ understand that the Iranians are playing with them”.
This happened to me about three years ago.
I screwed a little bit of Miss and grilled at the interview to find out what she really wants to do with me.
Finally, I found out that my suspicion of pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these screws, so I've got a little bit of doubts and questions, and I've finally thanked and left.
You can tell me I've screwed up, but pyramida is pyramida, and financial advisors are financial advisors.
The skiers went to the mountains on the weekend, waiting for enough snow and nice weather.
The Mountain Centre in Czech Republic experienced the first larger effort of skiing students on this weekend.
After an extensive snowing at the end of the working week, there is no need for snow, and some skiareals have started operation.
The Congressors did not denounce either the obligation to show themselves in the trains with a covid certificate.
While villains do not complain about the interest of customers, some ski equipment loans report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberian district traveled to the railway tracks and to the conventions.
The skijars wanted weather that offered the sun today and excellent snow conditions.
"We are pleased, that starting weekend really came from the Friday night skiing when we had the first skier hill," the Director of the Sports Area, Šed Jakub Hanus, commended himself.
Thousands of people went for the first weekend skiing in the new season, too, to the Jesenics.
For example, they had Ski Aren Karlov or the Centre in Branna in Schumperska.
The weekend visit was very pleasant, and 400 people were estimated on Saturday and today.
Conditions are cool.
Today, the sunlight was lighting, there was about minus three degrees, so perfection, did not save the praise representative of the ski center in Branna Rostislav Walk.
Skiareal operators can sell skipas only to people who are vaccinated or are within a period of time after covid-19.
Unless the exceptions are people prepared and demonstrated the necessary documents, CTK René Groneš said from Spindler's Mlyn skicenter.
"We only recorded incident units," he added.
Less interest than the pandemic reports of some loans and ski equipment sales.
Fortunately, the interest in leasing skies is.
It's not like the past years, but there's still plenty of customers, Alexandra Bokishová said from the Skyopava Shopping Store.
He expects greater effort during the ski courses.
Also, the director of the Royal Court of Justice Snowbear David Shintak feels that the covid is not the interest of lending ski equipment as before.
At that time before the pandemic, we were almost borrowed.
Against the period before the pandemic, we are approximately 50 percent, said the CHTK Shintak.
He thinks people were lazy with pandemia and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand records the loan in Novako area on God’s gift.
With the loaning of skies, they started there a week ago, and the students must now order them in advance.
"We are starting to borrow this weekend, but people have already called forward, so we are expecting a great interest, just like last year," said the Operator of the Area of Paulina Novak.
The interest compared to the period before the epidemic is also according to the ski school.
If we want successful and rich not to go abroad, there must be a chance to live a quality life as abroad.
It is certainly not a socialist healthcare where a dentist or a specialist is often not possible.
They're going to abroad, smart and fancy people who don't have any property here.
The owner of the company's abroad doesn't just leave.
But with the rest, it's totally agreeing.
If these people don't live well in the C.R. and if these people don't have a good future in C.R., they're just not going to live in the C.R.
The emigration from Hungary began by winning Orban one beautiful day, the year ruled, and suddenly a few dozen thousand emigration rose.
It's naive to think that the CR can't be in a similar position from day to day.
Another question is the choices at all.
If you live here stupid, there's a traditional V4 mad man who can win.
Young people and education will leave, his supporters will remain, and people whose property can't be put into the plane.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in the blood for a beer beat?
While in the Czech Republic there was a full-flow autumn, in Thailand, the headquarters of the islands in front of Jiri Langmajer (55) used tropical weather!
The actor published a bleeding photo of his face on social networks.
Is it a real wound, or is it a dealing for the recording?
The London police are still looking for an unfamiliar Czech Republic.
She was last seen on the way home.
"The disappearance of Petra is not like her behavior and we are starting to worry about her," said Lucy O'Connor in the Saturday video from the police department in Lambeth, where Srnz worked.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech Republic according to it on Sunday 28 November around 19:45 left work and headed home to Camberwell's quarter.
The last time she was reportedly seen in the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd of her colleagues.
Srnc, according to British media, acted as a “authorist of health sisters” in the children's hospital Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St. Thomas hospital.
"We have tremendous concerns about our dear colleague, Peter, who is unreasonable," a group of health facilities said in Twitter's contribution.
"We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that could help her find to contact the police," the message continued.
The public to cooperate also calls on Ambassador Harriet Harman, who notified on Saturday on the Srnz case at the press conference.
"She's not familiar for a few days, she's only 32 years old, from the Czech Republic, her parents are obviously worried about death," the labourist politics said, holding a woman's photograph distributed by the London Police in her hand.
"I feel that we all have a great responsibility to try to find it, because she was out of her homeland, away from the family and worked here for our health," Harman said.
The police have already arrested a man who remains in custody in connection with the case.
According to the BBC reporting website, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what a man is suspected of.
Russia is unable to capture Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine like that either.
It's not a giant quantity, but an eight percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine repeats that we increase the threat of the Invasion and begin to have our entry full of teeth.
I quoted upstairs.
I don't know what he thought Russia wanted to do with the war.
The war is a damn dear joke and Russia has a HDP of Italy.
The comparison of the situation in 38 is out of so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare it to the first punnish war and "anexi" sicilia:D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that she would not comply with the agreements from Minska, Russia is announcing those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and the "concentration" on the borders would answer it.
What, the Sent Servanda Pact...
In Prague since Sunday, new driving orders are valid, mainly affected by pregradary bonds
The travellers in the Prague integrated transport (PID) expect a number of changes from Sunday, which are particularly related to the pregradary bonds.
There were new lines, some changed the route, and others disappeared.
The integrated system is newly incorporated by Mladiboleslavia.
In the capital of Sunday, they stop rapids from the Czech Budjejevic station of the Garden City.
In the pregrady trains, the S7, trains traveling on the route from Beroun to the Czech Brod through the Prague main station.
In the recent operational station of Prague-Grade, R17 will be a new stop from the Czech Budjavic and Benešova.
The PID will newly expand to other areas.
Otherwise, buses will go to the Light of Sazawa, Blatna at Jesenica, Old Floods and Turnov.
The buses in Mladoboleslavia will be included, including lines with the transfer to the Liberian and the King's Court.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines are introduced and 12 functional operations will be adjusted.
From Prague Zlichin, a new bus line 405, which will go to Jatza.
There has also been a new direct connection to Prague – Kralovice in the Cancer, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
They'll be empowered in the morning peak and on the weekend they'll be connected from Prague to Cancer, when the express line number 404.
News are included in the PID system lines 400 and 410 traveling to the Liberian district.
They're going from the metro station, not from the station of the Holešovica Station.
The fourth line, 400, goes across Mulnik, Dubu and Czech Lipa to New Bor, and the chosen mergers continue to Rumburg or Cvikova.
Further line 410 goes across Mullnik and Dubua to Dox, Mimona and Jablonny in Podešted.
On the contrary, the new operation is cancelled or restricted on the tens of Central Central Local Trails, including Mochov, Dobrisz, or Rožmital under Tremschen.
All trains with departure from Prague are cancelled at 02:30.
In order to modernise the railway, long-term restrictions on the trails of Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysa over Labe and the area of Kolína.
Changes are also waiting for travelers in other places.
The buses are replaced by some cancelled railway lines or extended by a section of 420 of the Dobris with a bond from Prague where the PID tickets can be used until Milevska.
The change was made by lines 540 to 543 in Nymburg and some buses are adjusted on the border of Central Czech and Hořowic in the Plizenia region.
Healthy meal/ lunch to the supermarket office
Hi, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30-min break and my only chance to get food is to go next to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, I have no strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietally.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and at a speed I'll buy a pizza pizza cream and a yogurt and an apple.
Question: What healthy without the need of heat adjustment would you recommend to buy me in the supermarket?
Not everyone's waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately they are.
And it's not about trees you need to see.
Only a peak of tree can be hiding under the snow.
If the tree is destroyed, the tree may be more inclined to be mushroom sickness.
I'm not saying that that's the only reason we're not allowed to go outside the convention, but it's one of them.
Dary's confession about the relationship with the Neved: I've never been happy for this
The Czech show business pond since Friday is nothing but revealing the relationship of Dary Rolins and Paul Ned.
They've been pulling it together for years, and a famous footballist even got divorced because of a singer.
Now Dara sent a broad message to the fans, explaining why love has been secreted to them for half a year.
"I allow myself to claim that there is currently no one in Czech or Slovakia who would miss that Dara caught a bear, then pardon, Ned," a joke of Dara Rolins, who is in the most successful Czech footballist in love to the ears.
He said he packed it, not the opposite.
Three days are the center of attention, and even though they are used to public interest, they do not have the joy of it.
And that's it.
What we both didn't look forward to, but we knew it would happen once, a singing continues.
I just don't know who's worse.
If those who don't care about it, and they're jumping out of the can, or we whose lives are questioning detailedly.
As if one of you wanted to hear the view of whether you and your husband or girlfriend were good enough, or you were insisting that all of you really know the list of your former partners and have been informed about the number of your mistakes and errors.
That's a yellow, that's what you want. It's Dare.
The two were together in Italy, where Rolins was driving for the preparations of her new fashion collection.
The ned has been acting as Vice-President of Juventus' football club again for a long time.
They went out with the truth just now because they were waiting for Nebed's divorce to be completed.
With Ivana, they have been separated for three years, not for their own, but only for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who are happy with us and wish us, we thank you.
We're just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have the heart in the right place.
Even that's why I love my new man, and as he is with me, I stand with him, and in good and in evil, she closed Rollins.
Hi, the other commentors have probably said all the important things, but I'm just confirming that the railways are great before the beginning, my classmates mostly met during the first semester or two, and they met, and then they found the shop together, which seems like the best option, because you know who you're going to live with.
The apartments are not usually incorporated too long ahead, so you probably won't find much now, but you can't be able to look at the offer.
Otherwise, avoid not only Cela, but also the neighborhood (as Vranovska, French, etc., it is a pretty bad address), and some parts of the Jews are a little ghetto.
On the contrary, Verje's quarter is very student, the King's field, and that's the way it's cool, and it's also close to most VUT faculties (I don't know exactly where you're going).
I've never been looking for rent, but I'm a birthbird, so I can advise Brne as if you're missing any more information :)
But that's an example of totally "normal" thinking.
Because of what several doctors have decided to do in Poland, it is actually perfectly right that the state does not finance schools enough.
Whether they teach what they want and pay it from their own or whether they go according to the state and pay for it.
We can't let a private actor control a piece of education only because a full-time public contribution comes to a few crowns and thus he will be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such claims are somewhat lost on the weight when it was written by a person who two days earlier expressed the petition action for the totality boicot of the state:
So the voice against if someone goes to abortion is the same to you as a voice against any statue standing on the square?
I'd consult you directly with the man who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I've already experienced that (i.e. long-year-old professionals) it either turns from the eye, or write something in the way of xxx *** or ... (convention) and that it is not readable.
The truth is, in this case, it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it completely.
I'd deal with it personally in a note of what kind of program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and hard student, you can look at some sign databases and look for the closest one.
But since it looks like you're pulling out of a book, I'd say that the author or the printer simply created his own sign, which belongs to what's physically on that coin.
PS: Isn't it a case rather the Odryn empire (King) than Audrey?
PSS: Somebody's already letting you down here.
Look at that comment with ÖH
Politicians don't even know what will be the "theme" of our presidency.
It's a lot worse trouble than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve of something because no one understood any text is smiley.
All important approved documents are examined by the word from the word, and the basic knowledge of English is not enough, that's the matter of lawyers.
In various EU institutions, hundreds of translators and interpreters are working, English is more useful for politicians for informal contacts, incorporating overstandard relations.
Furthermore, with this English, it is quite interesting after the GB appearance of the EU.
I don't understand that hate of Cele.
I've been working there for the third year and I'm fine.
How many times I ride from work at 10 a.m. and never a problem.
The fact that it's a ghetto can only say someone who almost didn't get in there in his life.
Yeah, it's probably the most of the Roman population of Brna, but the only thing they're doing is that they're interfering on the walk and parking where they don't have:D definitely isn't that I'm afraid to climb on the street tonight.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap living with good availability to the center, I'd go in.
A lot of apartments are now newly reconstructed or newly built.
Felix Slovak (78) without Ada and Gielem's lover as a colleague in the plot!
Who's going to spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people on the advent vein burned the first candle, not Felix Slovak.
I don't have an advent vein, so there was nothing to smoke.
I've seen a branch, and Lucy must have had, said to the Lightning Saxofonist, who confirmed the words of Patras, that she often visits her.
He visits, but he doesn't live in their house in the Winehouses where Dadad stayed alone after his departure.
Slovak still doesn't know where he's going to be on Christmas evening.
We've recently met with Anicka, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slovak and Lucia Gelem: AGAIN SPOLE!
Felix Slovak and Lucia Gelem: ONLY SPOLE!
But we were still talking, so it didn't happen for Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm going to be.
I'm buying gifts in time, and I'm sure I'll buy Dad and Lucia something, probably a perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the baptism of a music video to the Richman club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel myself.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slovak, who was happy to meet the wife of Luđak Saturday Adriana or Singing Camille Nylt.
And he made it clear.
And we are the Island to afford no soldiers and weapons?
I doubt someone's going to defend us for us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor must be a total idiot to not plant this territory.
And I don't understand why this should be a bad argument, so you'll explain it to me?
I don't know any other file that could be placed in hospitals in the crisis.
The cops are little and they can't afford that, so are firemen and nowhere in such a high percentage of health-trained people at this level.
And the fact that our army is capable of defending just the Ostrava heads the previous governments, not the army, she's been asking for new toys for a long time.
Record drying in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural grants, the land is not just a food factory, says the journalist.
Czech Republic is going through the worst dry period in the last years.
The waters according to scientists were declined in mountains and sub-hore areas, the smaller corner of the collapse also records places where the need has not been yet.
The cause of the drying in most part of Central Europe is climate change.
But it also strengthens the way we handle the land.
What are you ready to do about drying?
And how can we help the nature in difficult times?
Yeah, that's right, I'm barely holding up in ice brushes, i know what it's like to play hockey and the tactics (which I've tried in France Hockey Manager) is also a total hall.
And whether you're a hockey team "mead of Russia" or "lama China" lose two goals, even if you don't have to win a game at any cost, it's different than when it's compared.
But just as I listen to the Czech commentators who push out, what judges do not notice whether a male or female hockey is, it's all weird, but it's probably all sports, EUFA and "Italian actors" or motorport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And if it was the opposite, it's like it's always the other time, and that Czech Republic and Russia have lost more often than it wins, it'd probably be a classical "they're losing" in the "We won".
Coronavirus: Number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, on 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily diseases.
5766 people were hospitalized.
Overall died in C.R. 34,451 people, other 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are 1967 to 100 000, 871 per 100 000 in the last week.
The number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
29,929 new diseases have been registered in the last 24 hours.
It's the lowest daily number since October 13th.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, which is the lowest daily number of dead since the end of October.
Britain faces a large wave of infection caused by Omicron, and Dr. Susan Hopkins, the main medical advisor for the British Health Office, said on Sunday.
It'll need new quarantine measures.
Persons infected with omicro are already hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their number to grow.
For now, no one died of microne, but some fourteen days after the disease and about three weeks after the disease occurs to hospitals.
The chief of British labourists Keir Starmer stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently violated the law by breaking up in December, when the Christmas party was launched and banned, organized a Christmas quiz in Downing Street.
One Minister of Johnson's government protected the quest to be “virtually ” through the computer.
However, he was attended at Downing Street group of employees gathered around computers.
In Britain, pressures to remove Johnson from the premier function.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and the Christmas partys were banned, Johnson's ministers arranged despite a number of parties lockdowns.
The British public and the media are angry that Johnson and his government were making fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of the ITV commercial TV for Britain: Today two years ago Boris Johnson won most of the general elections.
This morning, the Conservative Party talks about the need to remove it from the premier's function.
Excellent how quickly the events have risen.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is waiting for the spring of elections that can end the 12-year-old government of Victor Orban.
It will be the choices of European importance.
How much can it be expected to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't even be free because they weren't the last two choices under Orban.
His party Fidesh controls the media, changes the borders of the electoral districts to profit from it, and makes other smaller or bigger tricks.
The last one sounds like anyone in practice can vote wherever he wants.
This will allow Fides to link voters from the decisive districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying they're not fair at all.
Do you think this will be just as unfair as in the years 2014 and 2018?
The situation is very different.
It was once, not if Fidesh wins, but how much and if he has a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will get a united opposition.
It's for Victor Orban and his side of the big unusuality.
Don't they try to keep it harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they're ready to go beyond what they've done before.
She recently fled into independent media recordings by the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz Laszlo Kövera, where she explains to the chiefs of secret services that opposition is a threat to national security.
These are the signs of the new approach you're talking about?
Yeah, that's one of those news.
It's all starting with the tongue.
I've been beaten quite often, last time at 14, mom's parents have no too much patience, neither am I, her daddy has long, but then she's blowing extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was very cholerical, and I was angered as a little awful, to the extent that I lied on the ground in the scream and was all blue, they took it two times under my shower to calm down.
Sometimes they danced me in my education, sometimes it was rather that they didn't know anymore.
I'm definitely in the tendency to deal with things with violence now, as a little girl, I've had a lot of bathing, now I'm gonna kick myself at least in something, and as a younger one I've had my parents so crippled over my hand, like (if I didn't get too much over the arm), so I've never got anything extreme, but I've always got it.
I'm not able to determine how much this is my explosion, but I'm sure that the education also has its share.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose my patience with my children, and I'm gonna deal with it the same way.
I think being kids is just bad and that my parents weren't supposed to do it, especially when it wasn't "discriminatory" anymore, but from frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws something, I guess it's not possible to screw up their kids, so I don't count it.
I'm not insulted, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of something.
The laws should be clear and clear.
So I'd call those who make the laws in such a quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're afraid of the loss of income.

Where will Slovakia move the process with the killers of the Kuciaka?
In Slovakia, the main treatment in the process with a quarter accused of the murder of Jan Kuciaka and Martina Kušnier.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partners changed Slovakia.
She moved the civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused entrepreneur Marian Kotner and his link to the top of the Slovenian policy and justice.
How will a major breakdown mean the process for Slovakia?
It's the huge journalists who can do it.
How is it possible that this petition had a regularly more media attention than the contrapetials of the Deans of all medical faculties that came out for a day, two later?
No, they've let themselves screwed up and the company jumped off.

Another government ends and the municipal involvement law in the selection of storage nowhere
The proposal of Minister Karl Havlicka needs to be reworked essentially
The government of Prime Minister Andreja Babiša is at the end and the law to ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens in selecting and authorizing the depth storage of high radioactive waste is still not.
The Government's legislative Council has interrupted the negotiation of a proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after summer interviews.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected communities associated in Platform against the depth storage but also with the Union of cities and citizens of the CRC.
The self-submissions from the law expect more to strengthen their options in the determination of the repository, as promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and required by the Czech Atomic Law and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to process in collaboration with the public.
The proposal for a law from Minister Karl Haviček, which has the Platform available, in particular explicitly arises from the municipalities: The proposed measure of involvement of the communities and the public in the selection process of the location for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the community and their citizens.
It can be effective only if the community or the public can influence whether the process will continue at all in this location.
This can be ensured by maintaining the responsibilities of the Repository Authority to require a consent before the establishment of a specific procedure of the public concerned.
The proposed proposal of the real intention will almost completely reduce public involvement and make citizens practically statistical in permitting procedures.
The draft lacks system-wide compensation for the community for the entire search and selection of the location for the storage, its authorization and operation.
The representatives of the citizens in reality under today's legal standards do not have too much opportunities to defend their citizens' interests in searching for a place for repository.
Only in certain licence procedures, they may submit their comments or withdraw, but the Authority or the Minister shall decide to issue authorisations in the interest of which they are granted.
The case complaint has no immediate effect on the implementation of research or construction work.
The co-decision of self-determination requested by the Platform is commonly used in many democraticly evolved countries, and then definitely in those where they have already been promoting the repository, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is beyond another failure in the State administration which hires external legal offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SURAO and related to contracts with lawyer Jane Zemank.
The total amount for these work is to be 4 million crowns according to the contract registry.
Antonín Seknička, the mayor of the town of Cele from the town of Gradek and speaker Platform against the depth storage, said: After the ministers of industry, who compare the position of self-submissions against the public authorities in search of a high radioactive waste, they only moved to their successors, we are waiting for a more significant turnover from the new government.
We're offering helpful hand.
We also thank the Union of cities and municipalities, which considers the problem of insufficient municipal rights in such a crucial construction as the municipalities concerned directly in the selected locations.
The platform against the depth storage combines 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 communities) in order to make changes in the access of the State to load burned nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste which will not be restricted only to the depth storage.
The Platform further proposes that the decision to choose the location for any storage is conditioned by the previous consent of the public concerned.
The actress of John Goodman (69) forced to lose fear: He dropped 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything in his lifestyle for years, he was eventually frightened by doctors.
They told him if he didn't lose, he'd die.
And that worked out.
Goodman gradually dropped 90 pounds, which is half his original weight 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He praised his new character in Los Angeles at the animated series of the Freak Brothers.
From the sitcom Roseanne fat is a completely different person!
John loved to joke that his friends and family asked him to lose his weight, because his great body caused a blast of furniture.
"I pushed everything in my mouth," the actress said in 2018 in an interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I get to the age I can't afford to sit in place anymore, he said for ABC Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also matters what the boss and what you want to use the word "boss".
If it's about any text on a platform that expects a reader from the game environment, I wouldn't have translated it at all.
If it was necessary for a formal text, perhaps high school text, I'd think I'd be looking for the boss to describe or explain.
There's more than one kind of boss in all.
Like a game like Dark Souls, etc. has the bosss a few, that yes, and so there's a "boss" something like a gentleman/master of the level, and then there's a final boss...
In many games there are hiding boss (super boss, hidden boss), who are not even necessary to be defeated to the game or level be completed, but often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then you need Half-Life games, where the bosss are, but the player doesn't touch them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called at all?
Well, then they're mini bosses.
It's paushally unanimously somehow to translate the boss simply cannot, Czech and other languages do not solve it somehow (it's interesting just a catalogue that translates the boss as a final opponent).
It is simply for story or game generally significant, computer controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and guarding the completion of some level or task.
After Peter's missing from London, he's looking for the whole world.
The Czech police have also been involved.

Czech Republic, Peter Srnz, saw her colleagues last November 28th.

Pre-night Czech Republic terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While the data in October indicated a mild decline in attack campaigns, the attacks have significantly increased last month with the end of the year.
We recorded a great campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted on the Czech Republic.
The attack strategy remains the same for now.
The infected Annex in the e-mail shall draw attention to the user by a name which refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month there was a dangerous annex in the name of the word invoice, this time it was marked as a Copie of repair accounts for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eseta.
Spyware contains functions that scan internet browsers and other programs such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex e-mail clients.
The harmful code actively searches the recorded login data which subsequently sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in Czech Republic on August and September and with the coming holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the Spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not focus specifically on the Czech Republic, and security specialists have taken rather global campaigns in November.
In comparison with October's data, Formbook slightly weakened in November, but remains at least five of all detectives.
The attacks continued to take place throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
Formbook contained the most common annex with the .exe extension that had the name REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the account continues to appear.
The annex in Czech may then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
Significant decline and degradation of activity record security analyses in the Fareit programme, which cost 1.6 per cent of attacks and has had no bigger attack campaign in the Czech Republic in recent months.

I'm saying there's something new here, says Mokry Radek.
That the continuous dissatisfaction of several large groups or groups of the population led to finding a common speech.
Only the antivaxers, the anti-gunshowerers and the gender would not have been able to fill or pay this big trip.
The dog's action has a growing popularity, reminds me of a million moments for democracy of nausea.
Sometimes I feel like they rent the same stage and technology.
It's hard to say what kind of movement this dissatisfaction could be paid, it depends not only on the money's contribution, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer becomes a quarter and more dose vaccine.
It's definitely not going to be the left or central movement, bet.
The three-dose vaccine will become almost absolutely multidose, because it is obvious that we will have to let ourselves overlook every six months.
I'm very glad that the vaccines saved us.
The brilliant action of scientists is proud of humanity.
