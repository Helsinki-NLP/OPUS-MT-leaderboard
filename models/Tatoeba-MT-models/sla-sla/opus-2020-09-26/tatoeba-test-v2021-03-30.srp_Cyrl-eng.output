What's wrong with you?
What do you have to do?

I got off the train.
You promised to help me.
He was naked and boss.
I don't know why my head hurts.
Tom's crazy about Mary.

Oh, my God!
I'm fine.
Do you want to hear the truth about this event?
What's your nationality?
Be ready.
I'm kidding.
Excuse me, do you speak English?
Move quietly.
They were all young once.

In this stage of world history, in America, there is no such thing as an independent print. You know that, and I know that. There is no one among you who dares to write his sincere opinion, and if you wrote it, you would already know that it will never appear in the press. I have received my regular pay to keep my honest opinion outside the newspapers I'm working for. Many of you are also similarly paid for similar things, and any of you who would be so crazy to write what you honestly think, would find out outside, on the street, looking for some other jobs. That I'd let my right opinion appear only in one edition of the newspapers I work for, I'd get a fire from work in less than 24 hours....

What's this?
Turn around.
Just close your eyes.
Mary lost the key.
Take it easy!
I hate you from the bottom of my soul.
Tell him.
Do you want to learn something specific?
We'll have to walk now.
Girl Pizza and Mr. Casa were walking in the woods.
Anyway, you're wrong.
Redheads are driving me crazy!
Man has a lot of desires that he doesn't really want to realize, and it would be wrong to assume the opposite.He wants them to remain only desires; they have value only in his imagination; their accomplishment would be a bitter disappointment for him.It would be one desire and a desire for everlasting life. If it was fulfilled, a man would become completely sick of his infinite life, and would want death.
