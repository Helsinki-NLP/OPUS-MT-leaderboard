Elon Mask is forced to leave the head of the Tesla Board of Directors
The United States Price Papers and Bureau Commission and the founder of Tesla Ilon Mask resolved their debate on fraud.
The CNBC News reported this.
According to the television channel, in the framework of the Mask agreements, the head of the Board of Directors of Tesla will have to be abandoned.

However, in August, a group of shareholders of Tesla filed a collective complaint against Maska, complaining for financial losses.
The claimants argued that the businessman's posts had their losses.

The President of the United States, Donald Tramp, has considered a good joke about his success in the North Korean crisis.

The Chief of the White House recalled that the problem of North Korea had been adopted by the previous administration as the main complexity in external policy.
Tramp noted that Barack Obama's team had so much initiated relations with the UNDR that it could not even reach the country's leadership -- they weren't just pulling off the phone.
At that time, the United States and the UNDR were at the front of the war, and today the North Korean leader writes to the White House the " Beautiful Letters", said Tramp.
Tramp admitted that at the beginning of his work, Kim Chen Yin was too cruel, which, however, was mutual.
But now their relationship is so much that the leaders are in love with each other.
At that time, Tramp asked not to accept his words literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetent.
Tramp noted that Phenyan had recently ceased nuclear and missile tests, as well as closing military polygons.
All of these are the earnings of his administration, the American President.
Last Tuesday, Donald Tramp thirstyly responded to Kim Chen Yin from the UN Genassomb tribunal.

The use of Russian words by Ukraine calls “this language schizophrenia”, calling on the Ukrainians to quit the Russian letters even in writing their names.

The wrath of the writer could not even avoid the Security Service of Ukraine: when she came there and heard the interviews of the staff in Russian, she made a scandal and left by knocking the door.

"The uniqueness of the present 73th session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric that we have almost used in recent years with regard to Russia has now been more suppressed," said the senator in an interview published in the Russian newspaper on Sunday.
He explained that in the previous years, RF was "imposed as one of the three main threats to mankind, along with the Ebola fever, along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in a series, in any case, in the statement of a Western group that had been expressed sufficiently unanimously. "
At the 73th session, Kosacev emphasized that “theme of Russia was practically missing in the negative key”.
"If analyzing the speaking of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speaking of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, I am not taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, not exactly," said the politician, noting that Russia was "no longer a wall that was trained with a tennis ball."
The head of the Professional Committee of Suffeed does not exclude that this indicates a trend that he believed that " would allocate the present session [United Nations General], although the trend may be fully manifested in a year, in two, three."
"I do not exclude that the current session may in some way be a rotating session," Kosachev said, "as too many examples of how Russia has been able to move forward in international affairs with the connection."
As an example, he presented situations in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
" Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be required in time," the parliamentary added.
This is related to, he believes that there is “adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just a possible, inalienable participant in addressing global problems of modernity”.
"I don't want to be wrong, but I feel like we're going anywhere where the movement will not be moving again, it will be moving forward," he added.
Another “interesting and important sense” in this context, Kosachev called “the request for the Russian vision of the development of the modern world”.
"I attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [the Genassamble session of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sergei Lavrov, and I was very pleased to see that if a year or two or five years ago, the Russian vision of the world is largely uninterested, the situation is now different," said the Chairman of the Soféda Committee.
He believes that this is due to the “in the so-called new liberal order that is characterized with the West, there are no answers to the issues of dealing with world problems due to the obvious deficit of ideas in the global space, the deficit of ideas about how to address the problems of the Middle East, terrorism, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, migration issues”.
"And here the request for the Russian vision becomes more and more obvious," Kosachev expressed his confidence, emphasizing that in that regard, "the current session of the Russian delegation's success for Russia".

ADG has become the second popularity in Germany
The Anti-Immigrant "Alternate for Germany" beats a regular record of popularity, and the ratings of Angels Merkel fall.
The inhabitants of Germany seemed to have been seriously tired of immigration policies, Angela Merkel, which made the country aimed at millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The latest socio-quests that the Anti-Immigrant Party ' s Alternate for Germany are increasingly popular and the positions of the Merkel and Zeehofer bloc are weakening.
This week, the ADG beats a regular record by rising on the second line in the rating of people's sympathy.
The right conservators with the 17th per cent popularity have been able to cross the social democrats with about 16 per cent.
A break into one percentage could be reported to statistical error, but there is no indication of the fact that the ADG from a small group of euroskeptic economists had been able to become a serious political force in 2013.
The leadership of the general detention remains maintaining the HSS/HDC governing bloc, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there is a tendency to lose the points -- in April, the support of the Angela Merkel block was four per cent higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, which is headed by the Government of Germany, is also declined.
Today, 48 per cent of the Germans are supported by the angels of Merkel, 7 per cent lower than last year.
Let's add that "green" (15 per cent), left (11 per cent) and Liberals (10 per cent).
Alternative evolution
The Party Alternate for Germany was established in September 2012 on the basis of the “Alternative Election 2013” Group, which entered the Christian Democratic Union.
The Panel was initially opposed to the government course, but at first, it was only economic issues, including the euro and the EU interaction issues.
The group, however, opposed the “sponsorship” by Germany of the weak EU economy, had not excluded the possibility of returning to the German Mark and the full exit of the country from the European Union.
The Immigration Crisis ' s political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group was formed into a full-scale party, which took the lowest European skeptics and began to criticize the Government for the failure of immigration policy.
At the latest parliamentary elections in 2017, ADG was able to first strike into Bundestag, receiving 94 deputy chairs (from 709).
Two representatives of "Alternate for Germany " will be placed in Europe.

They decided to contact the CIC with a request for a single initiative group and to ask the Russians to ask: "You have not increased the pensionary legislation established as at 1 July 2018, for which the Russian citizens have reached the right to appoint an age pension?"
This formulation was registered by a vulgate subgroup whose representatives were not participating in the congregation, but it was considered the simplest and legal economy.
Most participants of the Assembly were composed of members of the member of the Just Russia, Illia Sviridova (six subgroups) and the CFP (four subgroups).
Three independent subgroups, from the Neighbourhood, Voronez and Orenburg, joined them.
Swiridov had previously said to the Knowledges that the invitations were sent to all initiators, and the consent was expressed by representatives of about 40 subgroups.
For example, Marina Semenová, head of the subgroup of vulgarity (which was supported by another 15 subgroups), said to the Knowledges that the invitations had not been received and planned not to come, "We did not understand who was the enemy and who was the enemy."

In the Loko game, Turbin's Achmath mistakes were screwed up like a horn of abundance.
Former Judge of the Alliance Category, Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of the Eugene Turbina arbitrary at the 9th tour of the Russian Championship "Locomotiv" -- "Ahmat" and explained the disputed episodes of the games.
- How do you appreciate the Eugenia Turbina's collaboration at the Locomotiv match, "Ahmat"?
- I believe that the arbitral confirmed his inconvenience to the Russian Prime League match.
I am surprised that efforts at the fifth round of Spartacus -- "Dinamo", neither Turbin nor the DSI leaders made serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result was not delayed in the ninth tour: errors in his actions, private shortcomings of gross receptions have risen as a rogue of abundance.
For example, at the 50th minute of the Ader railway, the Ahma Rodolfo Protector is falling through his hands in his fine area.
It's eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't put the tools.
- How do you appreciate the episode with the part of Idova, who was on the 82th minute when the ball seemed to be in his hand?
- I think there was an intentional game with a protector's hand in his fine area.
Turbin was close to the moment, well seeing this episode and his first assistant on the right.
This was also to be seen by the reserve judge of Sergei Karasev.
However, all three were asleep, and no tools were appointed.
Therefore, the match was distorted, and sports justice was distorted.
It was the same time when the concept trial had exhausted and buried the sports spirit of the game.
- At the 52th minute, Turbin did not decide to remove the guest defender Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight against Krichovjak, and when the judge showed him the yellow card, demonstratively applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you have to show the second "garlic"?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card showed a little bit of a case.
The second would be irrelevant.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double collaboration standards that some teams were putting tools for such violations as the episode with Ida, and some of them did not.
What do you appreciate the words of the football player?
- Look at the double standards.
There were tools.
They didn't.
So the arbitral doesn't give a second tool into the opposite gate.
This is the principle that is used.
And the second moment of double standards that the judge is watching who plays.
This was the "Locomotive" played on Saturday and "Ahma" had serious claims for Turbin's work because the team was damaged.

The United States have considered the sea blockade of Russia because of the supply of oil and gas
In the United States, the sea blockade of Russia can be launched to benefit from the world energy market.
The American authorities have so strongly fought for the success of the world carbon market that they are ready to reach the sea blockade of Russia, which remains one of the major world energy supplyers.
The possibility of the sea blockade before it was told by the head of the U.S.M.D. Ryan Zinke.
In contrast to world practice, the American Ministry of Interior is not police, but civilian functions, including the policy of natural resources.
The statement of Zinka therefore was made fully in the competence of the head of the agency, although political decoration was not deprived.
Speaking in the industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke stated that the US marine forces have controlled marine roads in the Middle East region and could block them if necessary.
The words of Zinke indicated that the need for Washington could be linked to the desire to prevent Russian supplies from the world's energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continues to receive the lions of its income from the world market of oil and gas.
The desire to distribute energy supplys in the Middle East, as well as in Eastern Europe, was the main motive for Moscow's reinforcement in this region, as assured by Zinka.
The Minister understood that the United States continues to rely on leadership in the world's energy market as the largest supplyer of oil and gas.
To this end, Washington will have to restrain Russia and Iran, and the sea trading blockade - an acceptable measure on that road, Zinke believes.

Observers are disturbed by the choice of Agutin at the " Voice" show
The watchers of the "Glas 60+" accuse Leonid Agutin's teacher of "whispering and narrow-through."
When he learned his father’s voice from the first note in blind hearings, many hoped that he would maintain neutrality and not return to the executor.
But his son’s feelings were overwhelmed, and he chose a relative to his team.
Many then considered it a joke, but forgived the teacher's unacceptability at the first stage.
But the joke was delayed, and the father of the star was completely unreasonable to take the place of more decent executives.
And now the viewers are not willing to forgive Agutina for such injustice.
Yesterday, we, watchers of the show, were embarrassed by an unlikely and frank dragging our relatives into the final stairs.
I had even doubted that Agutin had enough strength and conscience to not bring to the end of his father's first place," thought Irina Petrovska and Xenia Larina in the "Man from TV".
Meanwhile, for his father, Leonid Agutin "slied" beautiful performers who really sang, while Nicolai Petrovic whispered in a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audiences still want to see his father's show.
But it turns out that this is not true, the viewers want an objective assessment and see in the final of really talented performers, and now Agutin discredited the show.
"Sympathetic to the voting participants of the Agutin team, they were condemned."
"Last time Agutin showed his love for Dad, and today he had to show himself a professional."
"The contest has lost its sense."
"Removing two talented people from the project and leaving a father who does not sing but whisper, how can we call the teacher after that?"
"It's like the singing of the dad, make him a concert in Kremle for your money and see how many people will come to this concert."
It's a voice show, not a cruel family show.
"Agutin's side was unprofessional."
"Then, at your own show, you have to invite my dad to play, not the show that is made for the money of 1 Channel."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why the no-vous dad should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why was the worker from Surgut a great voice and the tempre, and the father of Agutin brought to the final?
And then we all complain that we've been on the scene and from the screens for decades!
That is because you don't get through the clutch!"
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
A circle of mud and bowling.
And the money for the family budget will not be too much!
The theatre of absurds continues!"
The users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional " Voice" at the blind audience, the city's son came out.
Then there was no way to take a son into his own team.
Besides, he said, "Come on, get out of here, all right."
Agutin couldn't do as a professional.

Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things, it's an insane nonsense.
I totally disagree with what Carrera is doing.
It only deepens the disorders in the team.
First of all, these are verses, reading and perceiving.
I wouldn't have responded to that if I were Carrera.
Everyone has an opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to be buried.

I think the Italian is lacking the flexibility of perception of the situation.
And that doesn't serve a normal climate in the team.
Today Spartacus has no games, so it wasn't necessary to blow up.

Pressure and struggle - how correct?
There's no word for a long time.
That's right.
The word “shuffle” in the meaning of“ weight, influence, influence” exists only fonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word “dulge”.
We use this word, assuming it comes from the word "pressure".
But the pressure and the "dulge" are not only close, but even in some ways the opposite.
Make sure you do it yourself.
To accommodate (the book book, aged) means "pleasant, full enough, to be sufficient for anyone or anything, to satisfy."
Enjoying, pleasure is related words.
He used to have the meaning of "without any dependence on anything, having a self-consuming meaning" -- "to do it to himself."
The old-Slovak "dowl'ti" is relative to the words "command" and "will".
Pressure, suppression is completely different.
These words really scary "born," daos - "wolf", deyja - "death" and "twoidøe"
Similarly the Phonetic form of “pressure” and “dull” as well as the infinite ageing of the last, forced them to become contaminated.
Thus, we have the same "d" influenza, which are also used in the letter by "a", which is, in good and impossible for the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
So the right thing is to hit it.
But this word is an older word, in its right meaning is no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/humans have a negative impact on you above, use the word "cuff".
You can also use the pressure structure, but remember that it's a office.

Mitropolit Ilarion compared the decision of Kiev to rename UPC with fascist actions
The head of the Division of Foreign Churches of the Russian Orthodox Church compared the rename of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarch to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against Jews.
"It's like that in Fascist Germany, to plant a yellow end star, which means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and for that purpose the draft law was created," said the mitropolite in the eter of the "Russia-24" television (Interfax quota).
He believed that the step would have the most serious consequences right now when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was in a sharp stage.
Kiev is therefore hoping to receive full control of the OPC and to " put it outside the law," the priest believes.
"This is the Ukrainian Church, and those who believe in this church consider themselves Ukraines, they are the patriots of their country," he added.
It has previously been known that the Deputies of the Supreme Council have worked on the implementation of Acts No.4128 (on the change of the subjection of religious communities), No 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No.5309 (on the change of the name of religious organizations).

The Deputy of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodox and Ukrainian holidays
The Deputy of the Holy-Uspenian Pocayevski laura, Mitropolith Vladimir, called for the protection of the Orthodox Faith and the Ukrainian holidays.
The text of his appeal to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (OPC) was published on Saturday on the site of the Citizen.
In different times of the history of our predecessors and family in faith and spirit, Christians had to confess to their faith and protect their holinesses.
Given the situation that has arrived, and on the information we have, and on the threats of the debate that are spreading, we can see that we have to experience something," said mitropolite.
He asked for support - prayer, moral.
Also, the laura deputy emphasized that it is likely to "need your physical presence."
The servant added: "The grandchildren of Lenin is by spirit, threatened by debate, and therefore we will protect our holiness."
For anyone who cares about the Destiny of the Pocayev Laura, the Orthodox Orthodox and the world's sanctuary, we must be prepared to protect it, says the treatment.
Mitropolith called not to go to those who perpetrate those who believe in deception.
UCC has a Canonical status defined by Thomas of 29 October 1990 by the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to introduce a new patriarch and another Catholic Pope of Roman Barfolomé.
The new style with its consequences is inappropriate.
And we are satisfied with the status of our church," the deputy laura noted.
He recalled that OHC since October 1990 was canonically independent and entirely self-suitable in its administration.
There is no administrative accountability of the Moscow Patriarchy.
In fact, Thomas already has our church.
What else do we need?" said Mitropolith Pochaevski Vladimir, calling upon the believers and all citizens to ask whether other religions of Thomas are independent of the Vatican?
Those who believe somehow have come to understand and have determined the temple to which they go.
However, someone wants to reassure enemy and disagreement.
Some are envy that the dome shines in the temples that they want to destroy," the priest emphasized.
The Pochaev laura is the largest temple complex and a monastery in Western Ukraine.
The laura is located at the top of the Pochaev Mountain, 70 miles from Ternopol.
The first historical information on it refers to the beginning of the XIII century.

The troubles of Afghanistan began not yesterday.
Following the attacks on 11 September 2001, the U.S. main enemy was announced by the Al-Qaida terrorist group (forbidden in RF) in Afghanistan.
Not in the past month, America and NATO allies launched a military operation there “Indestructive Freedom”.
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of American contingents and now on the Afghan land.
And peaceful life is even more ghost than in the past.
American troops are chased for the fence of tens of their bases.
As they can, they buy from the warriors for money, just don't touch them.
The Government of Afghanistan controls the smaller part of the country, 40 per cent, according to Paruseva.
50% - in the Taliban movement (forbidden in RF).
10 per cent more for IHIL terrorists (forbidden in RF).
But they're growing there fast.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudochaliphate in Central Asia is exactly what they did not have in Iraq and Syria.
America, it's all right.
As well as the fact that during 17 years of American drug production (opians) in Afghanistan, at least 40 times increased.
Colossal growth in the areas seeded by opium mac and multi-billion profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote at a referendum on EU and NATO entry, provided the country's name is changed.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize the right to be called Macedonia for its northern neighbour, taking into account the attempt of a single-named Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovski, politolog: " Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia receives the right to a better future, the hope of public change.
And Greece will reinforce the right to its past.
There are no ideal agreements.
They are arising from difficult compromises that cannot make them absolutely happy for all."
The country's rename is headed by ruling social democrats with Prime Minister Zoran Zaevov.
The conservative opposition was opposed to the President of the country, Georgie Ivanov.
According to Cvetina Chilimanova, Macedonia has no point to entering the EU -- it is sufficient to have partnerships with it: “Mnogy of those who do not like the agreement, believe that the current socialist Government headed with Zaevov is from outside to change the country's name.
But this decision will result in negative consequences.
First of all, I will lose my sovereignty.
Clearly, there are countries that would not like Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans."
Fei Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia stands before the greatest challenge in its history.
The country was a dispute.
The choice that Macedonian citizens will make will define the future not only for the Balkans but also for Europe as a whole."
