I can't explain that to you.
He's afraid of dogs.
There were girls full of girls at the party.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
How did you make an impression on Tom?
Why does he hate me?
Stop irritating him.
He knows her since high school.
Tom pretended that nothing happened.
I promised myself I'd quit smoking.
Stay here with them.
The accident almost cost him a lifetime.
He unloaded the bottle.
We're already home.
You haven't returned those books yet?
I met him at the club.
I disagreed.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
I hope you won't understand me pervertously.
Why are you so mysterious?
You're just running away from life problems.
Outside of snow.
When did you see her?
I've been waiting for you for three hours.
I failed the examination.
Eat as long as it's hot.
So we had to wait three hours.
What are you suggesting?
Tom thinks Maria's idiot.
I told Tom to wait for me.
I couldn't answer all the questions.
I didn't know you'd come.
Last week, I ran into Boston on Tom.
Tom's beauty.
Tom didn't know Mary likes cooking.
I told Toma that you were busy.
Tom was surprised to see Mary in Boston.
Do you want the anecdote?
I wanted to do more.
Tom is our best pilot.
Are you sure you know what Tom needs to do?
I can't just ignore him.
She's going to school on a bike.
I'll pay you right now!
Do you want to drive?
I've been working all day yesterday.
They're classrooms.
The coin was stuck under the table.
It's empty.
Wash the window.
Don't think I didn't try.
You stay here.
Tom risked his life to save Mary.
The caravan of the fiftieth camels was impatient in the desert.
You should be ashamed of your own ignorance.
I changed with Tom's places.
Tom went to the park one.
You're a teacher, aren't you?
I'm not trying to convince you.
I knew Tom wouldn't lose.
Tom said Mary wanted to drink.
What are you smiling about?
Tom didn't tell him how he was going to get there.
Didn't I tell you I'm allergic to the nuts?
I know how old you are.
I won't show it to anyone else.
Tom won't sell his house.
I didn't want to upset Tom.
I'll teach you.
I have food.
He moved to her.
I wouldn't do that.
Tom tried to strangle Mary.
I decided to try again.
Tom won't let you win any more.
The cosmonauts wear suits.
Algeria is buying arms of artillery in Russia.
Can I tell Toma what happened?
I don't have anything to give you.
Why should Tom apologize?
The results were shocking.
It's empty in this room.
Tom sent Mary a telegram.
Can you believe that?
We were staying under the open sky.
Don't lock the door.
When are you free?
Wasn't Tom supposed to do that on October 20th?
I have to go to work right now.
Who's this woman?
I want to talk to you about this report.
When does it start?
Smelling is one of the five feelings.
What have you got?
They're afraid of him.
Tom's at work.
Tom's hiding something from us.
He didn't even touch him.
Have you come up with a name for the newborn?
I want you to help me with my homework.
I'm not a specialist.
I got cold from him.
I like Brazil, but I still go to Ukraine.
I made you breakfast.
I didn't think you'd let me do this.
I see Tom almost every day after school.
He'll fix the grave.
Soup is so hot that it can't be eaten.
Why is she so popular?
They declared their innocence.
Where'd you get so hurt?
I don't think they're friends.
I made a deal with Tom.
I thought Tom and Mary were friends.
I was expecting good news from them.
The distilled water is flavorless.
Father's in the garden now.
Harry's working a full-time job at the local supermarket.
It's very unlikely I'm gonna be late.
I told them to be in the hats.
Tom said he was completely exhausted.
I've dreamed of being a millionaire once.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Tom is planning to break up with his girlfriend.
Where are you going tonight?
Tom closed the door to his bedroom.
I only knew Tom for a few months.
You're hopeless!
Tom's playing a very good violin.
No one blames you.
The next year is the year of the Rabbit.
Tom almost always takes a bath before dinner.
I can take you home.
What have you learned?
Please write what I say.
Now I'm adding the last strikes.
I can't forget Tom.
I don't have books.
Tennis is the only type of sport that Tom has well owned.
Come to the bowl.
Let me help you.
I was very tired, so I fell asleep.
Tom's my favorite singer.
Remember I love you.
He's a murderer, as they say.
Mary didn't want to wear an open Halloween suit, so she decided to dress like a woman of Amish.
Tom picked up his hat.
Tom was waiting for three hours.
Mary said she didn't want to drink.
You knew Tom better than I did.
Perhaps people like us should not have children.
I won't do that again, I promise.
Every morning I go for shopping.
The baby's pushing.
Tom refused to sign the document.
Tom didn't even delay.
I don't want Tom to go anywhere without me.
I've been watching how you work.
He has excellent ability to mathematics.
Careful, the bullet's on the road.
He's a parent's father.
Men were men then.
Swiss banks are very secret.
As soon as you finish your mission, you can drink as much as you can.
I'm the only one who can help you.
I hate winter.
What do you think Tom will say when he finds out?
Christmas is coming.
You want us to do this together?
All our attempts were empty.
He bought another glass.
All attention, now I'm going to the patient's audience, and make sure you've traced the correctness of the procedure, you're going to have to contact her use tomorrow.
Please, salt.
She spent all her money.
Tom was sleeping in the barn.
You're gonna ruin your eyes.
Tom was high for his age.
Have you noticed Mary's cupcakes?
You're gonna be late for school again.
What's your favorite movie?
So I didn't have to ask me twice.
You need to go to Boston.
I jumped out of joy.
She's rich, young and beautiful.
Do you love your country?
I don't see you and Tom.
I'm pretty high.
From a practical point of view, there are many deficiencies.
This is the house I live in.
I'm going to school with him.
Your face shows you're disagreeing.
Tom didn't kill Mary.
I don't know what I mean.
I went to Harvard.
You're like a broken plate.
I can't let him go alone.
Tom broke the window.
Jesus, allowing the rage to enter the flock of pigs, demonstrated the unchangedness of God’s Law on unclean animals.
I'm the captain.
I think we'll be fine.
We had to come.
I was wrong about it.
It's my birthday.
We need to tell people what they need to do.
If she's not dear, I'll buy it.
I told Toma what to do.
She almost drowned.
It was a good movie.
Are you wet?
I'll never let you forget it.
Tom told me not to talk to you.
Who were you going to sell it to?
I don't want a divorce.
I grew up in Australia.
Tom gave the freedom of anger.
The missing boy was identified by his clothes.
I've got good reflexes.
Tell me what it looked like.
She will probably refuse to follow his advice because she doesn't like it.
Did you write?
I know you're working for them.
I hope I can help you.
Do your parents know about that?
The waitress put a white scatter on her table.
That day I stayed home because it was raining.
There's a pharmaceutical in here?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why does Tom look at me like that?
I called the police and told me my car was stolen.
We can discuss this later.
That's a little helping.
Cats in ancient Egypt were sacred animals.
Can I speak honestly?
I work for oil company.
Why don't you find someone else who needs your help?
Tom put a wet towel on Mary's head.
He hurt his left hand.
Is she Italian?
We want to leave.
The population of this city is reduced every year.
Dan didn't want to be ashamed.
Can you tell me anything about yourself?
Did you find a difference between these two photos?
I've never seen so many books collected in one place.
You look a little depressed.
Don't forget to call me.
The cats have a squirrel language.
I would never do that.
Correct it, please.
We need to put the ice package to the ice to reduce the edge.
I could show you the city.
I know Tom's sick.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Take another cookie.
I want to sleep!
You must be an idiot.
Tom in the park.
I didn't think you were here tonight.
"Who are you nationality?" "Argentians."
Why are you sad?
I can do it much better than you do.
Don't forget!
I really think so.
Zontique's broken.
Tom made his room straight.
Did you file a complaint?
I don't like Tom very much.
So we'll have to change our plans.
Someone bit him.
Anything else you want to know?
Tom said he wanted to see us before he left.
But I don't have any money.
How's Mary's new dress?
There was a fear on his face.
If you don't tell her, I'll tell her.
Can you trust a secret?
My mother died in an accident.
London is England's capital.
Her mother was a singer.
Should we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
It's your fault.
Tom told everyone he was adopted.
Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.
It's just money.
Take her somewhere.
I was right there when it happened.
Her origin is unknown.
Smell that.
Tom wakes up from a deep sleep.
You're big.
Where did you see him?
I don't know why you want me to do this.
I hope I'll see him on Monday.
Are you sure you want to sell your father's guitar?
There's no girls on the Internet.
They'll find you.
I'm trying to figure out why this happened.
We'll send them a card.
If you don't want to answer, you don't have to.
Look left and right, before the road is crossed.
Tom was also my friend.
I didn't know her then.
We have heard these promises before.
What did you and Tom do after dinner?
I'm very unsatisfied.
As often happens, this afternoon, Mike was late for a meeting.
Tom told me Mary had a new boyfriend.
We won't let that happen.
These fools have violated the law that prohibits violation of the law.
It's not done yet.
John spoke so loud that I heard him on the second floor.
Tom checked his vision.
I didn't give it to Tom.
There's strange rumors.
I know you're rich.
Bill put $100 on a trip.
He served in the fleet.
Who taught you how to dance?
Tom screwed his nose.
I wouldn't be surprised.
I'm not lying.
You knew them better than I did.
None of us want that to happen.
How much more wine to buy?
I'm not going to screw up.
He got in the car and left.
Tell Tom about everything that happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared his soup with me.
All models are wrong, but some are useful.
I don't have time to do a homework.
It's a big step forward.
Pray for me, Tom.
We still don't know the side effects of this medicinal product.
Tom's got teeth for three days.
You seem to know everyone here.
Hope dies the last one.
It's the girl who came here yesterday.
I'll give you a new one.
You thought you said it was yours.
Where did he buy these shoes?
Don't make me do that.
What were you smiling about?
Tom usually goes to work on a bus.
Fadel went to school.
I've worked with Tom before.
Tom and I are team partners.
Leave him alone!
My heart beats more often every time I see her.
I think I'm the only one?
Everyone but Tom has hats.
She gives him everything he asks.
Is this selling?
I'm getting worse.
Do you have that bigger?
It's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
This only makes the problem worse.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of a washing bath in the toilet.
I called the door.
Tell him I'm sick.
They're already gone.
Can I take your car for a while?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jesse standing there.
They're very close.
You're wet.
There's some sugar in the bag.
I did that when I was a child.
Something really good happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't move anywhere else.
Who's in the blue shirt?
Tom has an American accent.
I don't have money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?
The carrot is useful.
I want you to tell me everything.
She looks good for her age.
If I knew her address, I would have written her a letter.
She kept herself for marriage.
We need to talk to them.
I'd like to talk to you.
Tom was shaving.
It's half-third.
Lev strong.
I had to make sure he was coming here.
She said she didn't know the rules.
Education is one of the most important aspects of life.
The boy fixed his hat.
Why don't we take a walk?
He's capable of mathematics.
I'm glad you told me about her.
He's afraid of cats.
I heard you played a banjo.
Did you read them?
I told Toma that I wouldn't help him.
Tom regrets he left Boston.
I don't like this store.
Tom speaks french awfully.
I don't remember how much I paid for it.
You don't eat with us?
Tom lives in Australia with his wife and three children.
I was barely able to get on the train.
I don't like arguing.
Do you like science and fantastic movies?
I'll make her happy.
Just tell him I called.
I don't want to go upstairs.
His house behind the hill.
It was Sunday, and I didn't get up early.
How many lunches!
Mary, are you right now?
I fixed the mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom made 20 repressions.
I'm sure you can handle the job.
After Mary gave Tome a slap, she dropped a glass of wine through him and made a firm step out of the restaurant, a dead silence was reigned.
You're two years younger than Tom.
We recognized them.
Tom will paint the fence tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary alone.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you'll need a loan.
Tom's father in prison never writes Tom.
It's expensive.
I haven't received any news from him for hundreds of years.
I didn't know Tom couldn't swim.
I thought we all had a long time to meet.
Everyone's interested in Japan.
Tom's going mad very easily.
Please, just do everything like me.
Stay there.
I don't agree with him.
That's what it's called luck.
It was so dark in the room that I had to climb.
How many aircraft in the U.S. army?
Is she your teacher?
Sing again, Tom.
What are you hiding from me?
Tom knows he doesn't need him anymore.
Tom was in the garden.
Young plants are placed in the winter garlic.
I own French.
If that sounds too good to be true, it's probably not true.
Leave it where you found it.
Tom was supposed to tell Mary.
Why are everyone looking at me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I told you it would work.
It all seems so weird.
Tom decided to go.
You taught me a lot.
What time are you waking up?
Bring the trash out.
Tom apologized to the listeners.
Tell Mary I got her keys.
Did you buy the candles?
Canada is a hockey family on ice.
The brain is a very complicated body.
They'd agree.
Your Japanese's good.
The thief broke through the window.
Spiders are disgusting little creatures.
I want to know where it is.
Kiss without muss, like soup without salt.
You tried to talk to him?
Where are the other prisoners?
So many things happened today.
I saw the car beat a man.
We accepted their invitation.
Tom was working with Mary.
I'm tired to death.
You know what your kids are doing right now?
Do you want her to stay?
He's missing her.
Please tell me I'm right.
We saw the castle in front of us.
Tom kept squeezing her.
Six goes in front of the family.
I went to my grandfather's grave today.
Tom couldn't believe someone wanted to kill him.
Tom didn't dance with Mary.
I saw a man eating from the trash tank yesterday.
I think Tom lied to me.
She took me under her wing.
Tom and Mary stopped laughing when they noticed that John was crying.
I need to meet Tom.
Tom lost his finger.
Did you sign the contract?
I told Toma he should talk to a lawyer.
Did they get into the wrong bus again?
Let Tom go home.
I'm not hungry either.
He has a lot of girlfriends.
This area has changed completely.
Tom's an antisemit.
What is your strongest side?
Tom doesn't like to be pushed.
Interestingly, when Angelica Agurbash sang a song to Neclayev's words, could she imagine that he would be speaking for presidents?
There's a yogurt in the fridge.
Can you tell us what's going on?
Tom's always being honest.
Foma's got to be there by two thirty.
Show me Boston on the map.
Tom said he was very exhausted.
Tom wasn't in his room?
Why aren't you looking for him?
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
I wouldn't want anything better.
Tom wants a popcorn.
My favorite restaurant burns.
John's ignorant, he's making a lot of mistakes.
Tom took an interview with Mary.
Tom is my personal assistant.
Who's this guy?
Keep your children away from the barrel.
Let's talk about it tonight.
I have to fix this.
They don't know French.
Calm down!
I knew what Jacksons were doing.
You shouldn't apologize to me.
Tom and Mary have one grandson and three grandchildren.
He wants nut oil.
You're lucky.
Tom's getting a little drunk.
I barely understood him.
He escaped the bait.
You can live in a big house and not feel comfortable anyway.
I'm expecting Tom to tell me what to do.
I'll see him tonight.
One plus one is two.
Red better.
The universe is infinite.
I'm not ready to do this yet.
Thank you for your visit.
What did you mean?
I wanted to spend more time with you.
Can you tell me about Tom?
Can I have Tom a few words?
Don't sound like that.
When was Tom arrested?
We're eating at six.
Elein became a lion victim.
Tom didn't want to go.
Tom's a little younger than your daughter.
I did everything I could to save Tom.
Try to convince her to help us.
Are you with us?
Get a wish.
Tom's alive.
Breven may be in the water for ten years, but it will not become a crocodile.
Tom pretended he didn't understand what Mary was trying to tell him.
I saw it happen.
I think there can be no other reason than this.
I'm very happy right now.
My apartment was robbed last week.
How can you always be so energy?
Put your signature here.
What an ego!
So you bought it?
A man as many years as he feels, and the woman is how much she looks.
Wiseness comes with age.
Do you remember what you told me?
There was a lot of snow last year.
He tried to swim the river.
Looks like everyone's happy.
Tom told Mary to tell the truth.
You don't want another daughter?
I like walking along the river.
You can come with me.
This vocabulary is a big gift for us.
"How long before dinner?" — "Five minutes."
Tell her.
Mary spent all her time at work.
Tom sat on his bike and picked him up.
Have you ever been to Scandinavia?
Can I open my eyes now?
I don't want to play cards.
I want to keep working here.
I live in Latvia.
I've been waiting for him until ten.
Tom usually says the first thing that comes to his mind.
Why do you want to leave?
How French will be "bye"?
It didn't cost so much.
What's with your computer?
We were both busy.
I'm fine.
We're not going to fire you.
Do you really think Tom can swim?
How are you going to spend so much money?
Mary likes to hang out with bad guys.
It is often said that a week in the world disappears in one language.
She has a little advantage.
I thought we'd talked about it before.
My parents would have been so upset if I had failed.
I feed the cat every day in the morning and the evening.
Hold your tongue, you'll get it wrong.
You must take into account all the consequences before making any changes in the existing code.
I can't bite, I don't have teeth.
I think you've done great.
Last night we had a strong rain.
What did Tom bring?
That's exactly what I was looking for.
Tom noticed that the door was open.
That's when I hurt my shaving.
There's nothing more to tell me about him.
What other choice did I have?
You should stay upstairs.
Go home early, Bill.
She sat on the chair and read the magazine.
From now on, we are not allowed to cry.
If I knew that, I'd tell you.
This is where he lived.
I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to a monkey.
Eat my chocolate? Don't even think!!
Beautiful in white, the house seems more.
I've had difficulty finding the original quote.
I had no idea you knew her.
What is the point of doing that?
What dog is yours?
You should give Tom more time.
You didn't tell me what Tom speaks French.
Tom's coming back to Boston next week.
Why aren't you helping me?
I watched a French movie with English subtitles.
I'll have lunch.
I think Tom played good.
He only blames others, he never blames himself.
You know how to play gangjo?
Tom came to Mary and hugged her.
"When will you come back?" "All depends on weather."
How many turtles live?
How safe is that?
Your message has been received.
To complete my house, I took three years.
I was irritated.
Don't talk to your mother like that.
We'll see if we can do it.
Tom didn't want us to attend his party.
I suddenly realized what's going on.
She said she'd be late.
Your parents still live in Germany?
I need it today.
Tom's probably gonna win.
What would you like Santa Claus to bring to you?
Why doesn't Tom want to see me?
Where's your spirit of adventure?
Why were you mad at me?
You can leave if you want.
I see you've met before.
Something tells me you're right.
It's not my cat.
The captain ordered his people to shoot.
Sit there.
He hasn't done it yet.
Tom became a father.
Tom's engaged with my daughter.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
It's hard to be a woman, you have to think like a man, act like a lady, look like a girl and work like a horse.
Let me talk to her first.
I tried to convince her, but I failed.
I thought you were a Canadian.
Why are you sitting on my chair?
Sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy it.
I've never seen you in my hat.
Put him on the police.
I thought you found someone else.
There is always a huge number of vehicles on this road.
You lied to us all.
I don't think Tom has brothers or sisters.
He must love you.
It's useless to pretend that you're making me believe that I believe in something you don't believe!
I think that would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I was pardoned.
I appreciate your support.
You think that's possible?
He's sick in the end of everything.
You think Tom's locked up?
If it's true, she's better than me.
I'll take good care of Tom.
Tom doesn't seem to know you.
I refuse to help Toma.
Can I sit with her?
Keep it.
Do you read anything other than the Bible?
Read the testimony of the cattle counter.
What does this gentleman make for life?
Why do you think Tom likes it?
Do your parents know about that?
Are they talking about you?
Tom's waiting for you in the conference room.
The main thing in Tattabe is not to say thoughts above the stomach and below the knees.
He paid him four dollars.
Because of the strike, I had to cancel my trip.
I don't know your name.
What time is the train coming to Boston?
What are the words to this song?
Mary likes to irritate her brother.
The law is on my side.
So we had to find out where to live.
Tom was with Mary all morning.
The publication of the article was based on the Professor's birthday.
You've had a phone call several times while you were in the shower.
She married him for money.
Not any bird can sing.
I bought him a magazine.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Tom doesn't respect them.
It's just superstition.
Tom must make his own decisions.
The account, please.
Your shoes should always be clean.
You're having a birthday soon.
Count it.
I don't like those shoes.
Tom was married to Mary for a long time.
It's just the picture I was jumping on the Internet.
I think that's why it's less than 30.
Did you drink?
It is certainly best for all of us to do this.
You're making it easier for me.
Tom said he saw Mary do it.
Tom can't just leave.
I'm loved.
You don't seem to be very busy.
Dedline's gone.
You're a lot like me.
Do you know the men out there?
Tom left the room without telling anyone a word.
This probably didn't happen.
Have you finished lunch yet?
Tom and Mary were talking for no less than an hour.
I want you to stay with us.
He tried to save her.
If you press this button, the door will be opened.
How many ties do you need?
I'm back to help you.
Tell me more about them.
Did you hear the last rumors?
I'd show you how it's done.
I begged Tom to come.
You've got a pinch.
My mom taught me not to waste money.
We could walk a walk.
She died yesterday afternoon.
I can't raise our daughter alone.
He took a seat for me.
I wanted to talk about it.
I screamed for help.
Can you explain your answer?
I know that's important to you.
They all knew her.
We'd better stop.
I'm not late anymore.
I'm so hungry.
I live pretty close to you.
Tom's taking care of the horses.
Why doesn't Tom agree with you?
I have to go back to Australia.
People usually die if they're killed.
They disconnected Tom from the life supplies.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
I'm sorry for my French.
What did I do right now?
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They won't fire me.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We always tell each other everything.
I'm never satisfied.
Tom doubles you.
Tom closed the bowl.
I'm married to a lawyer.
Another interesting source of energy is the heat that can be obtained from radioactive waste.
He's smarter than me.
Why did you say Tom first?
Your grandmother is a charming lady.
He wouldn't dare do that.
The twelve-hour trip exhausted me.
The baby woke up in the middle of the night.
I said I'm tired.
Who's the boss of this company?
Nobody saw us do it.
He came back two days later.
Tom had breakfast.
We should be home soon.
When did you move to Boston?
I know Tom and Mary are engaged.
Eat!
You helped Tom wash the windows?
It's out of my competence.
It was yesterday.
I'm starting to love myself.
What does your son want to be when he grows up?
I'm out of here.
Don't tell the One what really happened.
I'm not just gonna give you this.
What do you say then?
Did you talk about your hobby?
Get down here.
Why can't I see her?
I showed these cards to my friends.
Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.
I dropped the ball.
I'm a singer.
Tom apologized to us.
He read this book yesterday.
Where did Tom find this photograph?
Tom gave me both the money and the advice.
What do you want to hear from me?
Please open the door.
Tom said he didn't want to sleep yet.
She married him when she was 20 years old.
I can't give this dictionary to anyone.
Give me that box.
They say his father died in a foreign country.
Take mine.
I know Tom's above Mary.
I didn't have time to do this today.
Mary told Toma that he could help him.
Multiple number of 'person' is 'people', not 'persons'.
It's two steps.
You've ruined it!
I think that's why you had to stay in Boston.
Did you invite him?
Tom told me what the baby's name was.
Tom thinks I'm in Boston right now.
Tom didn't want to buy a new car.
We're teachers.
Tom will find you.
Everyone has weaknesses.
I hope you're paid well.
Tom didn't eat meat at all.
This book seemed interesting to me.
Thousands of unemployed sleep there day and night.
I'll probably be late.
Your kids know French?
Tom screamed and ran out of the room.
This soup gives it to fish.
There's a lot of girls in the room.
He's talking too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
Didn't you know I was teaching French in Boston before?
Tom was very surprised.
They tried to win time.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among humans, spoke in a horrible way, from the view of the Jews, the Galilean dialect of the Aramej language instead of the Hebrew, thus showed the insolvency of claims of a sacred language, which is particularly closer to God in prayers.
After all, Tom changed his mind.
My opinion is a little different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
That's why 300 dollars were paid for it.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom will do.
Weather forecasts weren't wrong.
Tom obviously doesn't know anyone.
I'll ask Tom to prepare you something to eat.
I'll go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read this book.
Tom didn't wear a necklace.
That's my answer!
I heard him sing in the shower.
You remind me of a young man.
Tom's at the office tonight.
I'm always busy.
I'm playing a little piano.
I thought you were a ghost.
Tom climbed up quickly.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.
Tom told me to stay in my room.
Rest is important.
Have you called Lucy yet?
A good idea came to her at the last moment.
There's a very dirty air in this room.
Why aren't you in the sweater today?
The pound is a unit of weight.
I wouldn't have talked to him again if I were you.
Japan uses a lot of papers.
It's very hard.
You betrayed me.
Tell her I'm sick.
Tom seems to be very busy.
And I'm very pleased to meet you.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
I can't help Tom.
Is that my book?
It's routine work.
Who else's on your list?
Don't give me my phone.
I've already decided who I'm going with.
I wish I knew what to tell them.
Tom's kids must be missing him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you need to talk to them.
He's reading physics in Oxford.
He was hiding that fact from me.
You saved me?
He cried loudly in his dreams.
What's your favorite browser?
Tom knew Mary by the voice.
You don't even look at me.
Tom's too lazy to do it.
Please stop fighting.
Grandpa always said the days will come like today.
I didn't tell her that.
I want to live in Australia.
No one could help them.
When did you meet her?
The day has come to an end, and thanks to your timely efforts, people who have been trying to help you in your work have failed to risk themselves.
After the earthquake, many decided to sleep in tents on the street.
Tell your people to drop their weapons.
There's a secret door in the library.
Mike has friends in Florida.
We both laughed.
We need three more chairs.
I like this office.
I have a friend who lives in England.
Tom's doing his best.
Why won't you be tomorrow?
We need to know each other better.
Someone said something, but I didn't understand.
Someone needs to talk to him.
I've never been worried about them.
Tom was able to get to the hospital himself.
I sat next to Tom.
Your voice is upset.
You've always been so selfish?
I think this medication will make you very useful.
Tell Toma to be here by half the third.
It's not a god of the news of science.
Tom suspected Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.
I'm afraid it'll rain.
Would you like a beer?
Where did you see him?
The poor cat was at the threshold of hungry death.
I've learned so much about my mistakes that I think I'm going to do more!
My favorite color is blue.
I've made some repairs.
You don't know what you're talking about.
The footballist hit the ball.
This book is selling well.
Tom didn't say anything.
I didn't know Tom would.
The positive atomic kernels attract negative electrons.
You're so wrong!
Tom opened his bag.
Everybody looked at my legs.
Tom was the first arrival.
Don't help me, I want to do it myself.
I'm not well.
Come to me.
The guest gave me an account of 8000 yen per room.
I stopped chasing for fashion.
Tom's allergic.
I know this girl's father.
I don't know exactly what my kids want for Christmas.
Why did she do that?
Does Tom have it?
I finally got a job.
Tom's in the kitchen, washing the dishes.
Temperature dropped by three degrees.
Tom refused to let Mary go to the party.
Tom won't ask me to do that.
I want to be like him.
I'll never tell you.
The bus was overloaded.
Where do you want to go next weekend?
How wonderful is that?
I've got a mammal.
Tom wasn't polite to Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car is selling well.
I have to work for this weekend.
You can't do this to us.
His words embarrassed me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what Tom had to do.
Tell her hello from me.
Was that a lie?
Tom's answer is shaken.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom back?
I've got to go.
Where was your son?
I saw it in the store.
The world is cruel.
I have a sensitive dream.
That's why it doesn't matter to anyone but yourself.
I'm from Sidzuoki.
Tom spit at his backyard all the trees.
Saturday is the day he's free.
I wonder what happened to her.
The last bus leaves in 30 minutes.
He told me he'd do it.
He gave him a book.
Thank you so much for staying with me.
She didn't give me anything.
I get it.
He wrote to his parents.
I'm happy with what I am.
Why are you just here?
Posttalion mile.
I want to know if Tom and Mary eat meat.
Tom wouldn't listen to my advice.
Anything you want to say to Tom?
You don't want another son?
How can I drop the weight?
I think we should report that we're going to be late.
Where are our friends?
Don't forget us.
They tried to hide their concerns.
There is a great body in this congregation.
I don't think you're right.
Did you find him?
You want me to come in?
Please put me on this side of the light.
Tom shot and killed a tiger.
I've never met anyone above me.
What's the price of the fried torture?
I want to drink something cold.
What do you care?
Each nation has a special nature.
A healthy person doesn't know the health price.
Did I miss anything interesting?
I had to tell them myself.
The audience's screwed out of laughing.
You're not paying attention to me.
I got a broken iron.
You like to photograph, don't you?
He's a noble knight without fear or intimacy.
They hate women.
I don't have any tiny things with me.
Tom tried to run.
What color's her eyes?
Go, go, go!
You overestimate him.
How many weeks ago did that happen?
Tom was sleeping in his room.
Do you know why this is happening?
I looked around.
Tom's still alive.
Hawaiian is my favorite pizza.
Tom was a hockey fan.
Who was the first here?
Are you singing in the choir?
You were home last night?
I've been homeless for three months.
She said she wanted to win.
Prices are going to fall.
I'm glad Tom wasn't hurt.
I've never hurt anyone.
It wasn't an accident.
Don't blame yourself.
What do you want to talk about?
Tom's yelling at Mary.
That's my favorite song.
Don't leave the engine on.
I don't know what's in the box.
Tom kind of said Mary from Australia.
Does she know you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very intelligent.
There are obstacles in our lives, some call them problems, others are talking about growth opportunities.
Thank you for taking him to fishing.
You won't have this problem.
I prefer to spend time with my friends.
Find a solution.
I hear a dog laying in the woods.
He told me he wanted to leave the company.
You want to come in?
You and I both know that this won't happen.
I thought you knew them.
Tom bought me a hot dog.
I'll be back late.
We need action, not words.
Tom was suspected he was a spy.
You're just running away from trouble.
The court without women is like a garden without flowers.
You can't leave the baby alone.
She'll do it if she can.
I'm done with this.
I put a bait on my hook.
Don't leave your glasses on the table!
We sold our souls for the money.
Are you working tonight?
The wind's out.
I've rarely met her.
I know that's really important.
I'm eating apples.
Tom learns as well as other boys of their class.
I'm not hungry.
Their job is to cook food for soldiers.
What happens if we get caught?
I can put things in the box.
I'm going to get ordered in your bedroom today.
He has five languages.
Tom had a difficult childhood.
I'm divorced.
How did you know Tom was sick?
I like how you say my name.
Tom didn't tell me anything.
There are no tall guys like Bill.
Shall we go?
I knew I could trust you!
Tom put the wood in the fire.
"Love never killed anyone." "Ask Romeo and Juliet."
What did the boy say?
I bought everything I planned.
It's like a virus.
Let me give you my phone number.
I shouldn't have let her go.
Tom died a year ago.
I knew you'd be back.
These books are old.
Are we leaving?
Neither Tom nor Mary were ever in Boston.
Did you ever suck?
If I had the money, I'd buy a computer.
Is Tom smiling?
She went to Paris.
Tom's at school right now, isn't it?
Let us know, please.
Tom chewed and went to the door.
It was just a joke.
Try to prove I'm wrong.
I told you to stay in your room.
Are you hurting anywhere?
He couldn't leave because of the lack of money.
Let me explain how this works.
Open the door or we'll break it!
Tom thought Mary probably wouldn't give up French.
I think that's why you can trust.
A lot of mystery in life.
Isn't it too salt?
Tom and Mary look healthy.
It's a rotten apple.
Tom said he didn't have any money.
Boston is Tom’s favorite city.
It's a pity when someone dies.
Are you feeling better?
What makes you think that this might interest us?
I'll think about you every day until I'm gone.
It was a bad bet.
Thinking of her coming alone, bothered me.
The river is stretched.
He looks like Johnny Deppa.
I've been watching them.
Do you really love her?
He gave the facts without comments.
He was dark green.
He'll certainly come.
You got a message?
Yesterday, Tom called me suddenly.
We really need that.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get the glasses.
I decided to give up.
The unfortunate accident took their only son.
Everyone knows there's something new in this old capital.
I'm always careful.
I went to the market.
Did you bring a towel?
Tell the Toma that I have his keys.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Do we have a chance to win?
I knew I had to stay home.
He understands French.
Tom went to the bus going to Boston.
When she fell, she smashed her elbow.
I'm sick.
We'll deal with Tom later.
You want to be rich?
They're calling you.
I'm proud of you.
She doesn't like my way of talking.
Mary wants another child.
I don't care what you're doing with your money.
I'd like to see the chief.
Tom didn't drive in Boston on the car.
Weather projection cannot be completely relyed.
She's still young.
Did you listen to Tom's advice?
Tom said he was a Daltonic.
How's your father?
Did they say when?
This car looks angry.
Are you studying English?
Are you my enemy?
She asked him for some money for a new dress.
Why does the moon shine at night?
I couldn't understand anything that Tom said.
You won't need that anymore.
Tom did it on purpose.
Let's think about it.
I know Tom wants you to do this.
Tom said he didn't know anything about robbery.
Do you know everyone here?
Tom couldn't read until he was thirteen.
I'd rather screwed eggs.
She lives in Muhosransk.
The people who are not smarter than me don't care.
Is this your first arrival in Australia?
The owls are wise.
Tom asked for some water.
The loser led a break in all three of his networks.
I can't go with you because I'm very busy.
Kilograms of figs are two and a half euros.
A lot of animals in the zoo?

What's he talking about?
I haven't seen Tom in a long time.
Tom said he didn't want to sleep yet.
What floor does Tom live on?
There's no direct flights to Bologna.
I live outside the city.
Give me a few hours.
Don't make yourself eat if you don't want to.
I have a job for Tom.
"What happened to the accident?" "No one knows."
What do you like in it?
When I came to the station, I called my friend.
I need to buy a plane to Moscow.
We met last week.
Don't believe anything he says.
Tom liberated his foreign accent.
We all knew this would happen sooner or later.
No one has expressed disagreement.
She's running.
It's a man.
If Icelandic was a color, I think it would be white.
Do you know where the meeting is going?
I'd like them to be happy.
I want to resign from work.
Christianity has many followers.
The carpets swallow the sound.
Tom told me that's impossible.
This must be where Tom lives.
Tom's a weird kid.
The phone was invented by Bell in 1876.
I slept on his shoulder.
I know you're working a lot.
I love Ural languages.
I hope that's what you're losing.
Sometimes you need to tell the truth.
Tom's a hard man.
I have an offer for you.
Did she like dinner?
I think Tom was crying.
Tom and I are planning to marry 20 October.
If you want to be alone, I'll leave.
He's got a lot of talents.
He's in a bad mood.
What would you like to be called?
He's got a Japanese father.
Who would want to kill him?
I'm in a hurry.
He says he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom said he was exhausted.
He's sitting up until late night.
Tom's room is very small.
Do you speak Italian?
The girl smiled at me.
This song is condemned to success.
I'll surprise you.
We showed them what we could.
I'm proud of him.
I just got home.
Tom burns both the tree and the coal in his cave.
My eyes hurt.
I love stories.
We must be prepared.
What were his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom threw Mary's keys.
I've been talking to him all the time.
I can't keep laughing at her jokes.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God foretold the compatibility of the king’s power and clergy in Jesus Christ.
You want me to talk to Tom myself?
Everyone of us went home.
It's not thin, but it's hard.
It's all a little stupid.
At this point, I don't know what I want.
That's incredible.
I think you sent me the wrong order.
Six-five for televisioners!
I think she's a good dancer.
Tom's interested in biology.
She tried to kill him.
Was he really that bad?
Please tell me where you're going to live.
They all need attention.
I'm on my own.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
He looks amazing.
Tom will help you if you ask him.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
It's Tom's voice.
Can we bring Tom?
Tom said I'm not beautiful.
Are you crying often?
We did not expect such results.
I've read it before.
If the car breaks, let's walk.
Can I touch your hair?
Did you find anything interesting?
Everybody does it.
I am often visiting my relatives.
He'll be excluded from our club.
You must be punished for what you did.
They climbed the stairs.
She's got to drink water.
It's one of the most ugly buildings I've ever seen.
The thief broke into the post office in the middle of the day.
That's why I left.
Why did you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come, too.
With God's help...
I don't like coffee too much.
My table's old.
We're both busy.
The darkness is untransparent.
I get everything I want.
Are you happy to meet me?
I'll get you.
Tom tried to drown in the bath.
Tom and I, we're growing up.
I said goodbye.
Tom is Mary’s younger brother.
You're acting like a fool.
Tom likes to play cards.
The book is big.
Don't talk like that about Tom.
I kind of made myself clear.
We've been waiting for three hours.
It's important that you understand.
Time can change, but human nature is still the same.
Tom looks very upset.
I brought some cookies.
Next year, Tom will teach French.
I listened to her until the end.
I advised Tom to rest.
Why does that make you angry?
The worst part of the trip is over.
We'll miss you both.
Don't be so shy!
I heard that phrase in the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her in his shoulder.
You don't speak French?
How dare you do that!
I really needed that knife.
How do you know what I had?
It'll take you a minute.
I'd like to change that situation.
We took care of everything.
I used to be very fat.
They're not coming back.
You don't have to trust any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a protein in a wheel.
He hasn't been through it.
Would you like to come with us?
Tom knows how to swim?
Just tell them what you need.
We plan to leave as soon as possible.
He went to the skies to Hokkaido.
"Shut up your fucking music and read the book."
You knew her better than I did.
I've discussed this with Tom before.
I sent you the money you asked.
There's no salvation for her.
I'm sorry I did it without you.
Your nose's bleeding.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom is in good mood.
You will soon be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants the same thing you do.
We can't just ignore it.
Where did you and Tom meet?
Where's the supermarket around here?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't know Mary.
I don't think I like that.
Even if you fake, join me.
Tom wanted to ask Mary for his forgiveness again.
Tom was thinking about it.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He's never been there.
I really want to go with you, but I can't.
It's never been like that before.
I didn't mean to do that.
I can't believe you.
I bought bread.
Let's go fast, or you'll be late for school.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom's not leaving.
Tom and Mary have changed their seats.
How are they carrying you?
Where are you going to live?
I'm usually a peaceful man, but it's hard to imagine what I'm able to do when my family is threatened.
Mary sewed Alice a new dress.
This decision was difficult to take.
I thought you'd like to drink.
I got what you asked.
He said he'd do it.
So you didn't have to leave.
Mary's been fixed after her illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get this?
The meat eating hurts your health and the environment.
Are you telling me you don't know anything about that?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom doesn't know how to enjoy life.
I want you to talk a word for me.
No one loves me.
I wish I didn't know Tom's phone.
"He knows." "Yes, did you tell him?" "No, he knew it."
Your explanation was very clear.
I slept the rest of the day.
I understand French.
I'm just sure you just thought about something.
Sahara is the largest source of dust in the world.
What do you like most in Boston?
I want to be alone.
They were waiting for the signal to start.
I told them not to tell anyone.
We have a lot to buy.
I read an interesting book yesterday.
Tom's gonna pay.
You don't need to know why.
My favorite tree is a crying beef.
I don't have this book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun is in the center of the sun system.
Are you a policeman?
Tom cheated on me and Mary.
You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.
I cut my shaving.
Tom and Mary seem more than just friends.
The river's scratched now.
The strong wind was quiet at night.
The ants and žiraphs are long relatives.
Tom did it because I told him that.
I'm not leaving.
Who taught you that?
You need it.
Tom was wearing two suitcases.
Tom doesn't seem to know me.
Someone's missing.
I'll tell her myself.
When are you leaving?
Don't slip.
The mountain is green.
I have my own theory.
I just had a conversation with your teacher.
I'm used to bed early.
Do you think I wouldn't help you?
Tom's in the office.
All Tom's doing is watching TV.
Tom's in good mood today.
It's the most delicious bag I've ever eaten.
I had a parking problem.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
You can't do that.
She's not mine.
Do you know what this is?
Ottawa is Canada’s capital.
Tom was never late for school.
Why are you so stubborn?
Go ask your father.
You still want to go?
The teacher wrote a brief comment on each letter.
It's hard for you to take it seriously.
The members of the tribe moved along the river.
I'll fix it.
I said let them go.
When's the beginning?
Nobody cares about what she thinks.
I don't think that's weird.
"Where did you get my phone?"
When will you clean the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do it.
Does it make sense to do that?
Why are you locking the door?
Tom said he was trying to do it three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane leaves at 8:00 a.m.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You don't know how to write programs.
Change the subject.
I like traveling around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom's small, but strong.
It's cold this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Please find it, Tom.
He'll give it to you.
This proposal is incorrectly written.
What would you do?
He disappeared in the crowd.
You don't understand what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
Do you think you're fat?
Tom divorced Mary last year.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
This lesson is infinite!
This box weighs a ton.
He gets everything because he's a jopolysis.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he never met her.
It seemed like he was going to kiss me.
Don't ear at me.
Are you having fun?
I don't think so.
I'll order it later.
Didn't you know Tom was going to Boston?
It's our school.
Yesterday I've been free all day, and I'm working today.
Take your coat.
If I think about it, I really need a cell phone.
Don't lose your patience.
Why is Tom angry?
What a horrible man!
The papers are harder.
Don't be mad at him.
You've exceeded your powers.
The curse was destroyed.
The grandfather Tom was born blind.
Tom's above you, right?
She hurt her back playing tennis.
Tom's pretty scared.
This table is white.
It was a weird game.
I've heard of all your problems.
I've known him for a year.
I'm going with you to Boston.
Let me talk to Tom.
Last summer, they were going to the mountain district.
Can you tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay away from there.
Tom and Mary aren't afraid.
Can you come closer?
She's a little shy.
What kind of action do you expect from Tom?
She seemed totally calm.
Press the button.
Tom went to the museum with Mary.
Tom was intrigued by what happened.
Mary wore boots to her knees.
It's a lie.
I'll keep an eye on them.
She said she was cold.
The road inspector was very rude.
Tom wants to follow his father's footsteps.
I don't see a problem here.
I don't have to do that tomorrow.
He lost his sunglasses.
It's horrible.
Tom told you where he was last night?
I can pick you up on the way to work.
I don't know what you mean!
Last time Tom was the first one.
Everyone's different.
I need to see you.
I lost your phone.
Place the tree over there.
You usually wear a bicycle helmet?
Tom's gonna fix it.
Tom said goodbye to his sister.
Mother was busy cooking dinner.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
Little garments have long handles.
Tom was in the sandals.
There's a barn beneath the tree.
Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
How's my story?
Tom turned off the wakeup and fell asleep again.
Tom and Mary looked tired.
I heard you sing.
Tom and I are friends.
How well did you know him?
Tom often plays guitar.
I tried to warn Tom.
The train was filled.
Tom rarely wears a necklace.
You bought too much bread.
He says he doesn't plan on going.
I have two dogs, three cats and six chickens.
Tom has a cable?
Whatever you say, I won't change my mind.
Tom can talk.
Thank him for your help.
Tom could have told me.
It'll bring your family's unfortunateness.
I was really nervous.
Tom said I should go.
I have to win.
It's useless to ask him for help.
Mary tried to sell her house.
You have to try not to sleep.
My mom's very helpful.
Tom's got a serpent tattoo on his back.
Did you buy meat in the supermarket?
He hit me by mistake.
What's this dog's name?
Go on the trip.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's father is.
It's raining like a brown.
The whole country is talking about it.
I'm looking forward to telling him.
You can't buy luck.

Can you read it?
We need more farmers.
Tell us more about your journey.
Six degrees below zero.
I'm not expecting you to believe this.
We have seen many unusual plants in the botanic garden.
Sometimes a small gift can be a show of great love.
Do you prefer blonde or brunette?
I didn't go to the bus.
That's why it didn't like this movie.
You want us to help you?
Be realistic.
Tom was planning on having a party.
I'll call someone for help.
Why didn't you tell us about it before?
Is that Chinese or Japanese?
Fire it out.
I'm making progress.
You're pale as a ghost.
I'll be home at six.
French is not that complicated.
Let's get out of the cab.
He was seated.
Tom never missed school.
I suggest you do this today.
I'm not going to marry her.
Tom's drinking apple juice.
Are you going on a train?
That's what we think.
How could something like this happen?
You're actress.
Tom was mentally ill.
I forgot to ask.
I'm always freezing my hands and my legs.
How can we translate the words that are not available in any language except mine?
Could you tie this with a tape?
I'm going home.
She always keeps her room clean.
I hate people like Tom.
I asked Tom to wait for us.
We're stuck in the traffic.
Tom's very angry with me.
I washed my head once a week before.
Eleven is a simple number.
I won't lie to you.
Coffee for my account.
We're husband and wife.
Jacksons invited us to dinner tonight.
Tom was impartial.
In October, the leaves begin to fall.
Melanie said she liked swimming.
What was sad about you?
Now I'm too busy to talk to you.
The captain runs his ship and the team.
Tom says he wants to be buried here.
Where did you go?
Third of the prisoners fled.
Thank God!
You think Tom knows?
This time I'm crying.
Tom was acting like a child.
Stop singing.
There were only six people at the party.
What did you decide?
I didn't know you were romantic.
I saw you spy on Tom.
I need you to do it right now.
The robber entered the house through that door.
I know how to survive.
Mary worked most of her life.
The guy Mary's name's Tom.
I'm afraid I have something to confess.
Tom was expected to be there yesterday.
Tom was an important man.
I want you to stay with me.
He's in the hospital.
Don't forget to sign.
That's where you'll be safe.
I'm in Teheran.
"Do you speak Greek?" "No, it's my first lesson!"
Why did you give him the money?
Did Tom buy anything for Mary?
Did you go to Boston last week?
I didn't play tennis yesterday.
Let me do this more.
We must respect their desires.
How did you get her?
I've been to Sapporo before.
I told you to get out of here.
We'll do our best.
Would you buy that?
Tom's gonna be late for the plane.
She's always getting up early.
You want her to help you?
You eat rice every day?
We were sitting in the deepest audience.
You'll survive.
What did she buy in that store?
When will we have a woman?
He came here hoping to see you.
I'm glad Tom did it.
I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is near our school.
It's a cookie I burned for you.
England is like Japan in many ways.
Tom would never do that.
I suggest you try more.
The lay of this dog doesn't scare a child.
Don't resist.
Tom has the keys.
When I'm in a bad mood, I like to think about the minerity to get better.
How would you feel if someone did that to you?
We both really want to sleep.
Tom just can't do whatever he wants.
Tom doesn't often tell us the anecdotes.
Luke can be used in many foods.
There's almost no snow here.
I asked Tom to help us.
The wood hit the lightning.
Do you speak English?
My brother will kill me.
I've opened the bullet.
Tom can stay with me.
Is it difficult to learn Greek?
Will Tom come with you?
Where's the remote control?
I can't find her either.
You'll speak in Swedish.
Have you seen anyone else?
Tell me why you're here.
Don't put the phone on.
Tell Toma not to see him.
We looked in the window, but we didn't see anything.
You want to work with them?
It was an interesting movie.
I've been working from morning to evening.
What time are we leaving?
It's a fake.
Tom's very emotional.
Why are you avoiding me?
What's going on with Tom?
I hope you don't get cold.
He targeted a bird.
Tom will be released on Monday.
Oh, come on!
I have to go on.
She's been squeezing her nose to the glass.
In English, sir and estar speakers do not differ.
I know exactly what to do.
He's very secret.
You have an excellent English.
Any messages for me?
Tom didn't want to cry.
How much time do you have?
Writing a message by driving a car is very dangerous.
Tom said Mary agreed.
Tom said Mary wouldn't win.
Why did you shave your beard?
I want to go back to this house.
How many lunches do you have?
The Black Will was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you ask Foma to stop?
You swear to love me.
I don't want Tom to think he's supposed to be messing with me.
I was very calm.
Everyone has something to hide.
We'll have a few guests tonight.
Her voice still rings in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
Time's all healing.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't miss the case.
Why don't we have dinner tonight at the restaurant?
Some birds didn't fly.
What else do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you?
I told Toma that you came to Australia.
Did you look for this?
Didn't you tell me you had a brother?
Where should I wait for you?
I was really worried about you.
What did you find?
Can you explain that to me?
We were stuck in the snowstorm.
The book is on the table.
I don't want any of them.
What do we lose?
You better ask him first.
He was fired against wishes.
Take them to the hospital.
Tom told you where he bought his pipe?
She never answered his letter.
I hired someone to work today.
Stop screwing a fool!
Tom would like us to stay.
I'm on the stairs.
It's the biggest car in the world.
Tom almost never asks why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me Mary didn't do that.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I already did it.
What's the weather?
I sent her a message.
You owe me $300.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
Can't you introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know I'll always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She cried.
I told Toma that Mary had to do it.
You two idiots.
Do you like living outside the city?
How long have you been doing this?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's head.
Who are you planning to go to Australia?
Someone screamed.
Which one's better?
We're grateful for your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't tell Toma to leave.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The train's going at 30.
I know you're hiding something.
Free the beasts from the cell.
He's afraid of cats.
You look like a father.
George's five years older than me.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as you're told.
Please look at this movie.
Someone's calling.
I ran away.
Why aren't you ready?
I can't fall in love with your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're much higher than Tom.
You can use his library.
I congratulated him on his birth.
Mary says she needs more time.
Foma pulled away from the door.
My dad's English teacher.
Tom and Mary gave their grandson a bike for Christmas.
Hold on to the laundry.
Did you do that?
I'd like you to translate it to French.
How many glasses on the table?
The lawyer has convincing evidence that she is innocent.
Possibly.
I don't like Tom anymore.
With whom Tom?
Taro has a strong sense of responsibility.
We both saw him.
We have to help.
Tom just got out of jail.
Did you tell Tom?
It's me!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know how Tom looks.
I've developed a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you'd do the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did this.
I don't want to hear your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
Only philosophy can be used in a vicious circle in proof and highly assessed.
I can't afford to have children.
When I approached them in French in Paris, they were just looking at me, so they couldn't make them understand their own language.
Should I leave?
I was so stupid that I believed it.
She really did it.
I think it's very expensive.
I'll open it.
My mother must be mad.
White bread, please.
Sows are cute.
Tom's illiterate.
I think Tom's still out of work.
We're perfectly close to each other.
It's French complicated, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
Danger's over.
We need more wood.
Tom said Mary was upset.
Let me know if you need any help.
We need to get there before him.
He must have missed her.
He says he's not sick.
Paris far away?
How long is it in Tokyo now?
He said he was hoping to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frida Calo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim's not coming today.
You'll be a father, you'll understand.
Last Monday, I saw you and Tom.
Where did you take off your shoes?
We went to the beach.
Do you think this year's gonna be a Christmas snow?
How was Tom's party?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from one of my friends.
I'll work for you when you pay me as well.
I'd like some coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth completely lately.
You're the only one who likes Tom here.
I know what Tom would do.
You won't have another chance.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
All the accounts have to pay me.
She's screwed up.
Tom said he was looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom's bringing Mary for his hair.
Tom didn't seem happy to me.
When I grow up, I want to be a fireman.
Tom regularly eats sushi with his mother.
We forgot to log in!
Tom said he liked it here.
No, I'm not tired at all.
She's the lazyest one I know.
Mary's cleaned up in her room yet?
This time I'll forgive him.
I really like Chinese food.
It's easier than you think.
Tom wasn't a good coach.
He's a sober man.
Alvaro from Venezuela.
Here's the account.
He insulted me publicly.
Tom won't win anymore.
Why don't I stay with you?
The induction plates for the direct heating of the cattle and the cords are used by magnets.
I cried.
Tom wants to learn how to play the trombone.
Get out now.
Can I look at your rights?
I'll take 1,000 pesettes from you for the replacement of the lightning on these jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to marry.
He forgot the sweater.
That's how Tom lives in Australia.
I didn't know exactly where to start.
That's memories!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets for a concert.
I had to go to Australia with you.
Tom burned the pancake.
He dictated several letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in the pyjama?
How much does that cost?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to take care of the garden.
The cup of rice weighs approximately 80 grams.
I should have left Tom's note.
Are you Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I'm waiting for Tom from half the third.
He likes it so much.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary are doing this together.
Anybody else noticed that?
This proposal is not in English.
I think Tom's good.
She played a sonate.
You can write in any language you want. In Tateba, all languages are equal.
The infection has been bleeding.
Tom didn't want Mary to buy a present.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
One day, you'll tell me thanks.
Tom's watching TV sometimes.
Am I ready?
I was waiting for you.
I'm still in a bad mind.
Run, chickens!
I saw a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
I think we should give more attention to the current situation of things.
I know what you told her.
I only fell asleep after two hours of the night.
Mary was not thirsty.
So it wasn't so hard to sleep as he thought.
I don't like that.
I tried to wake Tom.
They say that film is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late because of a strong rain.
I guess she's healthy.
Tom was in the hat.
Take care of your brother.
Tom said he wasn't waiting for permission.
It's time to end.
Have you had dinner yet?
I like bitter pepper.
When are you usually standing on Saturday?
I added milk to coffee.
How can I change this?
Spain adopted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I never betrayed you.
We used to do this together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about the money.
There are no invincibles.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom can paint.
They're spoiled.
I didn't know it would be impossible.
Are you having fun?
A man was sentenced to death.
Was there a snow yesterday?
You scared her.
You can't catch Tom.
Did you die of her?
Tom knows French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put that back.
Tom and Mary are almost one age.
I was impressed.
I suggest you don't go.
We haven't discussed that.
Tom made Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wants to go to a beast.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary for self-defense.
How does faith differ from confidence?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you find out?
If weather allows, we'll go to the mountain tomorrow.
We both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read the ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of God Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I've been thinking about the problem, the harder it seemed.
His gray eyes brightened and scratched, and his common pale face became alive and covered with rum.
What kind of pizza do you like most?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Take more.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands were blue from cold.
You want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
Tyfun ruined a lot of homes.
This man was sentenced to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Can anyone speak French here?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me take your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
The power in Tom's hands.
I learned to learn and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me?
No one's going to blame you.
I'm not really busy right now.
Children prefer to play than learn.
He was recognised as his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess what language I speak.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend is a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on politics talks.
Is that red or white?
We're not afraid of fear.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Let's go!
Do it before it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom didn't get used to such a job.
Bring your wife.
What, the muscles suddenly come into fashion?
Tom said he wouldn't want to spend so much time on it.
You're upset.
Our granddaughter was born yesterday.
Tom's pirate's suit.
It's a pure truth!
Let's go get the tree.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
The job is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom has to be here in 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll get you out of here.
We are proud of our achievements.
So we had to invite Mary.
Tom was supposed to be punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not a girl.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She's become a mailman.
Don't leave me alone here.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop kicking a cat!
What were you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime did you commit?
How do we know that this man is the one he sees to be?
King Harald Gormsson, more known as Harald Sinosebius, has led Christianity to Denmark.
We can't do anything for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last days were very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to pour flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You can't go to this room.
Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very talented and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read German Gesse.
Honestly, I've never spoken Portuguese.
When criminal cases come to court, it is generally accepted that there are twelve people in the jury court.
What exactly did Tom do in the embassy of Australia?
Tom and I started seeing each other.
The boys marched four in a row.
Tom was very confused.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very acid.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something was wrong.
We had no idea that Tom was going to do it.
There's been another day.
You have to do it right now.
I have to go to the X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was severely damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We're impartial.
I've got mosquito bites all over my hand.
Tom, hurry up, we're gonna be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you watching your weight?
Tom's playing on the trombones.
You from Tokyo?
I want her out of my house.
You probably can't do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonalds are worldly known for their hamburgers.
Tom made Mary a dear gift.
Do you have any opinions?
Do you like these ghosts?
The castle is broken.
The diamond is a precious stone.
Get some biscuits, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionarys.
Let go, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to go with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I've got a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Maria.
They want the best.
Tom's a waiter.
It'll be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many people suffer from low self - appreciation?
Was that too simple?
What Alice encountered, waiting for the answer, was a sudden war, and it was a noise that was so rare to break her drum barbecue, and so loud to reach the heavens.
I lost him in the crowd.
We talked about Jim when he entered the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
So you can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get things in the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did was wrong.
Many books are issued every year.
Tom unwantedly gave Mary the money she asked him to.
Why do you hate her?
My washing car broke.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I was trying to solve the problem.
You should have done your homework.
I spoke on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This stone was so heavy that I couldn't pick it up.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
He'll be able to respond.
We've got some cannoes.
Have you ever tasted a banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?
Wealthy sometimes look highly on the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his sont.
How can we explain this to the children?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey climbed into a tree.
The language I learn is very complicated.
Your baby can walk.
Is that all Tom does?
I'd rather not marry her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
Are you really alone?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom's the youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I strongly believe in his innocence.
The President has ruled four years.
I'm glad you're glad.
I don't know if I'm ready for that.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Can you solve that question?
And Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
In the building of twenty floors.
If you're not going, I'm not going either.
You don't know when Tom comes back?
I don't have Tom's photos.
Can you wait a minute?
Are you going to give Tom something for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes that singer.
If he followed my advice then, he would now be a rich man.
I made this decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There's a strong wind up.
Tom had no courage to try to jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He runs as fast as you do.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan to be home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's stubborn like a resident.
I think we can trust you.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had a feeling that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I got home, he watched the TV.
Tom was talking in his dream last night.
Tom's ready to protect himself.
You're never right.
Don't repeat that!
I called him, but there's a girl on the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We need to follow the plan.
I'll tell Toma that you called.
Tom's very strict to the children.
How are the negotiations going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of history was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested in it.
I'm mixing majones with ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom's got little whiskey.
Do you understand what she said?
You're kind of distracted.
Don't piss her off.
I'd better stay.
So there was a brilliant idea.
She's resting right now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a reliable place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who did you talk to?
I want to believe it's all right.
She always keeps her room clean and clean.
I suspect that Tom needs to go to Boston next week.
Don't go abroad.
Tom was in a horrible watch.
Tom's face is beauty.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stay?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger for him was an abstract concept; he always had enough food.
The hall needs a new curtain.
Can you stay with them?
Tom's here early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, there was rain yesterday.
Looks like he's sleeping.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
She's got her legs hurt.
This is a risk we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to take you to the hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're envy.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do that often.
I hope we won't do that again.
How many times did you help Tom do that?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These precious things are expensive.
I don't know how you do this.
I saw Tom dance with Mary.
By the time I get there, there's gonna be a time for opening.
I'm not sure what size she has.
He was also good to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom put the lamp on and went into the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Foma's gone away from the door.
We have to do it.
She couldn't ignore Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire them?
We cried with him.
Would you like to try again?
Wait a little longer.
Why are you so dressed?
The milk can be made of oil, cheese and many other things.
You don't have the power to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you her family?
When you drink water, don't forget those who dug the well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for the younger daughter.
Behave yourself good.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
Didn't you know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt an unprovoked guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won as they expected.
He blinked back.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
Didn't you think to ask for Tom's help?
It's worth it.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in a human language?
No one's hungry but me.
Tom's very excited.
No snowflake in the snow lave considers herself guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom to be here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'm dealing with this problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When's the store open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He broadly opened his mouth.
It's a spit once.
I really liked this book.
You're important.
When the ice melts, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she was staying at her bed.

I went to school there.
Fish is still cheese.
Try to remain positive.
I've been sick.
She strangled him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Will it hurt?
There was a big red hat on the girl.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom's been deceived.
I called you here to ask a question.
Who to play with Tom?
I need a light coat.
I've finished my mission.
It's a cat.
Please tell me it's not true.
You're not coming in?
I repaired his radio.
It's a very bad idea.
Tom's above you.
Tom found a job without hard work.
Is this a book in public access?
Please, could you speak more loudly?
I'll tell Toma to contact Mary.
I helped them.
He looks like a girl.
Please speak to me, not otherwise than Jacob Matthewwich.
She's not alone anymore.

The moon is the Earth’s satellite.
I don't know.
There's nothing useless in nature.
No, she never fell in love.
You did it on purpose!
You won't need it.
Tom's rarely going to party.
You're not my mother.
Tell them we're on our way.
Do I look like a guy who wants to marry?
I closed the door, but I didn't lock it.
Therefore, we should be careful and not kissing Mary publicly.
Can we help them?
Thank you for calling me back.
They're happy.
Please don't be so harsh with me.
Now I command the parade!
People we all have a good year.
I'm not sorry for you.
I know Tom won't give up.
I don't like her very much.
He's gone.
You're very smart.
Tom and I are planning to marry 20 October.
She thought I'd let her down.
I live in Boston right now.
Tom took his secret with him into his grave.
You really want to put your money in that bank?
I don't think anyone else wants to do this.

You must like me very much.
Why are you so worried about her?
I'll never do that again.

Tom paid Mary a very pleasant salary.
What do you think of that?
Let's get your breakfast quicker.
Tom doesn't know why I didn't win.
Never in life!
Did Tom ever ask you to help him?
The chair needs to be fixed.
I thought you were right.
Why are everyone looking at us?
Where's Tom's keys?
Did I correctly say your name?
Nobody saw her leave the room.
Wa-bank.
Tom will never find him.
All women are the same.
He let them walk in the garden.
I don't have a crustale ball.
Your love is fake.
She's about my age.
Did you really do it for free?
You want me to open the box?
Boys are always boys, girls are girls.
You need to get down, turn off the radio.
There is nothing new in his addiction to alcohol.
He doesn't realize the risk.
So you don't have to do that anymore.

He bought his son a camera.
Shut up and eat.
I gave you everything.

Are you looking for someone?

So I didn't have to hide.

Did I not warn you not to go there?

She left Boston.
We need to consider all options.

How old were you when you moved to Boston?
He is less aware of his problems.
Tom claimed that he saw UFO.
I know who you were with.

What did you ask them?
It's a good fix.

Do you have a problem with the car?
In the tourist information centre, the map of the city was made available to all those who wished.

I'm teaching.
I knew Tom was bluffing.
I've been trying all my best.
That's a good sign.
Some believe that the guardian angel protects them.
Tom ruined his bank account.
She's in the hotel right now.
What am I gonna do with that?
He was so curious that he paid his attention to it.
I told him that I didn't care.
Tom wants to change society.
I thought you couldn't see anything.
We're both here for the same reason.
Love is strong, and money is stronger.
I saw him naked.
There are many child books in our library.
I didn't let her home early.
Did you talk to her?
How long will it take to get there?
I didn't want to interrupt you.

Tom was born three days before Christmas in 2013.
A young girl was silent.
When Tom heard his favorite song on the radio, he couldn't refrain from starting to sing.
When does this end?
Tom kissed Mary and apologize.
The spot left a trail on the suit.
Is Tom dating anyone?
Tom didn't show me anything.
I hate driving a car.
They're fake.
When you came back, I left.
Did you talk to him today?

They made me a big party.
This mountain is covered by snow for a year.
Tom stopped at Mary's store to buy sugar.

Stay away from here.
What's the worst movie you've ever seen?
I thought you hated us.
Think well before you answer.
Tom says Mary needs more time.
I thought it was a joke and I didn't answer.
His name wasn't Tom Jackson, actually.
Is that sarcasm?
Don't do what you'll regret later.
You envy her?
I hope I can stay here for a long time.
Payment will be made dependent on experience and education.
I think Tom's right.
You don't have to sport.
Tom told me you were married.
I thought I wouldn't stay.
We are looking forward to you and your family.

I told you I changed my mind.
Why did you say that?
You have to work hard if you want to make it.
There are no exceptions in the Esperanto.
If you need help, tell me.
Can I go home early tonight?
You wouldn't have survived for nothing.
Tom didn't think Mary would upset it.
There is a trade area nearby.
Mary thinks she's the smartest.
Use your fist.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
I remember you.
That's interesting news.
Tom is a bitter drunk.
We don't even know her.
Tom made a few suggestions and checked them on Mary before pouring on Tataeba.
I know where you hide your money.
The school's finally over.
It's a long pencil.
Does your mother know about that?
Do you really like that kind of food?

I told them not to tell anyone.
That's how Tom died.
The cafeteria's empty.
Write with a pencil, please.
We can't leave.
He confessed to his crime.
This is the most beautiful picture I've ever seen.
What are you doing here?
He's worried about something.
Sometimes Claudia thought about psychoanalysis.
Tom would never accept that.
You need to find a job.
He'll be back late tonight, too.
She's very proud of herself.
I left about half the third.
Don't leave the tape on the sun.
I knew that before.

Come on in.
I'll keep them for my grandsons.

How are you, Tom?

Fortunately, he didn't die in an accident.
He often sits for hours reading books.
I had no idea you could do that.
Tom unloaded the car.
Tom knew about Mary something John didn't know.
There's no answer.
We need to call him.
Are you busy?
I've been negatively down my head.
Tom, you're called.
You promised not to drink tonight.
Are you ready for tomorrow?
We checked.
Look what Tom's doing in the garage.
I don't think that's how it works.
I didn't do that.
Tom told me he'd be back.
When are you coming tomorrow?
The hole box.
Did you talk to Tom about this?
Is that a flying mouse?
She'll take you to the airport.
Tell me what else I need to know.
You can't make me marry you.
That's pretty weird.
The leaves are yellow.
I woke up and she's gone.
We have plenty of food today.
He spoke with a speech in which he supported my view.

I have to go back to Boston.
Sit down, please.
Wake up Tom.

I don't have anything to tell you.
I'd rather you don't tell Tom about it.
I didn't want to go anyway.
I'm not going to complain.
They kept their love in secret.
She only hurried to the station to be late for the train.
Don't tell my bride that.
Tom's tired of always paying the bill when Mary and I go to a date.
I urge you to review your decision.
I'm not worried about your past.
The police searched Tom's car.
Although I felt something weird, I didn't know what it was.
Are you a pig?
I went to the army.
Why can't you accept me as I am?
The bear's black.
Tom doesn't know what Mary did.
I don't know who will be at the meeting.
It's hard to approach the president.
If you're hungry, eat.
I was terribly scared.
He's no longer a member of our club.
I'll take care of it right away.
I don't trust her.
Sixty-three is equal to eighteen.
‘Scala’ is anagram ‘laski’.
I've never seen Tom help anyone.
Dan participated in a racism myth.
You did it fast.
I need to take the watch for two minutes ahead.
He's on her side.
I didn't forget your betrayal.
I think you've done great.

It's her way of saying it makes me nervous.
Eat what you like.
And what happened then?
Do you think he likes me?

He prefers not to talk about it.
I let them sleep until afternoon.
I just wanted to get back to my old life.
I'm sorry I shouted at you.
I already said everything you should know about it.
Health gives a person a liberty that most don't realize until it is lost.
Is that important?
I know Tom's secret.
Tom is a man.
That's ridiculous.
No one could believe it.

That's not surprising.
The rabbit's bleeding out of his ear.
Postmoderism is different from modernism.
I've read this book before.
Damn it!
He is very enthusiastic.
Maybe you should call the police.
Did you report this to the police?
Do you really think Tom's sick?
I'm not afraid of that at all.
I don't have much money you think.
I'm selling clothes on the Internet.
I could've done everything faster when I was young.
I wasn't worried.
John, the highest boy in our class, is called "Mr. High."

That's incredible.
The sky is covered with wrecks.
This bird is in danger of extinction.

He said he'd be back right now.
They have large information.
Everyone in the village called her Green Hatter.
I don't want to.
It's time to put the kids in bed.
That's what you can do.
I've had a rest.
Tom won't mind.
There's nothing.
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.
Did you take the medication?
Many people believe in the corruption of our country officials.
Did he get his pants off?
I can't distinguish him from his brother.
We can count on it.
I'll go with her.

I can't pay you.
That's what I found in the cave.
I think I impressed him.
The train's going to be on this station for about two minutes.
Get up, Tom.
I want to sleep with your wife.
Where do you think it would be safer?
I know your father.
I heard you scream.
He's the boy who painted this picture.

As it turned out here, you can't find out now.
Now Tom has his own room.
I didn't know her first.
Many votes were fabricated.

It's just not going to happen.
They can't afford that.
What colors do you like?
She says she feels very tired.
Doesn't matter.
Tom had a happy childhood.
I just got back from Boston.
Why did Tom run away?
Tom doesn't know what Iraq is different from Iran.
So they said not to do it themselves.
Two days ago, I got cold.
I was waiting for him.
You don't have to do that.
Let's get some coffee in that coffee or something.
You have something in your pockets, don't you?
Ask Tom-- he'll tell you the same thing.
Sammy saw that helicopter and had to wave his hands.

There's no conditioning in my house.
Tom and Mary are studying French together.
My boss is very happy today.
They blocked his offer.
I'm admired by your courage.
Tom was hoping Mary would stay in Boston for a while.
Don't make me do that again.
It's your turn, Bashar!
You're damned.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
I visited Boston.
Excuse me, could you repeat the question?
What do you think they're gonna do to Tom?
Ask Tom when Mary's gonna do it.
I don't want anyone to do that.
Tom's gonna work this weekend.
Tell her, please I called.
No one could see us.
I knew I'd find you with Tom.
The president's attempts to implement more strict arms control once by time were crossed by the powerful arms lobby.
I think we're familiar.
You underestimate Tom.
Don't worry, Tom.
I'll try to say it in English.
Give it to me, please.
We need to talk to her.
You have enough time.
We should have planned more carefully.
You need to sleep.
I'm proud my father's good cook.
Do you want to tell me something else?

So it was thirteen at the time.
I'm going to Boston on the bus.
Tom wants to try a new champon.
Tom grew up in these places.
You have to pay forward.
Did you make coffee?
You could tell the truth.
She just thinks about herself.
You usually talk too fast.
We both speak French.
Get yourself a good suit.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
It's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your shoulder?
Tom hid the fact that he was in jail.
We're sick for Spartacus!
That's how he showed his feast.
Why did Tom need him?
It's a capital contribution.
Truth is bitter.
It was not enough time for that.
Did I say something funny?
Where's the ring?
Meg didn't even look at me.
Promise?
I know you did it on purpose.
It's time to find out.
I have to call him.
There's a lot to think about.
You've always been a winner.
Network, transmission.
I used to live on Park Street.
Try to be there on Monday.
I've read this before.
It's because of you.
Until certain conditions are met.
She's not like everyone.
Social networks allow to find a lot of information about a person before meeting him.
What really happened last weekend in Boston?
What is the point of learning?
These breasts aren't very sweet.
I don't think these black spots can be pulled out.
I told you everything I had to tell you.
No, I didn't.
Let me pay.
I can't forgive his lazyness.
Tell me you're kidding!
I'm a realist.
I heard Tom was excluded from school.

Tom's kind of famous.
Jimmy knows everything about cars.
I've seen them all.
As everyone knows, he's a genius.
The painting hangs on the rocks.
Mary said she'd win.
I want this dog.
Is Tom with you?

Distribute this dust in a glass of water.
Will you go with her?
Let's get one of those ready lunches sold at the station.
Tom tried to kill them.
She says she's happy.
You want to go abroad?
Don't blame the government.
Put him in place.
How did you know each other?
Who sent that letter?
Drop your guns.
What happened to the money?
The average rental salary for the apartment in Manhattan is approximately $4,000 a month.
You won't find them.
Tom's the only one who survived.
Are you going to buy this car?
You sound like my grandmother.
I don't have my own brothers.
Let's see something else.
You think that's the exact translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both really wanted to eat.
So there's nothing to do here.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop here!
You've been very helpful.
Don't knock the door with your hand.
You have to take into account his age.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you don't like pizza.
Tom began to suspect something was wrong.
What if he's back right now?
If you're tired, sleep!
I'm afraid I won't have time.
Didn't you know Mary was Tom's wife?
I need to go on.
Tom and Mary stopped kissing.
We're going to lunch on Friday.
What's your dad's name?
Can't you turn the radio off?
I don't remember exactly what Tom said.
Tom is an artificial player.
I wasn't ready for that.
Look at that girl.
Tom has a living imagination.
He's got a broken neck.
What are you saying?
Yesterday you left the bar just the moment I was going to put everyone a drink on my account.
Tom told me it really works.
I want to play chess.
I'm supporting you 100%.
I haven't seen you for almost three years.
You should tell her what you feel.
I have a light headache.
I heard about what happened.
We rarely have snow here.
Don't open this box.
I hate waiting.
Sometimes I see him in the club.
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.
It was fun yesterday.
Where did Tom get these photos?
Panic is useless.
Hey, you know what?
I spent three days in Boston.
I'm sure he's hiding something from us.
Tom hit him off his feet.
Tom tried to stop Mary from opening the door.
I didn't do anything wrong.
You need to do more.
You're the only one who can order money.
How is it related to each other?
I could do it much faster than Tom.
Don't feed trolls.
Where's Tom sleeping?
I won't tell you.
Why are you still here?
The equator divides the ground into two hemispheres.
He's a landed man.
I've never seen anything like that.
The trees give shadow.
She was taken with a polish.
Tom doesn't know where it is.

Tom bit a dog.
I know you're out early.
Tom was doing this all morning.
I understand the consequences.
The river is divided into the eastern and west parts of the city.
Why are you jumping?
Do you know anyone who speaks French?
Is that why it was awful?
Tom invited me to stay for the night.
I don't think Tom is guilty.
I'd really like you to stay.
I'm impressed by your French.
We both want to do this.
If the ice gets warm, it grows.
We could have done it.
The doctor said that Tom needed surgery.
I've changed my tooth paste recently.
Here's something for you.
This is your bedroom.
Tom's realistic.
Who's knocking on the door to me?
When and where did you and Tom meet?
I came to visit you.
I'm feeling amboy.
Our team came home with a triumph.
I went alone.
Tom married an older girl.
I listened to him.
Why are you not sleeping?
Did he come to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you cry.
Show me how to do that!
Everybody's silent.
Let the dust climb.
Why are you so stubborn?
He stuck into his Chinese teacher, but with all these hormonal cases, he was intimidating almost every person who met.
I'm glad to let you know that I've completely recovered.
I wrote a lot of esperanto proposals.
I like the Aquarel more than a pasture.
I can't make an exception.
He thinks fast.
I can find them.
I'm here right now.
You have the right to a lawyer.
Don't sit too close to the TV.
I'm my head almost every day.
I'm surprised he didn't give the account.
Did you steal it?
She must be mad at me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My father loves fishing like me.
Hey, it's me.
Dan was a part of the superiority of the white race.
I'll try to distract them.
I like the color of your shirt.
It's not me, I swear!
I don't think Tom speaks French.
My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom's better cooking than me.
He's swimming like a syringe.
Tom didn't tell Mary he needed to buy.
She brought a meat.
"Tome, hurry." - "I'm coming!"
I've got a big problem.
We're not partners.
We have already faced this problem.
I'll try to say it in French.
I'm not like everyone else.
I managed to get two tickets for a concert.
He likes to praise for his father's successful car business.
She's in the sunshine glasses.
Come on, Emilia, your father is waiting for you.
How many hours can you sit in front of your computer?
Tom can barely walk.
Minus by negative gives a plus.
In the basement's body.
Please make a donation.
I really need to talk to you.
Nothing to tell.
I prefer traveling on my own.
Ankara, Turkey's capital.
I went to the drinking room.
I prefer a simple approach.
They're cool.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Jane’s goodbye speech made us very sad.
I'm trying not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You look awkward.
I'm grateful for your help.
He couldn't keep the smile.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "girl"?
I didn't try to kill them.
Education is recognition of something you didn't even know.
Tom agreed to help Mary.
You should have thought well before making her pregnant.
Tom says he won't marry Mary.
I caught two fish.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom's bleeding.
I'm not poor.
Professor Hudson is my father's friend.
Can I come, too?
Does Tom earn enough to live in town?
The interrogation is over.
Please turn off the radio.
He didn't seem to be sure of his answers.
I heard rumors about Tom and Mary.
Take off your jacket if you're warm.
They're so many.
He couldn't accept the principles.
Mary says she's lonely.
You're probably gonna get three hours off for that.
That was a easy solution.
Mary said she'd come early.
I want to open my own restaurant.
Are you still buying lottery tickets?
It could be any one.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was a Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's what people don't understand.
Tom is a rich imagination.
Finally, she solved the problem.
The point is to tell the truth.
I don't want Tom to sing at our wedding.
It's all about work.
I didn't have anything wrong in my mind.
Tom maintains cleanness in his room.
These three books belong to Toma.
He was jumping from one to another.
It's a reconciliation.
Did you tell him I was here?
Tom's in.
It's not cold today.
I mistakenly wore Tom's shirt.
Looks like the bank's robbery was planned till the tiny.
That's why he didn't like it, but he still bought it.
Stay a little.
I want to talk to you about something.
The bank's empty.
Why didn't you show it to Tom?
Isn't weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I was swimming in the river.
Tell them to take off the phone.
Can you tell us what that is?
Say no to racism.
Tom's a messenger, isn't it?
Don't force me to kill you!
What do you like more?
They don't respect him.
There's no choice.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
You don't mean us.
You can't answer.
Tom has a lot of books.
Can you distinguish the aligator from the crocodile?
Wait, what's that?
My grandfather built this house.
You want to use this opportunity?
You can't stay here.
I did it for the first time today.
I arrived in Australia when I was a child.
You really want me to tell Toma that you killed his father?
Your teacher called me.
I'm your father.
Can I do it myself?
The whole nation was touched by his speech.
Do you know how dangerous it is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower this morning?
All right, everybody, listen, please.
Is it made of a tree or of metal?
Excuse me!
I think Tom's my friend.
Counting to remain unreasonable and free, the nation relies on what has never been and will never be.
Tom's barely breathing.
Dogs don't distinguish colors.
Tom poured water out of the bottle before filling it with fresh water.
Dogs are true animals.
Tom's house was practically destroyed.
You're so stupid.
Tom knows you can't speak French?
On the lake, two boats.
I won't give you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
Being alone better than in a bad company.
These are the wrong data.
There is a significant difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom is lazy.
I need to tell Toma that he doesn't do that anymore.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's pretending.
Come closer.
We stopped at the Hilton Hotel.
That's why we should tell Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I asked Mary to wait.
She kept complaining that there were no money left.
Don't you think you should call Tom?
There's something to do.
She made him a gift.
Mary's working at her room.
Attention!
At the same second, I fell in love with this language.
Tom's safe, isn't he?
You ordered that pizza?
I need you to help me with this.
Tom's my close friend.
Don't do two things at the same time.
You weren't supposed to go to the woods alone.
No one can see my tears.
Tom was asleep again.
She really likes you.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are multiplied.
Tom never kissed anyone before.
I'll tell them you came in.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October of the month.
I'm very pleased to meet you.
I almost forgot the congregation.
They had the wedding last autumn.
He's helping me.
Put your hands up!
Everyone knows we didn't do this.
I thought Tom was never in Boston.
She learned to dive when she was five years old.
We regretted the noise manager with the neighbors.
I won't let you do this.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need this.
Honesty is one of the virtues.
When you meet a new year, you'll spend it.
There's no book in French in the library.
Each summary is dangerous, especially such.
You could have stayed in Boston.
There's no one there.
Can you write this with hyragna, please?
We don't think that matters.
No one understands you like me.
Behave to your age accordingly.
You know how to žongl?
Did you kill your wife?
We exchanged welcomes.
Tom still wants to come.
I thought they weren't coming.
I can't endure the kind of animal suffering.
I think Daddab's stopping today.
Sally made her brother clean up the bathroom.
Mary's apartment is in a full mess.
The conference room is currently busy.
Potato chips are harmful for your health.
My isn't as good as yours.
I'm looking forward to Christmas.
I've never seen you so happy.
He made a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
It's bored here.
Do you see the star?
Ask Tom.
Grab the rope!
That's what you said.
Tom says he's not hungry.
It's always been.
Can't we fire her?
The artificial satellite was taken to the orbit.
I'm totally serious.
Are you sure you're sick?
It's too simple.
What happens to our children if nuclear war begins?
I told them the bank wasn't working.
Tom and I soon became friends.
He has a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
I feel very compassionate to Toma.
There's nothing to tell me what to do.
Documents on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
Tom didn't tell us what he was so upset.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I don't work today.
That's what you said last time.
I know that better than anyone else.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like that.
You don't have anything to hide, do you?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The account should be paid until the first number of the next month.
My French is horrible.
We need help.
You're scaring her.
It's a cold city for me, not that Chicago.
Tom was the victim of an expulsion attempt.
I can't speak for a colleague.
Is Tom living far from you?
Why didn't I die?
The fight ended with a fight.
I didn't take it, you can check your pockets.
Tom came yesterday.
I'd like to leave my call.
You chose the wrong man.
They took a great risk.
We have a white cat.
Maybe you'll never be able to walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home yesterday?
If anyone can do it, Tom.
The meeting was canceled because of the tayfun.
Tom was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2013.
On the road, he drove a ride with mules.
Tom speaks French with his grandparents and his parents in English.
I don't think Tom's got enough money to buy a ticket.
Tom was hard to find.
Everybody's dancing!
I live with Tom.
That's where I met them.
You're not losing time.
Your problem is, you're lacking patience.
Several events marked the occurrence of the twenty-first century.
Stop doing this, Tom.
Tom said he didn't plan to do that.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told Toma to go to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said there could be no talk about it.
He got out of bed.
The trains follow according to the schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think that it is impossible to avoid confusing languages.
Why does Tom avoid me?
Is the examination going to be today?
What motivates you?
Sammy gave Layle his computer.
Put your sleeve in.
I was hoping you'd be back.
Do you think Tom will agree to meet us?
They say anyone in America can be president, but it's probably not.
Tom never forgot Mary.
The first name on the list is Tom's name.
What else did you miss?
Mary tried to calm down.
When's the train coming?
How long is this train coming to Boston?
Didn't you see that?
You need to call me.
Tom never suspected Mary and John were seeing each other.
When I get rich, I'll buy a farm.
I baked his cookies.
It's a neighbouring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You won't believe what Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think.
Transfer it to French, please.
Take the cold steel!
She needs a cab.
The crowd was rapidly increasing.
Mary told me she loved me.
Tom told me about what happened.
Hairs and screw it.
I'll find her.
Have you thought about what I said?
I'm very sensitive to cold.
We're looking for you!
She's all loved.
Compare your answers to Tom's answers.
Tom has a weak heart.
So I'll have to pay for it.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you borrow me a pocket knife?
Tom took off his front beard.
Did you see my dog?
Don't even try to do it on your own.
Nobody saw you take it.
I'm half Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix it.
You have to go back.
We've already spoken.
I can't believe I finally did it.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry, the test is light.
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth?
I don't know what book to choose.
Tom didn't understand anything at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white boy-paper shirt.
It's a tower.
I'll have to wait.
It was Sunday yesterday, not Saturday.
Anybody here knows them?
They're watching you.
How long do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
That's what we can do.
He knows about his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary's wearing a black dress.
We had lunch at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks anyone for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
In this city, there are a lot of widespread prospects.
What are you talking about?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to marry next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find the hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't told Tom yet?
She's got a double beard.
We can't make the people do that.
Let me take it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't stand that color.
Are they sleeping together?
We are very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still not married.
I didn't even know what you knew.
I won't let her in.
The neighbors complained about us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I've never spoken to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Toma.
She's got shortages.
I'm wondering why it's necessary.
It seems suspicious to me.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing Friday night?
Tom isn't the only one in Boston here.
Will you support me?
What do you don't like this plan?
I thought you were at work.
That's what you have to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
Are you a friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter will be over soon.
The titles and awards don't mean anything to me.
Where did you even find him?
The meeting's delayed.
I'll recognize you.
Have you had a good weekend?
Tom's drinking a beer.
If you don't want to do it, don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is that good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need the cash.
Bring Tome a drink.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
Get together!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled at me.
He's afraid we're gonna lose.
I can't call him home.
You had to apologize to Tom for your rude behavior.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy ran to his house.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a taxi driver when he lived in Boston.
Tom looks like a optimist.
He's not going to buy a camera.
I've done everything I can to help Toma.
I'm connecting you to her.
She has received the highest estimates.
Tom can be jealous.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color is your childhood associated with?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the benefit of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom used a native homecrat.
I'd like to get down.
Give me a note paper or something like that.
I want to relax in front of the TV tonight.
He'll be here tonight.
Cat's dead.
It's only half the ninth now?
Tom went to the shop to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
It's not safe to swim in this lake.
I cut my finger yesterday.
Tom wanted lunch with me tonight.
Tom doesn't look well.
She gave her hands to warm them up.
Tom said glad you were back.
My car's covered with pigeon shit.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Laurie's home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I'm not going to make this mistake anymore.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I convinced her to marry him.
I've been waiting for this day all my life.
What did they do to you?
Did he surrender the exam?
The plane's in the barn.
It wasn't him.
Do you have friends in Indonesia?
You may have to help her.
Mary's lost consciousness.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come with me to the concert?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd love to see you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where's your sons?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
That won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Hi," said Tom robly.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm hurting everything.
She had no food.
I don't think Tom knows how much time.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of cars passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the price.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new proposal as a message in the bottle: one day it will be translated.
You can't find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everybody loved you.
He and I are relative souls.
I have a granddaughter of your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
She began to get in her new office.
Let us take care of it.
I guess you're sitting in my place.
I was planning to do it yesterday.
It's a little early to drink drinking, isn't it?
My parents don't like my way of dressing.
Whoever wants to stay, can stay.
That'll be interesting.
I hit him hard and hard.
Because, worse?
It's not good.
Can I take your hand?
It's green.
Tom heard the noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom wasn't sleeping all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about cellulates.
The series must start watching when all the seasons are taken off!
Road accidents happen daily.
Where did you go to the skies?
You've been to the feather?
The perspective is disturbing.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the ball pen.
The only way to know what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept for two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You should find another way out of this situation.
Get out of here.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's all take a picture together.
I failed on the examination.
Everyone already knew about it.
You'd better go help her.
The footballist made a huge mistake.
Are they coming, too?
She's asleep like a baby.
Tom forgot to let the brake go.
This song reminds me of a girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The explosion is shaking the entire building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they hugged.
It's my cat.
Do you have children yet?
Tom didn't want to have breakfast.
They like Tom.
Tom doesn't even know why he was excluded from school.
Tom's a self-confident idiot.
That doesn't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I guess you need help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let the cat go.
I know you're all cowards.
Tom thinks that throwing foods is a sin.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place is swifting right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I don't doubt it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved very well.
Let's go to church.
Tom erased whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's responding.
I've never met him better than that.
How much did he cost?
I need to see you right away.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
The sharks eat fish.
I'm still the same as I was before.
Do you know the boy who's crying?
No one knew about it.
It's just amazing.
He said he'd never do that.
The stolen one's gonna steal a cow.
Tom doesn't swim well, does he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was just the shadow of his old man.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom doesn't really want to go with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
Anything happens.
What day is it today?
Let's give Tom another chance.
I just want you to take me as I am.
I'm an ordinary guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss Lily in his lips?
Why don't you go there?
Tom didn't even say he'd come with us.
Tom died a day later.
Tom and I should stay together.
I've heard only good about him.
I don't work here anymore.
What do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You're not compared to us.
I saw the car exploded.
The window's here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never throw out my Playstation.
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
Stay calm!
What's your favorite television?
You want to go to the movie tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's suitcase is empty.
Oh, my God, it's burning!
I'm afraid you're gonna lose.
I like to go to school.
I offered help.
I'll be back to Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son from me.
Her father seems to be an attorney.
I want to see a volcano.
I know the owner.
Your dog.
What do you mean?
You can't do anything about it.
Tell him I'm going to go to his house this afternoon.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to make an impression on her.
Don't you see what happened?
I didn't want to bother him.
The officer has made his people courage.
Tom's never gonna find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about testing things like that right now.
I don't know much about hunting.
I'm making meat at home for the first time on the grill.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would apologize to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many sons do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
Everyone already knew that.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You shouldn't lie.
I know Tom's gonna cry.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I knew that before.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe she said that.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw him look at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom has to be home.
She was the one I thought about.
Tom showed his driver's rights to the police.
I'm shaving every month.
I told you I didn't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's acid apple.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new catalogue.
It must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go to fishing tomorrow, I'll go.
Are you taking a job to the house?
According to mythology, Prometheus abducted holy fire from gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All passengers managed to get out of the bus before it burned.
I want to help you handle this.
You speak French better than me.
There's a lot of talented people in our city, but Tom doesn't.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We're taking checks.
My bike's gone.
The stars floated in the night sky.
I doubt Tom will win.
"Eh, here you have so boring." -- "My boy, it's all trying for this world..." -- "Here and I! Your Majesty, Genon and his servants have taken the island of Coriday." -- "How can we..." -- "How can we write, Linc can overcome Ghanon." "Well, as we can..." "Well, I'll take my sword!" -- "Ah?" "The Sword No!" -- "The Sword of No!" -- "The sword with the skull." -- "No, but how do you think of this gun."
Do you know who sings this song?
Your watch is going right?
I'll see you on Sunday at 3:00.
I was at your wedding.
Tom can barely swim.
You're doing this well.
I met her on my way home from school.
I didn't read any of his novels.
Everyone knew Tom was dying.
Where's the hammer you used for?
Tom wanted to learn to read.
I'm going to Tome's house.
Ken couldn't remember his name.
She said she needed money.
Tom helped Mary put on the blankets.
A is a multitude consisting of elements c, b and a.
I'll be back at 9:00.
He's got diabetes.
We can deal with them.
I was just wondering if you had any experience you'd like to share with us.
Tom was sleeping without a blanket.
Pray for us.
What kind of music are you listening to in the car?
I was told that three hours ago.
Take mine.
The French revolution began during Louis XVI.
He was curious.
He loved us.
Did you get a invitation from Tom?
I want to swim in the sea.
It'll depend entirely on him.
I met a classmate.
He's old enough to travel alone.
I didn't know how to answer his question.
Our city was occupied by a capabilities.
Nobody saw them walk out of the room.
Two big coffee, please.
We talked about you.
What kind of music do you usually listen to?
Without bread, no food.
It's gonna be snow tomorrow.
You should have quit smoking for a long time.
Stop joking!
Some of my classmates are full of need, they don't know anything about computers.
Did you like the bike?
I thought Tom wasn't sleeping.
So they weren't allowed to leave.
I didn't find them right away.
Hurry, please, Tom's waiting.
Listen to what the teacher says.
She's amazingly like Marilyn Monroe.
I know who we can ask for help.
I'm stronger than you.
She felt deeply regretted when she looked at her life.
I don't think Tom knows what he's doing.

I didn't want to swim.
He drunk a beer.
Nowadays, a man is harder to be himself.
I'll never talk to him again.
Shh, Tom, wake up!
I'm gonna cut my nose jackets.
I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm a new teacher.
They're all kids.
She freaked out and shouted at me.
Did you take your medication?
The rabbits are very nice.
She doesn't trust him.
It's time on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like the bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Did you want to tell me something?
I doubt Tom's still mad.
You'll be better in the morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you smell the burned rubber?
That's not what happened here.
When will your father come home?
I understand.
Tom stretched Mary's book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of the shower.
Tom's patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary aren't married.
Tom's gonna try to escape.
You're obviously tired.
We're champions.
Tom's deaf.
Tom said that's not enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring a salad for the party.
Her hair is wet from sweat.
I'm just buying a soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat on the floor between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much this weighs?
The board guide is a complimentary master.
Tom's married to Mary, isn't he?
All the storms in the park were busy.
Someone needs to tell her that.
I've got everything working.
Vermont is located on the border with Canada.
He had to live in the same room with his brother.
I'm not an imbecile.
You're gonna fix it, right?
I can't hunt.
He has a brother in Tokyo.
Dynamite invented Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We have to interfere.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can go if you want.
I know you shouldn't do this.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my glasses.
I've spoken to this student before.
What chemical sign is the bromide-water acid?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in the shadow.
I asked Tom.
So we need to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do that.
Cool!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a palace.
I respect his views, although I disagree with many of them.
Heaven is in the center of the city.
Who sent you?
She tied him a sweater.
I don't think Tom wants to go with you to Boston.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine calls cheaper?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
I wish I could just go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use them, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late to school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
How long are you planning on staying?
We've eaten instantly and left right away.
There's a big garden in the back of the house.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't throw anything on your feet.
Start every meal from the soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right against me.
The ticket was open.
I brought the wine.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day in school.
I want to meet you to death.
She's beautiful, too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I offer another strategy?
They're dead.
The apples are big.
Did you know Tom lived in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
Is she singing?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom was interested in listening.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Tom?
Let's go on the car.
You're interrupting me.
She was wondering what his lips would taste.
A good coach trains this team.
The tree's sick.
The train was detained because of a strong snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
Why do you think I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When did you last see her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for that book, aren't you?
It should have been you.
Mary left a hat in my room.
Is that a drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Do you live there?
What would you eat?
You don't recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning to do it or not.
I'm falling.
I wasn't able to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom wears a new shoe.
Last year she learned how to ride a bike.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Since there was winter, he didn't go out.
When I walked down the street, I saw my friend.
How many houses on your street?
The elephants are made of elephant bone.
I'm not a kid anymore.
"How's life, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
Her own French language.
It's a bad coat.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married then.
I bought this book.
Naiveness is his only positive qualities.
My hobby is the collection of insects.
Tom's baby lived in Boston.
I haven't eaten six days.
Can I tell them about that?
She's been silent all day.
No matter what he can say, don't trust him.
I went on.
Tom and Mary hope their next child will be a boy.
Mary's always very welcome, and she has a nice smile.
I won't let her die.
In all cultures, babies are asleep under collapse.
It's the best restaurant I know.
You could have learned a lot of them if you were listening.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
I'm sorry to upset you.
The one who never left the borders of his country is full of prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it gets when the snow falls.
Tom's helping his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
For many people in India, cows are holy animals.
I've turned my imagination on.
I thought we could do it.
My mom was opposing me to ride alone.
I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.
You know what you're doing, right?
Machine translation cannot be trusted.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
This river is full of fish.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
She and I are peers.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms before?
The prisoner is released.
What, they said it happened?
Could you leave the door open?
We'll have to wait for that.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice older than me.
Tom knows it was a mistake.
In Japan, it's a soft climate.
Check it again.
Don't condemn Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let Tom do what he wanted.
He replaced a trauma player.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Our journey went very smoothly.
It's inevitable that I'm going to France one day, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom's just pretending to be sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom's watching.
The rain stopped. You can reopen the windows.
I've never seen this before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was going to go out when the phone ringed.
I don't have to tolerate this.
Always step away from the road to the right.
We're asked to be introduced in a row.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
She may be nice, but I don't like her.
I can give you a ride if you want.
Tom told Mary she wasted her time for nothing.
Are you still in trouble with this?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxs as a hot bath.
I really don't have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's a open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about it.
You don't have to regret it.
She's my mistress!
Your voice sounds like a melodial siren song to me.
How's it feel to be married?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why he didn't like Mary.
My fingers left prints on the glass.
Chemistry is a great science.
I feel like my French doesn't get much better.
How do I get the best passport?
You may be able to help Toma.
Tom is the best bubbster I know.
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They're ready.
Tom didn't pay attention to Mary all day.
Tom's got fat hair.
Tom doesn't want to sell the house, but he doesn't have a choice.
It's still a light outside.
I gave my sister a dictionary.
It's my father's car, but soon it'll be mine.
Did you forget his name?
If I had time to do this, I would have done it.
Do you see Tom's boat?
Big foma?
This medication will help you.
Stop the noise.
My stomach hurts.
Do you know how busy I was?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I don't have anyone to trust.
She is a fan of the Sex in the Great City.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Be good with him.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you have to do this often?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop!
Nothing is compared to a glass of beer after a long working day.
What's wrong?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.
How long will you take?
Let's rest here.
Are you in new shoes?
You can leave if you want.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
That's what my mom said.
She's screwed up when she saw the dog.
He's not above me at all.
Smoking is strictly protected.
This bress is beautiful.
Can you see that?
Tom's not excited.
You shouldn't have been to such a dangerous place.
Good job!
You used to say that yourself.
Here are some letters for you.
It is practically irrelevant that a scientist would have made such a basic mistake.
He doesn't have any proof.
You look bad.
He swimmed very well when he was young.
I'm writing to my friend.
He can play tennis very well.
She made students fooled.
She said she was a Canadian.
Don't talk to anyone.
And when were you going to tell me?
I didn't want to tell you that.
I filled the bowls upstairs.
Go straight.
I'm too tired to think about it now.
What house do you live in?
I told them it was ridiculous.
What are we living for?
Will the rain be this afternoon?
We know about her.
You could have helped us.
I don't often drive a car.
That's why it doesn't like the ending of the movie.
Just get in there.
Just ask him for your pardon.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I'm sick of you two.
I didn't know it was legitimate.
I love adventures.
Tom's in the library.
You were at school that time?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Why didn't you sing with us?
Are you happy?
I decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.
Tomorrow it'll be a strong snowfall.
We decided to move the meeting next week.
She thinks she can prove it.
When was the last time you played golf?
Are we poor?
I don't know Tom's name.
We have the same dentist.
Not all Brazilians like karnevals.
I don't think Tom knows what's going on.
Who did Tom sell his car?
Tom's flipping.
I have to make money to buy a computer.
Don't laugh at aliens.
I don't know them.
If you could choose genes for your children, would you?
So Mary and I need to rest.
He lied to bed.
It could have been worse.
Tom did his part.
Tom doesn't know where Mary's keys.
What book are you looking for?
I'm sleeping a little bit.
You're gonna get there sometime.
Tom's fine with Mary.
"You owe me money." "No, you don't."
He came up and got on his knees.
You don't have to go there if you don't want to.
This song always reminds me of my childhood.
Tom did this for you?
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
He says he's rich.
Tom's making three times more money than Mary.
I was drinking milk.
It's gonna be snow tomorrow.
Isn't life wonderful?
When it comes to cooking, no one's compared to Mary.
You're not yourself lately.
Tom lost his leg when the shark was attacked.
I burned it for you.
We'll do it as we can.
Next year I'll be three times older than you.
Can you tell me what happened?
Show me your collection of marks.
It'll take eternity.
Tom's completely above Mary.
Looks like no one knows him.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it?
This tissue comes to your skin.
I'm in love with you.
It's almost winter.
I think Tom lied to me.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom's parents told him not to do that.
Tom and I were surprised.
I'm fine.
Tom decided to give up his professional guitar game.
I'm married now.
It was just a few times.
This time you went too far.
It's working.
Are you going to see Tom before he leaves?
Nothing surprising," Tom answered.
We want to take off the apartment in town.
They spoke French.
It's extremely expensive.
He's not singing anymore.
I didn't know what else to do.
They haven't wake up yet.
Tom's a few inches above Mary.
I'm glad you offered that.
It's hard to answer.
You don't believe her?
English is a world language.
Sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told Toma to leave Mary alone.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom's looking for a job.
Why does he need a hammer?
Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of darkness.
The situation is getting worse.
I choose where to eat.
Tom decided to buy a car that was handled instead of a new one.
I just wanted to wish you good luck.
She's breaking up.
I won't let you take my children.
Don't give them to him.
Run or you'll be arrested.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom made it a rule to meditate every morning.
Did you check your calculations?
He tried to create a short story.
A room without books, like a body without soul.
Why did God insult us so much?
What does your brother do?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure this won't happen again?
I haven't seen you for a hundred years.
I visited Tony yesterday.
It's easy to make an impression.
You're old enough to do it alone.
Aristotel thought the Earth was the center of the universe.
I wonder what Tom actually meant.
No one understands me.
So many stars in the sky, I can't count them again.
Everyone turned around and looked at us.
Let me see.
White bears live in Arctic.
I told you I was the best of all.
I told you Tom wanted to go to Boston.
Tom doesn't have to ask you to do anything several times.
Let's wash the dishes today who loses a paper-scientific stone!
How unhappy I am!
I would never do that.
Have you ever been to Boston?
He speaks Russian - at least he said it to me.
Tom's a third-year-old.
How long will you stay?
I'm not a woman.
She's got a tall father.
The train was overloaded.
The house is red.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
You know Boston well, don't you?
The orchestra started playing.
Mary was in a pirate's suit.
It's not my wife.
Why didn't you mention that before?
Tom didn't want to be a knocker.
He was born at seven a.m. on 5 June 1970.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
Jane and Kate are twins.
Tom just eats white meat.
Thank you for helping.
We only have three rules.
She bought one for herself.
The security didn't see Tom.
In recent years, Tom had a great deal.
I helped carry those bags.
They've got plenty of time.
Fifteen times five equals seventy-five.
I live in this hotel.
I don't want to know anything anymore.
You don't know what he'll say yet.
My hands are tired.
I lied to my wife all the time.
Finally, she did it.
It's screaming that they were not insured from fire.
We've got a lot of money.
The examination was broken into two parts.
When are you going to tell them?
Tom didn't want to talk about his illness.
Eh, you're so boring here!
Reading the books compared to the journey.
Tom saw Mary walking into the shop.
Why are you not there?
Tom said Mary would probably win.
The Japanese would never do that.
I miss Boston so much.
She keeps writing letters.
I don't know who to consult with.
Turn left on the corner.
Tom taught me to do that.
You can do much more.
Give me one, please.
I can't bear inherent children.
That's what Tom bought me.
What you said is pissed everyone off.
You're too small for that.
My parents are married for 30 years.
She showed her talents.
I wish that was possible.
I suppose you can't do this.
I'm lucky I'm alive.
The next school festival, Bob, will play the main role for the first time.
You have to stay in the form.
I've been screwing the seeds all day.
On the accent, I realized he was American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was that a joke?
Mercy!
Tom obeyed.
All people of my generation think the same way.
I live for that.
Do you know how to ride skies?
The Duke owns many lands.
At least have fun.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad's gradually healing.
You'll feel like home.
It's not gonna end well!
He looked like he didn't eat for a few days.
I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who is Norman Finkelstein?" "American politician."
Get out of here!
Well, if it's not the sale of goods at home, maybe it's a new way to get to know girls?
Tom picked up the coin.
Why didn't you clean up in your room?
If God is not there, it's all allowed.
We both are Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything as due.
You're in time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please put your belts up during the flight and landing.
It was Toma and Mary.
We both love sea products.
I've been waiting for this a long time.
I rejected the proposal.
You want to come with us?
Tom didn't eat.
I'll take too much time to explain why it won't work.
Nothing's changed.
Did you build all this yourself?
I'm looking forward to the summer vacation.
Can I make this a different way?
That's where he looks great.
The wooden houses are easily flammed.
Let's get Tom's party.
The dog's still alive.
I'm going to college.
I know you lied.
The bed is very comfortable.
I'll make a report tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's a pussy.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait for his coming here.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know Mary's shoes size.
I need to think about it.
The meeting was appointed on Tuesday.
My name is Jose, we're friends.
You forgot to mention it.
We don't need that anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do it without our help.
Everybody's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who arranged a meeting?
I'm such a lucky guy.
Tom wants to fix this.
I'm not going to have fun tonight.
Mary was the only girl in the suit.
What bird can't fly?
That's what it's got to end.
Tom didn't answer immediately.
Tom died when he was 70 years old.
Life is a gift.
Tom also speaks French.
The invention of the transistor marked a new era.
I'm not in love with Mary.
Did you hear what she said about Alexei?
You look like a girl.
Here's a few photos.
What's going on the tenth channel?
I hate spinate.
Mother's cooking lunch.
Tom's a pilgrimage.
What can I do?
Her son's genius.
I know you've seen horrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He is inclined to give emotions free.
We were shocked by the news of his death.
Why didn't they go?
I didn't see you.
You're just making it clear.
He had cancer.
You're guilty of what happened.
He's as exact as a watch.
I know where you're going.
You're taking it all over the summer.
Let's move it.
Let's leave this up to tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do it.
I don't like doing this.
The cleaning woman interrupted the conversation.
It's a cat on the writing table.
I don't want to be late for work.
You're not screaming anymore.
Tom was a cool smoker.
Tom wore gloves.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to that weather.
I'm wondering who's gonna help him decorate the snowfish?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in family souls?
What's that noise?
My son has an inheritance sickness.
That's disgusting.
Is that a snow?
I'll call you back.
He put down the glass.
I don't know if there's a country in the world where you can marry your dog.
The best protection is an attack.
She's getting married this autumn.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it would be easier.
Can we help you with something?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When are you ready to go?
The investigations began last year with the confiscation of human computer archives from the German city of Magdeburg.
How's it going?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
Why did you think you couldn't?
We went back through Boston.
Who's gonna believe that?
Thank you for fixing it.
Are you insane?
The stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get this scarf?
They wanted evidence.
Tom's rolling his pencil.
Tom doesn't know how to ride a bike.
I'm not talking to the teluga at all.
Why did Tom leave?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild beasts.
How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed before her tears.
I spent $500 for one day.
Tell them to go home.
Put it anywhere.
They didn't make it in time.
It's seven thirty.
I see you're awake.
I want to know who told Tom that.
Tom got up early to see the sunrise.
Dinosaurs have died a long time ago.
I usually climb the stairs over one.
Tom's got that one more year.
I'm around the station.
Tom's a very good boy.
Are you drinking?
You're from Boston, aren't you?
Put it on my desk.
Tom got out of the water.
I was very proud of it.
You were ready.
Do you know brother Tom?
All guests can put their eggs away.
You'll pay for what you did.
I'm out of my hands today.
I asked them to stay away from this.
Tom only learned how to drive at 30.
I'm glad he wasn't hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary have they studied French.
I haven't laughed like that for a long time.
The kitchen knife was not enough sharp to cut the meat, so I used my peanut knife.
Honey, I can explain everything.
You'll be adapted to a village life soon.
Keep the barrel close to the water.
You're no longer a child.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We've all agreed.
There's a river deeper than that.
Thank you from all my heart.
I told you that a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
I guess you should tell Tom.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed.
Writing the words separately in cases where they should be written is a great problem in the Norwegian language.
What are you doing with the remains of the rice prepared?
It's been ten years since she died.
Tom met Mary a year ago.
Anything else you need?
We left shortly after that.
This book is worth reading.
Tom and Mary have done lessons before dinner.
I don't want your tea.
You're always so romantic.
The wife is not a boot, you can't take it off your leg.
I'll get you at six.
I teach Toma French.
I like to learn other languages.
Mary's got brown eyes.
I'd like to know how long Tom is planning to stay in Australia.
You didn't know I couldn't do it, did you?
What did you feel?
Let's give him a chance.
I like fruit.
Tom lied.
He's dealing with cars.
Are you still in touch with her?
"Do you think he'll come?" "I hope not."
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I ate the icru.
They shot me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We must check.
Tom gave Mary's gun.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
They first went to the bus.
Let's wait until Monday.
Anybody here knows them?
There must be a mistake here.
He can't afford a vacation.
I'm used to the smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was the day?
It's your fault.
I told you what time to come.
Of course, I kept my promise.
Our friendship remained strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get closer to the case.
Tom was sitting in the stairs.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes the lightning beats twice in the same place.
I'm not praised.
Leave it for later.
Tom advised Mary not to leave the door unlocked.
Tom blames Mary for John's death.
You make your own decision.
You were surprised?
We counted the annual rings on the tree we scratched and determined that he was thirty years old.
I think I've known you all my life.
I want Tom never wrote to my daughter again.
The rabbits are rapidly multiplying.
I don't want to discuss this right now.
What's the cost of cleaning the coat?
We'll paint it.
The opening is narrow.
I'm not afraid to go to the cave.
When happiness knocks on your door.
You need to listen to her.
I wish you knew how much you mean to me.
Mary answers the teacher's question.
Tell me frankly.
I'll come to whatever it is.
Do you mind making another cup of coffee when you want it?
I'd like to go back to Tokyo through Gonolulu.
You're not telling me anything I didn't know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom left the last one.
Tom signed the petition.
You tried to talk to Tom about it?
You scared them.
She insisted on her innocence.
We don't know much about Tom.
How was the day?
Don't worry about my dog.
Now I understand.
Give me some time.
Do you want them to help?
Tom can't be seen anywhere.
I told Tom to come here.
Find out what they said.
Apples are the best fruit.
Could you close the window?
Tom didn't have a ticket.
We can meet again in the near future.
The trees calmed me down.
He's a baborab.
I slept on my stomach.
Keep me informed.
You have the right to your opinion.
Mary told me she'd buy it.
I made breakfast.

I'd like some more tea.
Try to put yourself in her place!
I know you don't live here anymore.

That's why I came back so fast.
I don't know any word in Hungarian.
Tom can't forgive us.
You want us to go?
Who will correct these errors?
The only question is how much money we need.
Do you think that's a drink?
Go get that red car.
Can you give me salt and pepper?
Tom's asleep.
Sometimes it's hard for me to speak French.
I just realized something was wrong.
Will you call me tomorrow?
Tom said Mom never loved him.
Tom was acting weird.
So this picture didn't like it.
You haven't been seen lately.
I suggest you go on the bus.
Let's wait until we hear what Tom's thinking.
Will you come later?
You've been too low.
Don't touch my car.
I don't remember telling you to close the door.
Who taught you how to ride a bike?
Don't forget to pay taxes.
Have you ever been to that restaurant?
I was hoping to meet Tom there.
A few people helped us.
That's what Tom was afraid of.
Hence, he likes to ride a bike.
I don't have much to do.
I'm almost late for my train.
You just need to wait.
Unfortunately, I can't help you with this right now.
Your offer is better than Tom's offer.
You'll be a grandmother soon.
You don't even know how we missed you.

Tom answered correctly all questions except one.
Think before you say something!
Are you locked all the windows?
I had a dream about you today, it was a good dream, but it made me sad.
Did you go to the beach alone?
You could've just told her.

Tom fixed the car.
I love this shirt.
I'd do the same thing if I were you.
The store was almost empty.
Tom hit me in the back.
What don't you like in the winter?
It's time to stop.
Christmas was celebrated on 25 December.
Where's my lamp?
I don't think we can find Tom in this crowd.
Lug was full of paints.
Don't you have a key?
Who told Toma that I was here?

He's sitting here somewhere.
Unfortunately, I can't help you right now.
He wants to buy a chain.
Actually, I was kidding.
It's been raining all morning.
Why did you refuse to do that?
You're the best teacher in the world.
I'm almost sure Tom can help us.
Show me how to play chess.
What's the headache?
Tell us what Tom was in.
I don't know how Tom got to Australia.
It's not that expensive.
Did you go anywhere today?
You all need to help Toma.
My name's not on the list.
We're staying home.
I was barely jealous of Tom, and he started laughing.
I did it the way we agreed.
Very few can do that.
Do you believe everything you hear?
If you were me, you would have done the same thing.
I couldn't sleep last night.
What are you taking with you?
The first husband Mary died, and the second she divorced.
I can't sleep when the full moon.
It happens quite often.
Where did she study Polish?

It's not Tom on this photograph.
Was it easy for you to do that?
Tom was in the command in Australia.
Where's the bus stopping?
Someone hit me.
Tom loves it hardly.
Can you read me a story?

Put your jacket on.

Tom took the initiative in his own hands.
Thanks for talking to Tom.
It was the best lasania that Tom ever tried.
We'll leave in the morning.

Are they preparing for war?
I think I heard someone calling me.
Guess.
Of course, you can take my pen.
I want to know her name.
I've learned a lot from talking to Tom.
You should have asked me first.
Most of us don't know how to swim.
We don't have absolutely any chance of winning.

I'll do it only if you pay me.
Do you think they'll let us do this?
The teacher put Tom in a corner because he was acting badly.
Did Tom tell you about this?
The soldier died.
Tom goes there every morning.
You're not sacred either.
It's eggs a smile.
We're both scared.
It's hard for me.
We'll start without you.
I don't think it's mine.
We already have one.
It's very dangerous here.
Are you sure you didn't say that?
The beef is usually more expensive than pigs.
Not everyone knows what to do.
I don't like taracans.

She made her effort.
They won't let you do that.

It's not that expensive.
We all love you.
I'm an intermediate tennisman.
Is it true that you don't want to marry Tom anymore?
Answer me, please!
What flowers are you growing in your garden?
I never said she stole the money from me.
Who are you going to sell this to?
It's Tom's nephew.
Add some sugar.
What did Tom give you this time?
Tom, honestly, they're foolish.
Let's meet you next week.
It's very rude to interrupt someone during the conversation.
You'll have to eat this.
Stop comparing Tom to Mary!
I want to put him in place.
There's so much to do!
I'm getting up early almost every day.
Tom died in his bed.
Why didn't you get closer to the entrance?
I was barely jealous, Tom started laughing.
You think that's a drink?
How many students have come?

Did you go to the party yesterday?
I wish I was a Canadian!
Be careful if you're out.
If I were you, I'd change my tyres.
I'm almost late for the train today.
I'd be careful if I were you.
People are very scared.
Why does Tom want to live there?
That's why your name isn't on my list.
You're the best teacher in the world.
Tell him I'm not coming.
There were many people at the meeting yesterday.
I had a bad sleep last night, but I had a good night.
I became a doctor to be able to help people.
I hope you remember that.

Weather has changed.
Mary was in a red dress yesterday.
Would you like a free advice?

I shared my suspicions with Tom.
I need to send Tom a message.
We don't know the results yet.

So this picture didn't like it.
There's nothing ashamed of asking for help.
Why is your method better?
Get them if you can.
Some people say that, others say so.
The rain went three days without a break.
Does Tom have any relatives living in Boston?
When people don't need you anymore, they just throw you out like an old toy.
Did you get it?
I won't talk to Tom anymore.

It doesn't matter the clothes, it's the one she's wearing.
Mary's not my daughter, it's my wife.
Are these shoes good for you?

In your mother's opinion, where are you now?
The window of my room is out of the street.
Tom's cat doesn't respond to the cat meth.
"Well, will you help me?"
We're not busy now.
Tom's probably gonna do it again.
