Stars emit the light and warmth by using the energy produced in the connection (or blinking) of hydrogen atoms to form severe particles.
Scientists try to create a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
However, the solution to this problem will cause many difficulties and many years will pass before a useful nuclear reactor can be constructed.
The steel is drying on the surface of the water because of the voltage on the surface.
The surface tension occurs because water particles on its surface are attracted stronger than water and air particles over them.
The objects such as needles are able to go on the water plate through the invisible shell that the particles form on the surface of the water.
The modern slider beach has two edges divided by a row. Two edges increase the ice attachment, even when they are set below the corner.
The back of the blade is slightly scratched, so when the blade scrolls on one side, the ice-creaming back is also exhausted.
This makes the slipper turns, and when the slippers scroll to the right, the slipper is turning on the right, and if the slippers scroll to the left, the slipper scrolls to the left.
To get back to the previous energy level, they must remove the additional energy obtained from the light.
They're doing it through the emission of a small particle of light called a photon.
This process is defined by scientists as “immulated radiation emissions” because atoms are stimulated by a clear light, which causes the emission of light photons and light is a type of radiation.
The next picture shows atoms emitting photons. Of course, photons are much smaller than this picture.
The photons are even smaller than the particles that form atoms!
Thousands of hours of work cause the lamp in the light to finally burn, and the light stops to shine.
Then it is necessary to exchange a lamp. While switching the lamp, precaution must be maintained.
The light should be disabled or disconnected by the cable first.
It is because the electricity affecting the removal in which the metal part of the lamp is located may seriously affect the inside of the removal or metal base when it is partially in the repair.
The basic body in the circulation system is the heart pumping blood.
The blood is removed from the heart of “conducts ” which are called artery and produced by “conducts” called veins.
Triceratops' teeth could not only absorb leafs but also extremely hard branches and roots.
According to some scientists, the triceratops was eating with sagows, which were typical plants for the creed period.
This plant looks like a small palm with a crown made by sharp, squeezeing leaves.
The strong belt could be useful for the triceratops when he was trying to break the sheets before he went to eat.
Other scientists argue that these plants are very poisonous, so it is not possible that dinosaurs eat them, although today the lazy animals and other animals, such as popes (dinosaurs’ seeds) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
How would gravity force on the Io moon work on me? Stopping on the surface of Io, a man weighs less than on Earth.
A person weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth will weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on the Moon Io. The gravity force is there, of course, much less.
The sun doesn't have a scorch like the Earth on which you can stand. The sun is entirely from gases, fire and plasma.
The gas is diluted as far as it is distant from the middle of the sun.
The outer circle that we see, when we look at the sun, is called photosphere, which literally means “the light ball. ”
The Venus phase, similar to the moon phases, observed about three thousand years later (in 1610) Galileus, and used the telescope for this purpose.
The stages show that the light reaches only one side of Venus (or the moon), the one that is turned to the sun. The Kopernik theory, according to which planets are orbiting around the sun, had its confirmation in Venus phases.
Jeremiah Horrocks, English astronomers, observed the transit of Venus several years later, and exactly in 1639.

After the French campaign, the Germans started with preparations for invasion into Great Britain.
The Germans called the attack “Operation of the Lew of the Sea.” Most of the heavy weapons and resources of the British army were lost during the departure of Dunkierka, so the army was weak.
Nevertheless, the British Navy still exceeded the force of the German Navy (Kriegsmare) and was able to overcome every enemy fleet that would affect the La Manche Channel.
A few ships of the British Navy were on potential invasion routes because the Admirals feared their drowning by the Germans from the air.
Let's begin with explaining about Italy’s plans. Italy was primarily a “mlad brother” of Germany and Japan.
Their army and the Navy were weaker, even though four new ships were built before the war began.

In order to do so, they had to eliminate British bases and ships in Egypt. In addition, the Italian warships had no other tasks.
And now it's time for Japan, and Japan was an island state, just like the United Kingdom.
The subwater vessels are swimming units designed with the thought of a long journey under the water surface.
The submarine ships were used during I and II World Wars, and they were very slow and had limited range of shots.
At the beginning of the war, they traveled mainly on the surface of the sea, but with the development and more precise radar, the submarine ships were forced to go down under the water to avoid discovery.
The German subwater ships were called U-bots, and Germany was perfectly sustained with the navigation and maintenance of subwater ships.
The Germans were successful in using submarine ships, so they did not want to have too much trust after the war.
Yes! King Tutenchamon, sometimes called “King Tut ” or“ The King of the Boy ” is one of the most modernly known kings of ancient Egypt.

Another famous Greek is Pitagoras, a mathematician, known primarily by his famous claim of side relations in the right-angle triangles.
There are various counts about the number of people who use the hindi language. It is estimated that it is between the second and the fourth most common language in the world.
Consideration or exclusion of closely related dialects affects the determination of the total number of national users of the language.
According to the estimated language, 340 to 500 million people are used and up to 800 million can understand it.
In the languages of Hindi and Urdu dictionary is similar, but a letter is different; in daily communication, both users usually can communicate.
Somewhere in the 15th century, northern Estonia was under a very cultural influence of Germany.
Part of the German monks wanted to bring God closer to the local people, so they invented the literal language of Estonian.

To learn to create interactive media, it requires standard and traditional skills and tools known during interactive classes (creating scenarios, editing films and audio recordings, history, etc.).
In order to design interactively, it is necessary to re-evaluate media production assumptions and learn to think non-linearly.
In the interactive project, the elements must connect together, but they must also make sense as a separate whole.
The problem related to the variable firearm is that the complexity and number of elements needed to obtain a specific range of fire distances are much bigger than in the steady firewall.
This is a growing problem because the lenses producers are increasingly increasingly high in their production.
This allows the variable firecraft to make photos with a comparable quality with the one they receive objectives with the firing firing.
Another minus of the variable firearms is the fact that the maximum width (speed) of the objectivity is mostly less.
Therefore, cheaper varieties cause difficulties in lighting if the lightlight is not used.
One of the most frequent problems in converting a film into DVD format is the adjustment of the image size.
The satisfaction of the customers is a key criterion in the production of most TVs.
That's why everything that's on the TV screen had a cut edge down, upstairs and sides.
This is to ensure that the image covers the whole screen. This function is called overscan.
Unfortunately, when creating DVD, its border will also be cut, and if the recordings are too close to the bottom, they will not be fully displayed.
Tours, bankets and knights of the round table for a long time are elements of imagination inspired by the traditional motive of the medium-term castle.
Even standing among thousand - year ruins, you can easily create sounds and smells of long past battles and practically hear the bullshit of copiers in the barn, as well as feelings of fear from the bowls.

Unlike other primary hominides, they no longer use their hand to move, carry loads or move between trees.
The arms and foot of the chimps have similar size and length, which shows that the hand is used to carry the weight of the body when they are based on scratched fingers.
The human hand is shorter than the foot and has more straightened sticks.
The rocky bones of hand before two to three million years ago show how the arm specialization changed from movement to manipulation.
Some say that a frequent call for conscious dreams may lead to exhaustion.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that conscious dreams extend the time between REM phases.
If the lesser phase of paradoxal sleep occurs for the night, the problem becomes a low state frequency in which you actually sleep and your body regenerates.
It's as exhausting as waking up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch TV.
The frequency with which the brain tries to dream consciously during this night has an impact on the effect.

The vision, or the ability to see, depends on the organs of the sense of the eyes, or the eyes.
The building of the eye can be very different in terms of complexity that depends on the requirements of the organism.
Various systems are characterized by different options, sensitive to the different lengths of the wave, and are also different in the degree of vision, and also require different processes to interpret the input data and the appropriate number of organs to function optimally.
The population is called a collection of organisms of one species residing a specific geographical area.

What is the cell? This word comes from the Latin “target ” that means“ a small chamber ” and has been composed by a researcher who was looking at the structure of the corridor under the microscope.
The cell is the primary builder of all living organisms in which at least one cell must be included.
In fact, so fundamental and crucial is the role of cells in life study that they are often called “the elements of life. ”

The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of living organisms.
The source of the “ cells” is the Latin word “cella” that means a small room.
Seeing living creatures under the microscope, you can notice that they are built from small squares or bullets.
Robert Hook, the English biologist, looked at the core under the microscope and saw small squares.
He was the first person who saw dead cells.
The elements and bonds can go from one state to another and not change.
Gas nitrogen still has the same properties as the liquid nitrogen. In the liquid state it is dense, but the particles are identical.
Another example is water consisting of two hydrogen atoms and one oxide atoms.
The molecular structure is identical for gas, liquids and fixed bodies.
Although the state of focus can be changed, the chemical component remains unchanged.
Time is everywhere around us, it affects every action we do, and it is so hard to understand.
For thousands of years, the time is subject to research by scientists, philosophers and theologians.
We experience the time as a period of events coming from the future, through the present, to the past.
Time also serves to compare the duration of events (their lengths in time).
You can select the amount of time on your own by watching the return of a cyclic event, whose characteristic is the regular repeatability.

Methods of solution to problems using different concepts or areas to find a solution called convergence patterns.
This attitude focuses on the speed, logic and precision, as well as the identification of facts, the re-use of available techniques and the collection of information.
The most important element of this way of thinking is: there is only one correct answer. You only take into account two answers — good and bad.
Such reasoning is related to certain science or standard procedures.
Persons of such thinking can think logically, remember patterns, solve problems and scientific tests.
People are the most efficient species about reading in others' minds.
The result is that we can effectively predict what others see and intend to, what they believe, what they know and what they want.
The most important of these skills is the understanding of the intention of others, because it is possible to solve possible misunderstandings resulting from the actions carried out.
