In my view, the literature programme was formed by ladies of the Balsaqi age based on their interests.
From Russian literature in the 19th century, we preferred Daniellevski and Volkonsky.
They wrote the Belletrist, of course, for those same ladies of the Balsaqi age.

Germany: Fourth curve of coronavirus is inevitable
The fourth vaccine will take summer or autumn of 2022.
The expert believes that the current vaccine in Germany will not be final, but will continue with the new force.
Despite the active habitat campaign in Germany, neither two or three doses of vaccine from the coronavirus, it will probably not be sufficient to fully protect.
This is convicted by the leader of the Common Practice Association of Doctors, Ulrich Weigeldt.
Die Welt reported this on Saturday, 11 December.
"We expect the fourth vaccine to take in the summer, the latest of the fall," said the expert.
Furthermore, Weigeld hopes that the fourth vaccine from the coronavirus will be carried out "in combination with the flu vaccine".
This will help to achieve the best results.
Furthermore, the enhanced vaccine can help to combat the spread of the new crown of the Omicron crown.
The new option is extremely dangerous.
So the probability of reinfected Omicronom is three times higher than Delta or Beta.
This is the result of the preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Consequently, producers of BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted to Omikron by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses do not provide sufficient protection against infection by the new option of the Omicron corona virus.
The study of BioNTech and Pfizer showed that at two doses the vaccine is significantly below: “neutralysed potential reduces more than 25 times.”
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against omicron-stamp infections," stressed BioNTech and Pfizer.
It is therefore necessary for the third dose.
Experts insisted on accelerating the vaccination rate in the country.
For example, the Chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, speaks to reduce the interval between the second and third training.
Furthermore, as Salzberger believes, the accelerated vaccine will affect both delta-virus and the omicron variant of the coronavir.
"The experience of Israel shows this very convincingly," stressed the expert.
Wobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 years old.
Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (as with the Kalikana Vib series) is different from the number of other vibes, which was originally created in the light of the use of ice fishing, not only for fishing.
These visions are larger than those nearby analogs, a weight of weight, which undoubtedly affects the nians of the use of these interesting baits.
Another recognised feature is the upper fixed and fixed plastic plate which creates additional vibrations in vertical and horizontal lines.
As a "the winter vib" in the Bet-A-Vib hunt, it shows a pretty aggressive game.
A simple monotone animation is often the most capable, i.e. moving up and down by almost without breaks.
In planning the deviation from the vertical axis, it is not much that it is convenient for catching in limited space, underwater vegetation, corpses and other obstacles for which a trap is possible.
Furthermore, a small deviation is relevant in catching the winter of a boat and a large oak, and especially in the middle of the winter, when a point and aggressive bait is required.
After reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib immediately turns and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is not less than successfully used for winter-hilst-free hunting.
To satisfy its caprisis, you can select from two modifications: with noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib is capable of irritating the passive cheek that does not even react to the nerve.
When hunting back Bet-A-Vib, it demonstrates the distance and precision.
It is understood and not caprisen, combined with woods and tiles even with large diameters.
For catching back the rats, the bowl, the ersha or the oak, except for the equilibrium, and the "step" sometimes with "cherking" at the bottom.
If you're catching in the landscapes, you can change the front triple into a double, which will reduce the probability of traps.
Bet-A-Vib's baits are among the most sustainable in work and, as a result, one of the most capable.
The same success can be used in relatively small and pretty deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36.

Seven thousand Russian mercenaries were claimed in Libya
In Libya there are more than 7,000 private military mercenaries (CWC) Wagner.
The Chairman of the Supreme Public Council of the Republic of Khaled al-Mistry said this on Sunday, 12 December.
"Now in Libya there are more than 7,000 HWC mercenaries Wagner.
They also have planes.
They also roy tranchees in Sirta and Kufra.
They have 30 reactive aircraft on the Gardabia Airlines (i.e. as a civil airport in Syrte)”, said the Anadolu Agency.
Khaled al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries are " trying to capture" the central part of Libya, which stretches from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "to lead their people to power" in the Central African Republic.
Save Presentation
In the opinion of the interviewer, Moscow was looking for a country to preserve its presence in North Africa and to " sit in Libya".
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using the Aviabaza and the port in Sirta, as well as the Aviabaza in Jufre, is noted in the publication of the agency.
The Russian authorities have officially denyed that the CHWC Wagner is using Kremlin support.
Where else can mercenaries be
According to the Agency, Wagner is allegedly operating in nine countries of Africa - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's daughters receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of useful digested and natural resources, as well as weapons, technologies and military services in those countries,” the article states.
According to the media, "vagners" seemed to have been fighting in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
The group is not included in force offices or in the registry of yurlitz, and its fighters are not available in the formary lists of personality.
This company is under United States sanctions.
Recall, previously, 27 EU countries approved the restrictions against Wagner.
The Council of the European Union is expected to adopt this decision on 13 December.
Situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya de facto is the second parliamentary parliament with consultative functions with the dominant Islamist, TASS wrote.
The body has repeatedly called for a single day of vote on the election of parliamentary representatives and heads of the State from 24 December to at least February 2022.
"The election remains less than two weeks, and the chances that they will pass in time are rapidly reduced," the material notes.
On this basis, the High Electoral Commission of Libya postponed an undetermined announcement of the final list of candidates, transmitted by the Sky News Arabia television.
External policy with the Russian eyes
38 per cent of the Russians see more success in foreign policy than the failure, 29 per cent believe that they are failing.
"The examples of success -- "in Syria have protected, restored the world there, "recognition by the Northern Stream-2," "the whole world was frightened by that cool weapon," "The Crime We Refused".
The main failures are “conflict with Ukraine, “confrontation with Western countries”, “isolation from the world”, stated in the Study of the Public Opinion Fund.
The Government of Dubai has completely renounced the paperwork; all the servants also have become digital
The Government of Dubai reported that the full refusal of paper production and the transition to digital technologies was rejected.
All public services to the population will also be e-mailed.
This is reported by the WAM Emirates Information Agency.
"Today, the new phase of digitalization of all aspects of Dubai's life was marked -- we have completed the transition to the entire non-payable Government," said the Emirata Prince, Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, Shaich Hamdan Ban Muhammed Ben Rashid Al Mactum, on Saturday.
The internal and external documentation will now be carried out in all Dubai states only digitally through special information platforms.
Innovation has affected everything without exception of the industry: health, JCCH, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc., many commercial structures also joined the Government's initiative.
The transition to the electronic Government and digitalization of the documentation began in Dubai since 2018.
During that time, as the authorities estimated, 336 million paper sheets were saved, which is 14 million hours of human work and 353,8 million dollars in monetary equivalent.
Previously, Mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobinin, stated that electronic services would be equipped to citizens on 2 days a year.

Turkey's production and export of cars fell below the 2020 level
Turkey's production and exports of cars were sharply reduced in November on the basis of devaluation of lira.
As a result, the 11-month industrial indicators have been worse than last year, Bloomberg reported in reference to the Association of Automotive Producers of Turkey.
According to the association, 115 thousand cars were released in Turkey in November, which was 20 per cent less than a year earlier.
A number of 75.9.9 vehicles have been sent to export, which is more than 25 per cent of the last year's indicator.
And if Turkey's car sector showed positive dynamics by the end of the first 10 months of this year, it was already 0.3 per cent worse than last year.
The result of such decline was a sharp decline in Turkish lira course, which reached 29 per cent in November in relation to the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 IAS subjects received credit payments in 2021
The first Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov told the situation on the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized business, transmitted by MiA Correspondent " Kasinform " .
" On the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the regulation and development of the financial market, in the present year, the Chief of the State of 1 April 2021 order was adopted by the Chairman of the Agency of 9 April 2021, "On the approval of the provision of a provision of payments for loans of small and medium-sized enterprises," Alihan Smailov wrote in his reply to the deputy request.
He recalled that the provision of receipt of loan payments provided for banks and micro-financial organizations, the delay of credit payments issued before 1 April 2021 to IFRs, including IP, for the period from 1 April to 30 June 2021.
The period of delay was between 30 and 90 days for the choice of an IAS subject.
The borrower could have indicated a different period of delay.
During the period of delay with respect to the borrower, the claim-requiring work was suspended, the notification of the need for expiry of debt, as well as the receipt by the creditor of the commissions and other payments," he noted.
For 2021, the second-level banks received requests for the receipt of loan payments of 603 MDG borrowers, of which 553 MDG subjects were deferred to 9.7 billion tenges.
In the IFRS, they filed requests for the postponing of 131 ISB subject, of which the delay was granted to 95 subjects of the amount of 105.8 million tenges," concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonolog Purasev assumed that people with weak immunity could easily carry out the ocmiron type.
The doctor assumed that people with a weak immunity could carry it easier than those with strong body protection reaction
Pulmonologist Sergei Purasev explained why the crown-virus can be dangerous.
The reason why it is necessary to be searched in the conditions of virus fertility.
Scientists believe that Omiron was born in the body of infected HIV or suffering from immunodeficiencies.
I mean, in mutation, he had no resistance against immunity.
This makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no immunity response, it became very quick.
Apparently, he has these spike proteins, the spikes, more than it is supposed to have, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, commented the pulmonologist Sergei Purasev.
The doctor assumed that people with a weak immunity could handle ocmiron easier than those who have strong body protection reactions.
Turns out that the strong response of the body to anything, any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
That's what happens when a 30-year-old infection dies, and the 60-year-olds are carrying it.
The immunity reply from a young man is completely inadequate: where it could only be threatened with a finger, he beats like a rifle to the worms, Sergei Purasev concluded.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous side phenomena and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
The lights are bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, only symptoms can be purchased -- all the hope of the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of the intoxication of the body -- temperature, weakness, illness.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficult breathing, throat firstness, cough.
Right or left, abdominal pains can also demonstrate the development problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, until the end of the year, they can start vaccinating a growing generation from 12 to 18 years.
Virusologist, head of the IFTI genome engineering lab, Paul Volchkov noted that this category was very actively affected by quid.
Adolescents who go to school have a maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socio-activated crop, as well as children's instructions, said Paul Volchkov, the virusologist, the head of the IFTI genome engineering lab.
The most grateful to the author for this article.
I'd love to refresh the memories...
Theath-in.
In those seventy-eights, no dance savings were held without the melodies of the group.
And at home, as they gathered with their friends, dancing under their music.
Immunologists embarrassed the hypothesis why people with abundance become victims of quid
The authors studied the fat tissue remaining from bariatrial operations, and found that fat cells known as adypocites may be infected by coronavirus.
The immune cells located in fat tissue, macrophages, have also been infected, showing a strong reaction.
Scientists also studied the fat tissue of patients who died from quid, and found particles of coronavirus in fat surrounded by different organs.
It is known that HIV and flu viruss can be hidden in fat tissue by using it as a tank to avoid the immune system response.
Probably SARS-COV-2 is capable of this.
Biologist told the reasons for dementation
The biological candidate of Semen Golowaykin referred to the causes of demention and told the way it prevented radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is demonstrated by a gradual loss of cognitive functions, and with time a person is hardly oriented even in the familiar environment.
Golowaykin noted that the demention was mostly caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic violations and lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of illness development.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high contents of cholesterol, fatty, depression and alcoholism.
At the behaviour level, the role of factors such as social isolation and the lack of active cognitive activity," he said.
Dementation has also affected smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep violations and low-motive lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted the forgetty, inability to concentrate and reduce abstract thinking.
"The debate is that the loss of hearing may be both the early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risks of its occurrence," added biologist.
In order to prevent the occurrence of WHO disease, it recommends that we support the necessary level of physical loading, to train cognitive skills and skills that require memory and logic.
Previously, the Professor of the Neurology, neurosurgery and medical genetics of FGAOU in the RNIM.
N.I. Pirogova, head of the Cognitive Distortion Division of the Federal brain Centre and neurotechnology, Anna Bogolepova told the causes of memory.
Egypt returned about 30,000 illegally extracted from the country of artefacts
In the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has been able to return about 30,000 artifacts that have been illegally exported from the country by smuggling.
This was reported on Saturday, 11 December, in the broadcast of Al-Hayat, the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Tourism and Ancients of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Hauad.
Since 2011, 29,300 artefacts have been restored to the Egyptian State.
Only this year, 5300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered in the Bible Museum in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gauad stated that all the smuggling artifacts were registered in the archives.
Officers of the Department are currently working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts are tracking world auctions and sales online through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that cultural values were restored and then exhibited in museums.
He said that one of the returned artifacts had been discovered in Belgium a ancient human skeleton, which is now part of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities requested Interpol to help find the auction of Pharaoh Tutanhamon.
The Christie's auction house held trades on 4 July, where more than 3,000 years of age was sold for $5,97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused displeasure from Egypt.
The Egyptian party also claims that the art was illegally removed from the Carnack temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutanhamon, represented by the god of the sun of Amon, was kept in private collection and has not been traded since 1985.
How the reliquium came to Europe, unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has actively pursued repatriation of illegally expelled from the country at different times of ancient monuments.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of the smuggling ancients are the result of the archaeological findings of black runners.
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account," and that is correct, because Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are a self-employed people (climate to Turks).
If you want to add, only 42,000 people - so many tatars (Kainans) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate nation, and the name of this people is two words!
Only a Turkish language group combines them together.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal staff mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its staff to provide access to their personal mobile devices, says Financial Times.
The fact is, in Europe and the United States, the Swiss Bank does not provide corporate communication devices to its staff, instead of offering to acquire a mobile phone or smartphone with a telecommunications partner.
Under existing rules, the bank may review the information on corporate devices issued to its staff, as they are used to address business issues with colleagues or clients.
The Bank uses the right to verify mobile devices in extreme cases, for example, if the staff member used it to meet a client who was not approved by the credit Suisse.
Now that many staff have moved to a remote mode, the bank wishes to extend this rule to all the devices used to deal with work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's leadership has established a deadline to which staff can learn the new rule.
The information on the new requirement has not been commented officially in the credit Suisse.

Part 4
The last year of life, Sergei Esenin, 1925, was productive in creativity, but the harder for the earth’s existence of the poet and his ego.
He was already out of any literary association, swallowed with imaginism, but he was famous, famous, sometimes strongly criticized, even evil, but the reader is ready to wear it in his hands.
Over 60 poems were written over a year, many of them are real works, a cycle of Persid motives completed, the poem of Anna Snow was published by 8 books, the compilation of the Russian Soviet.
In the end of June 25, the State party concluded a treaty with Esen to issue its compositions in three volumes.
None of the modern Sergei Alexandrovich poets have received such honor, he is the first!
In addition, it was very good money - $1,000 rubles per month (for example, the factory director received 300 rubs per month, 200 engineer).
The funds that year were needed more than ever.
Assenin married the granddaughter of Lev Tolsto Sophie Tolsta, the family was needed to be equipped, to keep sisters Katja and Sasha, as well as mother.
It would have been a good time for life, but it has been decorated mostly in dark tones, as if the black man's song was materialized (written in November 1925 and published since the death of the Esen):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very ill.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Does that wind whistle?
Over the empty and inhuman field,
As I grow in September,
It sucks the brains of alcohol.
Many familiars noted that Esenin had been handed down, looked bad, apparently sick.
It's frequently repeated, nervous breaks.
And the reason it's probably not just in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis is alcoholism, Sergei Aleksandrovich has been treated with someone, there are no reliable documents.
Let's say that in May 1923, when Esenin insisted on the fourth wife, the American Icedora Duncan corrected his health in Paris's clinic with Professor Petra Hanuskina (the basis to it will fall two years later in Moscow).
The evidence of the poet, the scandals on that ground, the milition excessively dissolved on dozens of memoars.
Since the early 20s, the scary novel of a poet with a green snake has been rapidly developed.
At the end of summer of 1923, Esenin settled for a short time with a friend, imaginist Ivan Starcev.
It is surprising, but in his very good income, he never had his housing in Moscow or Peter, he was in housing apartments, hotels or familiar people.
The old men remember:
"I only came to sleep, and in most cases, in an inconvenient, drunk state.
Once at 4:00 A.M., Esenin fell on the staircase...
When he fell, he scratched his face and screamed.
When he came a little bit in himself, he began coughing, scratching all the sheep with blood..."
Yes, even after the European and U.S. voyage (the states had been dry, but Duncan accepted a suitable alcoholic stock) admitted:
"I didn't see there anything but the cabbages and the streets...
I've ended up, and I've stopped forgetting people...
Well, and a drink, of course...
And I was drinking because the torment was bite."

Mathras Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom 100x195
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econome is a contemporary performance of the budgetary model in a premium-class-line.
The foundation of the mattress is a block of independent double springs of Duet.
The large spring has been inserted with a lighter mild spring of small size.
This allows equally to distribute the load to the madrac.
On two sides, the mattress is supplemented by an artificial latex.
It's like a natural latex, but it's more dense and less expensive.
The flexibility and tension of this material increases the comfortable effect of the madrac.
The artificial lattex is hypoalergic, it does not use moisture and dust.
The mattress will be perfectly fit to a couple with a great difference in weight (30 pounds).
With the "smart" springs, there is no wave effect when a light partner slides on the side of a heavy one.
A pleasant, soft squirrel from a practical jackcard Sense will swing a layer of syntepone.
Natural tissue does not accumulate static electricity.
This mattress model may be produced in a converted version (vacuum roll-package).

And he loves as Lermonts wrote, "the strange love."
Why did the girl cry at the examination when she didn't fail?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it wasn't school?

In Europe, readiness has been announced and further enlarged restrictive measures against the Republic, “if the situation in the country has not improved”.
Minsk responded to the food embargo on a wide list of goods from countries that had previously decided to initiate sanctions against Belarus.

"Not in Shadow hat," when a scarf jacket makes a man a laughter
In the world events of 2021, barchat jackets were dominated.
Daniel Craig was probably the first one who declared his new fashion decision.
In September, he appeared at the "No time to Die" film premiere in a little maline jacket and a traditional "bondow" butterfly.
The Earthshot Prize was followed twice by Prince William, who first put on the eco-prize ceremony of the Earthshot Prize, incompatible with the Royal Variety's royal code, and then chose a more classical option for the event in support of the Royal Variety charity fund.
A few weeks ago, the trend was based on himself and Lionel Messiah.
The footballist came to pick up the seventh Goldball in the Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for male coats in Russia.
According to the analysts of the services entered in The Gazet.Ru, they were purchased 1.4 times more.
The most popular warm bargain jackets with a syrup and the main colors are dark beaches, boarding, dark blue, and, of course, black.
The average price of these models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubs, while men prefer to buy only jackets, which they choose rarely.
You can buy them not only from online rhylers.
Budget options are in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
The segment of the loux jackets from the barchat in this season represents practically in all brands - and Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which one of the premieres of the House Gucci film was made by Ambassador Jared Leto.
By choosing the jackets of expensive marks, you can be sure that the barchat is made of helmet.
The special technique of witching makes a thick tissue with a vorst external texture and a smooth internal side.
More budgetary options are made of patch or polyamide, but they are also less.
The fashionary expert of Lamoda Elia Vahoshkin warns that, in the case of a bargain jacket, the main thing is not his model or fascon, but the compatibility.
"Barchat requires evening light, so this jacket is perfect if you're gathered for a party or a feast event," explains Vahoskin. - It will also be appropriate for those cases if the invitation code of Black Tie or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion that compliance allows to make choices in favour of a barchat jacket is his buyer's status.
"The man in the bargain jacket, first, should have a proper advanced party with sufficient resources," say the Telegram channel authors on the man's fashion, "Beauty Brammel." - The handlers of the bargain jackets are usually part of the cost of those people who are rarely buying tickets.
They are simply invited to attend the world’s activities, where the drescode is always specified.
Illia Vahoshkin suggests combining a jacket from the barchat with the same sort of things: classic pants with arrows, one-tonne shirts, silk necklaces, fibers, wrists.
Too simple and daily things will look inappropriate.
Fashion experts from Brammel's Beautiful Expert are sure that the appearance of a soldier's corporate corporate corporation jacket would be inappropriate, and that is, if it's a "management of those who run this event, yes, it's the thing to him."
If the employee is lower and his goal is to move up in a complex hierarchy of the company or to slap financial bonuss, it is better not to wear a jacket.
The leadership will certainly appreciate the expression "not by the Shadow hat," according to the Telegram channel editors on male fashion.
Very unequivocated feelings of voice.
It's an unnatural temperament, so exhausted.
And she's totally not associated with a nice young girl's face.
Honestly, I don't understand the admiration of the neighborhood.
But I wish you good luck in my life!
It's all about money -- alternative energy is lobbying well, so it's paying.

I didn't see any beautiful man in the pictures in the article.
Just medium-statistical intermediaries.
Perhaps if such characters are so sure of their beauty that they decide to show it all over the car, they will probably not sit there.
But only because of the mental disorder and the ignorance of such "beautiful" people, but certainly not because of their appearance.

The Pfizer vaccine was considered 32 times less effective than omicron-stamp
The effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the omicron coronavirus stamp 32 times below compared to other types of disease.
This is the conclusion of scientists from the University of Hong Kong and China University of Hong Kong, according to South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective on the basis of a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of COVID-19.
"We see that most people had a high level of anti-viral activity against the original option Sars-CoV-2, but that ability was significantly reduced against omicron diversity," said Professor Malik Paris.
Scientists stressed, however, that the vaccine remains the most reliable way to protect from severe disease infections with coronavirus.
The former scholars of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account its impact on the omicron stamma.
Researchers concluded that the omicron stams could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increase mortality unless further measures were taken.
The head of Ukraine's mino defense accused the FRG of blocking NATO weapons delivery in Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Alex Reznikov, accused the Government of the former Chancellor of FRG, Angela Merkel, of the acquisition by Kiev of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times, on 12 December, Reznikov recalled that Germany had made a veto for procurement by Ukraine of anti-snaper systems and guns to defeat drones last month.
It is noted that Berlin later mitigated his position on rifles by recognizing them with immortal weapons.
In approval of the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to acquire the above-mentioned weapons under bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, it is United States, Britain, Lithuania and France.
In the meantime, FT notes that the position of the new German Government under the leadership of the Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the authorization of arms delivery to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier Sunday, Ukraine's Ambassador in Germany, Andrew Melnik, expressed the view that Kiev should not wait for arms delivery from Berlin at Chancellor Sholz.
He said that the previous leadership of the FRG explained its refusal to provide arms with the risk of the development of a military escalation of conflict in Donbass despite the “occupation of Russia” of the Ukrainian territory.
The same " non-sensitive" position, the diplomat, Germany will be preserved at the new Chancellor.
In August, the Ukrainian leader Vladimir Greenski stated that Kiev was expecting assistance from Berlin to equip the marine fleet.
In Ukraine, Germany is expected to " be a technical partner of Ukraine," added the President.
It was also noted that on the spring of the year, the Co-Chairman of the Green Party, Robert Habek, visited the Republic where he spoke to sell Kiev defence weapons.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

They were disclosed by information security experts in the interview with RBC.

Sholz arrived in Poland to discuss the Northern Stream-2 and EU legislation
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Shaltz, arrived in Warsaw for negotiations with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judicial authorities in Poland, the rising of Russian troops at Ukraine's borders and the situation with the Russian Gas Guide-2.
Although Shaltz claimed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed the unequivocal expectations from each other.
Poland Prime Minister Mateus Moraevski stated that he would invite Shaltz to speak against the Northern Stream-2, by which the Russian gas would be delivered to Germany in the circulation of Ukraine.
In the view of Moravech, Russia can use the gasproof against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to reach a country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that Warsaw and Brussels would be helpful to address the crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court has punished Poland and decided that judicial reforms carried out by the right party " Right and Justice " violated the EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay penalties, and her Supreme Court decided that national legislation had priority over EU rules.
The new German Government, which was made to the wednesday, despite the requirements of Poland and the United States, has not taken public obligations to stop the work of the Northern Stream-2 in the event of Russia's invasion into Ukraine.
American officials stated to members of the Congress that they had reached understanding with Germany on the stop of the gas pipeline if Russia had invaded Ukraine, a high-level staff member of the United States Congress reported on Tuesday.
The German officials did not confirm these reports, but Shaltz warned on the consequences on Wednesday if Russia violated Ukraine's border, and the position was confirmed by the representatives of the Great Seven on Sunday.

Our money in the church wall will pay $20,000.
The Santechnician who found the money in the church wall in the American state of Texas will be paid for a reward.
This is reported in the press release of the non-commercial Crime Stoppers of Houston.

In November 2021, the Santechnical Justin Cowley repaired one of the church toilets and found thousands of cash and checks in the heat.
He handed over the foundation of the church, and he said he did not even receive thanks from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you've done and what you could do," the KPRC-TV quotes it.
Apparently, the findings were related to theft that happened in the Lakewood church seven years ago.
At that time, about $200,000 were missing in cash and $40,000 in the form of checks stored in the church safe.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer loss.

Opened full protection scheme from COVID-19
Virusologist, doctor of medical science, deserved Russian science worker Anatoli Altstein in conversation with Ura.ru, has discovered a full protection scheme against coronavirus infection.
He said that this could be achieved by injection and use of a nazal vaccine.
In the internatal application, there is a large number of immunoglobulin A. There is no vaccine in injection.
Immunoglobulins A protect the slippery shell, so the virus can't get into the body.
Inside after the vaccine, we have the most immunoglobulins of G (antitel).
And if you enter both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is not yet a double vaccine solution," said the doctor.

WHO found "micron" already in six dozens of States
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the new crown of the micron has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts already say that the distribution of the new species may have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of dissemination of the image was reported in the WHO report.
According to the organization on 9 December, the stamp has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is because it has only started to spread actively from the end of November.
WHO also expresses concern at the high rate of the spread of the new crownvirus version.
WHO experts are concerned that the new preliminary stamp could go through the distribution of delta species, and it is the Indian version of the coronavirus, which is now in all countries without exception.
Before that, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhan Hebreius, stated that the omicron stams had a significant impact on the pandemic of the coronavirus.
Similar conclusions were made in Britain.
The experts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the "micron" will expel the delta in the next months.
The number of people in Britain will only be about 1 million, which is officially a micronom in the realm of the Kingdom is a number of hundreds of people, and up to 10,000 in the estimates.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the micron image, and more than 2,000 people will be taken to the hospital on the peak daily.
What the British health system will not be able to handle.
The situation is complicated that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the micron shape 32 times below compared to other types of disease.
As the "micron" responds to the Russian Satellite V, it will be clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamalei Centre has only approached the Russian vaccine test on the micron.

How many hidden sugars in common foods?
Sugar is not the best source of useful nutrients.
Its excess in the ratio may lead to diabetes of the second type, as well as to heart and oncological diseases.
The users should be taken into account that, under the unknown word of the product, a concealed sugar, a similar calority sugar, composition and a glykemic index can be indicated.
A few dozen names, in fact, can be presented on the label.
One of the most common and frequent names is glucose and fruit.
Other sugars such as dexstrosis (corn sugar), leulose (fructural sugar), melass (black duck), agawa cheese, etc.
These are all simple carbons that relate to mono and disharides, and they may be not only in the candidates but also in the ketchup, in a doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
The most effective way to reduce the consumption of sugar is to use targets and non-processed products as well as to pay attention to the label and many different names of sugar.
Various types of sugar differ from taste, but whatever the ingredient is called in the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white, it remains sugar.
The exact amount of sugar is difficult to calculate, as not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also that vegetables, fruits, etc. are initially included in certain amounts of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar can be much higher than the label.

I mean, they are able to act against air facilities, against other drones.
Even against the pilot aircraft.
There will be Ukrainian engines and other Turkish aircraft: corps and so on,” he quotes.ua.
While commenting on the main features of ANKA machines, Arestovich said that it was a reactive but not a poor BPLA.
He said that this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceeds its "with all characteristics".
The first BPLA party must be produced by a factory at the end of the next year, concluded the Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was established by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of a drone was held by Turkey's authorities in collaboration with a number of private companies since 2010.
The Ukrainian General Headquarters had previously secreted data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile complexes during joint force operations in Donbass.
On 6 December, the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, reported that the construction of a modern military drone plant in the country began.
He said that Ukraine intends to use drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Savunma and Ukrainian mino defenses concluded an agreement on the construction of the centre in Kiev, in which staff training will be conducted, as well as the testing and service of Turkish BPLA Bayraktar.
The press office of the Ukrainian leader referred to this memorandum as “great step forward”.
Two lions fled at the airport from the container
In the Singapore airport, the lions fled.
The Straits Times reports on this.
Two predators were able to get out of the container with a family of lions arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown, from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the fugitive lions lied on the roof of the container.
The beasts were not able to retire from him because of a close to the protective network.
The opposition ended after the arrival of staff in Mandai Wildlife Group, known by all Singapore Zoo.
They took the lions through the drotics with the tranquilizer and planned to deliver them to the quarantine.
Previously reported that in Pnompen, the capital of Cambodia, the lion fled the master and walked the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast came home voluntarily, and people were not hurt.
Specialists warned about the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies indicate that the excess of vitamin B9, also known as foil acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express issue was warned about this.
Professors believe that there are strong evidence that people who do not experience failing foil acids are less risked to disease with certain types of cancer, in particular colorful.
However, excess of the necessary dose contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, Beth Kitchin, dietologist, advises to monitor the amount of foil acid consumed during the day.
The optimum dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer is only raised if it is significantly distracted from this digit to a large or smaller side.
Kitchin recommends not to take vitamin B9 in tablets without doctor's recommendation, to monitor the dose and avoid milk peanuts and other foodstuffs containing foil acid.
Previously, Rachel Fine's nutrition consultant called a foil acid, which slows the age.
Since it was in the avocado, Fine recommended that men have more fruit after 50 years.
In Britain to April, about 75,000 people may die because of the omicron stamp.
The prognosis of British scientists show that the dissemination of the omicron coronavirus stamp in the next five months in England may result in up to 75,000 people, unless limiting winter measures are exhausted.
The The Guardian has reported this with reference to the research of experts in the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS transmitted.
According to the most optimistic prognosis of professionals composed of the Scientific and Emergency Consultative Unit in the British Ministerial Office, by April 2022, at least 25,000 surveys will be detected in the country because of the omicron stamp and all of them will be hospitalized by about 175,000 patients.
The hospitals will take over 2,000 infected daily at the peak of disease.
"The serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be required to prevent the overload of the National Health Service if the omicron stamps are more infectious than the delta option and the active vaccines can't exclude the infection," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM.
Previously, the British Health Agency has informed the United Kingdom that if the proliferation of omicron stamps remains at the current level, at the end of the year, there will be approximately 1 million infections in the country.
By mid-December, the omicron can become a dominant in the United Kingdom.
Currently, 1898 cases of omicron-virus infections were discovered in Britain, of which 633 were discovered in recent days.
However, the head of the British Mindwell, Sadhid Javid, on 9 December, indicated that this indicator could already reach 10,000 cases.

The demand for superyats has grown in the world for a quarter
This year, the construction of superiority and the orders for the next year are hit by all the records in the world, despite the calls for reducing carbon trail and combating climate change.
In the world registry, the number of ordered boats was 1200 - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of combating the effects of climate change for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a swimming fortress of $50 million and above will not be reduced, says Gardian.
However, they are increasingly increasing.
This year, 25 per cent of the vessels were ordered more than in the previous year.
The brokers say that the market was not 20 years old.
The first reason is that many who can afford a boat are afraid of land infection and prefer to hide from the pandemic on their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If all these people went to the office before and met with business partners personally, the absolute majority of them are now working remotely, and the negotiations are being conducted by zuma.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that the verphs are taking orders for new boats for 2025 and later.
This means that the customers are willing to pay more, only if their boats were prepared for at least a year or two earlier.
"The people just want freedom, and the super rich could afford it," he said.
In the western society, many criticize such behaviour of rich people and call it Decadent.
Wealthy sociologists do not want to realize that during deprivation of space, living on the yachts or flights on their own planes cause a social irritation because the elite does not want to share the responsibility for climate change with all the rest of mankind.
Economists call for action by Governments and suggest new taxes and rules for superbohaters, although they realize that, with such money mobility, it would be extremely difficult.
In the meantime, it only impresses the number of super-heats ordered but also their characteristics.
Of 1200 vessels, 27 have a length of feed above 100 meters.
The Norwegian billionaire of Recca builds a boat of REV Ocean long 183 meters.
It'll be the biggest yacht in the world.
In the yacht, the moon pool is set up as well as a submarine boat designed to study sea depths.
The existing super-eats were common for helicopters, movies under the open sky, and some of them, such as MacGregor's boats, were a platform for unity. Professor of American University Economic Anthropology in Indiana Richard Wilk said that compared to the total number of greenhouse gases, carbon trails produced by super-rich, are small.
But it is symbolic if it takes into account that multi-millioners in the world are almost 2,000.
It is just another example of overuse of a very few people.
Scientists have discovered that the emission trail of billions is a thousand times more than a medium statistical inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces a average of 5 tonnes of CO2 per year, Roman Abramovic is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases in 2018.
The two thirds of the emission trails were on its boat Eclipse length of 162,5 metres.
Even if the owner is out of the boat, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner may call the captain and give the team a ship, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea in Caribbean.
The superyat owners do not cause compassion for other people when they, as the richest woman in Australia, Gina Reinhardt, who owns mines on the continent, complain through YouTube that their giant ships are not available for ports.
It is also difficult to understand its call to build marines for ships of 50 meters.
Determined a dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to the development of the cancer of the worm
American scientists have identified the risk of cancer development a week.
This is the edition of Daily Express.
The experts concluded that the use of four and more alcoholic drinks a week had an increased risk of oncology development.
However, the probability of disease is increasing with an increase in the number of alcoholic consumption.
Furthermore, moderately drinking men have the risk of a cancer higher than women.
The exact reason for this type of oncology cannot be identified by scientists, noting only that certain factors lead to a destructive for the process.

Dogs can understand the words and phrases at the level of two-year child
Many, more specifically, dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very smart.
But they don't even know how many four-legged pets are actually developed.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to be sure to know how intellectual intelligence is developed.
Although the dog’s vocabulary is not as wide as human, the new study proves that the dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The work of scientists was published in Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or compile poems, do not make sense in politics, economy and art, while they often fail to cheat their masters.
Some gender representatives, believe experts, show better results in the understanding of the words of the human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are not yet sufficient.
Thus, some species are traditionally seen as dog genius, for example labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and they do not give up to a two - year - old child.

United States and Russia are prepared in Ukraine for trade
The United States and Russia will “trade” on the entry of Ukraine into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov stated in its article for the publication of “Glavred”.
In his view, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations on the guarantees of the United States that Ukraine will not enter the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Bayden on the right of countries to " enter anywhere".
If you are invited to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you don't want to trade, but just send the suggestor.
The analyst wrote that trade is intended for Ukraine.
Kochetkov added that Russia is not planning to attack Ukraine, but aimed at dialogue with Kiev.
"The preparations are being conducted secretly, quickly and immediately, and not to wait for the grouping to be detected and deployed by the opposition forces," he noted.
China stimulates the development of rail transport sector
The best Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries to the China International Exhibition of Railway Transport and Equipment in 2021, which was held in the city of Jujou of Junan /Central China/.
The main technologies developed by the CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically identify and diagnostic technical failures, said the representative of Hou Chwaven.
High-speed trains in China-Laos railway, which had been introduced in early this month, have already been equipped with data technology, which would ensure the increased reliability and capacity of the mobile component.
In the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of railway vehicles and many Asia and Europe are witnessed by “Chinese speed”.
In May this year, the CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd, the first two-stairs rapid railways developed in China, for exports to Europe, were collected from the production line of the CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co.
With the maximum working speed of 200 miles per hour, these trains will go on railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
The metro train, developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey, began to be tested in November.
The train will be moving through the metropolitan connecting Centre of Istanbul to the airport of the city.
The metro line will be opened next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with 120 miles an hour.
"The Chinese rail transport equipment industry is one of the highest innovation sectors and the strongest international innovative competitiveness," said Fen Jaosian, head of the Chinese Trade and Investment Department of Promoting International Trade /CRCMT/.
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese high-class equipment in the world market," said Fen Jaosian.
After more than 60 years of hard work, while conducting a number of independent research and developments, China has created a advanced railway equipment system, full subsidiary complex and large-scale production.
According to Fen Yaosian, the country takes the first place on the level of electricity of railways and on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist listed early signs of dementation
The biological science candidate Semen Golowaykin, in the interview with the Sputnik radio, listed early signs of demention.
He said that the signs of future demention could be forgetty, as well as a number of moderate cognitive violations, such as the inability to concentrate, planning, the reduction of abstract thinking.
The debate is currently discussed that the loss of hearing could be both the early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors of its emergence, said the expert.
Gologuekin emphasized that the causes of dementation may be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic violations, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s disease and aterosclerosis of brain vessels are the most common causes of the syndrome.
The biologist noted that the healthcare today did not know effective ways to treat demention.
It is therefore necessary to begin its prevention in time.
He said that reducing the risk of demention development would help learn foreign languages and active communication.
WHO also recommends that the moderate level of physical loads be maintained, regularly trained cognitive skills through games and hobbys that require intense memory inclusion and logic of thinking
"There are recommendations on the application of various BADAs, but their efficiency and suitableness are still discussed in the scientific community," said Holowaykin.
"The World Health Organization recommends the maintenance of a moderate level of physical load, regular training of cognitive skills and skills through games and hobbys that require intense memory and logic of thinking," said Holowaykin.
Previously, the charitable organization in Great Britain stated that the disease was increasingly affected by people aged 40 years.
Medicines called the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered to be the problem of vision, which causes the patient to acquire difficulties in recognition of objects.
Another sign of the developing weakness has been called the aphasia - the condition where a person cannot find the right words to transmit what he wants to say.
Neurologist demanded to send Saacashvili to abroad treatment
Former President of Georgia, Michael Sakashvili, needs psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation outside, stated the journalists, Otar Toid, who belongs to the consilium of doctors established at the Ombudsman of Georgia.
His [Sakashwili] neurologic status is leading to his disease.
Stabilized problems are movement, coordination, nature variety," said the expert, noting that this is not beyond the regulatory framework, and the ex-President is now required to be sent to special rehabilitation.
"It is called neuroreabilitation and mental rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia," said Toidie, demanding that Saacashvili be treated in a special institution that is not available in Georgia.
At the evening of 7 December, Saacashvili began to sabotage medical assistance after the prison staff were punished by disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician has quickly revoked the penalty and renewed himself in previous rights.

Spain had protests against COVID passports
In the Spanish towns of Barcelona and Valencia, protests against the mandatory vaccine certificate from COVID-19, the Agency Europe Press transmits.
In the Catalonic capital, the number of shareholders was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, COVID-passports were required to go to bars, restaurants, sports rooms, older and night entertainment facilities.
Many maniphestans have come to an action without masks.
They accused the State of totalitarism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also need more than 50 people to enter entering entertainment and restaurants.
The opposition in this city claimed medical dictatorship, and the vaccine was called an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infected have been identified since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia is also planning to introduce restrictions for non-vaccinated persons.
The QR Codes Acts introduced the Government to the State on 12 November.
The Russians are expected to be able to visit the sites of mass activities, cultural institutions, public nutrition facilities and retail trade with either a certificate of training or transmitted disease or vaccine.
The same rules will be set for trains and aircraft travels.

Cool rise: how Chinese become miners
Olympiada should attract millions of people to the slope and help to create international courts in the country
China hoped that the Olympiada would not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which would enable the President C-Zingpine to gather one trillon of Yuanas, but would also facilitate the economic development of remote provinces.
Taivo's mountainshore in Zimous Olympic Games in Chungzjako becomes increasingly popular for Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, there are also work on greening: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 mountains in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to accept international competitions.
There are problems with snow in many regions of China, where they are located, including in Chungzjako.
The main challenge for the long-term perspective is to ensure a comfortable and interesting rest in the Chinese departments so that all new ones become ever.
Nevertheless, it is far before.
The Adviser for Games Justin Downes said that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed until unrecognized.
In the winter of the slope, more Chinese are being sent to the slope every year.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite serious changes, it will take many years to create a mining culture here, according to Downes.
Many courters are in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions are still required to develop and create infrastructure needed for rest.
The 70-year-old Hao Makong lives in Chunli, near the places of the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that there has been a winter sports tourism in recent years.
Two years ago, from Beijing to Chunli, no local inhabitants have suffered without work.
In the country, more shops that trade clothes and equipment for winter sports are opened.
On the slope, the communities with the foods of the national kitchen are opened.
There is even a COVID-19 testing station on Taiwa.
China seeks to create a prosperous winter sports industry, its sportsmen should become leaders of the biggest international competition, and the courts and equipment to reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world can face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, said WHO
More than 500 million people in the world can be put into extreme poverty because of the pandemic of the coronavirus, which has delayed the progress of humankind in the universal access to health services, stated the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
The International Day of the General Health Services of WHO and WB published two complementary reports in connection with the notified 12 December.
They stated that the pandemic had led to collapse in the delivery of nurses, causing excessive tensions in health systems.
In this regard, the population of immunization has declined for the first time in 10 years, the mortality of tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and WB emphasized that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it has been harder to pay people for treatment."
This situation pushes over 500 million people "to extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services from their pocket."
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterrish stated that the pandemic of coronavirus had put more than 100 million people into poverty, and more than four billion people had almost no social support.

Reuters: Taiwan Minister has been disconnected from the transmission to the Sammit for Democracy on request of the White House
The statement of the Minister for Digital Technology of Taiwan Audrey Tan at the panel discussion during the United States organized " Sammit for Democracy" was transferred to a video regime, acknowledged by the YouTube summit.
The Reuters Agency claims that the picture was disconnected on the request of the White House.
Their report indicated that the map on which Taiwan was selected by a separate color from the PRC, which counts the island as its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tan was made by the South African NGO of CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world to ensure civil rights.
Taiwan was allocated to her green as "free" and the CNR, NDR, Laos and Vietnam are red as "closed".
After the Minister showed the map, the picture on its side was replaced by the box with a note that the views of the participants in the debate “do not necessarily express the position of the Government of the United States”.
The CNR was not invited to the Sammit for Democracy.
The sources of Reuters note that the map shown by the Taiwan Minister could go in contrast with the "one China" policy, which was followed by Washington.
One of the sources of the Agency stated that, after the map was demonstrated, the United States National Security Council had angeredly contacted the State Department, accusing him of showing Taiwan a separate country.
The Sammit for Democracy, organized by Washington, was held from 9 to 10 December with representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the Zero Day Summit, the Nobel Prize Laureat, the chief editor of the New newspaper, Dmitri Muratov, called for an international fund, through which the money gained by corruption was given to charity.
Earlier today, the Deputy Secretary of Sobbaz RF Yuri Averianov stated that the summit was carried by the " Anti-Russian and Anti-China charge".

The New Shepard space ship with six tourists on board has launched a suborbital flight
The New Shepard space ship carried out a suborbital flight on Saturday, 11 December, with six tourists on the ship.
The travel on the company's website has been over ten minutes long, and the passenger capsule descended to Earth, TASS reports.
The launch of the carrier missile was carried out with cosmodroma in the area of the city of Van Horn, Texas.
The ship rose to a height of about 100 miles, and space tourists were in a state of inadequateness.
The carrier itself landed on the cosmodroma plot.
On 20 July Blue Origin has successfully carried out the first suborbital flight of New Shepard with passengers on board.

The MID heads of Russia, Sergei Rajabkov, evaluated the perspectives of the relations of Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long way of interaction led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries began not yesterday.
One side of the negative predictability exists, but in part of a prospect of improvement in relations, it is unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion of the long way we have been through with the current administration and Trampe and Obama.
The problems have not started yesterday," said the diplomat.
Rjabkova said that the problem is in the U.S. intention to entail Russia's approaches to a number of issues.
MID heads added that they would not risk giving optimistic forecasts on the prospects for improvement of relations and would not expect to change the position of Washington.
He explained that, except for directions such as strategic stability and cyber security, progress was not observed.

Previously, the head of the MID of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, at the meeting with the Secretary-General of America, Anthony Blinken, said that Moscow was ready to restore a dialogue with the United States.
The virusologist warned about the danger of vaccine by COVID outside hospitals
The vaccine of COVID-19 may be allergic and they need medical assistance, so the first items for this medicinal product should not be organized in airports and trading centres.
TASS virusologist, member of RAN, a laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virusology of the Novosiberian State University Sergei Netesov.
It is easier to organize vaccines in airports and trading centres, but I would only do so at first times in medical institutions.
The fact is that the probability of allergic reactions to such vaccine is small, but it is desirable that a person then sit next to the doctor's office.
The doctors have special sets of anti-allergic medicinal products that function literally in a minute or two, which are sometimes very necessary," said Netesov.
The virusologist believes that the vaccination in trade centres can be considered when experiences in the use of the medicinal product are accumulated.
He also emphasized that the use of the nazal vaccine is important that it gets on a slippery shell in the nose.
However, the vaccine is likely not to reach the destination if the waxed in the nose is exhausted after the scratch.

The Press Secretary of the President of RF Dmitri Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continuing “aggressive action” against Ukraine, including due to the alleged “invasion” in the territory of the country.

New Caledonia people rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final outcome of the third referendum on New Caledonia's independence, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave France.
The French BFM.TV television television reported on this on 12 December.
96.5 per cent voted against independence.
Independence from France was maintained by 3.51 per cent of the archipelagos in the South of the Pacific.
The results were cancelled by 2.99 per cent of the bulletins.
The voting level of the day was very low: about 55 per cent of the archipelagos were attended.
According to experts, the low phenomenon is due to the calls of separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to pass the referendum date.
In October 2020, New Caledonia's inhabitants in the referendum expressed against independence against France.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
Most of the inhabitants supported the foundation of archipelagos in France.
New Caledonia is nearly 20,000 miles from the landscape of France.

WHO has previously considered "micron" less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously considered the "micron" less dangerous than the delta stamps of the coronavirus.
However, there are data on reducing the efficiency of vaccines in the disease of the new COVID-19 version.
On 9 December, the “micron” was registered in 63 countries.
" Preliminary data and significantly modified antigenic protein profile " micron" suggest that the vaccine efficiency against infection and the transfer of the option will be reduced.
According to the preliminary conclusions from South Africa, it may be less difficult than in "delte"," said the WHO technical communication.
The Organization notes that all registered cases of micronom infection in the EU have been prolonged easily or unlikely.
However, the new stamp, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster " delta".
There are two cases of omicron stamma infected in Russia.
They were "immunised earlier," said the Gamalei Centre.

Four Green scenarios were named in Ukraine
The Expert Deputy of the Supreme Council, Vadim Denissenko, listed four development options for the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Greenski, in 2022.
He believed that the head of the State could remain without the support of the West and may be compromised by Donbass.
On Sunday, 12 December, Denissenko told in a publication at the Glovred Portal.
The first option, which Denissenko has called " perfect storm", suggests that Ukraine will stop supporting key Western countries by reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such development would contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev could face in 2023.
"It is parallelly a reduction in the prices of key goods that we traditionally export " ...> internal protests and the opposition of the authorities to key PGGs (finance-industrial groups. - Red.) ", added the Ex-Parliamentary.
According to Denissenco, there is also another scenario for the development of the situation, a war against everyone.
This projection will occur in the case of high turbulence in the world policy where Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this situation, Ukraine ' s leadership could compromise Donbass, which resulted in the country's opposition.
In the end of the summer, the probability of this situation, according to the former nardepe, is up to 50 to 55 per cent.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian policy is the opposition to the Green Groups of Population and the President, which is likely to take control of the force block and implement " Populist initiatives " .
In the course of such a crisis, Greenski will begin " transformation of power", added Denissenko.
Another scenario is to turn Greenski into a nation's father.
This may lead to an event that will be a huge shock for society.
"The event must be sufficiently large in order to induce external partners ' response and increase Ukraine ' s support," said Denissenko.
Such a situation is possible through natural disaster, technical disaster or Russian aggressive acts, the ex-member believes.
However, the Russian party has not once rejected any probability of " attacks" on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States have increased military activity at the Russian borders.
Earlier, on 11 November, the surveys of the Rating Social Group showed that the Ukrainian President's rating had fallen to recordly low, comprising 19.3 per cent.
This is the lowest indicator since its election by the head of the State.
The analysts predicted the situation where the nearest elections of the President of Ukraine for Greenland would give their vote only 21.8 per cent, while the ex-president of Petra Porochenko was 14.5 per cent.
In addition, only 19.3 per cent of the President ' s support was expressed among all entrusted.

For the first time he was detained on 23 January at the Pushkin Square, at a myth in support of Alexey Naval.
"It was aimed at drawing attention to poetry generally, and now the interest in it was, unfortunately, lost to the decline of the common culture in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of detention and to disclose the messaging of his message.

Estonian scientists will look for life in Vienna
The Massachusett Technology Institute, in collaboration with Tartus Observatory and other research institutions and companies, prepares three space missions to Venus to find signs of life in the atmosphere, reported on Sunday "Aktual Camera".
The aim of the missions to start five years later is to assess the benefits of the life of the clouds of Venus and then to find life there.
For the project, Tartus scientists offered tools to measure acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
The cloud of Venera, near the Earth, was still expected to be too acid to live there, but the Venus was probably a planet of type of earth.
During the third mission, a test from Venus should be arrived.
Let's assume that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it looks like a earthly or different one.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that the earth’s life has not started on Earth.
But if it is different, it may be more likely that life has been born on Earth," said the head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project, Mikkel Pausalo.

Meta-inhabitants will change the Russian business
The theme of meta-inhabitants has become a popular autumn this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook was transformed into Meta.
This event has become an important signal for the market: the largest player has confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between humans.
The business in Russia, as in the world, will invest in the creation of its own meta-integrants and their subsequent monetization.
Meta-relateds should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend in creating remote interactions in the conditions of pandemic is that people are tired of dissemination and restrictions.
From the second, business aims to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models under them.
From the third, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets when any rights, valuable papers, artwork and even money are digitalized.
Ania, you're right, change in food is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you don't want anything too fat and harm anymore.

You can eat on a syringe, try, and enough.
For the truth is ten days of the weekend, you can prepare any delicious and useful meals.

The British economist could not provide a projection for 2022
The British economist Jim O'Neill could not provide a projection for 2022, since he believed that such attempts would be a failure.
He wrote about this in the draft article for the Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictableness and any trends can change the traffic.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and secondly inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also confessed that he did not know whether the prices on the goods were temporary or not.
According to the expert, prior to the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of infinite generosity of central banks has already survived” and it is time to return to relations where the percentage rates to inflation will be correlated with the expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that the continued soft economic policy in the background of the pandemic could, in some experts, lead to a new inflation.
In addition, it should be drawn attention to the growth of productivity, as well as to the increase in poverty and climate change, summarized O'Neill.
Previously, the head of the Global Research Division of Investment Opening Michael Schulgin reported that the positive expectations for the dollar for 2022 were maintained, while the growth capacity would be less significant.
In addition to the risks for the course of the dollar Schulgin referred to the FRS currency policy, the dynamic of oil prices and the concerns of the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But one thing is joyful is that if you compare yourself, five years ago, the containers were less.
It's better now.

The Russians gave to autodillers about 4.5% of GDP countries
After 10 months of 2021, the Russians spent the purchase of new cars 2 trilns of 784 billion rubles, which was 28 per cent higher than the same period of last year, the Russian Automotive Market Research Agency (NAPI).
To understand the scale, the same amount (about 3 trins of rubles) was spent by the State to support citizens and economies during the pandemic of the coronavirus.
Last September, at the meeting of the Heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount was compared to more than 4.5 per cent of the country's domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
The Russian market income leads to the Korean Kia brand.
In 10 months of this year, he was able to implement cars of 325.7 billion rubles, almost 24 per cent higher than before.
In the family of Kia Hyundai, more than 35 per cent increases, and the car sales is estimated in 279,3 billion rubles.
In the leadership positions, the brand and the average price of the vehicle -- in Hyundai, it grew almost 21 per cent, up to 1.94 million rubbers -- a stronger trip dynamic only in Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
However, the sales of Korean brands have not increased significantly: according to the statistics of the European Business Association Committee in Russia, in the quantitative expression, Kia has implemented more than 9.4 per cent of cars in the same period as previously.
Hyundai, almost 12%.
The Japanese Toyota has closed three leaders on sales in the cash terms - the Russians spent 10 months of the mark, 275.5 billion rubles, 14 per cent more than a year earlier.
The Japanese follow Mercedes-Benz with 266,1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has increased and sales (by 37 per cent), and the average car price (on 28 per cent, to 8.2 million rubles).
" Mercedes-Benz also has a good increase in sales and medium-sized price -- more, for example, than BMW -- from here and a large increase in the financial quantities -- explained the NAPI director Tatian Arabiaji. -
At the rate of sales, the fantastic indicators show Chinese brands, also significantly increased financial quantities this year."
The Russian Lada on income growth demonstrates medium-night indicators (+ 28 per cent), the Russians spent 10 months of 229,4 billion rubles on the cars of that mark.
Last year, companies with car sales falled in items in 2021, including Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
The UAZ and totally in a minus 10 months, the Russians spent 12 billion rubles on the roads and trucks of that mark against 12.4 billion rubbers a year earlier.
Based on the problems with autocomponents and disruptions in the production covered by the whole world's railways, auto-corporations continue to adjust prices continuously -- the same "AutoVAZ " increased the value of Lada models seven times per year, the last trip (on 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
They regularly transmit prices to their product and other autoproducers.
The volumes of the Russian road market in cash will continue to increase, in addition to the deficit of cars, inflation and the desire of autoconcerns to play past losses, the experts believe.
In the conditions of car deficit, I think that many auto-concerters have even partially been able to transfer the cost of past periods to the user which they had not been able to price the cars before,
Says the WTB Capital analyst on Vladimir Bespalov.
I believe that the autoproducers now feel very well in financial terms by maintaining high sales marginality."
The indirect indicator of this is the increase in the cost of vehicles that have been observed during 2021, the prices for new vehicles are increasing faster inflation, the expert states.
In a long-term perspective, the market will also grow in quantitative expressions and in cash, but mainly through the inflation and complicating the construction of machines itself, the Prognosed Bespal.
As a result of the increase in prices, the offer will be limited.
In the cash expression, the Russian author will continue to grow and in the future year, even if the cost of the car is slowed, the manufacturers will be able to obtain their income by volumes, notes the independent consultant on Sergei Burgasliev.
Given the increased demand and the insufficient proposal, the manufacturers are now trying to obtain the biggest profit from each car sold, Burgaslies notes.
The increase in the production of machines is not expected at least in the next six months, while the heating of the insufficience of citizens in the future is also warming in Russia.
In the background of the situation on the market, the cars were a good object for investments, purchased a year ago, even with a run, can now be sold more expensive, as the expert states.
Byden said that the transfer of US military to Ukraine in the event of the invasion of Russia
The U.S. leadership has never considered the sending of American military to Ukraine in the case of “invasion” of Russia.
This statement was made by the President of the United States, Joe Byden.
"They never had such plans," said the Chief of the White House, answering the question of the journalist whether the United States had refused such an idea.
Byden noted that, in the event of escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia would face economic implications.
He stressed, however, that the United States and NATO had no obligation to use the military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the unanimous use of US troops for Ukraine ' s defence in the agenda was not worth.
Byden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to the Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and Natovian troops to the eastern flag, B9 of all NATO countries that we have a holy obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia," said Baiden.
Previously, the Press Secretary of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, emphasized that Moscow had no intentions of invasion into Ukraine.
He noted, however, that Moscow saw the problem in the use of the Turkish drones and that " American weapons are approaching our territory".
I'm leaving these interviews right away.
If they're trying to make me listen to screams, wait with hours, drink an unreasonable burde and a cup of washing, it's terrible to imagine what's going to be at work.

Because, to confirm his lie about the involvement of force structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to scare and confront.
