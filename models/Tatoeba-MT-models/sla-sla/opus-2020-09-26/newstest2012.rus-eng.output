Parliament does not support the amendment that gives the freedom of Timošenko
Today, during the amendment to the Criminal Procedure, the Ukraine Parliament rejected the attempt to repeal the article that condemned the opposition leader, Julia Timošenko.
The amendment that would lead to the release of the former Prime Minister's prison was rejected during the second reading of the draft law on the mitigation of convictions for economic offences.
In October, Timošenko was sentenced to seven years of prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was recognised as uncomfortable.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will consider the appeal of Timošenko in December.
Timošenko claimed that the sentence was a political place of the regime; in the West, the process was also suspected of prejudice.
The proposal to repeal article 365 of the Criminal Procedure Code, under which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes to ratify it.
Libya's victory
In the history of release, or rebellion, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Kaddafi was buried somewhere in the desert, and without it, the war ended.
It's time to define winners.
Islamists are generally conquered in the country; the question is, moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of the normal Chariat law that we have already heard.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the stealing penalty is a hand cut.
Women may forget the emmancipation; potential remedies will be executed; etc.
Instead of the dictator, the competing clans will be united by the Coran.
There will be a order in Libya that we can't imagine and which we would hardly wish.
Nevertheless, our lifestyle is not the only one in its kind, neither the best, and it would probably not be suitable to the people of Libya.
In fact, it is surprising that the Islamic warriors accepted help from the unbelievers.
Their only excuse is that they believe that the nature of the NATO was not the American General, but Allah whose greatness they glorified after each strike.
And if we find winners in Libya, the West is not their number.
We participated in shootings, served in Islam, and our policies relieved the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of benefit.
In view of the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we decided to resign from Libya's military occupation.
The local population does not need to worry about the exile of crossmensions.
Although, without oil, would oil companies get the black gold of Libya practically worthless?
And then the West will finally be able to wake out the useless protection of civil rights.
Unless Sharia's followers end it.
A new wave of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe are now focused on investors.
The statistical storm went over Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries have published GDP data in 3 block.
In comparison with the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in a state of delay, and Germany and France have demonstrated growth.
Still, the debt market is beating records today.
Investors are not only looking towards Italy; they are now focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The Eurozone statistics offices in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have announced their preliminary assessments of economic development in the third quarter.
GDP of Germany increased by 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries have also adjusted the data on the second quarter where the case was better than it was expected (0.3 per cent growth instead of initial 0.1 per cent). France reported a small reduction, by 0.1 per cent (decisive information suggested a stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy has shown preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, compared to the previous GDP block, the Czech Statistical Bureau confirmed the trend of gradually slowing economic growth.
The results were worse than the analysts predicted.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it was delayed compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany's economy increased by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
From July to September, both the eurozones and the European Union have demonstrated growth in comparison with the previous quarter by 0.2 per cent, compared with the forecasts of analysts.
Greece's economy has demonstrated a preliminary reduction by 5.2 per cent.
The income of its 10-year bonds is 28.45 per cent.
The income of both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching critical marking.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, and so on.
Despite the deterioration of the situation in the region, the income of Czech 1-year bonds remains approximately 4 per cent.
Germany said that the ECB was the last creditor that could save the situation.
The Czech Assembly took the election to the Euro.
In Montenegro, they won at 1:0 and celebrated an unexpected monetary prize of 200 million.
The National Team has succeeded in the most complicated season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech and the beautiful naked Peter Yiraček, they won with account 1:0.
In the second time, the Czech team was happy to retain a significant advantage after the home response match, and it would participate again in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the match and made a detailed report.
Almost nothing significant in the first time and great luck in the second.
The Czech National Collections Partially due to the defeat of the team at the end; the Great Czech; and the Heroic Yiraček; win 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates the entry to the European Championship.
The excellent defense of the Czech team allowed Montenegro to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damianovic and Vučinic became the most unfortunate couple of matches after they missed two great opportunities.
The great Peter of Chech is one of the reasons why the Czech National Collections will not miss the European Championship next year, and the Czech football will thus earn about 200 million Czech crowns.
The game has been very tense since the first minute.
Both teams experienced difficulties with combinations; the game was most of the time in the center of the field.
This also explains the absence of pressure by the first time's team, and further strikes over the defence line have been carefully captured by the Czech Protectors.
The Iranian students are willing to die for the nuclear programme of their country.
They created a live shield.
Several hundred students of the university have created a live shield around the nuclear power station in Iran.
They therefore wish to express their support for the nuclear programme of their country against the possible attack by Israel.
On Tuesday, on the afternoon, students prayed before entering the building, a request for death was followed by both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred universities have created a live shield around the Isfahan Enrichment Factory.
They thus demonstrated their willingness to protect the nuclear programme of their country by the price of their own life.
In its last report, the International Nuclear Energy Agency (IAEA) pointed out that Iran had not left an attempt to obtain nuclear weapons.
The possible attack on nuclear objects in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday, on the afternoon, students prayed before entering the Isfahan Uranium Enrichment Factory followed a request for both the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at the maximum paralyzing of the Iranian nuclear programme, the objectives of the Israeli press will be both in Isfahan and in Natanza, where the enrichment of uranium is carried out.
Food for children suffering from fatty: No breakfast and sausage for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 are weighing more standards; while 9 per cent of students are overweight, 5 per cent suffer from fatty.
According to the last study, children suffering from abnormality usually come from families leading unhealthy lifestyle.
We again see the importance of the environment and the patterns of behaviour associating with the person for his or its healthy development.
For example, the sausage appears on the tables of children suffering from fatty, almost twice as in families with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of the children suffering from fat are eating potatoes for dinner before an interview relating to the educational event called Fatness is not a coincidence.
Furthermore, the families of children suffering from abundance are not sporting, but this concerns most of the families of contemporary schools -- only 15 per cent of their children said that their parents have time for sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of the last year’s study; it was part of nearly 900 primary classes throughout Bohemia.
The Activities of Fatness was not a coincidence of the second year in order to support the insurance company the Unilever and the Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 students from 4 to 8 grades have joined the project.
The correct nutrition and sufficient sports load are the main factors that cause rapidly growing numbers of children suffering either of excessive weight or of fatty.
"For example, only half of the questionnaires said that they eat five times a day, on the breakfast-tour-tour, and it is one of the unchanging conditions of proper nutrition," the study concluded.
No lunch and no sausage at evening.
Experts warn that even relative details such as the permanent family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of the schoolmates are breakfast together.
In most families, everyone's breakfast separately.
The worst discovery was that in every tenth family people do not have breakfast at all.
Still, breakfast is the basis of the right daily range.
The study showed that baked food is more frequently used in families with children suffering from abundance.
Almost every one, regardless of weight, drinks sweet cold drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40 per cent of children are regularly at sports, this number is reduced more than twice - to 15 per cent - when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study selected by children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) it was suggested that their own menu, based on the proposed products and based on their tastes and preferences.
"The preferred food in Czech children aged 12-15 years from the ideal of healthy nutrition."
Their favorite food includes a large number of painful, meat and sweet meals.
"Specific alarm is a major popularity of sweet cooling drinks," the final part of the study says.
As the main meal of the pasta, the bird was beaten with a small overweight.
However, children were practically not interested in beans, fish and vegetable foods.
Aim for a healthy lifestyle
The study also showed that children were willing to change their eating habits provided that the information would be provided to them.
"A number of participants in the research control group showed a significant improvement of healthy food preferences when they filled the survey after the Emergency lecture was not a coincidence," the project said.
This was particularly notable, for example, in the case of sweet cold drinks, more children prefer them just water.
Furthermore, as the main meals, children were more frequently marking birds and fish, limiting the number of sweet meals and baking.
Stylist should also be a good psychologist, as acknowledged by professionals
In the first article on style training, I visited information at introductory classes.
I had no idea what was going to happen.
Lessons of three experts in this area; councils for choosing clothes for non-standard figures; and seminars on how all this works in real life.
Next, more.
The closer we are to the final examination, the more information and practical tasks are expecting us.
Training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it is truly satisfied with information.
This time, with Alenka, the director, we discussed how to wear a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One short neck, another male figure without appropriate forms, weighs more.
The stylist should know how to minimize wide shoulders, extend the neck or add the missing volumes.
We were given advice to emphasize the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopez, which is the owner of more delicious breasts and beards and narrow tall, and not wear them too much.
For example, if the difference in the size of the talia and the bead is so big that you can't pick up a suit or panties, it's worth having at least one thing that's bound to order.
You will certainly not regret the funds, because the perfectly seated clothing is worthless.
In a suit sewed for order, you will feel much better than the one who keeps moving, wails, naked, etc.
Male figures, on the other hand, can wear clothing with bowls, applications, shifts or belts.
Given the abundance of such information and types of figures, I'm glad I have a whole week to realize.
Still, I'm afraid that's too much, given the homework we've received.
Each student of the course had to come up with two dresses for any celebrity, for the day and for the evening.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothing and the type of figure.
I'm about to wear Miranda Kerr, which you can know about Victoria's Secret's advertising campaigns.
I am happy for myself because it's much easier to wear than, say, Britney Spears, Christine Agiler, who has recently recovered from a tonne (please, consider that I am exaggerating), or quite young Selena Gomez.
We must cut out the clothing from magazines or find it online, print and process with graphical programs.
The Mudbord - so called the result of work - then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphical image.
It is important to keep a graphical style in mind.
Stylist does not just wear real people, but creates product pages in magazines (based on specific instructions, such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what a stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us.
But it was only Sunday.
Stylist needs common knowledge
The Saturday Talk, which was acquired by the types of figures, was renewed by three experts in this area.
Stilist, Honza Pokorna; fashion designer, Jacob Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and stylist should use this fact.
A good stylest can use one of the clothes differently.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, the coat-shirt can be wearing in a normal way, over the jeans and shirts like a coat; but it can also be wearing on the naked body, without a blanket like a dress.
Another possibility is to sneak the sleeves or lift the collar, and the whole image is completely changing.
"Game with him," he emphasized.
Anyway, I appreciated the following advice: "For your work, you must know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start breaking them," Jacob told us.
Here I finally realized why we're going to screw all the definitions and rules that are combined with something and why, while in fashion magazines, we often see different things.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I found out that a stylist should have more options than the number of photos he needs to do.
For a fashion review on ten pages (equivalent to ten dresses) I must be prepared to create at least 15 images.
Now I also know that the object of clothing on the picture often looks and works in combination with others is not as real.
We must have this in mind when we create a image.
Honza Pokorne confirmed that often the image and style were half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have an impressive vocal, but her image and marketing turned her into a world star.
Relationship with stylist services in the Czech Republic is still quite cold.
Even famous people often think that it's too much (and they believe that it's enough to be a specialist in something and how they look, secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their styles, we should expect them to call us a different (minor) size than the one they really wear.
Then we go to Google and find out if the tabloids have written anything about the fact that some famousness has been thick/displayed, etc.
In Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that it was not enough for the stylest to deal with fashion and to be able to pick up a dress.
Our work is primarily communicating with people we dress; therefore it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to evaluate people, not to distort them and to follow their views.
"If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add a few beautiful things, you can't throw out all her closet by telling her that her clothes are horrible."
"Find at least a few things you can praise, and advise what you can wear with them," said Mario.
He also showed us that a work bag should be placed specifically.
It's a bag you tie around the tall to wear everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as scarfs, sticky rolls or English stones, there should be a newlon thread (stylists use it when they take off some items, such as bag or hat), special tissues for tissue tissue on the back when clothing is too large (sheets and similar objects are prohibited as they break out the clothes) or a set for sewing.
In order to distract from the lectures and get some practical experience, we learned to make correct shoes.
Even during the recordings in the studio where the sex is smooth, it can be damaged, not speaking of the street shooting.
And then we took a sticker.
You don't have to touch your shoes with scissors so you can't spoil them.
This requires real art.
I was glad that Mario praised my work.
I didn't like the skills mentioned here.
It's only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend course.
I'm starting to realize that being a professional stylestyle is not easy to say.
V Need for Speed: Running is happening in America.
Overview
What was supposed to be a careless walk, became a routine morning travel to work because of a series of totally inappropriate and unreasonable mistakes.
The ambitions were satisfied to a certain extent, but it is not important, because no one clearly wanted to do any work.
Before the new version of the "Flee" was connected with great hopes.
It was expected to move the previous series of Need For Speed in a new direction; demonstration versions indicated that the game would take a decent place in the race game genre.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main hero comes out of the car and runs.
As this often happens with the NFS, there is a lot different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the overall impression is that several unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series of games for years.
So it's not actually mistakes, it's the manifestation of an unexplained chain of developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You're part of the history whose chief hero, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by taking part in an illegal race through America.
You're going to the west coast car, San Francisco, and your task is to get to New York first.
This idea has several interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages divided into more than 50 races.
This means that each race goes on its own route, individual stages go in a variety of interesting environment.
Therefore, there is no sense that the game is always the same.
Although the schedule is at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, some routes are enjoyable.
However, the game does not cause strong emotions.
Although driving a car through the desert, in autumn suburbs or high in snow mountains, it is very pleasant.
Furthermore, the race sometimes reassigns an extraordinary detail.
For example, in the desert you get into a sandstorm, which is significantly lowering visibility.
On the other hand, the mountains need to be careful to avoid falling under the lave.
The individual races are pretty well arranged.
There are only a few diversitys, but that's enough.
For a while, you are trying to overcome a number of rivals, and then you try to improve your time. Or you will compete with one opponent.
In addition to all, you have time and time in contact with the police that makes your task even more complicated.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation where Jack runs from someone mostly, and you have to help him by pressing the buttons at the right time.
It's not complicated.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much less than you could expect (only three to be accurate).
It actually turns out that it's good for the game, because it's not boring; given all the above, it's one of the things that make the game more interesting.
The race model is followed by previous models.
This means that it is no longer a special thing, but it cannot be considered deficiency.
If you're looking for a real life imitation, you'll have to find somewhere else.
However, this driving model is very appropriate for the dynamic race, although the market can find better options.
So far, it's very good.
However, some time afterwards there are problems.
Unlike the driver's model, it's not that good.
You don't expect any complicated conversions and conflicts from this game, but if you don't have a clutch with the object, how your car will behave, something is wrong.
Usually, by raising or passing by cars in a dense stream, you sometimes slightly touch another machine, but sometimes in a practically similar situation, your car starts to be freaked out.
Or it's broken.
This is not so important because of the restart system, but it's enough to ruin fun.
The restarts are designed so that if you break or get away from the route, the game returns you to the point where it was interrupted.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start the race from the beginning.
It's useful if something doesn't work, but you can't trust it completely.
Sometimes the restart is not enough, and you have to teach a separate race station.
The important lack of game is the fact that the same things are often happening in the same places.
For example, some turns have to go in a certain way, otherwise you just don't get in.
In other cases, you meet civilian vehicles in a certain place in the same configuration, no matter whether you arrived first, five, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly irritating in situations when you see your rival drives easily between two vehicles moving in the opposite direction, while when you get there, the cars are already located in a way that you need either to round them or drop the speed.
It doesn't matter when you're close to them; it's all arranged that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
The rivals have other advantages.
During the game, you find several places where no matter what time, the same competitor is chasing you in the same place.
This is especially obvious at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you go in the opposite direction.
Apparently, your rival must stand before you, despite anything.
The point is, when he comes before you, it makes you worse the review, which leads to one or more accidents in this area.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and filled with adrenaline, but this is so obvious that it starts to get annoyed.
Sadly, despite the simple driving model, the game is interesting and sometimes so satisfied with events that you have no time to pay attention to what is happening around you.
No matter what you don't miss, the concept with 50 unique routes, the sequence of race or something else.
The idea of car shift during the race is unusual.
You need to track the gas stations on the road, because it's the way your car can change, despite the fact that in most cases the one you already have is enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
The sports machines are suitable for cities; powerful American vehicles are for direct road cuts; and exotic super-sporters for technical driving, for example, on the embedded mountain routes.
The main mode history regime is closely linked to the mode challenge mode; it is a race on individual parts that you will learn during the game.
Here you win for your own personal case both medals and shoes, common for challenges and history regimes.
Many possibilities are available for a higher level of driving: starting from machines and ending with the profiles.
Furthermore, the profile is linked to the autolog online function, which compares the results you have achieved with the results of other players and provides communication with the public.
Here is another lack of understanding; this is an example of the last race in a sequence.
You and your car are going into the metro tunnel (will think so), where you run through the railways in the darkness (yes).
Your spidometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (will think so), when a train in the back of you suddenly hits the metro, turning your car into a metalloom breast.
During a few days, our edition discussed whether when we were created a game, no one really thought or its creators really think of us as such as fools.
The technical composition of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression of the video to the most pleasant, sometimes even amazing.
Although it is a pity that in some critical times, the quality of recording, sometimes very much, is declined.
This is particularly related to events with many participants, where a good record would not help you.
The sound is fine; the saundtreck is on the lover.
To satisfy the wider youth audience as possible, in the saundréc, “the compositions have come from different styles”; but it is unlikely that a lot of people will buy a game because of its music.
General impression of Need for Speed: Running is quite irregular.
If the game had escaped obviously unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Run was the best part of the NFS in the past few years.
Anyway, the game remains incomplete.
Of course, it's a good entertainment, but prepare for the shortcomings that will blind you as a airline lighter.

EU Ambassador Vicenova:
The Czech Republic has the reputation of displeasants and skeptics on euros.
"The Lisbon Treaty has caused significant disagreements between individual organizations."
"I didn't expect such a cruel war."
" Five or six years before the situation is stabilized, calmed down, and all players will be used to their new roles," EU Ambassador Milen Vicenova strictly started its лекtion at the Legal Faculty.
It has proved to the extent that its " Clear and Open About Europe" is held in the first part of its lecture, where it described individual EU institutions and the relationship between them so simple and clear that many lecturers from the Legal University of KU would be envious.
Furthermore, Vicenova commended the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompei:
"The criticisms said at the beginning that he was a common gray office mouse that could not play any role; I should say, everyone was amazed how well he handled his role."
"He is a person who can listen at the same time to the twenty-seven participants, who has a great communication with them and has a clear idea of how to develop the EU."
She explained her new position of the representative on international relations and security as an answer to the question, " Who is the European Union? What number should I call?", i.e. as an important step towards unification and greater transparency of the Union policy against countries such as China or India.
No one's going to ban our cheese
Vicenova has further focused on the programme, key to the EU in the past, present and near future.
It called the successful Czech Presidency last year.
The Czech Republic had dealt with the coming financial crisis; they overcome the crisis and organize the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She said that the resignation of the Government at the time was a negative phenomenon that caused severe damage to the Czech Republic.
The representatives of Czech Republic in the EU are currently very busy.
As the Ambassador said, the Chairman and the financial crisis that followed, have led to the continuing nursery.
The new seven-year budget of the EU must also be adopted, which is very difficult, taking into account the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be poor and efficiency, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive greater support and what less; all these issues are in the existing programme.
Ambassador reminded the key slogans that she brought to Brussels: "O Europe, the Understanding Language."
"I really don't like the reductions, foreign words and the jargon that no one understands.
As citizens can understand that in Brussels, people are not trying to sell curve or round cows, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to banish our cheese.”
It is also going to use the EU environment more effectively and attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe - our future
Ambassador argues that the Czech Republic is regarded as euro skeptics; as well as people noting the negative rather than the positive sides of things.
She wishes that more representatives of Czech Republic be involved in European organizations.
It believes that several factors are guilty of this: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivation letters; at the same time, with small support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Chairmanship of the Czech Republic, she noted the power and cooperation of the High-Urban Group.
"Believe that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and the Slovak joins us, the French next to me says, "Why is the congregation again, the High-Grade Group?" and he is not happy to do so?"
In the future of the Union, Vicenov expects mostly new strict rules for the budgetary policy of States parties.
In comparison with the new European Federation, it considers the idea bi-speed, unless the multi-speed Europe is more realistic.
"We have both countries inside and outside the eurozone."
"We have the Schengen Zone, and we already have an institute of enhanced co-operation."
"It was said for the first time that countries who want to be united, while those who do not want to stay away."
"The number of such institutions will grow; this will be really two-speed Europe," Vicenova expects.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompey in the promotion of the rules under which all issues relating to all the EU should be discussed by all countries parties, not only in the eurozone.
Brand History:
The innovator of IBM entered the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find a word that best expresss the IMB strategy, it will probably be "long".
For the broad public, IBM is a symbol of technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded over a hundred years ago.
The company's debt was placed by her first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson's older.
He believed in his devision that many world problems could be easily solved if people wanted to think.
His slope "Mye!" has thus become a stamp around which the life of the future giant (and also the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began to issue in 1935).
Furthermore, this was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson was thoroughly built.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means a continuous move to the future.
The IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her original values, although she was not afraid to change everything around her.
In our first hundred years, this has enabled us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to reach even more," said the current leader of the company Samuel J. Palmizano on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the concern of employees, just as Patricia in the Czech Republic, the IMB staff were one of the first US employees with paid leave, insurance from the employer, elegant uniform and a complex bonus system for best inventors and entrepreneurs.
Such advanced are long-term IBM relations with consumers.
It was one of the first world's companies that lifted all discrimination, which gave her a great choice.
It agrees with the anti-discriminatory strategy and the current plan, in accordance with which the woman, Virginia Rometti, will change Palmizano next year.
She worked at IBM for thirty years; now she is a selling, marketing and development director.
In recent years, IBM has organized meetings, online brain strikes, with many future innovations.
It is not surprising that a lot of ideas are working around a half a million people in the company.
Organization with good reputation
The strong position of the company in business is provided with strong internal and external images.
"In the first place, the IBM concept was rather a organization than a technology company," said the Economist professor of the Harvard Business School and the author of the IBM Rosebeth Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it is a company that helps solve business problems using technology," added Jodge Colony from Forrester Research Consulting Company.
As said in the company itself, there is a difference between going to the market and creating it.
In a hundred years, IBM, or the Blue Giant, as it was called in the United States because of his logo, became one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems that it is the universal technological company that develops hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services from servers to nanotechnology.
It owns the largest number of patents among all American technological companies, five of its staff received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, bankomate, banking map, financial cock, code and discette.
With 220 billion dollars, according to market capitalization, IBM has become the second largest Technology Company (the first place in Apple) for the first time since 1996.
Watch Forward
Not all its products tasteed to buyers and entered the age. For example, the IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; the Prodigy online service and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is determined by moving forward, you cannot be emotionally bound to the past," said Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM easily sets bases on several platforms -- if they don't work, it denies them.
It is, for example, different from its competitor Microsoft, who is based and surviving the falls on Windows, its operating system.
Perspective technology
The main IBM income is from services, about one fifth, in each case comes from computer programs and equipment.
While in 1990, with capital twice, it was the strongest equipment manufacturer.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets at $15 billion, while investing 58 billion in buying prospective technologies.
It continued its investment even after 2008, when the present economic crisis was first hit by the world.
The IBM follows the example of his first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased the number of investments in the years of Great Depression.
Until now, the IBM seems to have injured the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the IBM share price has increased by 120 per cent; the net earnings of the company have continued to grow.
The IBM corporate devision is to change everything but its own values.
This flexible giant can therefore be expected that even if another crisis is overwhelmed, this flexible giant will deal with the situation.
IBM history: from cheese knife to space flights.
The IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York 100 years ago, and its original name was "Corporate Calculation, Tabulation, records" was quite complicated.
It took the name IBM in 1924, which was originally called a brand used for offices in Canada and South America.
The foundations of the future IBM were founded by a combination of four companies, whose history begins in the 1880s.
They owned technologies, such as legendary "table clocks", i.e. hours fixing the time when staff come and leave work.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlet Flint, who was also head of the company's council by 1930.
Flint hired a competitive director, Thomas J. Watson, to help him manage the company.
The leader then moved the founder of IBM into the shadow of Watson's ideas remained a base of incredible corporate culture and individuality.
Watson was head of the company until 1952.
IBM, clearly from the name, began from the production and sale of different business equipment, from cheese knives and meat cuts to casso equipment.
During the first four years of Watson's management, the delivery had doubled up to nine million dollars, and a large expansion of the company for all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that nearly forty years later his seat at the chair of the director was taken by his son, Thomas Watson-Younger.
Under his IBM leadership, the technologies began to develop artificial intelligence and created the first language of programming.
In 1960, both staff and IBM computers helped NASA to control space flights — to Mercury, Saturn, and 1969 — a human flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - IBM line System/360.
The classic PC, which defined the computer standards of the time called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers of the Chinese company Lenovo, while bought a consulting office of PricewaterhouseCoopers, focusing fully on consulting and services with high value added.
In the last three years, IBM has made great progress with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its goal is a reasonable use of technologies in areas where this has not yet been planned and the improvement of the road situation and urban management.
In the scope of the IBM trade, the Smarter Commerce platform recently presented, which helps businessmen control the whole trade cycle.
The IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czech Slovakia, as the first country at the same time in Central and Eastern Europe, IBM established its office in 1932.
Today IBM CZ is also managed by the Strategic Outsourcing Centre in Brno.
The headquarters of Central and Eastern Europe are located in Prague, where the World Level Research Group is also working on the recognition of speech.
Richtarzová about her wrong husband:
Yveta, keep it stupid, I don't need it anymore!
Darina Richtaržova (53) said it's over!
After her husband, Josef Richtarg, 53, became a bodyguard and lover of Yveta Bartoshowa (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
Nevertheless, she did not want to wait anymore, and she set out clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," explained Richtaržova.
When Darina Richtaržová provided the blood of Bartosh in her house in summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And though she forced Yvette to leave Rzichan 30 days later, Pepa did not leave a singing.
Moreover, he publicly confessed that he loved her.
After some time, Darina gave up, pretending to reconcile her husband's romance; and now she finally forgived him.
I don't care who his wife's sleeping with.
Even if Richtarz and Bartosh ever break up, his wife won't accept it with a wide range of arms.
"He's a biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will expel him."
"And he will end his days not as my loved, lost and found old fool, but the man with whom I am connected," said Richtaržova, added that she was already released from her husband and insisted only on both ways.
As long as Joseph did not mind the fact that his wife rejected him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Yvette, I'm not changing it."
"My wife decided to leave her marriage on the paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our union is still working; I am responsible for repair, garden, house and shopping."
"Darina and I are talking completely normally, but we don't share the bed anymore," said Richtarge magazine Blesk.
He claims that if Richtaržova finds a new love, he won't interfere with her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I'm in love with Yvette and I'm in full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
The worst women's habits: Do they affect you?
When you ask men to call some typical bad female habits, they usually list all of them at once.
Dear ladies, will you recognize yourself in the following lines that describe several female habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Your second half complains that you've been walking on shops all the time?
Do you have to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like buying big sales?
If so, your shopping may be a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their passion for shopping.
However, who of you will refuse to walk for clothing in search of the perfectly seated clothing and sampling?
Maybe shopping is a hobby for most women, but for men it may become a real hell.
Just remember how many times you told your second half to wait outside...
Eternal Dissatisfaction
"I am too thick?"
"I need to drop at least five pounds -- why don't I start doing gymnasics?"
"You're still attracted to me?"
Do you know these phrases?
Yeah?
Then you join a group of women confused with your appearance.
Not that you need to stop following yourself, but many men are literally allergic to constant complaints of a partner to their appearance.
The strong sex also agrees that the more often such complaints occur, the more women are irritating them.
The most important thing is order and cleanness
It's like an endless story.
Washing glass, cleaning of sausage, pollution, washing dust, bath cleaning at least twice a week.
You're criticizing your partner for coming to a clean cafeteria in dirty shoes; children behind dirt in a clean barn and fingerprints on the window glass in the living room that was so difficult to clear?
If you suffer from this “devision ”, try to realize that falling into extremes is not good; and that order and cleanness should not be first in your family.
Without prejudice to purity, your relationships and the whole family may be threatened.
Intention to command
"Back your underwear in the trash."
"You're going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"The wet towels should not be on the floor."
If you make observations to your partner several times a day, it may be very boring.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood that, women wouldn't have had to command them so often...
Chatters
Some women like to talk, insult and plead intrigues against others.
Women are focused on relations, so they like to discuss who, where, who, and why.
From time to time, every one of us may dismiss the rumours.
Let's be honest, this is the nature of all women.
Anyway, there are more serious rumors, women who often talk and despise others, especially in a female workshop, are a great danger to their surroundings.
The effective transfers of Jager and Voracek helped Philadelphia to win
During the NHL match on Monday, two efficient transfers of the hockey attacker Jagra helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on Carolina's ice. It became again the most effective Czech match player.
In both cases, Claude Jiru used the experience of a thirty-ninth-year-old star; he added another transfer and was declared the best player of the match.
Two effective match transfers also belonged to the one team with Jagr Yakubu Voracek.
After the Jagr match, he told foreign journalists that he predicted Gira a great evening.
"I told him before the match that he'd kill a hack trick."
"I felt it."
"You sometimes feel that kind of thing," explained Jagr, after whose actions, Gyru was stabbed the goal as soon as the Flyers had given it.
A little later, the second goal of the team also had a Czech trail.
The closer Harriquens Voracek conquered the shiboj and handed it to Maxim Talbot, who screwed between the circles.
In a second before the first break, Patrick Dwyer reduced the break in numerous advantages, but at the beginning of the second time, the Flyers again led.
Especially Giru.
After the results of the Jagra, he smashed the third goal; further his strike was converted into the fourth Wayne Simmonds goal.
"I like playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player of the League, but he's definitely in the three of the best," said Jagr, praising his central.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in NHL my team companions were trying to help me, and now it's my turn," added Jagr.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with Tuomo Rut and the Dwyer tools, reducing the break to one naked.
The further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who increased the breakup to two points.
"Pronger was doing great in our zone."
"He hit the shabe, I accelerated, and Reid went to the far end."
"I targeted him and glad that it worked," Wracaček described his impression from the last naked match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the first place in the Eastern Conference.
The defender of the team of Montreal Czech Jaroslav Špaček did not finish the Baffalo match; he left the game in the second period because of the upper part of the body's injury.
Together with an experienced defender, Canadians lost their two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after the series of tools.
Thomas Plecanec couldn't kill during one of their attacks.
More than the scores lost, the home trainer was regretted with a large number of injuries in the back, since the match ended only with five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We finished the game with only one experienced player, others were young people."
"Whereever it is, we can't do anything about it, we just need to accept it," said Jacques Martin.
"The replacement of the replacement was impressive and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the shaibu from our zone."
"What was our weak side," added P.C. Subban Protector
After thirty attacks, the Czech gollipper Ongei Paulez helped Winnipegs defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Jets Goals, who interrupted the fiveth series of injuries, were killed by five different players.
Dinamics of travel prices since 1989
By 1989, only five public tourist agencies could work in the former Czech Republic: Chadok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
Since travels to the West were strictly limited, tourist agencies of that time were mainly selling tours to the socialist bloc countries.
Thus, the Czech tourists traveled to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Soci, Crime in Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (two countries in the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, which led to significant restrictions for Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The greatest paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the Socialist bloc (i.e. and Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel individually to socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovakian wanted to go to the Soviet Union or Poland alone, the invitation from the country was required; otherwise, it was impossible to travel individually.
At the time, tourist agencies offered travel to the West, but they had to either stand in line all night, with a sleep bag or have "good friends" in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
The currency permit was required to travel to the West and was not issued to politically untrusted people who were not allowed to travel.
The Czech Slovak currency was not freely converted; money (West currency) could not be obtained without currency permit.
Often, the Czechs had their holidays at home, which led to a large number of houses and summer houses, and this habit has been maintained to this day.
Since 1989, tourism in Czech Republic thus survived this revolution.
While until 1989, the vacation to GDP or Bulgaria was a culmination of our trips, Czech Republic held 4.5 million vacations in the world last year.
The great paradox, which we no longer realize, is that until 1989, we could not freely visit the most popular Croatia, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
In the beginning of 1990, the need for visa in neighbouring countries of Western Europe was cancelled, which led to a huge wave of short travel mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czech Slovakia could never get to the West, and they all wanted to go there for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists were sleeping in tents in parks, since their income was lacking for a hotel or a household.
The typical feature of Czech tourism during that period was the desire to bring its own food (conservations, salaries, etc.) to save money.
Another important moment is the introduction of a freely converted Czech crown. In decades, our tourists can finally buy the west currency freely.
Our level of life and average income increased, which led to another important circumstances in 1997.
Since 1997, the increased demand has enabled tourism agencies to prepare regular flights carried out by charter airlines.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czech Republic did not need a visa to visit almost all developed world countries except the United States.
The next significant event in the history of travels after the revolution took place in 2000, which led to the historically direct first charter flight from the Czech Republic to the exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have delivered Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and this winter flights from the Czech Republic will be sent to the twelve exotic directions.
At present, about 100,000 Czech countries visit exotic countries every year!
Another important event of this period, symbolising our development after revolution, happened in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States abolished the need for a visa for Czech tourists, thus joining the most developed world countries forever.
For the first time in history in 2008, more than half of their leaves spent abroad (50.3 per cent); and for the first time in history, they spent more than 15,000 crowns per person during abroad leave, including their expenses in the destination item.
The General Assembly must choose the President, the threat of the pat returns
For about five months, the Czech football had no president, and there was a risk that the successor Ivan Haschek, head of the Czech football association (FACR), would not be called even after another extraordinary general meeting that would take place in Nimburg on Tuesday.
There is still no consent in the rules of election to follow.
Without this, the vote will not begin for one of the three candidates.
Jindrih Richl, Miroslav Pelta and Thomas Pazlik are eager to lead the Czech football.
Haschek left his position in June, and he called on his colleagues to join and find a strong person who would lead football in the future.
Nevertheless, the era of Haschek reloaded football between two chambers of associations that cannot choose a single candidate.
It was obvious on 16 September when a new president was to be elected.
The members of the General Assembly came to the National House in Prague, Smiles, because negotiations remained locked, not only by elections.
There was no agreement on who has the right to vote in the General Assembly -- only legal representatives or officials to whom the powers were granted.
The moment has since been partly resolved through the recommendation of the Institute of State and the Law, according to which the Mission, based on the powers provided, is not possible.
Conflict on election rules, however, continues.
The Executive Board also did not help much, although it was mainly busy in its congregations, both regular and extraordinary.
The ideas of voting have changed several times, but the key question remains the same.
The question is, how can we go to the third round and avoid the pat?
"The argument is whether to follow the standards established or find another model," said one of the Vice-Presidents of FACR Duchan Freedom, representing a professional football in the association management.
Based on the model provided for by the Charter, the winner of the 3nd Round was a candidate who received great support from the Chamber from which he was a candidate.
It is alleged that Moravia agrees to compromise to consider the winner of the elections of a candidate with the largest number of votes in both chambers.
The Czech Party insists on the condition that a winner, in general, should be given at least two thirds of the votes.
"Nonetheless, the two previous rounds would have lost their meaning; it would completely reject the concept of the two chambers," the Freedom agrees with Moravia's arguments, saying that it would be best not to change the rules and vote in accordance with existing standards.
Some of the suddenly, Thomas Pazlik agreed with his view, although the rules of elections defined by the Charter were more than other candidates.
"I would like the elections to go to the maximum of the statute."
"I want to avoid all possible representative nonsense, as in the previous General Assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who was the first candidate; and he contradicted mostly Pelt in his statements.
Pelt's still optimist.
He believes that the new president will be known in Nimburg; he also hopes that candidates will be constructively cooperating in the future.
"All the emotional shifts will be calmed after today's anticipated release of the National Championship at the European Championship."
"The football will be again on a happy wave, people will be more willing to cooperate," said the representative of Jablonec. He has three candidates most experience in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Raichl's more restrained.
"I hope the agreement, but the situation is very unequivocal."
"It is not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules."
"It may cause another breakdown of the General Assembly."
"I hope the healthy sense will win," said Richl.
Not enough time left to reach the agreement.
Some records indicate that individual negotiations went directly to Montenegro; but who knows whether football unity will be achieved to the match.
A supplementary flight that was to be delivered, in addition to other, Vice-Presidents of Dalibor Kucher and Raichl to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to technical failure. They were looking for an alternative to deliver part of the executive committee to the place of the re-playing match.
Finally, the Minister ' s meeting, which is expected on Wednesday, may be decisive.
The Minister for Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobesh, would like the opponents in the country's strongest sports association to come to an agreement.
Many are: government subsidies; football credit; and the planned CSTV General Assembly with a new Czech Sport directive after Saska's financial problems.
Patzlik joined the presidential fight because he did not see a suitable candidate
If the head of footballers Plzeń Tomas Pazlik saw a strong candidate to meet all his requirements to the President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR), he would not even claim a high post.
"If I had been a decent candidate, I would have fought for him and not participated in the fight myself."
"But such a man hasn't been found yet," said Pazlik CTK.
Pazlik's motive to combat Miroslav Peltha and Jindrich Richl is to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged favourite of elections, from entering the FACR.
Furthermore, Pazlik emphasizes that if he wins, he will remain president only until 2013, when a regular general meeting is planned.
In the future, he would like that post to be taken by an experienced top manager not too connected to football life.
"I have spoken to several people that could be considered."
"For me, it was awful to hear some of them say they didn't even want to deal with the Czech football at the moment."
"I wish to change that opinion," he said.
The main disagreement of Pazlic with Peltha is now related to the relationships of the last relationship with Roman Berbroo, the President of the Regional Football Association in Plzan. Berbr is a contradictive person who is known as an influenced lobbist behind the cultivation, able to influence the votes of the delegates of the general congregation.
Pazlik therefore considers it unacceptable that Peltha become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and no football will move forward."
"With the support of Berbra, a capable businessman, it would be even worse for football," said Pazlik.
He suggested that a few years ago the name Pelta was written during telephone hearing in the investigation of the corruption case; Pelt has been able to avoid the sentence.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring football."
"And how we would look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Pazlik, "he now does not mention his previous statement that he would "sell the Plzeń club if Pelt became president."
If Pazlik wins on Thursday, he could present cooperation with Pelta in the future.
This view was divided by another candidate, Richl, who was supported by Pazlik before the universal meeting in September, ended by fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to whom I would have contacted."
He's very capable.
"I can introduce it to the head of the group."
"But he can't manage the association."
"I don't get my nose into what I don't understand," said Pazlik, who drew great attention to himself in September, when he supported the removal of the Judge's brigade headed by the Human Macella, which was changed by Dagmar Damkova.
Pazlik claims he would risk management of the association.
He refers to his experience in the management of private companies; since last summer, he had managed the Plzeń team, which had celebrated its first triumph in the League.
"I have powers to make the soccer environment change, to support it for better."
"Safeguard the influence of some groups of persons who are inclined to influence the disciplinary and appealing Council, which leads to disgusting situations," said Pazlik. It does not hide its antipathy, for example, to the Director of Sparta Daniel Crugetin.
One of its priorities would be to strengthen the relationship between FACR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the assistance of which it will lobby at the highest political level to extract more money to sports from lottery collections.
"This is one of the key moments to be taken by the new president."
"If taxes are taxed, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where the money will go," he said.
Pazlik does not consider his relationship with the Plzeń Club a burden, although he claims that the President of FACR should be independent.
Peltha's connected to the Jablonez, and Raichl with the Prague Docla.
"It's not a perfect option."
"But I can't see any sense in the hypocrisy transfer of my Pluzzien club's shares to someone else, as I'm going to go back in six months," said Pazlik.
Pelta promised new FACR rules that would avoid the Election Pat
Two days before the general soccer association, one of the candidates to the President, Miroslav Pelt, promised that if he was elected, he would fight for the new FACR rules to avoid electoral disputes in the future.
Until the Thursday negotiations in Nimburg, the official of Jablonec remains optimist and believes that the attention from the pre-election fight will have a sense of distraction from today's expected success in our soccer collection.
Before the elections failed in September, Pelt promised that if he won, he would focus on both the representation and the receipt of funds.
He decided to participate in the elections at the last moment before the last General Assembly, and the two-month delay could be useful for him to resist his ideas of football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have long been in football, and they expect the president to be famous on Thursday."
"They feel that it is time for someone to head the association," said the person mainly associated with the Jablonec club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Association.
This gives him reason to assume that he is sufficiently experienced to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems were caused by the eufory that was ruled during the rule of Ivan Haschek.
" Unfortunately, rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted in the general meeting in June."
"If no different ways of representation were adopted, we would have already had a president since September," said Pelta.
It referred to the core document of the civil association as a false goal for delegates.
"If I become president, I will consider it my personal task, and I will take my personal responsibility if this attempt is unsuccessful."
"It is a fundamental question we cannot exist without," said Pelta.
Besides, he says he's not trying to qualify himself in the background of the rivals.
In the past, he claimed that he could present his cooperation with Jindrich Richl, who he appreciated for legal education; he was fully aware of the fact that his candidate should be his first Vice-President.
For a long time, he hasn't attacked Thomas Pazlic, who has always criticised Pelt.
"He's in football over a year and has made some success."
"However it is, his attacks were inappropriate, and many people surprised the methods of his pre-election campaign."
"Sother and therefore some of them are now questioning his true identity," said Pelta about his competitiveness, and he claims that he is faithful to the declarations he announced in September.
He considers his primary weapons of football knowledge from the lowest-level competition to the national gathering.
The national gathering should represent the whole football.
"I would also try to stop all incidents, starting from the case of gods or the consequences of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would then focus on the negotiations both with the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for all football," said the 40-year-old candidate of CTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the football head would not bring out staff releases.
"I will need to know the official instructions of individual staff." It was his letter to the insurance, where the period of intergovernmentality is a clear nerve.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios associated with the planned General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will be in Nimburg on Thursday.
"If the only question is how to make elections in the third round, we can handle it."
"The football needs the trust he can only obtain by finally choosing his leader," said Pelta, who two days before the key day of his worker's career remains optimist.
Richl promises that FACR will work actively with its leadership
If the meeting on Thursday, Jindrih Railh, the Vice-President, becomes the president of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association will be desperate.
Richl promises that if he is chosen, the time of hard work will come.
He wished to establish changes in the system and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual fields of football.
He also promised to solve the problem of the Czechs; to improve relations with the EUFA and with FIFA; to attract more money to football; and to continue the work of the former President Ivan Hashek.
"As President, I'd like to focus on football as a whole."
"Of international contacts with EUFA and FIFA, to national collection, professional football and youth football activities."
"I don't want to say that I will do it myself," said Richl in his interview for CTK.
"I am a team player, and I want to distribute powers in the executive committee so that each member will focus on a specific area."
"I'm sharing the tasks carefully so that each of these football segments will make great steps forward."
"It may not be liked by many people, because it would mean hard work, rather than just criticizing the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in football movement, assuming, made him doubt his candidacy.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if there is any sense in this, and that I will not be surrounded by men who put my sticks in the wheels and question my every step," he explained his doubts.
"Nonetheless, many people told me that I should not give up, otherwise others will come."
"This is the trust I can't dismiss," he said.
Furthermore, he said that his motivation was to continue the work he started with Haschek.
"The larger number of work has been done in the past two years, and I don't want to rewrite it."
"The processes have been initiated that could result in a few years later, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, would be elected, the situation in the Association can be returned to what was before Haschek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's not what Mirek Pelt is competent."
"He is surrounded by people who would take football so that it would be available only to the elected."
"I can be accused of a lot, but I'm certainly not subject."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just the selected minority," said Richl.
Furthermore, he opposes charges that he will only be the President of the Czech Republic.
"Although many people are trying to claim the opposite, I plan to make the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about the division of the second League into the Czech and the Sea parts whose winners would continue fighting in the first league."
"It will prevent the current situation when there are only three maritime teams in the League, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Richl.
While the presidential struggle was enrolled by the Chief of the Plzeń Tomas Pazlik club, Raichl did not dare assess his chances of winning.
"Nonetheless, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as its Vice-President, and I see that I have achieved some obvious success," said Raichl. He has been able to save tens of millions of crowns in uncomfortable contracts, talks on television contracts and negotiations on the law on the lottery.
On the other hand, he partially blames himself for lack of unity in the association.
Acknowledging that Pelt was “exclusively excluded from the process of returning credit to Czech football”, he considered another competitor, Pazlik, a strong candidate who had something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he worked well in Plzan this year."
"If it is chosen, I hope that he continues what Ivan Haschek started without substantial staffing changes in the committees."
"He would not distort the facts for his benefit," said Richl about his rival.
The most beautiful pools of Europe
Jump into the Water
Julia Stanek
Children's pools with universal fibre optics and status pools in Budapest. Travelers can test the incredible water of Europe - and relax the body in the jacuzzi after a city or walking.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meader couldn't do during her research trips for the last year and a half: without her bathing suit.
Laying on her back in the water, she looked up with a taste of the shaped dome, flying to the marble cherubs waiting for it at the end of the pool and loved a carefully recovered sailing pool like ar-novo.
She hastened to add every loved pool to her book - with important details about the construction and history of the building.
The historian of the architecture of Meder reviewed more than 200 sailing pools -- and now gathered impressions in its recently published book Badefreuden (Badefruden), from public pools in München to historic bathing castles in the Black Forest and “functional concrete buildings” in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited the bathrooms in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Poland and in a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a real enthusiast of the bath culture.
She experienced very little enthusiasm on sports, said Meder, but it was different in the water.
The only deficiency is that the swimming fans should be treated with the blue café tile and the smell of chlorine, while the runners can breathe with a fragile smell of wave forests or listen to a joyful chirication of birds in the park.
"I once asked myself why the swimming pools should always be so horrible," said the Vienna Meder.
"So I started gathering beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
The flashing in the pool and well-bearing oils in the sauna is such a healing factor in the bathroom, because the Meader believes that all emotions are stimulated.
And the sailing pools can be a real pleasure for the eyes if the builders take such work. "Instead of the sex in the pool, you have the surface of water."
"The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is visible: high roofs, color tiles and tramplins.
The illustrated publication of the Bathing Radost on 190 pages contains valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of health oasis -- and it causes you to want to jump into water.
The Mader water collector found several excellent copies during the research in Hungary.
She found a rich water in the carst cave (Mischolz Tapoltz) and a term bath filled with pumping water in a building built in a bottle (Varosi Termalfürdö, Jasbery), as well as a wonderful therapeutic bathroom, such as 100-year-old Bath of Secheni in Budapest.
Of many heated open pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, an amazing appearance is opened, and you can see the whole Zurich from the bathroom on the roof or look at the snowy Arlberg from the open pool in St. Anthony, and there is a couple window that allows you to see what happens on the ski.
The most unusual design is expected from swimmers in Langgenfeld.
The winter is raised by a couple of three open shells, which seem very small in the back of the Ethal Mountains.
Algambra, Swartzwald
The collaborator of pools was not in every pool that had a chloral smell.
Many term baths smell gray, and Arpad's baths smell so much with oil in Beccastab that you may be difficult to believe that you're in a healing source.
The smell of hydrocarbonates in the pumping water is almost black from the eil that sticks to the skin as soon as you flood into a pool - a healing experience of a certain type.
At a certain point, though, Iris Meader was disappointed in finding beautiful places for swimming. When she tried to visit the open Czech bathrooms in Lugachovica, she found that the territory was printed.
The baths designed by architect Dushan Yurkovich in 1902 were closed.
When the Meder looked into the viewed windows of the red-white-white building, she saw the cables growing between café tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on hot tracks, the remarkable swimming pool in Schwarzwald is the Palace of Termal Waters in Bud Wildbad.
The pools have already been through three stages of construction, and you will find not only the neo-roman elements of the period after the construction of 1844 but also the Mauritanian Hall in the style of Algambri, added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Termal Palace is the favorite swimming pool of Iris Meader, and not only because it's from Schwarzwald.
"It is a real achievement to combine such different architecture styles," said Meder.
Speaking into the thermal pool in such a palace is obviously a second-step exercise.
Speculation of agricultural products
The Bank is investigating trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tives
Will Dojce Bank stop tradeing agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Ackermann had given the working group a task to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor worldwide.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg -
According to one study, 84 per cent of the Germans are considered unacceptable that banks speculate for agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two thirds of the questionnaires are required that Dojce Bank and other banks cease trade in agricultural products, as trade is aggravating problems that are facing the poorest people around the world.
Conclusions were made in a study conducted by the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa from the Foodwatch Consumer Organization.
The study is based on the report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harald Schuman, demonstrates that the world trade rates are higher and that banks are thus involved in global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is directed directly against the head of the Doyce Bank of Josef Ackermann, although large banking houses, such as Godman Sax and Morgan Stanley, are also traded.
Trade rates were originally contemplated as a means of protecting traders from price collaboration.
Nevertheless, most experts now agree that the players rejected the rules of proposal and demand - and are profited from the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to the criticism and pledged to investigate the charges and said that no trade was "no worth risking the good reputation of the Doyche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the charges contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year when the results will be submitted to the Board of Directors of Doyche Bank, with recommendations for action.
The head of the Bank then plans to announce the changes followed by the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may fall or end completely.
Ackermann's working on his image.
President Foodwatch Tilo Bode rejoiced with the news by emphasizing his critical attitude to the financial sector.
As the main lobbyst of the bank, Ackermann has a certain responsibility, according to Bode.
"The Bank must remove all the investments that make money at food prices," said Bodee.
"It doesn't matter whether it is a hungry person or a reputation of the Doyche Bank."
The rapid reaction of Ackermann was surprised at first, but the Director would like to have an immediate image just a few months before his office was completed.
The Bureau announced on Monday that the Chairman would not move into the Observation Board as planned.
Abolition of the speculation of food products market could improve its image.
He also has almost no need to take care of the costs, with the consequences of the successor.
Each second would have refused investment in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep the manager's pressure.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users joined the organization's campaign.
Bode published a study on Tuesday, a study was conducted for the Institute of Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa 7 and 8 November, and 1001 people participated.
Not more than eleven per cent believe that investments that make the food price is acceptable for the Doyche Bank.
Many bankers would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such trade.
43 per cent would be recommended to leave the bank, 49 per cent said that they would consider closing the bill and transition into another bank.
Home of the 21st century in Vienna
Pavilion is new
Ingeborg Vinsovski
The architectural history with rises, falls and happy ends. The Austrian Pavilion for the World Exhibition of 1958 in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, deserted and abandoned.
Now it's opened again as an exhibition center.
The Pavilion of Austria, designed by Carl Schwanzer for the World Exhibition of 1958 in Brussels, is a well-known example of the modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glass halls, courageous to believe in technical progress.
Pavilion Schvancera conquered the Grand Pri in the architecture in 1958 for his light steel and glass.
The building is considered to be a ceiling in a modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
Finally, he was celebrated for the world in 1973 by his legendary fourchcylindrical tower of BMW and its sister - a building in the form of a glass.
The Pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was transferred to the Swiss Garden near the South Vienna District, converted and opened as Museum of the 20th century in 1962, and is often referred to as “Home of the 20th century” for that reason.
However, the building did not fit in the technical and spatial museum -- there were no walls on which art works could be hanged, and bad air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern arts in Vienna received a new home.
The house has been deserted since 2001, and its condition has become worse and worse.
The architect Adolf Crishanitz has now restored a pavilion called the “Home of the 21st century” and will be used as a Museum of Modern Art.
This museum is a museum of Belveder, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday night, in all senses a joyful event.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became a new director of the Austrian Gallery of Belveder in 2007, has contributed to a new start.
Husslein-Arko, a student of the History of Arts with a brilliant career figurer in youth who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and eventually became the founder and director of the Contemporary Museum in Salzburg, convinced politicians and guards to continue reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations and decided how the building would be used.
The new museum had to contain a permanent exposation of the FRIC WATRUSA Foundation, a cafeteria and a book store along with modern art, and a office building was also built.
Strict control & limited budget
Crishanitez was then a perfect candidate to implement the project.
He was known, of course, by restauring and expansion of the Vienna Secesion, Josef Olbrich, and he won the competition, but he also learned from Swancer at the Vienna University of Technology, and the pavilion was a “exclusively important place” for him, where he attended the exhibition“ start every week”.
He knew the original design and knew the tasks that stood before the building, a building that had already lost part of its size and ease when transferred to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that occurred at the last restructuring were much more serious, and the building was “consumers of energy”, said Crishanitz.
The window profiles on the glass facility were replaced, a strong glass-wake safe glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced by a high-sistage safe glass.
The steel heat bridge translations were strengthened or replaced, and the asbest was removed from the ceilings.
Two lower floors created space for new use of the building, a lighting well between the building and the streets provides lighting - a practically new building, but still a delicate pavilion of Schwanzer.
The original external doors were stored, and the building was decorated in the old red brown color of protection against corrosion.
The movie Hall was the same as it was before.
All of this with strict museum management control and a limited budget.
"We often had to find a material that was good, cheap and would be approved by the museum management," Cryshanitez said, pointing to an inequality motion in the basement.
The building remained flexible and light, despite the limitations, problems and conversion.
Crichanist recently noticed that the pavilion "from Brussels" was a rough, typical history of "capley in the city".
Such architecture, "without its place" still wishes to stimulate real awareness.
The house of the 21st century is in a very right place, since the city's planned unexpected luck has occurred. The entire reconstructed “main station” with offices and housing real estate grows around the Swiss garden.
The house of the 21st century may be supplemented by the second building of the Crishanites, a Collectioner of Francesca von Gabsburg, acquired the Berlin Temporary exhibition Hall and has reportedly been negotiating with the city on its neighbourhood in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans a multi-million winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn announced an anti-crisis plan to avoid winter train cancellation.
The number of staff should be doubled.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and train delays.
Recalling the internal anti-crisis plan Deutsche Bahn, Bild reports that up to 2015, investments were planned to be around 300 million euros.
Investments are intended to improve the capacity of local and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of own and attracted staff involved in the cleaning of snow from roads and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms from snow and ice before the start of work and 90 per cent of the necessary arrows within four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned about the possibility of cancelling and delaying trains by the winter at the meeting with Government leaders and industry two months ago.
During the last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced significant difficulties with passenger carriage, as she lacked reserves at the deterioration of weather conditions.
A number of new regional trains have been expected to approve the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays with the ICE train delivery.
Deutsche Bahn has also had much more frequently checked ICE train axes after one of the ICE trains broke right at the main station in Kelne.
The Bank will pay many millions of pounds of fines in the United States
New troubles have come from anxiety around Josef Ackermann, Director-General of the Doyche Bank: Doyche Banku threatens a fine in the United States in many millions of pounds of sterlings.
As if Doyche Bank had no problems in the family, the history of an industrial giant in the United States has now caused him, and the Bank with the headquarters in Frankfurt will pay 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to relieve the disputes resulting from the bankruptcy during the financial crisis of five largest credit unions.
The problem was around the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Administration of Credit Unions (NCUA), the financial market regulator, accuses a number of largest banks that they used false promises to trigger credit unions to buy their financial products by deceive.
The value of bonds has fallen sharply during the financial crisis and has brought down credit unions.
"We are pleased that we have resolved this problem without the appeal of the parties to the court," said the representative of the Doyche Bank in New York.
The bank did not accept its guilt in the agreement.
The same is true for Citigroup who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
President of NCUA, Debbie Matz, welcomed the operational response of both banks.
The National Loan Management (NCUA) is responsible for the US credit unions and interferes with bankruptcy processes to protect consumer contributions.
The NCUA is fighting for compensation for the losses that emerge from billions.
This is the first agreement of this kind.
The regulator also drew attention to other largest banks and summer excited the case against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Suspicious mortgage liabilities are so-called valuable papers secured by mortgage loans.
They are supported by internal loans.
This resolved the fate of a number of financial companies when a bubble in the US real estate market in 2007.
The American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long time to live in September 2008 in a financial crisis.
A few years later, U.S. banks are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators have made a large amount of claims to pay compensation or punish fraud.
For the largest vave claim, the Federal Office for Housing Financing (FHFA).
It accuses 18 biggest international banks that they acquired Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac credit agreements for approximately $200 billion.
The Bank also stands before the threat of the prosecution by FHFA on numerous agreements of the total value of $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires that the bank with headquarters in Frankfurt take responsibility for " significant losses", but has not yet indicated the exact amount.
The Bank rejected claims as unreasonable and reported the intention to dispute them.
Warren Buffet invests 10 billion in IBM
The financial guru of Buffet actively invests in the IT company of IBM.
From March, he bought shares for a total of more than ten billion dollars.
As far as the largest US investor Warren Buffet has always stated that he does not invest in computers and IT companies, as their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the IBM annual report changed his view of investment in the industry.
According to Buffet, he had to understand much earlier that IBM offers services and purchases computer systems for other companies' IT departments.
In the financial world, the investment of Warren Buffett was considered a knightship.
The IBM, the IT veteran, has now received the title "Sir IBM".
In an interview with the U.S. Business Television CNBC Buffet reported that he acquired IBM shares at $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest IBM shareholders of 5.5 per cent.
Buffet said that even IBM had recently known nothing about his participation.
He commended the management that managed to make profits even during the financial crisis.
"They did a great job," said Buffet, considering the management strategy.
The IBM was focused on high-income IT-services, such as the date-centres.
The founder of the computer industry, who is now over 100 years old, also offers software and consultative services, as well as powerful business computers.
Buffet has still avoided technological companies.
He claimed that he was investing only in those companies whose business he understood
Invested, for example, in cargo carriages, fitting materials and machinery.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway owns a long list of largest companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (ex Münchener Rück), along with about 80 its own daughter companies.
The 81-year-old acquired a small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built one of the most expensive companies in the world with skilled investments.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
By making it a cult for countless investors around the world.
His almost unchanged instinct of money has brought him a nickname "Oracula from Omaha."
The IBM share price increased by one per cent before the markets were opened after the Buffet investment announcement.
The Blue Giant, as they still call IBM, stands on a fund market of over $220 billion, which makes it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world along with Apple and Microsoft.
But Buffet said that he would not invest in Microsoft.
Her founder Bill Gates is his close friend.
Unlimited Danger
Following the discovery of the "Cattle in Zwickkau", Turkish media began to doubt the power of the law in Germany.
One newspaper says "blood ideology", which is now rising up to the surface.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessmen between 2000 and 2006 were the result of a real extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have been a response to this communication in Turkey and in the German-Turkey community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has caused long-forgotten fears, and such law-extremist attacks have not been in Melne since November 1992 and Zollingen in May 1993.
There has never been doubts, however, that xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the proextremist network now discovered has such a scale that is not fully aware of.
"Regeneration of bloody ideology?" was the title of the website of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informant of the secret services, and expresses concern that the German authorities could be involved in the proextremist mud.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) responded quietly, mentioning the victims of racial hatred by silent picket against the Brandenburg gates on this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin at a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German and Turkish bilateral employment agreement.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light -- as a history of success.
The lighting in some Turkish media was a shake. “Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary” is a name of one article in the Turkish "Haber X" portal, commenting on the circumstances of a series of murders.
The German Hürriyet also did not miss this parallel.
"It's starting to smell bad" is the name of the Amet Khulahji column.
He noted that people who paid taxes and their work had contributed significantly to the transformation of Germany were killed.
Police behaviour and succession have been criticised against German-Turkish Internet Forums.
The authors asked why the German authorities did not think before to monitor suspicious persons in the law-extremist circles.
Some authors have come to a rather sharp rhetoric. "If they continue to act similarly, migrants will have no choice but armed self-defense."
"It'll be the best self-defense."
"The world in Germany depends very much on how the whole network will be opened and on the rightfulness of punishment," says Selen.
Crimes in Melne and Zollingen in the 1990s were an example that the world in Germany was threatened.
The photograph of burned ruins in Zollingen was deeply in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
No other event showed to Turks who live here so clearly that they were in danger, and the Germans -- that improperity and indifference could come into real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of Turkish unity.
Do not repeat past errors
The Turkish press was convicted mainly by the failure of the German police after the attacks. Helmut Kol refused to visit survivors in Melne.
He sent a telegram of compassion to the President of Turkey after the burns in Zollingen, but the participation in the memorial ceremony in Kelne adopted his Minister for Foreign Affairs, Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel, in his speech, calculated the taxes that Turks pay in Germany,
It's like he defines the value of a person by the taxes he pays.
The current lighting in Turkish media has reiterated how many German Turks have been deepened since then to the current German State.
It has clearly shown what to be done now in addition to the efforts to identify and reevaluate law-extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bank scandal on the Turich Lake
Most leaders are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS was almost bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been fighting with one, another crisis since then.
Now the German has to get him back to the faithful course.
Alex Webber probably didn't think he'd play this role.
In July, after his effective retirement from the head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that it would begin at least an effective post in 2013, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Greatest Swiss Bank of UBS; an unexpected and profitable career course.
Alex Webber was apparently delighted, praised Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for the remaining strength and made several friendly observations to his future colleagues.
"UBS has been able to change to the best."
"I look forward to working with Caspar Philliger and Oswald Grubell."
But in September, it became clear that everything would be completely different.
Trader UBS in London circulated bank security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Executive Director Oswald Grubel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the President of the UBS Board of Directors is considered sick, and everyone wants to know, when will Alex Webber finally become his position?
Weber should consult the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank stated on Tuesday, it would take the position of the President of the Council in May, not in 2013.
It won't be easy for Alex Webber.
He is an economy professor and specialist in the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and it will certainly need time to adapt.
He suddenly was responsible for the bank's strategy, which once again proved that he had earned the term “the largest bank scandal in Europe”.
The UBS, on the one hand, has recently managed the largest assets in the world, and with the other years, does not come out of scandals.
The proud Swiss bank seems to save nothing.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a great reputation.
The Bank has linked the image of a secret and sustainable but, at the same time, the fancy manager of assets with ambitious goals and aims to become the largest player in investment banking.
As a result, UBS managed 1.6 billion in 2007, thus having more money in management than any other bank in the world,
As an investment bank, the largest banks of the world have entered the League.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, former banker and professor of banking, who has long been a teacher at the Institute for Banking Affairs of the University of Zurich, explains: "I have always brought UBS to my students as a model of a good bank."
"We know what we know right now, you can ask how I could have made such a mistake."
He was really wrong.
Only in 2007, it was clear that something in UBS was going wrong.
In the middle of the year, the executive director Peter Wuffley, who was considered as an excellent intellectual and to the same extent a brilliant banker, suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we could guess why he left.
The Investment Division of the Bank tried to play substandard securities and had to write billions.
You want to believe that you don't want to, but UBS reported an increase in capital by 13 billion Swiss francs to resist the crisis.
The Bank was really able to find investors -- but investors from whom many bankers had recently denied courtesy -- one very transparency Asian sovereign Fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign Fund hidden so much that even its name has not been reported.
It was only the first hit.
In April 2008, everything has become much worse.
The Bank had to announce new billions of losses, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, the second level of salary, the Chairman of the Board of Directors in Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
There was a disaster in October 2008, due to the lack of investment during the UBS financial crisis, and the State had to be saved.
The National Bank bought UBS toxic prices for unnamed billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for the converted bond with a mandatory conversion to be the owner of the bank.
All Switzerland was shocked: the country realized the dramatic implications of huge banks in the small country.
Finally, UBS was five times higher in 2007 than all Switzerland's production (see graph).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says a bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster came shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the United States and stated that he was willing to transmit the data of the rich clients who may have departed from taxes through the bank.
UBS has also agreed to pay $780 million comprising unjustified business income plus fines.
The UBS therefore recognized more or less as a tax removal tool.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been its advantage in fighting for rich clients, the secrecy curtain.
After that scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The result of the client's money was started.
In a few months, the bank has lost confidence in both main areas of its activities -- in investment due to failures of speculation and in the management of assets as a result of assistance and promotion of tax removal.
And it only calmed down, and it seemed that UBS had been able to break the situation, as it happened with the trader's affirmation, and a single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
It is clear that risk management in the investment department is not yet working.
"The incident with Aboli clearly showed that risk control had not changed enough," said Martin Jansen, professor of economy and finance at the Swiss Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks also doubts: "The problem of UBS is that he has no risk control tools."
The long-term precaution of Swiss bankers have been the guardians of the world's largest assets, not the excessive risk, but the security for money, regardless of whether or not the world has fallen outside the Alpine republic or not.
Swiss banks safes have become a symbol of incomplete reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize a delicate chocolate taste.
UBS headquarters in Zurich are still in line with the form of a decent Swiss private bank, but a little more.
Her position is classic.
The bank's head office is located in Zurich in Banchofstrasse, which is headed from the main station to the Turich Lake, in the surroundings of Swiss Mountains.
Buildings are excellent, and the rental rates for shops are one of the highest in Europe.
Among traditional Swiss stores such as Confiserie Sprüngli can be found jewelry companies such as Tiffany's.
The Swiss banks were located here for hundreds of years from the National Bank to the Palace of Credi Suiss and elite private banks, such as Julius Ber.
The heavy door leads to UBS lobby.
There are large skin couches along the walls covered by the marble.
UBS knows his clients need reliability.
But both largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point rejected Swiss banking concepts -- or, according to the head of one of the small Swiss banks, have betrayed them.
He would not like to see his name in the newspaper -- like all Swiss bankers, he also cooperates with two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too large -- in particular in the investment banking, where the Englishsacks are very active.
In his opinion, Swiss people have nothing to add here.
"And if there's something, they've adapted to the English Saxon customs long ago."
Indeed, the English-Saxon investment banking changed UBS, brought him the first large profits -- and then fiasco -- and no other European financial institution lost the amount of money in the jungles of substandard assets such as the largest Swiss bank.
The catastrophe became obvious on 15 October 2008.
"The small country-owned coalition with the population of seven million people took the largest rescue operation in the country's history," wrote Lucas Hessig in his UBS Crah.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (approximately 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it come before?
If they ask Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly UBS.
Two of the largest Swiss banks were united in one large group in June 1998.
A bank has been educated, which has already been too large for small Switzerland, and the bank that continued to grow.
It also helped that two UBS banks complemented each other, one was a rich but gradual bank specialized in Zurich for the management of assets; the other was not so rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly received access to a large amount of money they could use to rotate the almighty wheel.
Two names relate to UBS growth: Peter Wolffley, Executive Director of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wolfley and Ospel were a dream team," said the bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wulfley, an excellent intellectual, modest and deeply understanding models and statistics, and Osplel with his internal instinct, which went all the way up, starting from the intern at the bank."
But the Osplel eventually relied on Wolffley.
And Wolfley could have made a critical mistake. "He thought his models were reality," Geiger said.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
The pride precedes the defeat.
UBS officials remember the meetings of members of the government, where Wolffley always repeated the same slogan - to move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he led the tournament table where banks had been successful.
UBS wanted to reach the top of the table.
He was able to make a part of this path.
UBS was the largest player in the trade in currency and public valuable papers.
The mandatory management consultants, however, indicated the weakness of the parameters called "permanent income" in banking terms, was far behind the biggest banks.
UBS had failures in American mortgage products.
In order to shut up the hole, UBS went into an adventure that almost cost him a lifetime.
In pursuit of growth, the bank and their hedge fund themselves have invested in American substantial securities.
This has developed into a large mechanism that combined valuable papers based on US mortgage loans and continued to sell them on its own risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way to get out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
"UBS was buying until summer 2007 when the US real estate market was already in fire," said the bank analyst Geiger.
The higher growth, the deeper the fall.
One director had to go after another when the attempts to order the bank had been more difficult than it seemed in the first place.
UBS posts have become children's game with chairs and remain unreliable until now.
It is almost impossible for anyone who leads this huge bank.
He must find a strategy for the bank that turned back to all existing business models.
Heiger's bank analyst has already had an idea to give up investment banking, focus on assets management and forget its Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not ready to go so far.
However, it is obvious that investment activities must be significantly improved.
The new head of the Bank, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present its future strategy on Tuesday.
51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was actually considered only as a temporary decision when the bank suddenly broke up with his predecessor Grubel.
For the past time, he was able to show the nature and now, as the Turich Bank said on Turich on Tuesday, the UBS headed on a permanent basis.
Ernotti plans to restore the investment bank to the state in which it was in the mid-90s.
It reduces 3500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs the concept of development.
What's UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These questions must be questioned by Axel Webber.
He still publicly said that he and his wife were looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
The recession concerns in Europe are declined by the American Fundamental Bank
The ongoing recession in Europe has deteriorated the mood of American investors at the beginning of the week.
The change of Governments in Athens and Rome had no great effect.
Industrial production declined the hope that the debt crisis could be overcome in fertility.
The general relief followed by the shifts of Governments in Rome and Athens has not been retained.
The euro fell in relation to the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half full, not half empty -- but now the problems are again ongoing, said Mark Luskini from Janney Mongomery Scott.
The financial markets were, inter alia, on sales lists.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index closed at the level of 12.078 with 0.6 per cent fall.
The market barrometer was declined between 12.027 and 12.170 items.
The broader S&P 500 has closed at the level of 1251, dropping by one per cent.
The Nasdaq Technological Index lost 0.8 per cent by trafficking in 2657 points.
In Frankfurt Dax, it fell by 1.2 per cent by closing 5985 points.
Industries in 17 euro zones have significantly reduced production and are adapted to the end of growth.
The Eurostat Statistical Service reported that the company had produced two per cent less in September than the previous month.
This message has struck American investors into skepsis. "We are not on the island, we are dependent on them," said Steve Goldman from Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe would hardly quickly strike the recession and that banks show further signs of weakness.

He therefore believed that it was too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffet threw the principle in the trash for a few decades and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM amounted to more than ten billion dollars during the trade price of the older company's shares almost one per cent against the trend.
The shares closed, almost without changing, at $187,35.
Buffet stated that he paid $170 for stock and now shared 5.5 per cent.
The cost of his investment company Berkshire Hathway dropped by 1.3 per cent.
The Bank of America has fallen by 2.6 per cent, much stronger than the market.
The bank converted to cash almost all its remaining share of the China Building Bank, delivering $6.6 billion.

Intelligent crows fill the cities
The experts today say that these very smart birds will no longer be expelled from towns.
Some love birds, others want to get rid of them as soon as possible, and the crowns have been part of the city landscape for centuries, but the inhabitants complaining about dirt and noise are increasingly in many inhabitants.
The problem of birds, however, has not yet been achieved.
In the first symposium devoted to crowns, experts in Ler, Eastern Frisia, claimed that the player could not be expelled from towns.
Specialists from all Germany discussed possible decisions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Conservationists argued that the root of the problem in cities was in migration of specially protected players, pointing out that the use of agricultural chemicals had increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
The complicated lives of birds were complicated by hunting, building and cutting the traditional trees.
The crowns are under protection.
There are large colonies of over 600 parent couples in the town of Zest in Westfall and northwest in Jever, Dipholce, Ahima under Bremen and Lere.
The unequivocated project for the shooting of crowns in Lere called for disagreeable newspaper titles in 2005.
Critics described the trap of birds and slaughtering them with their sticks as a special cruelty.
"The usual movement and scaring are nothing," said the architect and landscape designer Werner Claver from Lear.
The struggling of water or sewing of trees often has undesirable consequences, said Manfred Kaiser from Lar, Baden-Wurthamberg.
"Livings are dissolving, and large colonies are divided and distributed into other areas."
Fear can only be exempted from hospitals, houses of elderly and schools.
"We're gonna have to live with them, not to get rid of them."
The problem in cities will not be solved in the fields," said Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kelner.
The combination of birds from the protection of living areas and incentives to return to other areas could be an exit.
"Information stends instead of benzopil" was a slogan proposed by the psychologist and ethnologist of Utah, Maria Yurgens, who is a totally different approach to birds. "We must be sure to live with this problem."
Yurgens was one of the founders of the educational crown route in Asherberg, Slezwig Holstein, where information was provided on the information stairs on the life of very reasonable players.
The project has already caused the interest of tourists.
Yurgens also expressed her opinion on the noise made by the birds. "They have a lot of information to tell each other."
The birds and the birds have come into legends, and the players often use not only the weapons to capture those who look at, but also make the weapons themselves.
Students of conduct at Cambridge University have recently tested the bird mind measure in four players.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that it was necessary to knock on the rain to get a liquor of prayer.
Without special training, they recognized the size and shape of the stone needed to slap the rain.
In another experiment, a more complicated challenge had to be addressed by the intelligent players.
Researchers put a small leather with a liquor of prayer in the vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get a bowl.
But the researchers gave them pieces of provokes.
All four birds used to make hooks and hooks to pinch the wire on the pen and get it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four players have handled this since the first attempt.
Ronaldu is leading Portugal to Euro-2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks to win in the last minute have not been lasted for a long time.
Portugal, Croatia and Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland took the latest seats in the Euro-2012 championship in Poland and Ukraine.
Under the leadership of the superstar, Christian Ronald, who screwed over 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal won Bosnia and Herzegovina with account 6:2 (2:1), perfectly designing its fifth entrance to the Euro after 0:0 at the first stage.
The Czechs had enough 1:0 (0:0) in the second round of playoff against the outside of Montenegro after the pure victory in the first round (2:0).
Croatia has not missed its chance, playing 0:0 against Turkey, and Ireland has easily reached accounts 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24 minutes), Nelder Postga (72 and 82) and Miguel Velozu (80s) slaughtered the rest of the naked for Portugal.
The former Bundesligi professional player from Wolfsburg, Zvezdan Misimovic and Captain Emir Spahic, minimized two different points by the efficient tool for 41 minute and 65th goal for Bosnia.
Sena Lulich received the second yellow card for 54 minutes.
Portugal has already expelled Bosnia from the 2010 World Championship in South Africa.
Portugal has made a great start at Lisbon Estadiu da Lus.
Ronaldu took a early start, hitting a gate of about 30 meters.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his remote capacities, with a 25-foot tag increased to 2:0.
The Bosnians who did not open the account in the first half hour received their first opportunity by the attacker Edin Jacko.
The former Wolfsburg player from the leader of the English champion Manchester City for the 33th minute sent the ball to the bottom of the stange, but the ball didn't cross the gate line.
Yiraček is taking care of Czech Republic
Then Judge Wolfgang Stork from Ergolding was emphasized.
Following the attack on Elder Post in the Bosnian penalty for the 36th minute, Stork decided that the Portuguese player simulated and showed him a yellow card.
Stork also sentenced suspicious tools for the game with a hand after Fabiu Quentran - Misimovic implemented it.
Following the interruption of the vice champion of Europe in 2004, four more goals have been established.
Peter Yiraček discontinued all the doubts remaining regarding the Czechs for the 81st minute.
Europe's championships are sent to the European Championship on the fifth sequence of the year 1976.
Happiness was also smiling to the Coach Michal Bilek and Legioners of Bundesligi Michael Cudletz (Bayer Levercusen) and Thomas Peckhart (1. FC Nürnberg) after the error at the beginning, which could be a catastrophic.
The doorman Peter Chech for the 9th minute, thanks to the immediate reflex, prevented the potential cargo of Thomas Sivoka.
The best chances of Montenegro were when Stevan Jovetich and Dean Damianovic duet were on the field.
Damianovic hit the end of the fine area for the 40th minute and almost stabbed the Czech naked.
After the retreat of the cang, he rescued a champion of the Czech world class after the Forward FC Seul left the field for the 50th minute.
The winning goal was stuck just before the final whistle.
In the meantime, Turkey was lacking football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after the loss of 0:3 in Istanbul, Turks were unable to play better than the 0:0 in Zagreb.
Although there is no doubt now that Gus Hidingk's coach will now release the place on the team chamber to the third place in 2002, Croatia is fourth time in the final tour of the European championship.
The Turks were almost perfectly launched in the eyes of 31,000 viewers at the Maximir stadium.
Seljuk Inan's long-term strike got in the stand for seven minutes, and the Kazim Cazim attacker couldn't turn the ball into the net.
After that, Croatia waked up and increased its control of the game.
After the break, the Croatians continued the game in a great shape.
Legioners of Bundesligi Daniel Pranich (Bavaria, München) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Aintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field along with Mario Manjukich from the Wolfsburg team, who resigned the seat of Ivan Perishic from Dortmund for 62 minutes.
Trapatoni is going to Euro-2012.
The Irish people in Dublin celebrated their first entrance to the Euro after Germany in 1988.
The coach's team, Giovanni Trapatoni, who seemed confident in its place after winning 4:0 in the first stage, took leadership for the 32th minute thanks to Steven Ward's naked.
Constantine Vasilev, a guest team, compared the $57th account.
Ireland took a good pace since the beginning, but only at 23th minute, Robbie Keen in Los Angeles made the first pure goal hit
At the last moment, the Estonian Protector had been able to prevent it from leading Ireland forward.
The hall was stuck for 32 minutes.
Having rounded the protection of Paul Londak, Ward was in the right place and, putting the ball through the line, changed the account at 1:0.

Mass murders - human dimension
The tense and very good new book of Peter Englund “Beauty and Grief: Personal History of the First World War” begins with a long list of acting persons from whom the heart is freezing.
Here is the advice to read: Carefully cut off the page and use it as a bookmark.
You will meet these people very close as Mr. Englund's story, and this list of acting persons will be your GPS, your lighter at the time when you, as one of these men and women, get off the road and lose in the mist of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He was also a new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which served the Nobel Prize on Literature.
The book he wrote right now is unusual, he describes it quite exactly as an anti-history work.
There are few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, fancy journalists or discussions of tactics and war technology.
It's not that much of the book about what it was -- he explains how much the book about what it looked like -- it's about feelings, impressions, experiences, and the state of the spirit.
The book " Beautiful and Grief" combined the experience of the military years of 20 or less unmarkable men and women, from both sides of the front line, from schools and scientists to alpines, doctors, rapid and servants.
Some of these people will be heroes.
Someone gets in prison, loses his arm or his leg, gets mad or dies.
Their lives are flooded here as church candles: new ones are added to the crowd of others, and some are gassing at that time.
The book of Mr. Englund is to leave the historical books standard.
This is also an amendment to the idea that the First World War was only a heavy war in the West Front.
The Beauty and Grief has been able to give the panorama of other military theatre: Alps, Balkans, Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are falling by bees; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under pyramids; the unsolved problem is the much of cece.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people as a natural disaster, like a hurricane of Katrina, smelling in a smokeless dust.
When the cannada is close to you and you're a woman and you're home with children, will you stay or run away?
Anyway, who's doing this?
Almost nobody understands what's going on and why we have to fight in this war.
"The lack of facts," said Mr. Englund, "is fulfilled by speculations, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessive ideas, theories of conspiracy, dreams, nightmares and hearings."
"Beauty and grief" follows the fate of people such as Florence Farmboro, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young Navy of the German Navy of the Open Sea.
Their stories have been taken mainly from memoares, letters and other published materials.
The stories of their lives may be terrifying or exciting, but they are to the highest extent alive because of the minor moments and depths gathered by Mr. Engund.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to deal with them.
Speaking of a German school girl's story, he says, "Ersez, everywhere."
"Replacer, fake aluminium, non-existent rubber, paper links, wooden buttons."
He continues to tell about the erzac pizza in Germany.
He describes the "meat of pressed rice cooked in a barrel fat (and a decorated fake bone made of a tree); tobacco made of dried roots and dry potatoes; shoes shoes beaten by a tree."
It notes that there were "837 registered meat substitutes authorised in the production of sausage, 511 registered substitutes of coffee".
Some stories tell the honor and courage.
One American observes the desire to be cruel and says about the war, "You feel that, at the end, it is what men have been created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarette and whiskey, the evening newspaper or the bestseller, and to claim that this show is civilization and under your shirt shirt is not hiding barbar."
The British soldier, on the contrary, notices that he will probably die and no one will notice it and will be regretted.
"When a person reconciliates himself with the thought of sacrifice, he would like to think that this would happen before the public," he wrote.
But that's the opposite, it's like a "convicted man who's hanged secretly."
Other observations relate to the old Europe, which is declined, and the new types of fear.
"Conflict was increasingly economic competitive," said Mr. Englund, "military factories."
He notes the arrival of a person called "new species in the bestiary of the beginning century: a beautiful and ideologically convincing mass killer in a well-shaved suit, which fits a nursery by sitting behind the written table."
People act unpredictablely: low actions as much as heroism.
Mr. Englund told about soldiers who tried to seduce the prostitutes with a venery disease to avoid the front service.
"The most grothesic expression of this is seen in the trade of a monkey that soldiers have purchased and blurred from their genitals in hope of entering the hospital," he wrote.
"We desperate have put him in the eyes, which has often led to life's blindness."
Translated from Swedish Peter Graves, Mr. Englund flexible, but non-brous, perfectly suitable for his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, it shows how war "released completely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People start asking why their leaders force them to fight.
The best books about the I World War were often indirect, such as "The Great War and Modern Memorial" of Paul Fassel or romances such as "In the West Front Without Change" of Ericha-Mary Remarca, rather than the exhausting historical work.
The book of Mr. Englund is included in this unusual pantheon.
His book has the most amazing final that I can remember in a non-stuff literature.
I won't tell him.
But it's like he came to the page with a list of characters, grabbed it out of your hands and burned it.
After previous error, a thoroughly calculated raid
There were hundreds of police officers, some in protective helmets.
The night clocks from Monday on Tuesday were selected because the Zucotti Park had to be at least people at that time.
The operation was kept secret from all except a few high-level officers, the others first said they were leaving to learn.
The Commissioner of the police, Raymond W. Kelly, was in the centre of the event, emphasizing the importance of the police Department.
There could be no talk about the recurrence of the last weeks, such as the use of circuit gas against protesters, which was contrary to the department's rules and caused the hurricane of audiences to the occupants.
Thus, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation was launched to release the protesting Zucotti Park.
The authorities were preparing when the occupations were deployed in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis doctrines were carried out on Randells Island, counting on Zukotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called training in the case of conflicts, counter-terrorism measures, providing for the rapid movement of large numbers of police officers, in view of the Lower Manhattan.
The last training was held on Monday on the East River Manhattan side.
The order to enter the park came in "the last minute," said the source familiar with the orders in which the mission was mentioned only as "training".
"Them are several cops I know and who have been called to this case not said they were being sent to Zucotti Park," said the man who spoke under the conditions of anonymity.
"The only ones who knew they were going to Zucotti Park were at the highest posts in the department."
One of the reasons for secrecy was the lesson that acquired the city.
The authorities wanted to clean up the park on 14 October, but retreated before hundreds of protesters who went inside before the scheduled time, hearing about these plans.
During the operations on Tuesday, various police units, including police forces from the districts, used usually to control criminal circuits.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost as a job, came and left the park during the day, making an hour of the night a suitable time for the attack.
"It was right to do when the park was at least the people," he said.
Rescue machines with lighters and loud speakers gathered to Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge before moving forward.
The lighter and previously written announcements of the speakers appear to have scared many protesters.
When administrative office officers entered the park in their blue winds, many protesters simply gathered their things and left.
The police reported that the tents were not touched until 1:45 a.m., giving the protesting time to gather things.
Other police groups, according to the witnesses, were gathered on the perimeter to enter if there were arrests in the park.
The journalists in the park have been forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, representative of the Department of Police, said that it was done for their security.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see the police and that the police treated them rudely.
Mr. Brown said that cars with TV cameras at Church Street, along the west border of the park, could have taken a picture.
When the police went west through their personal protesting breasts, including bags, plastic carpets and polyethylene bags, full clothes, the Sanitary Department teams followed it, collecting what was abandoned.
Some protesters who refused to leave were expelled out and the photos of this came up on the Internet soon.
The main group of protesters has taken positions next to the kitchen of the camp, at the center of the park.
Some have built barricades, and the police came in, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the camp’s epicentre had their hands together.
And two people tied themselves to the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
To cut the castles, rescue officers were called.
No arrests were held in the park until 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The cleaning operation was completed in approximately 75 minutes, reports the police.
Mr. Brown said that about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for " violation of public order and resistance in detention," he said.
The highest officer at the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department and a senior officer in the department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, head of the Department of Search, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, although he was present, “not in charge of the operation”, said Mr. Brown.
The second police group was waiting for the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it was necessary to enter.
The fences were placed in Cortland Street, north of the park, and in Pine Street, in the neighborhood to the south.
The observers saw the police expand the perimeter even far beyond Zucotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of police officers, many with shields, pushing people even further.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night came south of the park.
About 5 a.m. to south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped on the roof of the police car, and others, according to the apparents, air was released from the police van tyres.
At some point, a piece of a faner flyed out of the crowd.
As a result, one police officer and one of the protesters had been hospitalized.
Trade union of school staff will be filed to the city for releases
The trade union, representing hundreds of school service staff who have lost places last month, plans to court the city in the Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were not necessary and discriminatory because of the unproportionate impact on schools where poor students learn.
The trial is probably the latest means available to the Union of the District Council 37 to cancel releases.
Sixty-seventy-two school assistants, a co-ordinator for work with parents and other employees who were among the low-paidest employees in the city, lost their seats on 7 October, as the trade union leaders referred to their political reaction to their refuse to give the city access to medical funds managed by working groups to close the hole in the last spring budget.
City officials categorically rejected this charge.
At the hearings in the City Council last month, the Chancellor of schools, Dennis M. Walcott, said that the releases were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the members of the Council pared him, saying that nowhere in the budget had been indicated that the subsidiary school staff would be fired.
The representatives of 37 of the District Council reported that they had notified claims, warning the Department of Education that the case was filed against it; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce a formal claim to the Supreme Court of State in Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the Department of City Education will be filed as defendants, and eight temporary recruitment workers will be listed as judges, all black or Latin American women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the city's legal department, said that the city had not seen a prosecution and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
In accordance with the preliminary version of the complaint issued by New York Times, the trade union focused on several schools in poor urban areas to support the claim of unjust treatment, claiming that poor schools have lost more assistants because they are chronicly underfinance.
He pointed out that, while there were no releases in Staten Island, and in the Upper East Side or Tribecca schools there were few, 17 subsidiary school workers lost their place in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to go to County 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of eight school assistants who worked in free high school 36 in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the law states: " These are not areas of rich parents who can find money to fulfil budget failures."
The 36th budget was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost the money when the city changed the way to calculate additional funding for every poor student entering school.
The trade union also claims that the school director could be misleading with the language of notification that allows the co-ordinators to be released from work with their parents.
The word “surplus” was used in the notification, although “excessive” is often said when the teacher from the paying statement is moved to the list of existing workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parents were fired," the quest says, "not just translated."
Mission completed, Congress is prepared for the Libya Agreement
The Republicans and democrats at the Capitol Hill seem to finally agree on something relevant to the rebellion in Libya.
All it needed was to succeed the rebellion, the ancient dictator Muamar Kaddafi was captured and killed, and the American intervention was completed.
On Tuesday, the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Senate should consider the resolution made by the President John Carrie (democrat, Massachusetts) along with the Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (independent, Connecticut), which praises the Libyans for the successful rebellion and the American troops for " courage " .
"The purpose of this resolution is to pay honors to the brave people of Libya when they begin to restore their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of support for their democratic arrangements by both parties."
The language may seem harmless, but no further discussion on Libya was easy.
This summer, the legislators of both parties argued with each other and with the White House on the formulation of a series of resolutions that endorse or condemn the role of the American army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Carrie and McKain submitted a resolution allowing the limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the Chamber of Representatives by a majority of the votes of both parties and has never been voted at the Senate.
However, on the same day when the law had failed in the House of Representatives, the Chamber also did not support the proposal that would cut off the financing of the American operation in Libya.
This left an American mission in some kind of legislative cleaning area -- when the Congress was sufficiently irritated to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not so angry that it would actually blow the ground out of her feet.
Thereafter the insolvency of the Congress
In August, Tripoli was surrendered to the Libyan rebels, and Caddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
The Senate can now be ready for action.
The Resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "is admired by the people of Libya for its incredible courage and unusual endurance in pursuing freedom" and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their unusual courage and professionalism."
The resolution also “recognizes the national interest of the United States in the successful and inadequate transition to democracy in Libya”.
Will new measures be fully supported by the Council on Foreign Affairs or would be dissolved by legislators like the June Law?
Senator Richard H. Luger, the leader of the Republicans in the Committee, spoke against the last version.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not seen the last version of the bill.
On the other hand, the Capitol of the Chamber of Representatives this week should vote for the constitutional amendment required by a balanced budget, the primary legislative priority for almost every Republican and some democrats in the Congress.
This action, proposed by the member of the House of Representatives Bob Goodlat (Republican, Virginia), would be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or anything else to be made to the plenary vote of the Congress of that convention.
Other legislators have not yet been able to amend their plenary meeting, but not because they did not try.
Amendment to Gudlat is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments affecting a wide range of issues that have been raised in that convention.
Some were duplicated -- the same bill was implemented in the Palace of Representatives and in the Senate -- others were minor differences.
There are at least 15 versions of amendments on the balanced budget only in the House of Representatives and a lot more on " control of federal expenditures " .
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors -- mostly the newly elected Republicans who wish to decorate their summary -- the opportunity to praise for their "making" such a proposal.
The Act on the Monitoring of the Budget, which took place in August, required representatives and the Senate to vote for the amendment of the balanced budget.
In March 58, the senators voted for an unnecessary resolution supporting the idea of amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen wish to limit the number of terms of members of the Congress, and a member of the House of Representatives José Serrano (democrate, New York) wishes to cancel the limitation for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson-Younger (democrat, Illinois) proposed a number of amendments that guaranteed, in addition, the right to quality education and health.
An amendment that prohibits one-pool marriage has been offered for many years, as is another prohibiting flag burning.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the abolition of federal laws if two thirds of states object to them.
As the members of the Congress have tried to propose amendments, they have progressed no faster than in the past years.
In the 111th convening of the Congress, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments, and 66 had been made in 110th.
This rate would be compared to the beginning of the 1990s, when members of the Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they did not make any more success than they did now.
The last amendment that was adopted - the 27th - was approved in 1992, but it was actually introduced to the Congress in 1789.
"Bit but not conquered," said Giffords in his first television interview after an attempt
Ten months after the armed man was shot at it in the public event in Tuson, a member of the House of Representatives Gabriel Giffords (democratic Party, Arizona) appeared on a federal channel on Monday night, songed the melody from the Broadway Solar Show will return and said that he wanted more to heal than to return to Congress.
When A.B. News and Diana Sawyer appeared in the 20/20 programme, Giffords had hardly formulated proposals and needed help in walking.
The programme showed its difficult way of recovery after the bullet injury, which broke the skull and broke the left side of the brain by passing from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she returned unexpectedly to the House of Representatives and triumphedly voted on a bill of debt.
In his first television interview after January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13 people, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang -- and called her healing difficult.
On the question of Sawyer, how she feels, 41-year-old Giffords said, "That's very good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly's astronaut, was part of the "20/20" class special issue, which was shown before the exit of the new book of Gabby: History of courage and hope.
Special explosion reported the reconstruction of Giffords after the shooting on 8 January.
In the first few weeks of Kelly's video, she's lying on a hospital bed with a shaving head and a long scar on her head.
She can only raise one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a cart and therapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
Shuffle your head.
Pull your lips out.
And then her first word, "what."
A few days later, Giffords said the second word - "toast", and asked for a change in the breakfast menu.
The A.B. video shows that music played a central role in the healing of Giffords: we see the congressman singing along with "The girls just want to have fun" Cindy Loper and "Free Fall" Tom Patty.
At the interview of Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, she said she didn't remember the day of the temptation.
Her husband told him that he read the Giffords article in the shooting paper on March 12th, when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who were killed at that time.
The suspect who attacked Gerd Lee Lafner is in Missouri prison and is subject to forced treatment in the expectation of a court.
"A lot of people have died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Trust, hard, hard."
One day during her healing, Kelly Sawyer said, "I'm winning."
"And I said, "Gabby, you're not winning," said Kelly.
You're just beaten.
And you'll go through this, you'll heal and come back stronger than ever.
Army feel more pity than respect
The event was a celebration in Wall Street, which gathered millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballade about helplessness, disappointment and losses.
On the signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines were built around it.
The audition in the smokings applauded his stand.
"The soldiers were viewed as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring collection of money.
The Senior Military Officer at the concert, at which also was the chairman of the Headquarters Committee, Admiral Mike Mallen, saw the role of troops differently.
"Them were treated like orphans," the officer wrote in the e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respectful, it was pity.
Completely contrary impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and the often ambitious, sometimes admired American public.
The troops are praised for their sacrifices.
But commendations have their price, say soldiers.
The audience is increasingly acting like she feels sorry for people in her shape.
"We are not at all victims," said Brigade General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and soon left Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way to show support for some is to treat us as unhappy."
This is a sensitive topic for warheads who do not seem ungrateful or disagreeable with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger that returning troops faced during the last years of war in Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most of the talks about regret are being held quietly and only between war veterans.
After the two of his sons returned from the battles of the marine, the Colonel, resigned by Mark Kenshn, warned them that people from the army would look at their service from two points of view.
Some will look at them with appreciation, because they have been bumping rebels and being in exotic places.
Others will think whether the "mask of a cruel evil veteran," said Kenshn, who fought in Iraq and returned to the high government post in Washington.
While looking for work, he said, he felt that some interviewers were cautiously asking if he could endure the tension of responsibilities in Washington immediately after the fighting.
Canshn remembers his sons saying, "When you tell about your service, you must count on the negative effect."
The disorder experienced by the military is partly from American indifference to wars.
The victory in the battlefield rarely receives commendations from a country that is a little familiar with the army and sees little direct benefits from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as it was normally in World War II," said the Lieutenant-General in resignation, David Barnow, who commanded American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and audience is mainly focused on the depth of the suffering of the soldier.
The military appreciates the number of the proceedings they have done, by the number of companions they have lost, or by the scale of losses.
The army faces a growing pressure against rape
This week, the historic judicial proceedings should be decided whether 28 men and women ' s lawsuit would be taken against the army against rape.
If not, hundreds of the prosecutors will be in line with the following.
The soldier of the first grade, Elizabeth Lyman, 25 years and 11 weeks of pregnancy, approved of her, was raped by her associate at night.
It was in October 2008, and she returned to her barracks at Miramar Airport, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend, and met a man's accompanied with a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," says Lyman.
But Texas' crops dismissed her fears.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I'm sorry I didn't listen to my instinct then."
A few minutes after they entered the Lyman room, a man came back to her, crashed and raped, she claimed.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former troops will be urged to wait for the judgement of the court at the historic hearing that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and whether the court will be judged against the former Minister of Defence, Robert Gates, and his predecessor Donald Rusmfeld.
The court claims that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to deal with widespread military violence in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The case filed in February by Susan Burke, D.C., originally included 17 judges, but grew up to 28 in the next month - 25 women and three men who all claimed that they were raped or threatened by the workers of sexual violence and that the army did not properly investigate, prosecute or ensure proper justice after alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeted the army's highest, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she said.
"Who are the people who can destroy the worship of violence?
Burke also said that about 400 other victims had been linked to her since February, many of which could participate in future desires.
Its strategy: instead of collecting all the claimants in this case, put all eggs into one basket, so to say, it will open a lot of cases if it takes to support pressure.
The Protection Team from the Ministry of Defence under the leadership of the Federal Prosecutor Neil McBride has taken steps to cease the case.
The judicial documents received by Newsweek reveal the protection strategy mainly that former or current soldiers cannot claim the army's claims for the damage caused by the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the decision of the Supreme Court of 1950, the Federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by military personnel.
“The alleged damage is a risk to the military service of the prosecutors”, states the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the '50s.
Although women are still officially prohibited to participate in the fight, the division exists only in words: Modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers play an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the war zone.
As a result, 150 women soldiers died between two wars, two thirds of them in battle.
The army is also time to become modern, says Burke.
She is not lonely in her struggle; in addition to her lawsuit, three others are preparing.
At the Yale Legal School, the Seminar of the Veteran Legal Service is preparing a case against the four largest military academys on the promotion of women's hatred atmosphere.
The non-commercial union of American war veterans in Vietnam is preparing a lawsuit against the army, in the centre of which the diagnosis of " change in personality " which are subject to violence victims in order to remove them from service, is a normal phenomenon, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati from the human rights group, the Organization of Women's Military Actions.
Her group filed a complaint against the Veterans Office in December, accusing him of discriminatory practices of retirement treatments from people who claim to have been threatened by sexual violence during the service.
The nine separate laws offering a number of measures were introduced to the Congress by a group of senators and members of the Palace of representatives from both parties.
In 2010, the Ministry of Traffic Prevention and Combating Sexual Violence reported 3.158 attempts of rape.
However, it is known that the attacks are often not reported, and, according to Pentagon's own estimates, the figure was approximately 13.5 per cent of the 19.000 reported cases that occurred this year.
This report, published in March, also examines the percentage of trials: 20 per cent of the known cases were in 2010 twice as in the civil justice system.
The claimants in the Burke case call the attacks only the first in a number of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she reported rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell the details of rape separately 11 times the fiance of police, doctors and commanders.
She gathered a set of proofs of rape, and the blood of the attacker, from the cut on her hand, was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat before the judge at the hearing, asking her whether she had sex with her friend earlier on the day of attack.
Six people gave a positive characteristic to the accused who was finally justified.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was born now -- I ran out of the courtroom with a scream."
"They put me in the psychiatric department, and when I left, I remember my commander said, "It wasn't a trial on him, it was a trial against me."
Lyman was ordered to contact a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her personal change, which made her unfit to service.
In January 2010, she was fired with disadvantaged formulation, which did not allow her to receive any benefits.
If the case of Lyman and her law enforcement companions proceeds forward, it is a difficult question, said John Terley, a professor of law at the University of George Washington.
However, he said, "I think they can move forward."
The doctrine that has been criticised since it appeared.
I've been criticizing Doctrine Ferres for my whole life.
The army has been retired for decades because she has no incentives and restraints that are responsible.
He adds: "The chances are greatly against them... but it is important for them to try."
These things will only change when the decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not for them, Burke, the judge's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other judges for future cases.
"We will continue to fight with the army on this matter until reform is there," she said.
Or until we die, depending on what happens before.
The walls have eyes: How researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming a new person of real extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Breawick was a normal guy who exposed his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Bravick, who confessed to commit a mass murder in Norway in July, which took 77 lives, appeared at his first open trial.
Although Bravick could act alone, he was far from lonely in the network: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, communicating with millions of nationalists who support the right groups in social networks.
After summer tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how can we find them?
It's easy to go to Facebook.
"We realized that getting to them is not complicated," said Jamie Bartlett, the recently published report on the European Cyber Populism of the British DEMOS Research Centre.
Personal data stock on Facebook is so large, says Bartlett, that researchers could easily use the website's advertising tool to identify the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy -- that marketers have been doing for years.
The Bartlett team found a half a million fans of the right groups across Europe and then advertised them, but instead of showing a new group or a diet product, the advertisement offered the user to conduct a survey on their level of education, violence and optimism on their own future.
With the help of Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues, more than 10,000 participants in 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries were able to interrogate, even without leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way to do research," Bartlett said.
Some results are not so impressive: online parties to the right groups are most commonly young men of male sex, dissatisfied by immigration.
But suddenly, "the ones who combine their online activity with offline activity are more reasonable, more democratic and less aggressive than those who are just hiding behind the monitor."
The work of DEMOS is only one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, researchers and politicians use the site to explore all in the world - from health to social trends expressed in the Laycas, wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding to the average of three records a day, "super-aktual information" of the Facebook causes a research boom by increasing the number of scientific articles called the website by 800 per cent for the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook's beauty is that it gives the opportunity to study people who can't be approached in the street with a record.
"Rather, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You would have had to join the party and they would never accept you," said Bartlett.
"Facebuck turns off all this -- you're directing them."
Others say that this site could identify and explore social health problems.
The last study of Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who discussed their drunken fees on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about this.
Moreno suggests that students, such as their communion teachers, could monitor the site and interfere to help a student who has too often updated drunk status.
"You cannot solve the problem without identifying it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-autor Moreno and Director of the Centre for Children's Health, Behaviour and Development at the Child Research Institute of Seattle.
"We have found a way to identify children from a risk group that would not otherwise be found."
Facebook is also constantly drawing data on its users.
The site ' s data processing group has processed the status statistics and the Valentine Day, the phenomenon of voters in mid-term 2010, as well as the National Happiness Index (using mainly information available only to them, the cyber-free champions had long insisted that the website should make its broad collection of data available to research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play in Scrabble with a friend of thousands of miles from you, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become participants of the research they don't even know?
While researchers have strictly certain rules for offline research, online data are public.
"I don't think that many users were at least wondering what a researcher could observe their profiles," said Neil Selvin, a sociologist from the London Knowledge Lab, on the study that he conducted in 2006 using public accessible pages of students in Facebook.
"How they imagined, it was only between them and their friends."
The question of methodology is then.
There is no guarantee that the study is fair.
On Facebook, it is not possible to find the number of information in the profile and on the user's page.
"What you say in Facebook, and what you do outside Facebook, are two completely different things," said Salvin.
That is why, despite its years of technology research, Selvin believes that the notebook and pen is still the best research tools that can be used.
"Nothing can replace a real world and a relationship with real people," he said.
"Social research is expected to be about social and most social research is still offline."
Cold and Inhuman: Anders Bering Braywick will be before the court for the first time
Anders Bering Brawick, a person who confessed to the organization of a double attack that took 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter of resistance during the first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian resistance and the Knights of Tampliers of Norway," he said to 500 attendant in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculture."
"I recognise action, but I don't admit guilt."
Judge Torkyel Neschaim interrupted Breavick during this monologue because he didn't "withstanding to give Bravic the opportunity to use this hearing as a place to express his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to authorize Bravic, who brought with him the previously written speech, to contact the victims’ relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Brevick in custody for another 12 weeks, banned access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and the listing for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and victims visited the hearing.
Some came in hope to see Bravic in the eye, others to make sure he is locked up.
Everyone has come to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," he told the Norwegian NRK channel one of the survivors in Utoya.
"It was uncomfortable, but it made me feel a little easier personally after I saw and heard the suspect."
Bravick, clothed in a dark suit and blue tie, kept calm and professionalism during all the hearing and looked in the eyes of the journalists and the survivors when he entered and left the building.
Despite the strange idea of Bravic that he was part of the great movement of opposition, the judge decided that he was not a mad man and said there was no evidence that he had acted with companions.
Some can be comforted by the fact that the attacks on 22 July appear to be a work of one extremist, not a group of radicals.
But this does not reduce the automatic tribulation and disturbance that the entire nation now feels.
"I wish it looked like a monster, but it's not," said one victim's relative.
"It would be much easier if it were."
7 lessons from the lost interview of Steve Jobs, showed in the theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5th, some compared him to Henry Ford, describeing the technical genius as the Great Designer of Modernity.
But the fact that Apple's fans could consider the greatest opening in the recently discovered interview that they remembered in the preliminary markets this week is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and production technologies.
He, of course, was a designer, a dreamer and considered himself a hippie, but he was also an excellent organizer and a modernizer of the production process that believed that many business managers suffered "a sickness to think that a really big idea of work is 90 per cent... [but] a great idea from the great product is a huge amount of skilled work."
Let's go back in 1995, Bob Kringley created a television of the Triumph of Nerds on the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a unique long-term conversation.
Until then, about 10 years since Jobs was expelled from Apple, and he has been working all the time for his new NeXT computer to await a mass receipt of the Internet.
While a small part of the Cringley interview was used in Nerds, he said the original interviews were missing during transportation.
Only after Jobs died, a full VHS copy was found in the director garage.
This recorded material, a little edited, was the foundation for the 68-minute film, Steve Jobs, the lost interview that came to Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man familiar with his hatred for detailed interviews, Jobs seems unusual to expose his technological philosophy and business strategies here.
And incredibly thoughtful.
At four different moments, there are large intervals between questions and answers -- 10 to 15 seconds of meditation, where Jobs clearly raises his thoughts to say more accurately.
There are also moments where Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, where it appears to be irritated by Kringley's questions that make him move to issues or phenomenons of greater importance.
In the period before Pixar, iPods and iphons, the lost interview is something more vicious when Jobs appreciates what he sees different companies do right and wrong, and proposes his own vision of future information technology.
It's one thing to read about Jobs' after-death evaluations, but there's something wounded and inspiring in Jobs that we see here, an anxious dreamer at the threshold of the greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A small summary of seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
About how he was learning to manage business:
"After all the time in business, I've been asking, "Why are you doing this?" And the answers you always get, "Oh, that's just what you're doing."
Nobody knows why they do what they do, nobody thinks in business very deeply.
That's what I've learned.
Jobs continues to describe its attempts to rationalize the reporting at Apple.
The distressed way of recording the costs often starting with "standard costs" from the ceiling and then raising through "clarification", he created an automated structure that guaranteed that they would be able to monitor business costs from the bottom to the smallest.
About the joke of the Pope:
Jobs describes the "Blue box" that he mastered with Steve Wozniak -- a device that allows people to efficiently break into the phone company and call for free.
The device has been written a lot earlier, but Jobs' euphoria is here when you describe the blue box as an act of power infective.
He tells us how he and Wozniak tested the box by ordering a conversation and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until the connected as many stations as possible.
"We've caught the earth's ball half a dozen times, and you've screamed on the phone, and that was a minute later in the neighbouring phone car," said Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and all we've acquired is that we've been able to master something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We two knew a little bit, but we could make a little thing that could control the big thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think without that would ever appear Apple.
Jobs continues to describe a famous exit that he and Wozniak practically managed by calling to Vatican through the blue box at midnight and asking Papa to call on the phone, trying to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, these two were laughing right before the Papa was raised to answer on the phone.
About in love with technology (and coldly called Bill Hughlett):
When he was 12 years old, he searched for spare details to collect the frequency, he found Bill Hulett in a phonebook and called him.
Soon after their 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs received summer work at Hughlett Packard.
"It has had a strong impact on me, it was the only company I've seen at that age, and it has formed my view of what the company is and how well they relate to their staff."
Jobs later became one of HP research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw the first computer on the desk.
He was size of a suitcase, he had a small monitor with an e-ray pipe, and I fell in love with him.
I frequently traveled to HP as a teenager and rolled around the car and wrote a program for it.
Improvised innovation:
In several places, Jobs' interviews refers to the invention of new products during the summer.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a bunch of mounted plates, one buyer asked him to gather a whole computer.
During only 30 days of the loan, he had to reconsider both the collection and the delivery of ready devices.
Later at Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced by developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the rageous disputes... they screamed at me that it would take five years [collapse a mouse that would cost $300], and I was sick in my throat, and I went out, and I found a designer."
Nineteen days later, we had a mouse that we could gather for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
Large energy-related companies:
Long before he headed the Apple renaissance, Jobs had precisely predicted that many growing leaders were wrong in seeing the situation and losing control of their market shares.
"Let's say you're working at IBM or Xerox, so you're making the best copy or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company is not more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, thus [this types of people] who come to the company's leadership, and people making the product are exhausted from the decision-making area.
The product genius that led to this monopolyst position is exhausted by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products, the desired art.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could take over the whole information technology industry.
He could be ten times more, might be Microsoft in the '90s...
They have been defeated from victory.
Innovation as a form of art:
"The great idea from the big product is a huge amount of artificial labour... when you distort the big idea, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about her thinness.
There are compromises to which you need to go -- some things you can't make do electronics, glass, robots or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head - these concepts, connecting them all together...
Finally, everything comes to a taste -- it's about trying to express itself in the best thing people ever produced, and later -- trying to bring it into what you do.
Picasso said good artists are copying, big artists are stealing.
We were always ashamed of stealing big ideas.
Part of what Macintosh made famous was that people who worked on him were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who had become best information technology experts in the world.
If not information technology, they would do amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are having lunch with opponents of the Health Act while the court is considering the case
On the day the Supreme Court gathered at the closed door to discuss a political dispute whether he would listen to the law on the health of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were held at lunch by a legal firm that would dispute the case before the Supreme Court.
This case took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions.
One of the cases on the agenda was the application supported by 26 States to contradict the rapid health review adopted by the Congress last year, the law that united the conservative activists of the entire nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, the reverse debate would be expected at 5 1/2 hours in March 2012, and the outcome would probably be a disturbance in the presidential race, which would be in the expansion of the time the judgement was announced.
The lawyer, who will stand before the court and claim that the health law should probably be repealed, Paul Clement, who was the Deputy General Prosecutor during the Presidentship of George W. Bush.
The Legal Company of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozens of companies that helped sponsor the annual lunch of the Federal Society, a long-term existing group, constantly adhering to conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored lunch represents one of the trade associations that disputed the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, which has a huge financial interest in the result of gravitation.
Dinner was held in the Washington Hotel a few hours after the trial meeting.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a famous opponent of the Health Act.
Honorable guests at dinner?
Nothing new: two judges have been visiting the events of the Federal Society for years.
And this does not contradict ethical standards at all.
In fact, the judges are free from the Code of Behaviour, which regulates the action of the lower federal judges.
If they were obeyed, they might have reached the Principle 4C of the Code, which states: "The judge may attend charity activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge cannot be a rapporteur, a honourable guest or referred to in the programme of such an event."
However, the apparent closestness of Scalia and Thomas to two legal firms in this case, as well as the company with great financial interests, was sufficient for ethics activists in the Government.
"It is an impressive violation of ethics and indifference to the code contrary to the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the General Act.
"The judges have been drinking and dinnering at the official stock of money collection with lawyers whose cases are currently being discussed in the court."
Their appearance and assistance in gathering money for this event undermines all statements of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas are barely drawing attention to criticists who say they are very willing to mix the cases of a court with groups such as the Federal Society.
And Thomas's wife, Jeannie, is a famous conservator activist.
Furthermore, the conservators claim that this is an ethical issue with regard to Judge Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the primary legal service in Obama's administration when the first judicial objections against the law were filed at the court level of the first instruction.
Her criticisms demanded that Kagan refuse to hear this case because she was too involved in the protection of the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan didn't show that she was going to do that.
Boeing receives a recorded 18-billion flight order
The Emirates airline orders 50 broadcasting ships Boeing 777 and perhaps orders another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, a deal size of more than 1 billion dollars.
It is hardly news that the company receives a order for 50 units of its product.
But this is an important event when this company is a Boeing Co. aircraft engineer, and the prevalent price for all these 50 planes is $18 billion.
It is as important as where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, the growing gold lived for the future planes.
In the forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company considers that the Middle East will need 2.220 aircraft worth 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced his biggest equivalent in dollars for commercial planes on this weekend - 50 two-way Boeing 777.
The incredible order came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an opportunity to buy 20 other aircraft that will raise the total prevalent price to $26 billion, said Boeing at Aviashaw Dubai 2011.
Later on Monday, said Boeing, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, so-called Dreamliner, which could be commended with much better fuel savings and comfort for passengers.
The pre-account price for six planes will be more than a billion dollars.
"It's really very good for Boeing," said analyst Morningstar Neil Diora.
"The quality of these specific customers is pretty high."
Many Middle East aircraft own oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, they have not only money to pay for aircraft but also to increase the prices of fuel, which usually damages airlines, since it is one of their largest costs, not so destructive because the country earns money at high prices of oil.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines will cancel the plane order when prices grow, said Diora.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates order strengthens the leadership of Boeing on the market of wide-fluelling aircraft and helps not to allow an airbus SAS competitor to strike into his sovereignty with his A350 airliner.
Boeing's victory at the aviation show took place four months later after Airbus stated that he would postpone the largest A350 debut, which competed just with 777-300ER.
He postponed the debut to increase the axis load after the buyers demanded to increase the elevation and distance of the flight.
Boeing Co shares increased by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
The sister of President Mexico appears to have lost the elections in Michoacan
Louisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers were helping Fausto Valjeho from the IRP in the pre-electoral race.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seemed not to have implemented her application for Governor Michoacan during the harsh public elections, and she stated on Monday that drug dealers had helped to drive the race for one of its opponents.
According to preliminary results, the leader of the Governor of the Western State is called Fausto Valého from the Institutional Revolution Party, or IRP.
"The interference of organized crime during the entire election process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but also for the whole country," said Louisa Maria Calderon in the radio interview next day after the Sunday vote.
"They frightened our candidates, our electoral workers... they took the urnes for vote, put obstacles... and forced people to vote" for the IRP.
The IRP managed Mexico for seven decades until the presidentship was lost in 2000.
It is preparing the return, and the victory in Michoacana is an important step in this attempt.
The IRP hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Valjeho seemed to have a little bit over Calderon, who was headed by electoral ratings until the day of elections.
Calderon, a candidate from the National Action Party, or the PND headed by her brother, refused to acknowledge Valjeho as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or DRP, now belonging to the Governor's Chair, came to the third serious defeat for divided and unsuccessful lefts before the presidential elections 2012.
Aureolas also refused to acknowledge preliminary results.
Valjeho, former mayor of the capital of the state of Morella, denyed contacts with drug dealers and called on other candidates to recognize the results.
In Michoakana, drug cartels specialized for marihuana, heroin and metamphetamines have been ruled for a long time.
This is the native state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence continues.
The mayor of the LDC was killed a week before the elections when he agitated for Louisa Maria Calderon, and several candidates left the local pre-election race because of fear.
For the IRP, however, no matter how horrible the elections in Michoacan would be, the victory will give the move impulse of the party.
A man who should represent the IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Neito, saying congratulations from Washington, said Valjeho and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging in the front of the next year."
ABR persuads Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank had committed India and China to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would stop the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, director of the ABB office in Manil, said that two fast-developing large economies should " do everything they can" to accelerate the recovery of the currency block with either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the countries of BRIC look at the difficulties of Europe ' impartial, and said that Asian financial assistance could help to avoid a long-term decline in the global economy.
"It's all about us."
"So anyone who can help Europe to get out of the crisis is useful," he reported to the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be insecure."
"So if China and India can help, it must be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely affected by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, the loan funds of Italy have increased threateningly, and the Prime Ministers both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The long-term crisis in Europe raised fears that it could bring the world economy to the recession again, and led to the calls of leading developing economies to gather together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Neg predicted that any Asian assistance would be carried out through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation, such as the purchase of EU financial assistance bonds, had been provided with funds to ensure financial stability in Europe, provided great strength in the negotiations to Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that India would do everything possible to help the eurozone, since its own economy is now under way of reducing exports and reducing foreign capital impacts.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and unstable," he said.
"We have great tasks, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a possible option, it's a mandatory condition, because where we find a job for tens of millions of our youths and girls."
Others argue that there is no point for developing economies such as India to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutos Warshni, a professor at the University of Brown in the United States, said that it would be very difficult to assist Europe with 1.2 billion Indians, of whom about 800 million lives by $2 per day or less.
"They will find out at some point that the Greeks are retired at 50 years of age and go to sea and that will not be taken well," he said.
Lee Howell, director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reserves should be used to contain Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers in badly organized, loss-related enterprises, such as railways.
Mr. Neg said that the eurozone crisis threatened " significant direct consequences" throughout Asia.
ABD projection of 7.5 per cent growth in Asia in 2011/12 has now faced " degrading risks" because of the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets should make " extraordinary plans" to protect themselves from decline and significant capital flows from their economies.
Terrible warnings from Pentagon on potential reductions in defence costs
The Minister of Defence, Leon Panette, warned on Monday in the Congress that the expected automatic reductions of the budget would undermine national security and cause financial chain reactions from Pentagon's corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan in line and civil assembly.
Pentagon is already used to a reduction of $450 billion in the forthcoming decade, but is now afraid that additional reductions in 600 billion or more can be inevitable if the congress cannot reach the cost agreement.
"The consequences of these reductions will be destructive for the Ministry," said Panette in a letter to the senators, John McKain, Arizona, and the Republic of Lindsay Greham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of the congress to adopt a budget agreement and a result of the so-called sequence initiated a universal reduction by 23 per cent and the termination of many new projects.
"Such a strong reduction that has been used so unconsciously will make most of our shipbuilding and construction incomplete -- you can't buy three quarters of ships or buildings -- and serious damage to other attempts to modernize," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We will also have to dismiss many of our civilian workers and since the reduction will be made so quickly, we must almost have to fire civilians in order to achieve the goals."
"Those changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and cause serious combat damage."
The shortcomings will eventually affect the military parts, said Panette.
"Although military funding in Foreign Emergency Operations is not directly affected by the sequence, military achievements will suffer seriously from a serious breakdown in the main budgets," said Panette.
“Contract personnel will be reduced to end with the abolition of the contracts and the supervision contract that supports the troops”.
"State staff will be reduced, which will lead to delays with military suppliers' payments, and legal and political support will be violated."
Two senators wrote Panette 10 days ago, asking for details of the possible effects of automatic reductions in the Defence Ministry.
"As a result of the sequester in the Defence Ministry, the rapid decline of the United States as the leading world military power will be rapidly declined."
"We are standing up against these dragon acts," said the senators in a joint statement on Monday night when they announced Panetta's letter.
"It's not the way we can live with, and it's not the way we're supposed to get involved."
"Secvester is a threat to the interests of national security of the United States, and that cannot be allowed to happen."
Whether Panetta's letter or the latest warnings of the senators to the budget compromise or strengthen the calls for Pentagon to be released from reductions, we will see later.
Panette was absolutely sincere about possible reductions, although he came to work in Pentagon's management after many years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and realized that he had a difficult choice.
At the press conference last week, the Minister of Defence drew an uncomfortable picture of what could follow -- armies with a shell but without a core.
"This is a ship without sailors."
"It's a bullet-free team."
"It's the wing of the plane without enough prepared pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, a wardrobe army, buildings and bombs without sufficiently prepared soldiers capable of performing the mission," said Panette in its initial observations in Pentagon.
"This is the power that suffers from an unsustainable fighting spirit, bad preparedness and is unable to combat potential enemies."
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
In the annex to his letters to McKain and Greham Panette, he has given new details of the reductions in significant operational risks: reducing the response to crisis, conflicts and disasters; seriously limiting our ability to be first in deployment and response everywhere in the world; and leads to unacceptable risk in future war operations.
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could face obstacles, including those that have already been testing, and some only in early stages of planning.
This list includes a single striking killer of F35, a planned new bomber, a ballist submarine boat of a new generation, a new coastal boat and a new ground fighting vehicle required to replace the hammer.
The end of further development and testing of F35 could save 80 billion dollars in 10 years, but its supporters say that this is a vital step to improve and resist potential threats of China and other opponents.
How to catch a lie
A thorough view of the latest titles shows how serious and widely lies and lies in daily life.
The candidate for the Presidents of the Republicans, Herman Kane, has been engaged in dispute against sexual harassment from several women; each party accuses the other of lies.
Pennsylvania's university administration was charged with false testimony, as they seemed to hide that the football trainer had been raped by boys.
Last week, President of France, Nikola Sarkozy, was captured when the U.S. President Baracu Obame told the President that the Prime Minister of Israel, Binjamin Netanjahu, was liar.
The lie destroys careers and shakes the countries.
Congressman of New York and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Wayner turned himself foolish, denying his findings, which was rapidly opposed by uncontrollable evidence.
The former candidate at President John Edwards was accused of financial machination during a campaign related to the coverage of extra-manual relations.
And again, none of the living at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who was fake about his sexual relations with Monica Levinsky during his second post.
History of fraud at school and college examinations is an ordinary matter.
There were cases when the teachers were given the answers to the tests so that they had a good assessment of the results of their activities.
The teachers who should teach the opposite are sending a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
During one day, research shows that you may lie between 10 and 200 times.
Now it is predicted that a significant part of this is a lie to save.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times for the first 10 minutes of each other.
The discovery of lies or lying is the necessary skill for both personal and professional purposes.
In contrast to a room game, similar to, let's say, the charades where we need to cry " Happened!", the discovery of lies is a serious direction of knowledge based on scientific data gathered in the prestigious universities of comprehensive research projects, especially on psychology and physology.
One of the results of the study is that most old myths of lies were divorced.
Liars look in the eye.
They don't always sneak, scream, red, or scream.
It is not worth finding that liars are difficult to observe and that it is difficult to disclose.
Experiencing a lie disclosure can reach the truth by observing the structure of allegations, mimic, the structure of issues and temporary characteristics.
I have spent several years studying scientific discoveries in a widespread and constantly growing segment of knowledge of lies, and it is clear that the discovery of lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and which helps us in the orientation of our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruitment, interviews, negotiations or management.
Good liars are excellently able to read others, making them feel uncompulsed, controlling their own emotions and intuitively feel how others perceive them.
We know from the study that extraverts lie more often than introverts that men lie more about themselves, while women are usually to protect someone's feelings that married people are less lying to their partners than unmarried (but the lie they say is most urgent).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty by deceiving you.
How do you know anyone's lying?
First of all, observe the normal behaviour of your object.
It is called "determination of origin".
This helps to ensure a dispatch to assess the changes further.
Watch the position, the laughter, the voice characteristics of your object.
You should know if a person knocks in a normal condition, then you will not make unfair accusations when you see the knocking of his legs in the middle of the meeting.
Then find groups of deceptive verbal and non-verbal acts.
Treat these groups as red flags, not proof of fraud.
The deceives can fix the upper part of their body when trying to remember their history, they can put their steps towards the door, go to the exit, change their position in certain ways, or show " relief after interview" -- this excessive breath of relief and change of position when all complex issues are behind.
The investigators often fake the interrogation signal to just look at this relief after the interviews.
So, pay attention to your object's speech.
It is known that Scott Peterson had fallen down and used the past time, claiming that his murdered wife was alive, leading to its searches all over the country.
The people who are inclined can also use the distance in the speech, "I had no sexual relations with this woman... Miss Levinsky" or to repeat the complicated question entirely.
The most typical verbale indicators are barely captured.
Someone can use the qualification language when he answers the complicated question, "All right... truthfully... as far as I know... how much I know."
This makes the answer more emotional than actual, and often a red flag.
There is no magic means to identify lies, but you can control the ability to discover the fraud.
These skills will increase the chances of everyone not to become a victim of skilled fraud in professional and personal life.
The dispute plan for the construction of the oil pipeline needs to be reviewed after the United States threat to defer its approval
A few days later, Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Mexican Gulf, causing anger of trade unions, but reassuring environmental defenders, the company that is about to build the oil pipeline, claims that it will be willing to review the project to resume its work.
TransCanada reported on Monday night that it would remove the planned oil pipeline from the environmentally sensitive region of the Sand Hills in Nebraska and is sure that the project will still be approved.
The company made this decision at the press conferences in the Nebraska State Capitolia.
The official of TransCanada Alex Purbas said that the company remained confident that it would eventually receive the approval of the oil pipeline, although with another route.
This is happening after the State Department statement last week that it will defer a decision on the project at the federal level until it examines the new possible routes that do not affect the region of Nebraska's Sand Hills and the Ogalala Aquifer, the huge sub-zemal stock of water.
"It is a real step forward," said Congressman Lee Terry, the Republican of Nebraska.
The new environmental expertise ordered by the State Department will probably take the decision until 2013, after the next year elections, although the authorities denyed that policy was involved in this decision.
Obama, in his written statement last week, called for a decision by the State Department and expressed its support.
The oil pipeline length of 1.700 miles must go from Canada to the Mexican Gulf.
He must transport 700,000 barrels a day from Albert's province to oil race factories in Texas.
To do that, he has to cross six states.
He is hated by environmental defenders, but they love trade unions that hope for about 20,000 oil-related jobs.
However, Nebraski lawmakers, speaking against the plan, are considering a bill to accelerate the movement from the Sand Hills and the Aquifer of Ogalala, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current State Department's study on environmental impact showed that the project would only have a limited negative impact on the environment, but the source in the energy industry stated that the Department ' s auditor had ordered a separate expertise in the process of consideration, focusing on two issues.
One represents a Lobbist employed by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a advisor in the 2008 Hillary Clinton campaign, a conflict of interest for the programme.
Another was whether the choice of the company which was hired to conduct an initial study was inappropriate since it was related to TransCanada.
Patty Labelle was sued because she seemed to have caused child's painfulness.
The New York family claims that Patty Labelle's disco dive began to be in the headquarters of their homes in Manhattan, scaring their minor daughter to that extent that it was so frightened.
The Tirade of the Executive Lady Marmalade scares the 18-month Genevieve Monk so much that she passed "have changed personality, sleep disorder" and "powerful fear of strangers," said her family at the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
This happened last November, when Kevin Monk, his wife, the child gardener, Rosanna, and Genevieve were going to a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was hunting the car, Rosanna Monk came down into the lobby of the building on Riverside Building with their baggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped at the door and dropped her daughter on the floor for a minute.
Someone came to me back and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said yes and went to pick her up," she said.
Labelle has made an anger to a pregnant woman.
"She said aggressively, "You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door," said Rosanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She came in anger and began to use screwing -- the word of C and the word of F -- in high tones...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had a hysteric.
"I told this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle attacked the mother -- who still held Genevieve -- and her escorts had to keep her and push her into the waiting car, said Rosanna Monk.
The baby cried so much that she was drowned, she added.
Labelle later sent an apology note, but did not answer.
Lawyers and representatives of Labelle do not respond to comments.
The amount of compensation for damage was not reported, but a family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he took the case for free and that the family planned to sacrifice any money that he would receive for the charity of children with a diseased cancer.
"The goal is to force Patty Labelle to be responsible for her actions," said Davis.
"It is completely inadmissible, especially as regards a child's teacher with a 18-month child in his hands."
Climate problems slowed the economy
During the first year of the rule of Mario Lopez in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market increased, foreign funding decreased and the economy was weakened.
2011, which will enter the economic history of Sinaloa as the first year of the Government of Mario Lopez Waldez, also referred to as a year of change, which has produced great hopes for economic development, but given the disadvantaged climate conditions of the beginning of the year, there was no growth, but a reduction in the main economic development indicators has been registered.
The low temperatures of February did not only result in loss of millions for the agricultural sector but limited the growth of the public economy, causing a reduction in economic activity by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historic fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the report on the areas affected by the ice cream provided by the Mexican Council on Sustainable Rural Development, 835.582 hectares, of which 78.03 per cent were injured in total, and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected, and the main damaged cultures were vegetables, corn and nuts.
The decline of economic activity, until November, the continuous growth of unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute for Statistics and Geographic, had been established during the first three blocks, accelerate unemployment growth, from January to March 55.053 of the Cinalois inhabitants, with a share of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, increased to 5.28 per cent in the second quarter, and from July to September, it continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, which accounts for more than 74,000 unemployed residents of Sinaloa, which was more than 18.969 people in comparison with the first half.
Liquidity reduction
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year has been explained by many factors to the economist Gerardo Lopez Servantes, Director of the Economic and Social Science Faculty of the Autonomous University (UAS), the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, actions taken in public policy.
"What we see now is the growth of unemployment, which relates to several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market, to limit the resources provided by the law, which was adopted in the convention to combat money laundering, because people who have illegally owned dollars are difficult to work with them, invest and use them in something," he said.
Sustained immigration
Lopez Servantes said that unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state in search of jobs from abroad was limited in the United States, primarily because of the entrance difficulties and, secondly, since they once went, they have already faced a lot of difficulties in looking for work, so the group of people remains and requires jobs here, in the state, the unemployment rate is growing," he said.
Violence of formal requirements
Analysis of the labour market of Sinaloa is increasingly worse when attention is given to a large number of violations that prevail under the conditions of work, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the active population of the state, without being mentioned as employees in any social protection agency.
In addition to unemployment and infringements, another reminder of the state ' s work is presented with low wages; the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute for Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of the workers of Sinaloa was 5.352 peso, much below the average country, comprising 7.375 peso.
Reduction of FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the highest unemployment rate in 2011, the largest discount of foreign direct investments in the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, was $630.697 from January to July, which showed the fall of 87.74 per cent compared to $5.143.312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Government has only fixed 17.280,000 peso investments during the year, which mainly came to services companies.
Long
In the context of the economic decline, the Government of the State requested the credit approval of 3 billion peso in July, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities in order to revive the economy, only 2.600 million peso were approved at the local level, and no debt benefits were expected in any sector of the state economy until November.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario Lopez Waldes demonstrates the lack of government capabilities.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, President of the National Industry Chamber, said that the demands of various sectors, including the government itself, had been lacked during 2011.
"The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year was really low, there is a lot of work to restore the positions lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have failed to harmonize the efforts of all and, first of all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Economy delay
Lopez Loredo said that events such as early freezing had stopped the state economy and its efficiency and growth this year were limited.
"The low economies are the result of several events, including freezing, one of the main effects was the slow economy, which does not become fast enough to create a economic dynamic that allows us to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services, and, therefore, at the end of the year, we close it below our expectations," he said.
Review of the direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederation of Workers of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, said that the state had to continue the most dynamic production activity.
"In general and in general, we have discovered that we have worked on this, we believe that a long-term programme should be developed, which will re-determine the direction and economic course of the state, to mobilize all the material and human resources that have Sinaloa," he said.
Present work
President Coparmex emphasized the importance of defining the future direction to improve the Government ' s efforts.
"In general and in general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in different areas, there is a small progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has demonstrated progress in its own manner of public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to tell us that the government is getting involved in the work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government realizes that there is a lot else to do," he said.
He is sentenced for 8 pounds of marijuana.
Five years of prison and a fine of income for 100 days - such a sentence was sentenced to Navolato for storing eight pounds of marijuana.
The General Prosecutor reported that the convicted drug dealer - Omar Alexis Valensuela Sandoval, convicted for the crime against health, in this case, stored marijuana for dissemination.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valensuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican soldiers on 7 June 2010 during the street patrol of Cypriano Valdes, before post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white truck with a black bag in a car, and on a passenger seat, a small bag where soldiers found eight pounds and 23 grams of marihuana.
For these reasons, the extraction was transferred to the Second District Court, and the accused remains in prison in the Centre for the Support of the Legal Effects of Crime.
I need to make contributions to work
Public work relating to family programmes, Rescue of public spaces and 3x1 for migrants risks to remain incomplete or for long delayed because of the lack of funds, said Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda.
The Director of the Municipal Social Development pointed out that, although the work programmes have yet been developed, they are in danger, since the Government of the State is unable to contribute to the amount of 11 million peso for all three programmes.
He noted that the total financing of all three programmes was approximately 50 million pesos, of which the state should be 25 per cent, while only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for work, so it could still be delayed with their completion.
"They should invest nearly 12 million, and even though the year ends, they didn't give us any money when they had to give us part from July in the beginning," he said, "to avoid delay, we started work and they made a lot of progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that during the last year, during the rule of Jesus Agilar Padilli, the state had not made the contributions he had to make, so at the beginning of the municipality administration, it had to take money to cover more than 7 million, the amount that was not provided by the State administration.
"This happened to us in the previous administration, because the state had no financial opportunities for participation and programmes continued to develop, and this year, in order to get access to these programmes, we need to find resources to cover what remains to the state," he explained.
While the State authorities have the obligation to deliver these resources, he said that the request was made on behalf of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villiareu, to increase their efforts so that the interests relating to them would come as soon as possible.
"They should bring nearly 12 million, and even though the year ends, they didn't give us any money."
The Court will endorse a digital television transition in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogic signals for digitals is one of the most important changes that have made the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court (WC) rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and the Palace of representatives against the Presidential Decree, which transmitted the so-called " Transit to Digital TV" from 2021 to 2015, as eight votes needed to cancel it.
The minority of four ministers, including the Chairman of the Court, Juan Silvu Mess, considered that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded his powers, issued a decree with a detailed description of action to translate to digital ground television.
As a result, the constitutional claims claimed by the Senate have been rejected because of the lack of qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to speak on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement prepared by the Minister Olgoy Sanchez Cordero suggested that the decree be declared unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television programme is the right enshrined under the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel) in violation of the principles of hierarchical subording and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted for the project.
According to this argument, the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to deny the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions mentioned in it relating to the transition to the digital broadcast.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to dismiss the requirement of the Chamber of Deputies without entering the discussion of the project, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive authority could not determine the general rules of measures to be prepared by the State Administration.
"I also don't think that if this happened, it would have affected the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that the public policy planning in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, had an impact on the federal executive authority with a constitutional mandate, the governance of the State.
The replacement of analogic signals for digitals is one of the most important changes that have occurred in recent years, has led to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
The postponing of the transition, he said, would mean postponement of benefits from conversion into a digital form, which includes the satisfaction of public needs that have not only technical dimensions, “such as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues”.
These questions, he said, "the work of the entire system educated under the principle of public economic governance, includes a group of authorities that the Constitution has united into the public executive authority."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital broadcast, and it had done so through the executive authority, despite the existence of acute technical institutions.
It cannot be concluded that, taking the decree discussed, which affects the competences of the Congress, the Government, in the administrative scope of the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
Michoacana analyzes the possibility of the " voice after voice" calculation.
According to the PRV data, the difference between the first and second in the Governor elections is only 27 per cent, even without a summary of 879 votes from the total number of 6.074 protocols.
The possibility of the " voice after voice" is real, as regards the election process in Michoacan this year, where, according to the preliminary electoral results programme (PRV), the difference between the first and second seat in the governing elections is only 27 per cent, even without the summary of the 879 votes of the general protocols.
In the light of that, the Chairman of the General Council of the Institute of Election of Michoacan (IWM), Maria de Los Angeles Landeral Saragosa recalled that several days ago, 9 November, the electoral corps approved a package of principles to harmonize local rules with federal election reform.
It should be recalled that Michoacan did not adopt the Constitution or the Electoral Code of State or the Electoral Law Act, since the Congress of the State approved reforms shortly before the legitimate time of entry into force in this electoral process, and Governor Leonel Gody Rangel did not include its publication within the period set out in the law in the Official Journal of the State, claiming that he had some objections.
On the same day, on 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (CEO) adopted a decision on the constitutional claim issued by the local legislative Assembly, and called the “incorrect and illegal” vote of the representative of the State on the Constitutional Reform, as he has no right to “resolve or support them”.
In an interview on the possibility of " voting," Mary de los Angeles Leanderal claimed that, with the adoption of the relevant principles by the General Council, the IVM would be possible to present partial or complete summary of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, a partial list of one or more electoral urns may be made if the results of the protocols do not match; there is no record of voting and subcalculation of documents in urna or is not the chairperson; or where there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
Furthermore, the total listing of votes in all elections may occur when there is a sign that the difference between the alleged candidate winner and those who have received the second place in the vote, less or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the representative of the party and/or the coalition that set out the second of those candidates.
The total list of votes will also be made if at the end of the normal summary is determined that the difference between the winner and the candidate who took the second place is less than or equal to one percentage, provided there is a request from the political party whose candidate took the second place, in case the electoral urins were excluded, which were taken into account in partial listing.
It should be noted that there are elections in Morelia, where, according to PRW, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 per cent, even without 129 votes from the total number of 923 protocols.
His last will
His dust will be dissolved in the mountains of Sapalinam, confirmed by the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Basio Cortez arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday night; on Monday, there was a scrutiny and a calm mass.
According to the family, the latest will of the Colonel was to have his dust divorced in the mountains of Sapalinam.
Following the condolences with other people who died in the disaster, the family of Basio Cortesa returned to the capital of Coauilla on the aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest people visited the ceremony at Campo Marta.
On the afternoon, the colonel's dust arrived in a clock located on Nazario Ortis Garcia, where the family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 a.m., he conducted a review of the Santillo Technology Institute, organized by his former high school classmates and football team, Felipe Basio, who was a member in high school.
"His desire was to return to Saltilo, and for his dust to be divorced in the mountains of Sapalinam, he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Cortes Basio, the pilot's sister.
She believed that the Colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believed that he was at the peak of her life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, son and a loving brother who was dedicated to his family."
Felipe Cortes Basio left Saltillo very young to attend the Aviation College in Sapopan, Khalisco.
Some didn't believe him, they said he was even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream as a pilot.
His nephew, Jorge Alberto Davila Basio, remembers him as a very good man, "When he arrived in Saltilo, the whole family wanted to welcome him as he brought Marta Saagun to Saltilo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he traveled to Sapopan to his cousin's graduation ceremony, so he knows that his uncle died by doing what he loved most in his life: by running the plane.
He's being taken to the last path
The shootings from the weapons were launched at the Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortes Basio, headed by Governor Horhe Torres Lopez, people from the village and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, the leaders and students of the Technological High School in Saltillo, in which he was studying and in the school, and in sport, performed it last time.
Basio Cortes died recently when the helicopter he managed had been infringed, along with the Secretary of the Province, José Francisco Blake More, and six others, all the representatives of the Ministry.
At 18:05, the residues of Bacio Cortez (cremised), the resident of Saltillo, arrived to be dedicated to the funeral bureau to the members of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Major James Martines, to the training school esplanade, where his family, including his daughter, Amanda and his wife, Christine, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers, had already been waiting for him.
Three bodies found abandoned in the NL farm of Kaderajt
A few hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed 11 persons in the media who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found killed in various parts of the body with a fired fire in the abandoned farm in the Caderaite Himénes municipality, Nuevo Leon.
The discovery was discovered at 1.5 miles of the Cadillate road to Santiago, the highest communities known as El Castillo.
A number of people who passed past noticed that the village house, whose wall was decorated in the beach and brown, had been opened.
When they looked inside, literally in three meters, they discovered the bodies of three people, they immediately informed the authorities concerned.
One of the men was dressed in a yellow t-shirt with black jeans without shoes, and there was another man in the white mother.
The body of another man, in the red shirt and the blue jeans, was practically in one meter.
All three were lying down.
According to the testimony collected there, three people were killed elsewhere, since there were no gils in the place.
There are signs addressed to one organized criminal group, and there are several holes of bullets in the village.
11 Captured in Kaderete
The Ministry of National Security represented 11 people, including a minor who were part of a criminal group, which acted mainly in the Caddyte Municipality, and who were accused of abduction, murders, fraud and secret burying.
According to the publications, eight persons were detained in Los Alvero from the beginning of 11 November, and one person who was hostaged was saved.
They were provided by three houses and phones, requiring to become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another event occurred on 12 November at 6:00 a.m., the military personnel took a patrol round in the village of Old Rancho in Kadereit, when he saw a car without numbers with two men in the room.
By suspending them and conducting an inspection, the soldiers found a gun, a carrier and 18 ambulances.
Later, after these statements, on 13 November at 2:00, one of their companions was suspended in the public land of La True, which, after seeing the military, tried to escape.
He was accused of secret buried in the municipalities of Henneral Terran, Hina and Kaderajt.
The new Italian Government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce a new Government that will face the crisis that put the country to the border of the economic disaster.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday in order to introduce a new Government that will face the crisis that has put Italy on the boundaries of economic disaster and damage to the whole eurozone.
The statement from the Presidential Palace stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President George Napolitano on Wednesday, to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected that he will present the office consisting mainly of technocrats, although it is not understandable when the new executive authority takes its positions.
Monty said he would present to the President the results of his negotiations with political parties in his attempt to form a Government.
"I want to reaffirm my full confidence in the ability of our country to get out of this complex period," said the former European Commissioner for Reporters.
Monty did not say clearly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that obstacles were overcome.
"Structure is now well underlined," he said.
Monty has completed the government's formation process in less than three days, much less common, since Italy had struggled with the political and financial crisis, which has emphasized their debt to a critical level
The administration under the leadership of the former European Commissioner, Monty, should endorse the strict economy package required by European leaders in order to restore confidence to Italy.
On the basis of Monty ' s pressure to speed, the unstable markets have established revenues from the BTP bonds of Italy for 10 years over 7 per cent, where Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marchegalia, the leader of the Italian Emma Worker Federation, informed the reporters after the meeting with Monty, " We said that we would actively support this government."
We believe that this Government is the last chance of Italy to get out of this critical situation.
Monty's chances for success have been much based on the support of the LDCs, Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monty must lead to a good outcome," said Angelino Alphano, the Secretary of the Center-Right Party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important, because many of its members have been opposed to the government majority, consisting of the technokrats formed by Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monty should have strong parliamentary support for reforms, which would likely be unpopular by severe economy reforms.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts can lead to a new and destructive attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Foreign Bank Association has increased pressure, warning that Monty's failure could be a disaster.
Monty began his consultations with political parties, unions and business groups on Monday, as well as youth and female organizations.
He'll finish his row of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday, Napolitano, which allowed a very rapid transition to response to the crisis.
After a short break at the end of the last week, when it became clear that Berluscony would resign, the cost of Italy's debts has now reached a critical level of uncertainty that the new Prime Minister would be successful.
Saving Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern financial defenders of the eurozone.
Monty said that his Government would exist before the following elections for 2013, despite the widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to take reforms before appointing new elections.
Monty said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the main parties insisted that it should only be made of technical experts, as evidence of their displeasure by the impact of the financial situation on the process.
Political sources reported that mutual uncertainty and disagreement of parties have complicated attempts to integrate political figures.
Spaniards have more experience in games than Tikos
Of 22 players stated in Spain, 10 have already played 50 international matches.
For Costa Rica, only one of the 22 claimed players played 50 matches.
A small contrast with Costa Rica, if compared to 22 players caused by both countries for a communion game today at 3:05 p.m. at the National Stadium in San Jos.
While the world champions and Europe, number one in FIFA's monthly rating, have a full list of class A selection games, Tricolor has only a protector of Michael Uman as the only one who has performed 50 international games.
This figure was reached on last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2), at the stadium named Rommel Fernandes.
The Spanish football players played in the League of all stars and strong English Premier League clubs have been very active in the League and local cup competitions this year, and they are high-level players in the European cups and the League of Champions.
This should be added to the experience of the Spanish Fury in a complex qualification in the Euro or the World Championship.
The players of Ticos, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the list is headed in the Spanish collective gollipper Iker Cassillias, who last Sunday versus England (the match lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of an ex-holkiper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Cassillias will play against Tricolor today and establish a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javi Hernandez, Barcelona player, has 106 matches.
Cassillas and Javi were recognized as the best last week of UEFA, along with another Iberian team player, Subisaret, with 126 matches and bomber Shalke Raul Gonzales with 102.
It's almost approaching a hundred Carles Puyole with 97 games.
Javi Alonso follows them with 91, Fernando Torres, from 90, David Willy and Serhio Ramos, both of 81, Andres Injesta, 62, Sesk Fabregas, 61 and David Silva, 53.
By Costa Rica, next to Michael Umana, the left side of Junior Dias with 48 matches and the bomber Brian Ruis from 45.
Furthermore, only five have overcome abroad in 30 games: Calor Navas, 31, Randall Asofeifa, 32, Michael Barrantes, 31, Carlos Ernandez, 36 and Jose Louis Lopez, 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain in Gerar Pike (37), Serhio Buskets (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiol (31).
There are less than 30 outputs in the field with 26 matches, Winston Parks, 26, Gabriel Budilja, 25 and Roy Muri, of 23.
The rest didn't even get to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games, and Hordy Alba has two, Victor Bolivar has only one in Costa Rica, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not debuted yet.
The leader of Spain, David Willya, with 50 goals followed by Fernando Torres, 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruis has become more points, twice as Karlos Hernandez and three times more than Roy Muri and Parks.
Quintet included the country in a tour of the 20th-year career
The journey to Costa Rica is the dream that has come true.
In an exclusive interview with Viva Basist Jeff Amment from Pearl Jam, the group said that it was ready to give one of the best concerts next week at the National Stadium.
There was more than 20 years of expectation, but the group said that it was also a reality dream for them to play in this country.
It was a statement from the Basist and founder, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview with Viva from Brazil last week.
The Panel is in South America in the course of the twentieth year of work and, on Sunday, 20 numbers, will take its only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will speak at the National Stadium, starting from 7:30 a.m. with the team from Los Angeles The X and the local group of Las Robertas.
This is a part of a conversation that is fully decrypted online at The Nation.
For your Costa Rica fans, this is the dream that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica?
The journey to Costa Rica is the dream that is happening and for us, too.
It's just our second visit to South and Central America, and it's still good.
I was in Costa Rica only once - on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
So we are very happy to bring our music there.
I ask that because there is some loyalty to the group; fans live in tension days before the concert.
What will you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
We needed almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret that we took so much time to get here.
Some people, in the expectation of your concert, treat it as the greatest show of the year.
Does this add some tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest show we played in the past 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We took a few great shows in São Paulo, and we hope that this has brought us into shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we like to do surfing and jungle, about these two things, Costa Rica, is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and her surf waves?
We have a lot of surf friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves are incredible here.
My friends always go to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and Mexico, these are excellent places for surfing, that's how we learned, from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you could say you've done great shows with a lot of songs.
What have you planned to make in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show of the most possible songs; we will try to play a few songs from each album and give our fans a great variety of repertoaries.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does that work?
I think that's partly because we have nine plates and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose what songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in tone and surprises us, because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and what we could forget.
This makes the show more interesting for us, so I think it makes it more interesting for people.
This is where you mark 20 years of career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, of course.
First of all, I think none of us could ever imagine that we're in a rock group and that we've been doing this for over 20 years, it's like a dream.
We are happy for our happiness, and we are very excited that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and we like to make music.
We are happy to go around the world where we always wanted to go.
It's all very good for us.
What does it mean to you to be a major part of the grange flower?
It was always an honour to be part of this group of great collectives.
We're good friends with guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's great when the movement grows from a group of friends, and it's unusual.
From time to time, one group in the same city appears, but much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
I'm still playing with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at Alice's in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we are happy to be friends with all of them and to us the honour to be part of the sound of Seattle that came up.
It is also very strange that a group like yours remains together and in the same composition for a long time.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt Cameron joined us 13 years ago, which is much longer than many groups exist.
First of all, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and secondly, we're taking care of others.
We are all very close friends, and so have been opened musical roads that give each one the freedom of experiment.
We trust music one another, and everything could not be better.
Your attitude to the word of glory was difficult; but thanks to your success, you could do whatever you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
When we grew up, it was easier to find a balance.
We care not to be in the tour too long, because it's easy to get into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember people here for music, it reminds you that you must respect music and what has done, without being a celebrity and being a rock star, what none of us cares about.
What kind of other project do you remember, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs, and at first it was great.
We were a group for almost three years and did not release any album until Andrew Woods died.
It was a lot of disappointment because it lasted so long and the most important thing that we were still close friends with Bruce (Fervezer) and Greg (Gilmore), who started with us in a group, and when I hear a song or see a photograph, I think about an amazing man who was Andy, and as he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh, to talk about music and football and a lot of other people.
He was a great man, and we miss him.
The local group of Las Robertas will be responsible for opening a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Wadder, and that's why you chose it to open it?
Yes, the producers sent us a few video suggestions, and this was a group that we liked most of all, so we look forward to seeing Las Robertas can offer it live, and it must be very exciting.
Why do you keep changing the words at Yellow Ledbetter at the concerts?
That's the question of Ed, Eddie Wadder, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he's using the first thing that comes to his head.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
They're so many.
Among the first ones who come to mind, Giser Butler, John Antvisle, C.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
They're so many that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the relevance of the grange, despite his fashion?
I think we all feel some distraction from the word grange.
When I think about him, he reminds me of the groups I've mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all who appeared at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's great because it's music that you're worth listening, and the teams like Mudhoney are now making music better than ever.
At first, your music was darker, and now it's become more positive.
How will you explain this change?
It's interesting, because I think there's a few songs in the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are considered very dark, though they can sound a little positive.
From both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs were very dark.
I think when you grow up, and in your life, there was some injury, and you lost a family or a friend, these events start to affect your art and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect this for me.
So, I think you can be a happy man and still know how to create a dark music.
Peru:
Fuchimori was re-habited for medical surveys
The Ex-President Alberto Fuhimori was hospitalized on Tuesday to the State Hospital to survey the loss of muscle force, which was observed in his legs, said his family doctor.
Fuchimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years of prison for human rights violations committed during its rule (1990-2000), suffered from several diseases, including language cancer, for which he was surveyed four times and is monitored.
Congressman Alejandro Aginega, who is his personal doctor, told the TV channel N that Fuhimori would be investigated for three days in the National Institute for Neoplastic Diseases in order to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in its lower ends.
Aginoga said that he believed that Fuhimori should be a candidate for the benefit of mercy from humanitarian reasons; however, he said he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He carried four tongue cancer operations, lost 18 pounds weight, and other diseases, such as a strong erosive gastrite, iron fibers, stones in kidneys, high blood pressure and problems with blood turning in his legs, listed by the doctor.
Fuhimori is in prison since September 2007, in the Police National Office of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years of prison for the murder of 25 people by the troops of destruction of the army, which had been secretly acting in the first years of his rule.
Muhika is sent to Mexico to strengthen political relations
The official delegation, headed by President Uruguay José Muhiko, and consisting of several ministers and businessmen, will arrive on this Tuesday with a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two countries and to begin negotiations on the political issues of the region.
Muhika will meet the next Wednesday with her Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderonen, the most important point of the comprehensive plan of meeting with political, commercial authorities and meetings with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to the schedule published by Uruguay leadership.
The meeting of two Presidents in Guadalahara would be “a favourable to exchange information on political relations between the two nations”, as published by the leadership of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Muhika is seeking support for Calderon for Uruguay in the incident with France, which happened when the French President Nikola Sarkozy included the South American country in a list of taxes at the G20 meeting in the French town of Canne.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries remaining taxes in the ports, a statement that had prompted Uruguay and responded to the consultations of his Ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chaired in G20 since November, a group created from the most developed and developing countries, and has, in fact, the South American country since January this year a tax exchange agreement to avoid double taxes.
The Government of Uruguay has been trying to accelerate the conclusion of tax exchange agreements in recent years to leave this " grey list" of the Economic Cooperation and Development Organization, composed of countries that do not use international tax cooperation standards.
With regard to the Trade Plan, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 the Free Trade Agreement (STS), which has increased the goods between the two countries.
"Super Mario 3D Land" will be three-dimensional.
Super Mario fought for more than 25 years to save Princess Pitch from the evil foot of Bouzera, but he never did it in three dimensions before: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
The publication, which will appear in the world's shops this month, has been created in light of the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need to use the points.
"Mario is a hero, who should report how the stereoscopy will work without the points," said Nintendo, head of the Nintendo press service in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first Nintendo video game that was designed under this platform", because the successful products such as Star Fox 64 3D or Zelda: Ocarin of Time 3D were adaptations to existing games.
The representative of Nintendo stated that, despite the existence of 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and moving game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part of "simple" to attract less experienced users.
On one occasion, most experts will go "in the second round" to the levels of the game, which are at this time more complex.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or the one that only affects the depth of action but which needs to be played in three dimensions to overcome various obstacles and "do not subject to optical illusions".
This invasion of Super Mario in three dimensions also implies the return of the hero to the portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo migrates the fans of the series and repeats the successful formula from the previous games, the waterkeeper with the whistle must go through dangerous minered platforms to release princess Pitch.
However, the player will find new movements, decorations, suits and enemies, as well as the "player" of Luigi.
The Colom guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the extradition process of Alfonso Portillo began to answer in the United States for the washing conspiracy of $70 million.
This ends the process on which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which required the extradition of Portillo to judge it there.
At the press conference, Colom said that his decision was related to the independence of the judicial and executive authorities, taking into account that the first instance court had already signed an extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate he had not “incorporated his hands” to legal decisions and had taken all the extradition procedures he ever knew.
Together with the Portillo Serhio Ruano Marrokin, he will be extradicated for murder and severe body damage, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug harvest.
What was done by Colom shows the executive process after all legal and constitutional courts were exhausted to pursue the ex-head of the State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (COP), the Portillo will be extradicated once, with a decision on its legal situation in Guatemala and the guarantee of its human rights.
The Portillo was recognized as innocent in the execution of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a pre-extradition process, but the Ministry of Public Relations filed an appeal and reopened the case.
Trinyov helped 6,000 young people from the risk group
The organization was established to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of the Triniova Social Support Organization are important: 6,000 young people under social isolation have helped overcome the complex situations during this fourth century.
More than a hundred workplaces for the social group should be added to this.
The anniversary served as a result of the ceremony held in the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinius appeared next to Triniat Vela in 1986 to help young people with lack of education, lack of work and drug problems or marginalization.
The yesterday celebration in Sant Andreu gathered a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that cooperated with the association during these 25 years.
Different political representation during elections showed a single nature of work done by Triniova.
Following the President of the Generality, Arthur Mass, and his predecessor Hordy Puhol, the ceremony were visited by the former consultant of the Socialist Education, Ernest Maragal, and the ex-mailer of the mayor and the current eco-socialist, a member of the municipal Council, Rickard Goma.
Furthermore, in Fabra I Coats, the current social and family consultant, Josep Lewis Claris and the SEC on La Caixa social work, Ham Lanasp.
He said that Trinius had emerged at a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but he added that the work done so far was a "good basis".
The Chairman led Triniova as an example of combating bad circumstances and rendering hope for people who experienced difficulties.
"The Crisis is not new for the organization and work it has done," he said.
The captured building, where mass parties were organized, was evacuated
Conquerers occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on the street of Balmes, 51
12 occupants left the building yesterday noon.
It seems that a nightmare experienced by neighbors living in the house 51 on the street of Balmes came to the end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building that they occupied illegally yesterday at noon and where they organized mass parties that irritated the neighbours by the court without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent the repeat of the situation.
"From now there will be a passage control," said the manager.
The squatters that took 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the other settled, all the electricity and part of the water, drew the walls and left traces of different types, especially the banks from alcoholic drinks.
The first three floors were a site for mass parties that lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
The nightclub, Balmes 51, was immediately behind the building, which was also damaged.
The Master, Maria Pantinat, reported Europe Press that since the building was occupied, its income decreased by 80 per cent.
The owner of the club said that the captains of the building dragged her into an unfair competition, since they sold drinks for three euros, while at the 10th club.
Furthermore, the discotec owner had to respond to the noise complaints of the neighbours, although she noted that noise had been caused by non-club visitors, but by the people of the scotton, and, first of all, those who visited the parties that were organized there, frequency and intensity of which grew up, as said the angry neighbors.
The master of the club said that the uncomfortableness was so big that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months he's "forgiving" her rent.
The city police also confirmed that she had received more complaints from the neighbors on the situation over the past weeks.
The Chairman of the Municipal Group of PP, adviser Alberto Fernand Dias, requested last week " to evacuate the building immediately in order to address the problems of coexistence and common spirit that appeared in the neighbours and degradation in this area".
The popular leader explained that only one floor of the building was busy until summer, but in the past few months the squatters invaded all floors and practically into each room and that some of them had been invasions.
In this sense, he added that “the end of impunity must be ending and standing against the non-culturality of the building”.
So yesterday the police evacuated the building in Nou Barris.
At 15:30, the police left Montrall Street, 35 after they received a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or forest?
The architects agree with the possibility of a competition after the barriers on contributions
The municipal competition at 16 doors resumed the role of Kolserola in Barcelona
In mid-80s, at the rise of the Stole Corporation of Barcelona (CCC), the administration printed promo lists for Calserola.
The bullet described the mountain as a large park of Barcelona.
Furthermore, this was accompanied by the pictures of the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the SCB, in 1987, the park again took place in consciousness of many as Barcelona's highest point as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few who were oriented not north-south, but up (hore) down (sea).
Calserola's position as a natural park is contrary to this idea.
The prototype was not the Central Park, but the Yellowstone, with a wild cab as a bear of Yoge.
That was until, in September, the Council announced huge competitions, consisting of 16 competitions for many other gates in Calserol.
The idea of the park is under the gate, of course.
Either so, or someone wants to put the gate on the field.
The question is: Calserola, a park or a mountain?
The competitions and their organizational side and their influence on the city are a theme to discuss all Barcelona's architects.
This is not the most repeating topic discussed when two members of the chosen people recognize each other in the elevator.
And this is one of the few coincidences between the three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who were present.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: Competition appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the coastal line, it is "necessary" to discuss "the front of the mountain" when the proposal of Ildefon Serda, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
"We must let Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Besides, thanks to his great availability.
Calserola is more complicated," says architect, for whom the "gate of Calserola" contains a "familiar trap," and we should not think of them as "as entering the park, but as restricting some zones where we should act."
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayona with urban experience, called the proposal "intellectual task" with "some dangers".
Risks resulting in the "indetermination of public space forecasting" after the 1980s experience, which ended on the Forum ' s "s singing swan".
The first fear is the limitation of the borders where it can be built.
"The limitation of something is the preparation of the next step," is meant, transition.
"We must think of new urban planning tools, because the current [specific to the General Capital Plan (GSP)] can lead to real trouble."
Besides, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Calserola Valley "may be understood as a park, Barcelona, and not" as a pure topographic question.
The module recalls that there is already a work done outside Calserola, which "does not be missed by the ears", although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor offers to his profession, to enter this project from the beginning.
Moreover, he realizes that the nearestness of the mountains to the city is a passage that allows the architects to enter into debate, but "he doubts" that this technical profile should be the one that should lead the interdisciplinary teams (the success), he claims, which they should have created: "Architects must be only a tool."
Bayona suggests that the question that asks the name of this part is complicated, since the rules of competition lack the general type of Colserola: "The area has been declared 16 crossing competitions," he said, in the sense of the mountain, but there is no long reading to see and understand the area as a whole."
This, at least in his case, makes it possible for 16 contests.
On the other hand, the project for one gate can be crossed by the programme and definition with the draft architect for the neighbouring gate.
In your view, the Council must ensure that the trails are directly above Rhonda de Dalt, in full, the area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released
After 72 days of the settlement, the Judiciary of Red Casino pardoned the Mayor Monterrey's brother in the process against him in charge of expulsion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be free after the legitimate representative of Red Casino pardoned him to the Second Criminal District Court, which is conducting the expulsion process against Mayor Montrey.
After the Casino Royale bomb, the owner of the Red Casino, Serhio Gil Garcia, published a series of photographs and videos where Manuel Jonas seemed to require him to pay his economic contribution to allow the Monterrey authorities to permit a secret operation in the game house.
After public conviction, the State Prosecutor opened a criminal case against the Mayor's brother and on 2 September, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agent of the Ministry of Inheritance Crime, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old capital of the State.
It remained there for 49 days, following the second order for the prohibition of movement after the prosecutor excluded the offences of confinement and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Kaderete for the expulsion of half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison with the middle degree of isolation of prisoners because he was threatened by death.
The authorities allowed him to continue a municipal prison in San Nicholas, Garza.
On 25 October the arrest order was issued by the Secretary of the Second District Court, Jorge Janes, who said that after nearly two months of investigations, Jonas was sufficiently evidently guilty, such as taking 1.5 million peso with bookkeers in exchange for the authorization of the operation.
On Monday, the Legislative Representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, was presented to Judge Jose Louis Pesina to request pardon for the Mayor of the region, so he could receive freedom in the next hour.
During the trial, the State Prosecutor, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomesa whether he compensated for damage and who of the partners in the game house embarrassed, although the lawyer tried not to speak the name.
Based on the 197/2011 record, the legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrasabal, and thereafter no statements on the process planned against him; no reimbursement of damage and punishment would be required.
Following the hearing of a legitimate bookkeeper representative, nearly at 3:50, it was ordered to release Larrasabal Breton immediately.
The servant of the court, Jorge Janes, went to the San Nicholas Municipality in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also inform him of the immediate order for the release signed by the judge.
Minister Dionisio Peres Hakome tells about the details of the disaster where the Minister of Interior, Francisco Blake, died, and seven others.
The Ministry of Communication and Transport (ICT) reported that the results obtained in an accident, during which the Minister of Interior Francesco Blake Mora and seven other people died, showed that the helicopter had hit the ground directly in full state, without attempts of the pilot to make an emergency landing.
During the press conference, Dionysio Peres Hakome, the Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft rose up, the pilot found that weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"The elements that seem to show that the ship had several contacts with the ground have contacted the wings of the trees at 25 meters where the tool was lost."
He also reported that the vessel was designated for 19 persons, respectively, in accordance with the necessary requirements for the transport of persons.
He also said that studies conducted in the area of impact did not report on the existence of parts on earth.
"The study reported that there were no components of the ship elsewhere, the struggle was in the structural integrity.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers, which satisfied the requirements for transportation of passengers.
The earth in this place has a slope from seven to 30 degrees.
At this point, the Secretary said, the main thing is to obtain the results as soon as possible; however, the study could take several months or even one year.
In the meantime, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Support Services, said that during the attack, the presidential helicopter was managed at creiser speed and that this happened on softly rising ground.
"That information strengthens the hypothesis of the normal summer maneuvre at the time of strike," he said.
At the press conference, the owner of the SCT, Perez Hakome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aircraft rules, the flight was carried out under the rules of visual flight, which means that the team should be visible during the flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports revealed the appropriate conditions for the flight when the aircraft had directed the border territory between Mexico and the State of Mexico, where clouds were found at low heights.
Selected routes:
It is possible that, due to cloud conditions, the team was looking for a zone of lower height and more apparent in the Quernawac Valley.
It's a place of strike.
The coordinates of the strike and the latest records from the aircraft radar match, probably there was no loss of control or change in the direction of the flight before the attack.
Distribution of fractures on a small area:
The information available still indicates that the strike occurred on the front and side line.
The fracture of fractures makes it clear that the helicopter struck the ground in the structural integrity.
No obvious signs of fire or explosion have been found:
The disaster area remains undetected evidence in the fractures of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
The results of the recent studies show that there could be multiple contacts with the earth.
During the seat work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9.200 feet above the sea level, and the ground has seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The images show a sequence in which it was destroyed on the road.
Information contains facts that seem to show that the helicopter could have had several conflicts with the earth.
Following a thorough study in the larger territory than the outlined zone near the scene of the disaster, no parts of the aircraft were found discarded, which strengthens the presumption that the impact had occurred under the structural integrity.
MSS announces a programme of searching for a density gene
Social Protection is headed by an examination of abnormality genes in children and young people; it is supported by IPN experts.
The Mexican Institute for Social Protection (MSSI) announced that it was conducting a study in order to identify the abnormality gene of children and young people, which was called “Genetics of abnormality in childhood and adolescent age”, which would provide an estimate of signs related to excessive weight.
In his statement, the Head of the Division of Medical Studies in Biochemy of the National Medical Centre of the twenty-first century Miguel Cruz Lopez explained that a multi-profile team from therapists, nurses, dietologists and social workers was gathered.
This team is assisted by experts and assistants of the National Health Institute (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Supreme Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Political Institute (NPI).
The population (subscribed or not) is invited to participate in the MSSI sports centres that participate in the study in the Mexico Valley, where the children will be tested each Saturday, from 8:00 a.m.
He emphasized that the protocol began to be conducted in the Sport Centre in Quautemoke (West of Mexico), and from 8 October at the Nesaualcoitle sports centre (East of Mexico).
Following the aim of attraction from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue in the sports center of Independence (South Mexico) and finally in Morelos (North Mexico).
He explained that the purpose of this study was to understand the genetic and importance of the development of density and to set a risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases
The World Diabetes Day will be noted on 14 November, and the main objective is to gather three thousand children and adolescents aged between 6 and 14 years from parents' permission and under their care for individual food surveys.
They will also be asked about physical activity and history of family inheritance diseases to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or kidney inadequateness.
He explained that all participants (weight, growth and scope), blood pressure measurement and glucose, fat, cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis will be carried out on Saturday (to identify genes associated with child density).
Cruz Lopez said that this study reflects the concern of health professionals about the anxious increase in the weight of children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 indicate that only six years of growth had occurred: 77 per cent of the boys suffered from fattyness, 47 per cent in case of girls; with regard to overweight, there was also significant growth," MSSI said.
He said that the foundation of the search markers was based on the fact that the population of the country differed from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican was 65 per cent of the descendant of American Indians, 30 per cent of the European descendants and five per cent of the African descendants, and that was affected by genes associated with diabetes and excessive weight.
He explained that primarily the result of density genetics is the inability of the body to burn the amount of energy we consume (caloria) and is deferred as fat.
The researcher explained that a direct benefit for the participants was a comprehensive assessment of children that could detect whether they had any excessive weight or obesity.
Even, he said, the fact that there were dark necks on the neck (actants) and predecessions means the probability of metabolism and even prediabeth.
Information is addressed with all confidentiality, the doctors transmit it in writing to their parents, explaining all the dimensions and changes in the lifestyle that must be taken to avoid diseases.
Cruise Lopez explained that there are three main reasons that cause excessive weight, fatty and other chronic diseases: seating lifestyle, or lack of daily physical activity, a majority of the day before the TV and the use of transport on small distances instead of walking.
It is also due to high consumption of calories, i.e. increased consumption of sweet drinks and carbons (tammale, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with large contents of fats and proteins and genetic predominance, analysed in the programme.
UNAM asfalt can avoid cracks
Raphael Errera, a researcher in the UNAM Chemical Faculty, developed a polymer modified bitum to produce a mixture of best quality sustained to environmental and temperature impact.
If the road-covering signals were paid attention, there would be approximately 200,000 tubes needed to be repaired for each rain season in the capital area in the Mexico Valley, said Rafael Errera Nahera, a researcher of the UNAM Chemical Faculty, and added that if the process of construction and content of the affalted road covering is correct, the number of pits could be reduced or totally declined to zero.
In his lecture, the Technological view of the pits read within the International Year of Chemicals reports that the lab, for which it is responsible, develops a polymer-modified bitum for the production of mixtures close to bitum, but with better resistance both at high and low temperatures.
Errera Nahera said that this type of modified bitum could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some towns in the north, to improve the quality of roads and, therefore, the opposition to the education of pits.
He explained that the bitum, the most difficult part of oil, is the sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, one of the high molecular mass called asphaltenas, and the other is a low molecular mass called maltens, which together supplies the road coverage of its characteristics.
The bitum's strong behaviour is the fact that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees it acts as fluid, at 120 high, and at 50 degrees in Celsia, it remains almost solid, while at very low temperatures, the bitum becomes tight, he said.
This means that the resistance of the street asphalt is not permanent, but changes during the day, depending on natural conditions and temperatures, said the chemical engineering expert.
Hemfaca observed that Mexico streets were mainly covered by flexible coverage, which consisted of six layers of material, of which three last included bitum.
Among the top layers, there is a bit of small stones dropped into bitum and then conceived.
Every stone that makes this cover, he said it was loaded into a bitum.
In the movement of vehicles and efforts, this helps the forces to be very well distributed by road coverage.
If it was a modified asphalt, they would have been even better distributed, said the chemical engineer.
At the asphalt cover, he added, the last layer, which is called a layer of export, made of a small stone, was actually a sand floated into the asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will contact transport wheels, it must have greater resistance than asphalt covering and providing road training.
As part of the road coverage that will receive and disseminate the efforts, the export layer also requires adequate thickness and must be taken into account the material from which it is produced.
The weather, especially the moisture and temperature declines, are also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it has significant impact on the status of the asphalt.
When the ground is dry, the water is incorporated and it is difficult to get out of there, it causes the mitigation of all layers of coverage and, therefore, the education of pits.
During the education of caves, he said, the first layer of exports is being carried out, and only then it affects the bitum, but the damage does not occur immediately, which should be given attention in the first signs of the current repair programmes.
Furthermore, a member of the National Research System explained that transport load is another important factor in the development of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer of covering must always be linked to the transport load and that requirement must be guaranteed to prevent frequent appearance of jaws.
Raphael Errera said that, for example, bitum emulsions that have already been on the market and even helped to manage high temperatures.
What was not enough for the Valier candidate to become the new Miss of Colombia?
Analysis of the reasons that prevented Serna Meline Ramirez from receiving Miss Colombia's crown.
The representative of Valier received the title of the princess 14 times.
The next time, the Valie Del Cauca is only to wish to receive Miss Colombia's crown.
This time, Melina Ramires Serna had to be pleased that she had reached the winners with a silver crown and a trailer proclaiming her new princess of Colombia.
In view of the outcome reached last night in Cartachen, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and skipetr, the Department is 14 titled princess, and Melina joins the Legion of Women from Valie Del Cauca, who were close to the crown, but were declared by princess, among them Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domingez (1949), Patricia Belieni Ayala (1979), Laurena Alvares (1981), Rose Mary Alsate (1983), Olga Maria Arieldo (1987), Layla Blanke (1988), Monica Everes (1989), Maria Sonswella Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Hisey Alhure Garcez (2000), Catalina Hiraldo (2007), Stephanie Harcez Alhure (1989).
A question that many are now asking:
Because the result was the defeat of the main favorite, which in each of the talks showed that she had everything to become the new Miss of Columbia, not just so she was elected by the Queen of the Police and the most beautiful person on the version of Vogue -- the titles of the queens, such as Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who had received the crowns of Miss Colombia.
The first factor in the jury's decision to condemn the title of the First Princess was that she could not convincingly answer the question "What book is characterized by you and why?", asked by Martin Murille Gomez from the literary society, let us read.
She replied to the questionnaire:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of occulting, and I definitely think that the book that characterizes my childhood is "Little Prince" is a pretty deep book.
Today I read "Crime and Punishment" is a series of world literature that should be read all of us; I also read the book of Irina Nemirova, Russian writer, a wonderful book called "Blood Heat".
Answer that did not like the jury because of the term “occulture” and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically how each of the quoted books characterize it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said that she was calm and satisfied with her result, "the universe wise thing happens."
And you all, please read a little bit, "Little Prince" is a big book.
Among the sound hypotheses, Valier burned from favoritism.
The reporter from Bogota assumed that since she was preferred, she was a candidate who received all preliminary prizes (culinary competition of the Ostera, the sighting vote for the best national suit, and the Queen-Math), "which excited the jealousy of other candidates, caused the queen's stress, and as a result, it did not shine on the scene."
And it was noted during her first appearance in the swimming beach of Hilton and during two shows at the evening coronation.
Although it seemed confident in both, it was noted that it lacked the strength and energy that the representatives of Magdalene and Atlantic demonstrated.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milena was called the princess " means that a candidate who wins more awards during the competition does not become a queen."
Furthermore, the representative of Valier has recently avoided communication with the press and it was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valier failed to convince the jury of its interest in social work, which is finally the essential of the National Beauty Competition.
That is why two days before the election, a member of the international jury, Lucy Doti, said that they were looking for a woman committed to their country ' s social needs.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, we should not only look at the appearance but also focus on public consciousness, before they take part in the competition, they should already be involved in projects," she said.
There is also an assumption that the representative of Valier had sinned with defects on her belly and fibrosis, which was seen on her stomach, but it was controversial, since the jury had noted her as a "natural beauty" candidate, taking into account her healthier body, good food and responsibilities of physical work.
King Jorge Hernan Orosco adviser notes that Melina had not the best body that had better, "but the problems of fibrosis on my stomach, which were not very noticed, made her lose her glasses on the last day."
In the meantime, the journalist Guido Oyos of Cromos believes that the error of the representative of Valie de Cauca was that it was surgery.
"Operations are good, but Valier's representative doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the prize that was first delivered to the National Beauty Competition, the cruel prophecy took place last night said that it was a child that Reimundo gave Melyn to compensate for losing the pleasure of receiving the crown.
This is or not, the fact that Melina today has a year of rule, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions identified directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, it will enter history as one of the queens, who, despite its excellent contest in Cartachen, faced difficulties in receiving the crown.
This was the work of a man who identified the body of Alfonso Kano.
Criminalist from Kali came into history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Kano.
The work of these servants is key.
On 4 November, CTI Kali criminalist entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the head of FARC Alfonso Kano compared with his fingerprints.
Seven of the CTI criminals, this week, the queue was to retrieve Eliza Gonzales, a man from Puerto Tehad, who spent 21 years in the field of trial.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzales worked in cities of Choco, where he often had to spend more than five days through the jungle to reach the places where the bodies had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valie and became a professional in the field of criminalism, where he studied skin trends, i.e. arms and steels.
On the week of Elizare's identification operation, known as Alfonso Kano, he was told to take clothes for no more than three days.
Something's getting closer.
On Friday night, he arrived on a helicopter from Kauka to Palmir.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to a man who was head of the world's older party war, so they asked him to take ten pictures of Guillermo Leon Saens' prints.
However, when he arrived with the research team to the place where the body was located, he did not identify it in an external form; he was very different from what was shown in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed as a local farmer, without scores and much worse.
But the fingerprints aren't lying.
Using an increased glass, ink, shovel, and lamp, Elizar compared the body's fingerprints with those on the photos.
His eyes weren't disappointed, it was Alfonso Kano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Tehda requested confirmation of the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinson, that it was the leader of the RSC
Search for fingerprints
The recognition received from President Juan Manuel Santos Elisere Gonzales at the press conference on the operation against Cano is particularly important for the Sijin Unit.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactylscopy is strict science, without mistakes, it can play a key role in the discovery of crimes.
In addition to the identification of bodies, ductyloscopic experts are taking part in the investigation of crimes such as stealing and murder and identify the identity of detainees.
In detention, many criminals have false certificates or have no documents.
We're taking their prints and looking for them in the base.
The researcher said that in the case of stealing, he had to take a piece of the wall home because the thief was resisting his hands in this place to possess a safe full of precious and money.
"It is hard to work with the walls because they are not comfortable to remove the prints, but in this case we can take a picture of the entire arm and establish the identity of a criminal who participated in several stealing," he said.
The prints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
A dead man was recently found with bottles from under the liquor around him.
During the investigation, a relative could have been suspected in committing a crime and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle were coincided.
Although it doesn't guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves he was at the murder scene.
The CTI Daktiloscopic specialist explained that chemical or physical reaction is in place where there are prints.
When they appear, a shovel or a tape is used to remove them.
The prints are then sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or are registered.
"The problem is that we still have many non-documented colombians," CTI expert said.
He explained that it was not the way it was shown in the CSI television.
Just like not all the gold that shines, not everything you touch leaves your fingerprints on.
However, if possible, the comparison is made.
"Angered People" challenge the New York authorities
A hundred protesters broke the camp in front of the Zukcotti Square.
Part of the protesters heard the decision of the court to prosecute a demonstration from the square and sent to the neighbourhood park.
The members of the Wall Street Movement called the New York authorities on Tuesday when they tried to invade again, under the protection of a court order, to the Manhattan Square, where they were evacuated at sunrise when they were attempted to capture another park of the Great Apple.
There were hundreds of protesters copied at the Zukotti Square, where they wanted to fall by a judicial order that allowed the " angry people" to break the camp on the square, while the other part of the movement replied to the range, captured the park in the north of the city, where further arrests were held
"Our idea is that, as the court does not allow us to break the camp on the square, we will break the camp somewhere else and continue the judicial fight for returning to Zukotti and through the peaceful strike and demonstration," said Mark Bray, one of the representatives of the Wall Street Movement.
Brey explained that the response of the " angry people" to the evacuation of the city, which was given by mayor of New York by Michael Bloomberg, entered the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued a decision prohibiting the violent evacuation from the square and allowing demonstrators to remain in the camp.
Furthermore, the “angered people” approached the capture of a new park located in the centre streets of Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the ownership of the Church of Trinity.
At least for an hour, they could take this place, but then the police arrived and started arresting some of the protesters, although Brey couldn't name the exact number, but told the Efe that he saw several journalists who were also in handcuffs.
The Organization assures that several hundred people were standing with tents where the delegation of religious leaders went to show support to the members of the movement, trying to speak as a mediator in negotiations with the police.
In the meantime, the Zukotti area, which is a private property, remains closed to the expectation of a trial appointed on this Tuesday, which will consider the legitimacy of this morning's prosecuting prosecutors.
Some of the protesters who were heading there were carrying and disseminating copies of the judgement at the same time and even giving these copies to police guarding the area, which led to " some small conflicts", said Brey, who said that some police were beaten by demonstrators.
The Judicial Decision prohibits the authorities to evacuate members of the Wall Street Movement and force " laws issued after the start of the capture, or to prohibit the demonstrators from accessing the park again with shops and other property used earlier".
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that the city had suspended the opening of the public space, and the demonstrators were informed about it, but local laws do not allow them to deploy the bedrooms and bedroom bags again.
The municipal council has personally justified the removal of the protestants from the Zukotti area during the morning, the operation during which approximately 200 arrests were committed, and the decision was taken, because the protesters had “violated the law”.
Bloomberg said that he had ordered to clean the area because it was “the place where people had come not to protest but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm others”, because some companies had been threatened, and the neighbors feared that they would "remember life quality".
The evacuation that took place this morning was disgusting and showed that Bloomberg was more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers," added the representative of the movement that condemned the Mayor ' s ' disrespect for freedom of speech.
The responsibility for Wall Street Captures also indicated that they intend to organize “great shares” on Thursday in collaboration with public organizations and trade unions to remember the last two months of the protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will become the Virgin Mary in the special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Buble and other extraordinary Canadians, it will be presented in the " Russell Peters Christmas" television programme on 1 December.

The private TV channel announced today that Anderson, along with the coroner (balad performer) Michael Buble and other extraordinary Canadians, would appear on the "Russel Peters Christmas" program on 1 December, as an absolutely special Maria.
The CTV presented today television show, in which Anderson, also known as the widespread web-wide pornography video, was presented with her husband, Tommy Crüe's drumman, is also dressed as the Virgin Maria, holding a doll in the ears of Jesus' image.
In this scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comic of Indian origin, who recently acted as a leading to the torpedo of "My cruel torpedo of truth" Charlie Shina, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a Canadian singer of Buble participated in the special Christmas show in the CCTV, who married in Buenos Aires at the Argentine model Louisian Lopilato, and also knows the scandals.
Recently, Buble named America Success Kim Cardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan restored after the earthquake
GDP increased by 1.5 per cent by internal consumption and put an end to the drop-down lane that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and has still been recovered from the destructive earthquake caused by a nuclear crisis, the most scary disaster that the Earth of the Sun since World War II had suffered.
According to the first estimates of the Government of Tokyo, material losses amounted to $300,000 million -- a strike that seemed to pass, despite the difficult world situation.
After three loss blocks, the gross domestic product data from July to September definitely helped to turn the page: GDP increased by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and by 6 per cent in the annual calculation.
The second quarter registered - for Japanese the financial year begins in March 2012 - also highlights the fastest growth rates from January to March 2010.
Renaissance can be partially explained by renewing the purchase of machine equipment for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and followed by tsunami.
In fact, companies have increased their investment by 1.1 per cent against reducing by 0.9 per cent of capital costs, which had been observed since January to March, the first reduction after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real fracture in the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Cainsian impulse, which calls for an increased crisis - or restructuring infrastructure using lies to grow from zero.
Japan has awakened, mainly through the development of domestic consumption, which is now 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This indicator increased by 1% by increasing the cost of cars, travel and rest.
Let's Clean Yena
Tokyo provided the internal market when Yena - Japanese currency - became one of the " asylum valuables" selected by investors who want to relieve the debt crisis in the euro area and negative prognosis regarding the United States, the privilege that puts the privilege as a rock on the account of exporters.
With a stronger currency, the product is expensive, which is a serious impact for the country whose economic course is defined as a health of large technological companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame yen for their low indicators from July to September.
As long as the markets continue to lay down the EU peripheral countries, the Government of Esichico Noda does not reduce caution.
We should be careful of the persistent risks such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the flood in Thailand and the rapid improvement of yena, said yesterday the Minister for Economic Policy of Motohis Furukawa.
And in fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most participants demonstrated the apparent signs of economic decline in September.
The indicator that predicts breakdowns in the world economy has shown that the major forces are slowing down.
Then it fell by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below the average, which is at 100 points, after it crashed at eight tenths to 99.13.
Athens again give soil to doubt
Papademos said that the correction would be approved, but the conservators would not sign any written obligation
With the peripheral prizes for the risk and indetermination of the parks, Greece continues to wander around the labyrinth, which leads to a great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “agreement” of the new transitional Government of Ellada was rather imposed by Brussels's requirements than by the true conviction of political forces, began to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lucas Papademos yesterday warned that alternatives to structural reforms were not available and that the 100-day period agreed with its appointment may be insufficient for their use, the leader of the Conservative Party, Antonis Samaras, assured that there would be no support for the new strict economy in any case and repeated its requirement for new elections appointed on 19 February.
The main task of the Government is to implement the decisions taken at the Summit on 26 October, said Papademos yesterday, opening parliamentary debates that will be encountered tomorrow with the reliability of the new executive authority.
The 24 employment package, the disciplinary code of public officials and new measures to combat tax remedies will be the first innovation.
However, the message of Samaras does not clarify the question of his position: "We are ready to help the transitional Government, but we do not promise anything."
The Conservators leader made a step more in his moods regarding the EU and the IMF, organizations that should freeze 8.000 million of the Athens urgently needed, and explained that he would not grant its approval to any letter of agreement with the requirements of the treaty.
However, the European Commission, still irritated by the effect caused by the Papandre referendum's all or nothing, repeated yesterday that its requirements were clear: it would not resume assistance if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties did not sign "written agreement without any bilaterality and as soon as possible".
The representative of the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafai, said that the three inspectors could " very soon" return to Athens to discuss with the new Government "what must be made to pay the sixth tranche" of 8.000 million, although the exact date is not yet marked.
In the Greek club, there's enough thread for a while.
Ms. Sofia: " These are tools for progress and hope."
The Queen emphasized Spain ' s " fundamental " place with regard to this type of finance
Spain has taken a visible place in the world in the field of microfinance.
The Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that in the last two decades, the country became the second largest donor in relation to cooperation tools whose "essence", she said, "the instrument of social progress, justice and hope for the best future of all mankind, based on faith in people."
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Summit on Microcredit in Valiadolide with the belief that " there is no doubt " that such actions are " absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium objectives established by the United Nations by 2015, and "specifically aimed at reducing the double number of people living less than one dollar per day -- the level at which the " line of poverty " .
Spain is still working in order to expand the receiving network around the world and take this task with all "responsibilities", and hopes that the efforts and achievements of the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will "provide the creation of new capacities and best opportunities for the poorest people, and especially for women, "the primary recipients of these concessions".
There are many achievements and many difficulties that we face.
Microcredit summit becomes not only a dispute area but also a platform that contributes to "two main objectives".
Thus, Her Majesty explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would be used by these financial services and a hundred million of these households would be earmarked from the poverty they have been loaded into.
The impulse for the establishment of a microcredit system in Spain and all the rest of the world " went on the path started years ago" by Muhammad Junus, stressed Ms. Sofia as "act of justice and recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as a "delightful idealist in the universal fight against poverty" whose work is known for 15 years since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study its credit policy.
This experience took over the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "I have seen continuous development everywhere," said Her Majesty, whose connection with the project had her title "the heads of the family" gathered in Valiadolide "poor banker".
Finally, the Queen of Sofia concluded the presentation, calling on the attendees to participate in the discussion and to find decisions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethic Imperative"
Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Himénes, said that solidarity was a " ethical imperative" for each democratic State.
It therefore said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries with the times of the economic paper, since it was a " continuous commitment " .
Hemenes concluded that the microcredit implies a " serious and firm course to eradicate poverty " and now " greater than ever" Governments of developed countries should work in accordance with solidarity criteria and not allow it to be victim of reducing costs.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of cooperation for development”.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, appreciated the " success" to give "confidence" to people "which all doors are closed" and Mayor Valjadolida Javier Leon de la Riva welcomed all attending the city who "opens his doors with the spirit of solidarity".
HDC invites the President of the European Commission to be elected by a general vote
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress (HDC) was held on Monday 14 November in Leipzig without significant problems for the Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned in the programme, but there was a fall, in particular, to satisfy activists who believe that Government's policies are not so strict today as to Greece and perhaps tomorrow in relation to Italy....
The draft resolution on the chairmanship in the European Commission, issued by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained from the vote.
The ovations stood for a few minutes, which deserved Angel Merkel's speeches and several hours later Wolfgang Shayble, Europhile and the Minister of Finance, had not left room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slope: the correct response to the crisis is “no less than Europe, but more Europe”.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because " nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, it's time for a breakthrough in Europe.
This may mean changes in the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union ' s financial policy of the eurozone countries, but this may also affect the elections of the President of the European Commission by the universal vote " to give a person to Europe".
In any case, it was one of the proposals for the draft resolution adopted by the Congress, whose idea was clearly the idea of Wolfgang Shayble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven countries will quickly agree with this decision; Britain opposes it, and HDC leaders believe that Nicola Sarkozy is also against it.
But the soil is prepared.
Similarly, delegations rejected the proposal to raise the vote of each European Union member in the European Central Bank, in accordance with the economic size of each of them, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
In order to calm the situation in its party, the Chancellor has increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Cole, but it did not strive to influence the congress through the " small" European countries or countries in a difficult situation that loved to criticize " high-level" Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe focuses on the importance of " Hermano-French friendship", Angel Merkel did not mention France.
Just by the way.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Lapcig became a bloody battle scene.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating injuries of the Napoleon Army.
What is fraud with hospital leaves?
Following money benefits, UMP and the Government began the attack on hospital leaves.
On 15 November, Nikola Sarkozi will arrive in Bordo to visit the family fund and to speak on this issue, which is periodically raised since 2007, on the fight against fraud in social benefits.
And in order to help the attack that had a desire to save in a difficult situation but also a part of the campaign for re-election rights to the Presidents, most would like to focus on hospital leaves.
First of all, in view of the budget savings, the Government intends to impose the private companies on the fourth day of unpaid vacation before the payment of the benefit.
Apparently, without the special consent of the employer, the sick worker would lose the salary for four days, at least 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens the anger storm, but, according to Les Echos, will result in the savings of 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, to impose public officials one day without the payment of the disease benefits (the public officials have not yet had to wait for the payment of the benefits, unlike the three-day expectation of private sector workers).
Now that these issues are discussed, the majority has also raised the subject of fraud, in view of abuse in the provision of hospital leaves.
The control will be more tough and further, if you are caught, you will have to return all the payments you have illegally received," told Xavier Bertran on the RTL channel on Saturday 13 November.
Like in other cases, the effect of the statement has proved to be somewhat unproportionate in the actual abuse of hospital leaves.
They are indeed subject to permanent control and political attacks since 2002.
People in France are not more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's see the numbers in the country first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of the Health Economy, daily compensation costs in 2008 amounted to EUR 11.3.000 per cent of the total health costs.
Of this amount, 46 per cent were of decrete vacation and accidents in production and 54 per cent of the disease benefits, which amounted to EUR 6.2 million.
And therefore, it was 2,5 per cent of health costs.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to an Alma Consulting Group.
The average arithmetic, which hides some deviations; another study published by the Monster.com Career Manager website in 2007, showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French interrogated workers said they did not take any hospital day.
Another study, this time on medical insurance, states that in 2010 37 per cent of patients had been less than 8 days, 15 per cent from 15 days to one month, 15 per cent from one to three months and 11 per cent longer.
To compare these figures with the numbers of European neighbours, French workers are not more inclined to take hospitals than any other country.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001 the total absence of work in France (for health or not) was between 10 per cent and 11 per cent compared to 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16 to 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud related to hospital leaves is very low compared to gray employment.
With regard to the level of fraud, it is very low.
The biennium of the law after 2002 led to a systematic check of hospitals for more than 45 days.
In 2008, from 1,5 million CNAM verified cases, 13 per cent of 285,000 short-term disease conclusions were " unreasonable" or too long " , representing 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematicly checked hospital leaves, more than 45 days 11 per cent of 1.2 million cases were “inappropriate or unfounded”, equal to 132.000.
In general, 169,000 cases were " unfounded" for several million workers who received hospital leaves.
The numbers that show very few cases compared to, for example, with the series of employment.
According to the Deputy UMP Dominic Tian, the author of the report on this issue in June, they comprise from 9 to 15 million euros of non-profit budget income per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore infinitely higher than the loss of fraud.
Papademos: Greece should follow the new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
On Monday, on 14 November, the Prime Minister Lukas Papademos said that 100 days provided to his coalition Government were not sufficient to fulfil this task.
"To achieve the economy goals, we need to support our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the head of the Government, who made his first public statement, opening a discussion on confidence in the parliament in the Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the Eurozone on 27 October must be a " fundamental task" of the new Government, as the presence of the country in the eurozone is " maped", he added.
Accordingly, Papademos predicts a reduction in the budgetary deficit of the country ' s " approximately 9 per cent" from GDP by the end of the year, with 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
Rights reject the measures of the new Government
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the Leader of Rights, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support further strict savings.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at the meeting with the representatives of his party, New Democracy.
He expressed his consent with the objectives of reducing deficits and debts and combating disadvantages, but also its failure to take any course that prevents the recovery of the economy.
Ollie Renu, the European Commissioner responsible for the economy and finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary loan in 8,000 million euros without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Eutanasia and suicide need to be legalized with foreign assistance, states the Committee of Experts
Canadians are denied to death, as approved in the report of the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palyative medicine, the Committee claims that the Government, the health institutions and the doctor work together in order to ensure the best inflammatory assistance, not counting cancer.
Canadians are denied to death.
Only 9 per cent of the Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in that direction.
This is one of the impressive conclusions of the report of the Royal Society of Canada, which took part in six experts from different areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to change the criminal code in order to authorize suicide with foreign assistance and ethanasia when the choice is subjected to circumstances and the patient may be considered competent for such a decision.
For the beginning, experts refer to a recent study of the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada is in 10 places, the study notes that “medicalization of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to dispute about death”.
For medicalization or not, 77 per cent of Canadians have no access to palliative assistance, reports experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6 per cent of them end with death in the hospital.
The highest country in Quebec, where 86 per cent of the deaths occur in the hospital.
On a delicate issue of ethanasia and suicide, the authors of the report have concluded, which is contrary to the position of the federal Government, which has already stated that he would not want to change anything in the criminal code on eutanasia and suicide with foreign assistance.
Now, according to experts who have also examined the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or decriminated, there is no evidence that this decriminalization involves abuse in the application, such as the implementation of eutanasy or suicide with foreign assistance against people who cannot or want to make such a decision.
On the contrary, confirmed during the television conference, Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, most of the cases were in those countries where the euthanasy and suicide were not legalized with foreign assistance.
Eutanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is obviously illegal.
Suicide with foreign assistance is practiced in Canada, where it is obviously illegal, explained Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for Euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85 per cent of the Canadians are in favour of eutanasia, because, according to Angus Reide's 2010 survey, they believe that this would allow people to relieve their suffering at the end of their life.
66 per cent believe that the legalization of the eutanasia would not be a signal that the lives of older people or persons with disabilities had less value.
With regard to people who were suicide aiding, 41 per cent of the questionnaires believe that they should not be persecuted criminally.
With regard to prolongation or termination of medical care for sick, the situation is less meaningful, say the authors of the report.
They also suggest, in addition to their other recommendations, that the Criminal Code should establish that legal termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained in the spirit of respect for denying medical care at the end of their life without fear of criminal persecution.
With regard to palliative assistance, the Committee calls upon the Government, the healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best of the possible paliative assistance and not only in cancer.
Finally, with regard to the palliative or terminal sedation already applied in the Canadian Health Institutes, the Committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve as a density of physical pain as ethanasia and is subject to the same restrictions.
Remarks of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already commented on the conclusion of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Mayor Pierre Deshan, a healthcare law expert, described the " excess" position of experts who signed the report, because, among other things, it did not limit the use of eutanasia to death cases.
This opens the door to the situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is older than 18 can ask for help in committing suicide, said met Deshan who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Mayor Desham also emphasized that the authors of the report seem to be independence of the identity above all other values that constitute the social tissue of society.
He said, "There are warning signs and bans in society."
The healthcare lawist Margaret Somerville also expresses "categorical disagreement with the conclusions of the report, which she called the " euthanasia manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, contests, inter alia, the report on abuses in some countries where the euthanasy and suicide with foreign assistance are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregone.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign power
Damascus condemns the conspiracy.
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar Assad's participants made a demonstration yesterday before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria Bashar Assad has increased yesterday, which, with the support of Russia, opposes him and condemns the “contract” against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership in the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened sanctions against Damascus, and the neighbours of Syria and Jordan have resigned President Assad.
The King of Jordan, Abdal II, became the first Arab leader yesterday, who called on President Bashar Assad to resign power in Syria, where nearly 40 civilians and armed forces were killed.
"If the interests of Bashar were expensive for his country, he should retire, but he should also establish the necessary conditions for the new phase of political life, said the King of Jordan, the neighbouring with Syria, to the BBC interview.
In turn, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu expressed regret that the mediation efforts of Turkey, which began early this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East, who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their desires, will lose power, he said, implying Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking a rougher course.
For their part, the United States welcomes the " extension of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime " following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasing course of repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, representative of the State Department.
During that time, 16 civilians and at least 19 representatives of the regime have died in the area of Deroua in Southern Syria, reports the Syrian Human Rights Observer (OSDH).
Two other inhabitants were killed during the shooting and the shooting of heavy bullets in Jobara in the detained city of Homs, according to the UNG.
During the press conference, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria Valid Muallem stated that the country was approaching the end of the crisis."
Furthermore, he responded strictly to the decision of the League of Arab States to exclude Damascus, which he said to be a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, he added, ascertaining that this conspiracy against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to exclude the Syria League of Arab States, it is currently exploring the “mechanism of protection of civilians and requires food in the country of 500 members of the Arab Human Rights Organization, journalists and military observers.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, Allen Juppe, also expressed his view of sending observers from the UN to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that he said had fallen into “paranoid”.
The new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the exit plan adopted on 2 November and, inter alia, the withdrawal of armed forces from cities where the battles go, and the release of arrested demonstrators.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, called yesterday on the "incorrect" decision of the League of Arab States, while China called on Syria to fulfil the crisis plan, but abstained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty requires time from Italian markets and victims
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monty, asked markets for a little time to form their team and implement a programme that would require sacrifices to restore the credit capacities lost in the last few months of the Government of Berluscony.
The former European Commissioner participated yesterday in discussions with political parties before today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate office consisting of technocrats not entering the parliament.
Monty spoke of the importance of the programme that suggested many victims, said Francesco Nukara, a representative of one of the numerous small parliamentary groups who participated in the discussions after the meeting with the candidate for the Prime Minister.
Spiker of the Chamber of Deputies Janfranco Finny said that he would wait to see if Mario Monti would be asked to vote on confidence before Friday to ensure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The meeting will end with the presentation of Mr. Monty of the limited list of ten or some of the ministers of the country, Georgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on the nervousness of the fund markets and bond holders yesterday, asked them for time.
“Democracy takes time to prepare the Government and the programme,” he stressed, adding that it was convinced that markets would be patient and understanding.”
His appointment by the President was initially approved by the markets, but anxiety was reaffirmed, in particular after the unexpected fall of industrial production in Eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister had to form a team, including the most important, technocrats, although he emphasized that he would also like to include “politicians”.
The new Government will have to act until 2013, the following elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, the new Government will receive Parliament's confidence on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that he would work hard to ensure that Italy would become an important acting person in Europe again.
The representative of the European Commissioner Ollie Rehn emphasized that " despite the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed."
The European Union believed that Rome would not fulfil the budget for 2013, despite the strict economy plan adopted in recent months, required, in particular, new strict measures.
The Italian boss Emma Marchegalia, who was meeting with him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because the country that has no growth cannot comply with the deficit parameters”.
Mr. Monty, famous of his competence and independence in the existence of the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents the " changing age" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy", according to the preview authors.
The great unknown is the long-term of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid early elections, as by April 2012 Italy had to pay the public debt obligations of EUR 200,000.
Russian scientist assisted the Iranian nuclear programme
The Russian Scientist Viceslav Danielko assisted Iran to develop a nuclear-weapon detonator, confirmed an American agency specialized in the field of nuclear danger on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the United Nations Agency to identify the identity of this scientist.
Last week, IAEA expressed concern about the possible military perspective of the Iranian nuclear programme
According to ISIS based significantly on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, working 30 years, " starting from the sixtieth years, in the Soviet Nuclear Centre in Chelabin (Ural) and was associated with the production of synthetic diamonds of explosion methods".
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to create a nanoalmasis company in Kiev.
His financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 before returning to Russia
In his report, IAEA recalls “remarkable signs of Iran ' s development of a nuclear detonator system that has “incorporated the work of a foreign expert who did not only well know this technique but also informed the agency that he had worked most of his career on this technology under the military nuclear programme of his country”.
The number of antimuscular crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to the FBI statistics published in Monday from 2009 to 2010, the number of antimuslim crimes increased almost by 50 per cent, while other forms of racial and religious violence in the same period were slightly reduced or not changed.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is equal to 49 per cent, compared to an increase in 13 per cent of Catholic violence, the reduction of 4 per cent of the attacks on Jews and the overall increase in 14 per cent of religious crimes.
The total number of crimes due to hatred, according to the FBI, increased very smallly to 6 628 cases, of which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent of religious differences.
After the decline in 2009, the number of these crimes has increased again, stressed the Human Rights First Organization, “a significant increase in violence against Muslims”, added the organization in the official communication.
"Human Rights First emphasized long ago that acts of violence against Muslims, as all forms of hatred crimes, should be considered as serious violations of human rights," added one of the leaders of the organization Paul Lejander.
"The American Government may and should do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, considering that this could be done by improving police reports on hatred crimes."
"The offences on the ground of hatred" in the federal law are an inheritance of the period of struggle for civil rights.
This law was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish for acts of violence related to race, colour of skin, religion, nationality and sexual orientation today.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes like Facebook
On Monday, the Twitter web site has changed its platform, which allows users to see the activities of those who are watching, which makes this service similar to Facebook.
The new "action" tab and other "name" allow you to monitor the activities of other Twitters, the users whose messages ("tweets") you track and those who track yours.
This gives the opportunity to identify if they publish messages, if they sign new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before broadcasting the network on Monday, said the AFP Press Secret Twitter Caroline Penner.
Twitter, who has been known for a long time as intuitively unreasonable, and as using a rather uncertain term (RT to overcome someone else's composition, #followfriday for the recommendation to follow other users), mostly enjoys experienced users, opens himself in a wider way, representing something closer to the popular social networks of Facebook and Google+.
On the Internet, users discussed this innovation through Twites on the Internet.
"It's useless, nauseous and too much like Facebook."
The functional activity will help me better monitor certain elements of my flow in Twitter, wrote @dannycronstrom.
Austria
Entry into the Constitution of the Golden Rule of the Budget
The leadership of a large coalition of social democrats and Christian democrats in Austria decided on Tuesday to write the budgetary " gold rule" into the Constitution to reduce the budgetary deficit and thus avoid possible reduction by Austria ' s public credit rating agencies (three A).
The Chancellor of the Social Democrat Werner Faymann personally announced this decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, while the Austrian State debt was 74.6 per cent higher than the upper threshold of the standard in 60 per cent established by the Maastricht Treaty, but below the State debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's payment was only one point, from AAA to AA+, we should pay per cent of three thousand million euros more every year, the argument of Vice-Cancer and the Minister of Foreign Affairs from Christian Democrats Michael Spindelegger.
Thus, Austria fulfils the summit of the eurozone member countries in Brussels on 26 October; heads of States and Government required reduced budget deficits by the end of 2012 and return to balanced public accounts through the constitution or equal law.
The regulation adopted by the Austrian Government reminds the “German model” because Germany was the first European country that adopted this rule.
By 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget should be reduced by 0.75 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP), and from 2017, the structural deficit of the State's federal budget should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP each year, and the lands, as well as communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The goal is to make the State debt fall below the 60 per cent marked by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Esychico Noda
Threats the new intervention in the currency market
Japanese Prime Minister Esichico Noda warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would carry out new interventions on the currency market if the price of yena continued to grow.
We will interfere with the last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the yena exchange course, Mr. Noda Senatu explained.
On Tuesday, Yena grew up almost before the historical mark, which encouraged the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold a yen for dollars largely to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which has established a new force record since 1945.
However, since then, Yena has grown constantly, provoked by the purchases of investors who perceive it as “a refuge” in these sad times of the world's falling economy and the debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro fell below the symbolic plane in 105 yen, near the level that led to the last intervention.
The financial crisis in 2008-2009 cost about 120 yen and over EUR 160.
The increase in Japanese currency damages Japanese exports because it makes Japan's products more expensive and reduces the income of Japanese companies due to abroad when converting to national currency.
"Japan fights to restore itself" after the earthquake and tsunami on 11 March, which deserted the region of Tohoku (Sjeveroestern) emphasized Mr. Noda, who fears that this growth of yena will kill a tough fertility of recovery.
The third economic power in the world has resumed growth in the third quarter - 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time per year, through export and consumption of households affected by the disaster
However, the Prime Minister feels that the high price of yen does not reflect Japan ' s " Fundamental economic indicators " .
The Minister of Finance, Djun Azumi, called on the Japan Bank (BoJ), who opened a two-day meeting of his Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all the necessary steps to weaken the yena.
However, the Deputy Manager of the Hirohide Yamaguti Institute warned that the Japanese Bank had already taken " appropriate steps " and that there was no further mitigation to be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting, at the end of October, the broadcast organization increased by 5,000 million yen (47,000 million euros) to buy treasury bonds, raised up to 55.000,000 million yen (519,000 million euros) of the ceilings it allocated to buy various financial instruments to satisfy the market of securities.
Eurozone
The rates are growing, the fund markets are collaborating
The risk of infection by the debt crisis undermines European indexs.
Despite the appointment of new heads of States in Greece and Italy and the improved growth rates in France and Germany, the rates in unstable countries continue to grow
Still concerned with the stability of the eurozones, European markets went a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and finished trade at 3.064.
DAX in Frankfurt has fallen to 0.4%, and London is 0.1%.
With regard to new difficulties in paying loans to the eurozone countries in a difficult situation, the fund markets around the world continue to lose part of their recent achievements.
"Anxious investors are just too concerned about the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker of IG Markets quoted by Reuter.
The Tokyo market was closed by 0.7 per cent under the burden of new market doubts on the ability of Europe to end the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has contradicted its view of Europe, and the markets will follow each other in the narrow change corridor until the investors have confirmed that the situation has been stabilized," said Micusige Akino, manager of the Fund in Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This return of concern about the future eurozone beats a single currency that continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lower marking in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency cost $1.3570, dropping by 0.4%.
According to the brokers, she fell after the meeting of the Chancellor of Angela Merkel HDS, which adopted a resolution on Monday, providing, inter alia, an opportunity for the complex country to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are significantly higher than 6 per cent
The credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level of great concern.
Today, on Tuesday, the income of Italian 10-year-old bonds reached 6.85 per cent and the profit of Spanish bonds at the same time was 6.2 per cent.
Those difficulties with interest rates in southern countries, but also in France, continue to undermine the concerns of participants.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monty, asked for time markets to restore the situation in Italy under threat of paralysis under the weight of his debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papademos, reaffirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the eurozone, on 27 October, would be the " fundamental task" of his Government.
Spain was under market shooting in front of parliamentary elections on Sunday.
In front of the interest rates on the 10-year debt obligations of Germany and Spain reached a new historic maximum.
Awaiting growth figures in the eurozone
France has established an economic growth by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, a little better than expected 0.3 per cent, thanks to the increased consumption of households.
Insee, however, revised to the second quarter's reduction, falling by 0.1 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnating.
The economists are most concerned about the fourth block.
Germany, in turn, detected a 0.5 per cent increase in the same period.
The first evaluation for the whole eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., the European Commission warns about the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should be overcome by dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be decided after an incontinued discussion or on emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and value of electricity directly affects the purchase capacity and competitiveness of companies.
This is a healthy trend that the election meetings are a cause to reflect on the deck and the place of nuclear energy.
The dispute will not bring fruit until all economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are examined.
France should build its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
We are now 7,000 million people on the planet, demographic development will double the electricity needs by 2050, unless the vast part of the world's population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fulfil the growing deficit of the digested resources to continue the production of electricity constantly, while forgetting the essential need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate disbalance, the subject that disappeared from environmental debates.
The Facusim accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to deny nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which decides on the need to find a source capable of replacement of nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, there are only few of those who resolutely continue their projects.
The United States decided after Fucushima to add one installation to its own set, renewing the construction of the station, which was suspended after the accident in Tri-Mile Island.
Although Germany's renewable energy model is sometimes illustrated, the reality is contrary to this argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the value of electricity, the increased energy dependence, the increased demand for imported gas, in particular from Russia, from the emissions of carbon gas in connection with the construction of gas and coal stations.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be felt.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The turbine-building champion of Europe, from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, is also the largest carbon and gas user because of the interruption wind; which is why carbon gas emissions and electricity prices are 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher than the average of Europe.
On the other hand, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40 per cent more for electricity than the French households.
Since the globalized energy price is a key factor in competitiveness and supply of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will lead to a large increase in the value of electricity, which will illustrate the illusions of the new industrialization of our country and the protection of buying capacity.
The price most French refused to pay, even more because they did not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the energy policy of the country has made it possible to create a industry in 125,000 direct workplaces and 410,000 focused.
It attracts the entire pleasant specialized for international trade in small and medium enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved into another sector.
If France had decided to renounce nuclear energy, it would have sacrificed a large amount of these enterprises and would lose 6,000 million euros a year from the French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrical engineer will order the EPR designed to work for sixty years if its manufacturer is scheduled to be closed?
In order to determine the equation of energy, it should be recognized that there are no divine or devil sources of energy production.
Developing the Areva solutions with low carbon emissions, nuclear and renewables indicates the complementarity of energy sources.
Nuclear energy supporting the highest level of security is undoubtedly a vital issue
In France, we have a security body that operates incompromising and transparent control of existing energy centres, such as Flamanville.
Our teams whose professionalism is generally recognized are full of the same security obsession.
For 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mile Island, occurred under normal conditions of exploitation, but without any consequences for the human or environment
In Chernobyl, the reaktor device and unforgiving human error led to tragedy.
In Fucushim, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented force that caused deaths of tens of thousands.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from this accident, as learned from the two previous.
The fruitage of this step and cooperation between security bodies, operators and French and German constructors, the EPR, represents a project that allows such phenomena to be opposed.
Since it is considered by all energy experts wishing to build a reactor, the stop of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift to the Competitors of Areva and EDF, clearing their way to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is necessary and legally to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and maneuvers to be overcome in a dispute that is so important for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration - burden or good for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicola Sarkozy was criticised from various parties -- the overload of police, judicial and administrative services under the policy of figures and compatibility with the self-approved status of France as the “State of Human Rights”.
Then there was an administrative distress of foreign students, which came to the news when the Minister of Interior (Liberasion of 23 May) stated that France " did not need foreign talents, stones and waiters".
But it is rarely analysed in economic terms.
The right and left are in this matter very well.
The right tone was asked by Jacques Schirak, who said in 1976 that “900,000 unemployed people would not be a problem in the country with 2 million foreign workers”, and by the left, Michel Rockar, who explained in 1990 that France “can't accept poor people from all over the world”.
Difference only in generosity
In 2005, the fear of invasion in the country of the hord of the Polish waterkeeper felt both the left and the right.
Both parties see the burden in immigration for the French economy and the French society.
The difference is only in the level of generosity that they will allow to show to immigrants.
In his programme, François Olland was limited to banalities, saying that “the joint work will allow us to solve our immigration problem”.
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may give a selective advantage, but it is very costly economically.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us of the recent book summarizing recent immigration data (Special people: As migration has formed our world and will define our future, May 2011, the publication of the University of Princeton, 352st), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, earning salary and employment in immigrant countries.
The immigration limitation leads to a decline in growth and reduces employment.
The fears of immigrant influence are based on the idea that they are able to replace local workers, especially low-qualified, by provocing a reduction in salary.
Experience, however, shows that immigrants are much more complementary in reality than replaceing local workforce by carrying out work that lacks local workforce.
Unqualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local workforce, but the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training is not related to the proposals of work.
Positive impact on wages
Just as the surgeon would be difficult to work in a country where there is lack of anesthesiologists, the complement that exists between local and immigrants has a positive impact on local workers' salary.
Giovanni Perry estimated that the increase by 1% of the migration flow increases by 0.6 to 0.9 per cent of real long-term wages.
This, without the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (mean American laureats of the Nobel Prize, the great share of naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make pure profits to the social security system, giving an average of 1% of the general budgets of the European countries.
Under the assessment of the World Labour Organization, for example, in Germany, an immigrant aged 30, will bring a net profit to the public budget (minimal costs) in the average of 150,000 euros.
Nikola Sarkozy was going to be incorporated by teeth at the beginning of his mandate.
Those teeth that were used to frighten immigrants have a contrary effect.
Europe has invented democracy, a European democracy remains to be developed
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; but at the same time it is crude.
The European Continent should remember that, inventing it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the 20th century, he survived tragedy I of World War, totalitarian regimes, holocaust, Gulago, and Franko in Spain, Salazara in Portugal and Colonels in Greece.
Some believed that the democracy would eventually reinforce its enemies, enough to make a vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since the time of Napoleon, the Little One knows that this comes from the surface of the mind.
The universal vote, although is a mandatory condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can even become a “depression instrument”, as the philosopher of the Republic of Etienne Wadro once said.
No, democracy also requires many other public spaces, public spirits, values, organization, division and control of powers, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis that we have experienced is a economic crisis, but primarily the political crisis and the crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the genuinely false Greek referendum will have a double disclosure effect, showing both the need for a serious change in policies and the unpleasant sense of its inability and inconsistentness.
This duality must be designed to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line for democracy has now moved and many believe that the Republican soldiers are targeting the wrong way now.
We will not win anything by demanding a series of national referendums organized as appropriate and in a haotic manner.
Cart Blanche for the absolute European monarch or jumping with the bound legs into the disappearance of nationalism - what a choice for the citizens!
No, we dream not about the scarfing of hylotin, but about the implementation of -- joint, clear and continuous -- elections and democracy, this time at the general European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and no idea how many other crises are to be listed, because there is only one crisis in Europe.
All Europe is subject to market dictation and rating agencies, suffers from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole Europe is totally degraded at the international scene.
Many are concerned about the transfer of the sovereignty to Europe, but all Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, with each of its nations.
The management of the European project under the national sovereignty is urgently needed.
Because only the Europeans will be able to reduce each debt, free from markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
The crisis would require solutions at the general European level, and they cannot be adopted without full democratic legitimacy without causing us a disaster.
Following a long discussion of this proposal, socialists and Jacques Delor are now demanding a European economic government.
Let's do it.
But to imagine it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has come to life is another madness and a new fool.
We must begin a new stage of European construction.
In order to establish a Republic in France, the Republicans had to be created.
The revolution of interest would be insufficient.
This lesson remains strong.
We must build Europe, united at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, the present national European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let's create Europeans.
The uncontacted chip cards are spreading wider.
The World Chart Exhibition is opened on Tuesday in Wilpent in Paris in the atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, in 2011, 11 per cent of the world's microprocessor sales (bank cards, SIM-card phones) will be over 6,000 million units, according to Eurosmart.
The most important incontact technology sector that allows public transport or purchase to be paid by just a map over the reader.
This year, 460 million uncontacted chip cards will be sold in the world against 320 million years earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (awaiting 580 million units) and will be nearly 10 per cent of the world market of chip cards (6.925 million cards).
Europe, a long-term departure from the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the area of uncontact payments.
Approximately 26 million Visa banking cards are already supplied by the function and are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France starts with more modest positions: 400 000 cards of Visa are treated.
But the big shops are making it up.
This year, Carrefour released 2,5 million incontact Pass MasterCard.
To move to a higher speed, banks need to supply their customers' equipment.
"Two large organizations in France promised in the future to systematically distribute banking cards to their clients, " said Gerar Nebui, Director-General Visa Europe France.
The banks are testing payments by mobile phone.
But it's only the first stage of development of the future payment fund, that's the mobile phone.
As long as few devices are equipped with NFC technology (communications of the Near Field) necessary to carry out such transactions.
"They were delayed.
"But they must really fly away next year."
"We are counting on world sales from 80 to 120 million units in 2012," explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are going forward.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday an experiment from December to June next year in Cana.
The iPhone approximately 200 clients and staff will be supplied by squirrels providing uncontact payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marcel.
Société Génerale also said yesterday that he was preparing the launch of a proposal to allow his clients to pay through mobile phones.
The terrorist front is spread from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links of Islamic Magrib with the sect of Boco Haram.
A long-terrorism connection between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in Muslim Magribe (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Sect of Boco Haram was confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that the Algerians were now confident.
"The use of these two organizations and the reports of the secret services show that they are actively cooperating," he explained, without being detailed.
Paris seems to have made similar conclusions.
The investigation of the kidnapping of two French in Niger in January detected two boundaries.
The abducted in a restaurant in Niamea of people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leokur and Vensan Delori were likely killed next day with several of the kidnappers during the operation carried out by the French special units.
Among the fractures remaining after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several phone cards belonging to terrorists.
Here's a terror.
The analysis of the calls indicated several interviewers in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one indicates a Nigerian who lived long in Midiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, a Boco Haram collaboration, and the other is said to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
"It is a step forward, but we must wait for more reliable evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boco Haram."
"But it's possible."
"For many years, it is known that the sect receives financial and ideal support outside and that it becomes more and more active," said the Nigerian researcher, Kunle Amuvo.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in the actions and statements of Boco Haram and its methods, which now include the use of mortals and more complex explosive devices of the same type as the Aqmi.
The international community, headed by Washington, is now pressured on Abudhu to focus on the problems Boco Haram.
The fact is, the Nigerian authorities traditionally viewed the group as an educated community of non-interested people.
Fast Success
Based in 2002 in Midiguri at the machete, school and with the Fundamentalist Mohammede Yusufe, Boco Haram, which means "West Education is sin" -- preaches the establishment of the Islamic Emirate in Muslim North of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved a rapid success.
It was politicized and demanded strict compliance with the sharia, and its activists began to combat the wicked central government.
It is aimed mainly on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, the activists of Boco Haram showed special activity by executing numerous attacks on police offices.
Abuji's response, as usual, is compromised.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead after it.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
The sect is now radicalized and out of its northern vegetables.
On the last Christmas, she took responsibility for an action resulting from 80 people killed in José, and then another in Abuja.
In June, in Abuge, Boco Haram organized the first death attack on the strengthened police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international goal.
The establishment of a terrorist axis in Africa, which comes from Mauritania through Nigeria in Somalia, is now concerned with all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi has been strengthened in Mali and Niger and the Al-Shabaab Somalians are in Kenya, Boco Haram is a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with Presidents Goodlack Jonathan Zjuppe warned about the danger of Boco Haram and expressed his willingness to share all available information.
World, as the Republican candidates see for Presidents
With regard to China, Iran and Israel's assistance, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry are competing in simplifications and incompetentity.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, lead to complex peace through simple and more simplifying ideas?
If you listen to candidates from the Republicans, the voters could believe that.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying loud but deprived of the foreign policy statements which are traditionally a strong side of the Republicans.
The logs relating to China, Iran and Israel's assistance are often mixed with each other.
The Mitt Romney, who has the best chances to move from the Old Good Party, threatened the Chinese to complain to WTO and accused them of "manipulation of its currency" is a sensitive topic for America, irritated by the whole migration of their industry in Asia.
It's worse if it leads to a trade war," he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate in a complex foreign policy, could not overcome the position that affects emotions.
He called for a firm, but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who is held at the bottom of the ratings, remained unheard.
Reagan's style
Romni also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions were not able to stop his nuclear programme.
"If they pick me, I'll stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of non-compliance with the promises of the partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Kane, the second in the candidate rating, demonstrated the disrupting ignorance of cases.
He recently called for the opposition to the Chinese military threat because Beijing has tried to achieve nuclear power - apparently not to know that China has already had it since 1964!
The Governor of Texas Rik Perry, who supports Israel and strives for military strikes on Iran, said he was willing to use an American army in Mexico against drug carters.
Torture of suspects in terrorism prohibited by Obama in 2009 also recommends Kane, Perry and Michel Bahman candidate.
All of this is very far from the candidate of the Republic of 2008, John McKain, a heavy foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president answer that Reagan had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to reduce the tone of combating terror.
They insist fairly on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, at the early conclusion of the " boys" from Iraq, his tricks in Libya, which brought him a weak policy.
But the attack is not that easy.
The population considers a positive national security balance in Obama, which eliminated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it doesn't believe in military interventions that link the sand.
And, claiming that America must be rebuilt economically in order to restore its leadership, Obama's rights.
North Stream, new gates for the entry of Russian gas to Europe.
The northern stream linking Western Europe and Russia directly at the bottom of the Baltic Sea is launched.
It is based on gas supplies of 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate this event with pump.
More than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated in the last Tuesday on the shores of Baltic, between the orchestra and the excellent snacks, in the opening of the Northern Stream, the new gas pipeline, which directly links Russia and Germany under water.
The Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fion and his Netherlands colleague Mart Rutte, together reverted a symbolic ventilator controlling the accession of Russian gas to the Western European network.
On the new gas line, 27.5 million additional cubic meters of gas will come to Western Europe each year on the first pipeline length of 1,224 km, connecting the Leningrad area with the land of McClenburg-Meering.
The second pipeline should be prepared at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas equivalent to all of the consumption of France.
The possibility to build the third pipeline in the same direction is already discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this enormous project is victory.
The project met the severe resistance of Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany by avoiding passing through the third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose part of their power: they will be more difficult to influence Russia, threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the most tense point of debate, Warsaw did not stop before comparing the Northern Stream with the New German Soviet Covenant, implying the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting the Russian project, Western Europe has achieved greater security of its supply.
But by the price of the deprivation of Europe of energy, because the project created a bresh between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has achieved its understanding of the direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries that have consumed large amounts of gas and their own stocks.
"This gas pipeline is part of the cooperation with Russia, a new arterial that organicly links us," said François Pion, opening the gas pipeline, demonstrating how important and political gas contracts are and economically important.
All of this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, who were present in a large number in Ljubmine, the gas arrival point.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical movement.
The underwater pipeline is made of a steel locked in concrete to protect it from coconut ships.
He's lying on the bottom of the sea, at the middle of 200 meters.
To build it, the mine fields remained since the second world war.
"The hundred had to be removed or destroyed as precaution," said Jens Muller, the press secretary of the North Stream.
There were also many steps to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake weighing 242 Eiffel Towers, without breaking across its length, without vents and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the Sweden area, but the managers of the project rejected it because Sweden was not admired by the fact that the Russian public company would be settled at its shores forever.
"In the event of an accident, we will close the flow of gas in less than a minute," said Jens Mueller.
So, if the gas in the gas pipeline is exhausted.
But this seems to be very unlikely for the constructors who designed shives only once for 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the gas pipeline will be carried out by a subwater robot that pulls the ship for external observation, as well as the gas-controlling device.
The cigar-like device is inserted within the pipeline with a diameter of 1 m and stretched forward through the flow of gas.
On arrival after 3 full days of travel, at a speed of 3 meters per second, it gives precise information about any metal deformation.
The gas pipeline was designed for work for 50 years without the need for smaller repair.
The circulation of the gas is carried out only through its pressure.
It consists of 200 bars and 100 arrival bars.
Five companies have cooperated efforts to implement the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which owns 51 per cent of capital.
Others are the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent each), the Netherlands Gasunie and the French GDF Suez Group (9 per cent each).
These five companies created a joint enterprise called the North Stream, which was assigned to build and operate the gas pipeline.
His headquarters are in Zuga, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom subsequently rented the company for twenty years, with the opportunity to extend all the transportation of gas.
" Gazprom will pay for the full amount, no matter how much gas will be transported," said Jens Mueller.
The funding of gas-train construction was provided by 30 per cent shareholders and 70 per cent by banking loans.
The total cost of work will be 7.4 million euros for two pipelines.
The GDF Suez investment will be about 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are confident that they will buy their costs because Gazprom takes all risks.
The gas pipeline comes from the Baltic Sea in Ljubmina to the sand coast planted by grass trees.
The ventiles are 4.5 metres high, forming an outdoor gas terminal.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific gas characteristics before transferring it into German gases.
Since Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
This will be 3 million per hour, and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine brand note
Moleskine, created by the Italian company 15 years ago, will taste the letter.
He has the smell of adventure, the watches spent in writing at the light of the candle.
Moleskine's tape is easy to find out on a straight-hand black cover, on the tissue, on the yellow-white pages, as if they were swallowed with time.
However, the book of Moleskine, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian Modo Modo company in Milan decided to sell design notes.
Maria Sebregondy, then consultant of the company, was responsible for launching a new product.
The tape is inspired by an old production technique, a moleskin, a located bounce tissue used, for example, to cover the scameics.
It is argued that this type of books is highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has brought an old and forgotten taste today that was a cult for the Evangard artists before the 20th century," said Mary Sebregondy, who has since become the leading brand in Modo Modo.
Good luck.
Since 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25 per cent and reached 12.7 million.
We were far away from production of the first years when only 3,000 booknotes were made.
Moleskine crossed the borders of Italy and exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a typical buyer's profile, because the bookbook is equally attracted by businessmen, students and a person of free profession.
The buyers of Moleskine are cosmopolitic, have wide views and are educated.
A small Italian company, who had only 12 staff at first, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It spreads its bookmarks in the bookshops of Fnac, small cities shops, and has been able to acquire a wide range of knowledge.
"We followed the spirit of time and this new letter requirement, despite the e-mail appearance," explained Mary Sebregondy.
This characteristic cultural feature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; the brand recently organized the exhibition of the “Okolic Way”, where the architects and artists demonstrated their own notes.
In August, he also launched covers with a leopard painting on the event of a film festival in Lokarno.
Using his success and cultural aurum, Moleskine has diversified its products, which now include bags, handcuffs, computer bags.
Success that was born of jealousy: In the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the SG Capital Europe investment fund, now Syntegra Capital, which entered the new page in Moleskine history.
Why is unemployment among disabled workers so high?
About 19 per cent of persons with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of the employment of persons with disabilities begins today.
Despite the public charitable policy started in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities remains twice above the average, namely 19 per cent against 9 per cent for the general population.
Absolutely?
“No,” stressed Eric Blanche, Director-General Adapt, organization that organizes a week of employment of persons with disabilities.”
"In 15 years, significant progress has been made."
"In that time the unemployment share was not 2 but 3 times more."
"It's just like a lot of work ahead."
There is a lot to say for a disabled person who's in employment barriers.
Among them are more older: 37 per cent over 50 years (17 per cent average).
They have a lower level of qualification: 80 per cent have no degree of bacalaur, but only 10,000 persons with 2.3 million students in higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very common, which is 85 per cent for persons with disabilities against 38 per cent in the average.
Shortly, all these criteria that make it very complicated to return to work and which constitutes the point of problem," said Christian Grapen, Director-General Tremplin, the Association established in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about mentality that changes, but too slow.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre Procurement Association of Cite showed that the managers in question had a low level of knowledge of disability and “imagine full people in wheels or mentally or mentally incomplete”.
The result is that more than 20 employees have 6 per cent of persons with disabilities in the law adopted in 1987.
The latest known figures relating to 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
"We are approximately 3 per cent today," said Pierre Blan, Director-General of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of NGOs, as well as paid amounts, has decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations in 2007 to 2011 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act that raised the tax has created a strong pressure on companies," explains Pierre Blane.
"But this improvement also reflects the growth of consciousness, in particular in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of the workers from 20 to 49 have persons with disabilities against 82 per cent of organizations with a number of employees from 100 to 199.
Azar: "What happiness."
Before fighting with the Blue evening on Tuesday (20.45 p.m.), Eden Azar and George Leekens did not hide the pleasures they received from this friendly match.
We're not going to claim that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
By sitting next to Stade de France's Tribune, George Leekens and Eden Azar reconciled.
Five months later, the Belgian coach can only praise him after his assault matching Turkey.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his promotion and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to go on," assures Lill's player.
With regard to the contrast between his achievements in the club and the collection, it is one whole, he justified.
"I'm in Lille for a year and I'm not in Belgium."
"I have to earn the glasses."
Reserved, in front of this game with France, in the game against Romania on Friday night, Azar arrived in St.
Not forgetting, however, the concept of satisfaction.
He supported the Blue since he was 7 years old and victory campaigns 1998 and 2000.
"I always supported them," he confirmed.
This, of course, also strengthens the special nature of this match.
Especially that the other side is Matthew, Johann, and Adil, he recalls.
"We just crossed our ways."
"There's a chance to play against them, it's pure happiness!"
Leekens kindly remembered pride.
"Hare" to play at the holiday match.
" Honour" also claims as "neighbour" that France has become a very high-level team" only a year after the injury in Nine.
"Loran Blan was like a thunder, he admires.
Now that Belgium misss the next Euro, the Technical Sportsman will fly in one plane with blue leadership... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he emphasized.
"We're building something, the ambitious players, they're hungry."
"You'll make sure of this in future matches, including this against France."
Portugal is very confident
Portuguese Paul Bent starts its responsive match against Bosnia (22:00) on Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On his way, both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paul Bent has already seen himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the Congregation, which has been running since September 2010, has been qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and Bosnia to be conquered.
Given 0-0 on Friday in Hell, it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal was dominated in the game more than an hour, it was not able to achieve the covenant goal that would calm her down.
"This is a good result that, however, has a certain risk."
But the Portuguese are convinced, at their brightly lighted stadium de la Lus in Lisbon, that they will pass, in the eyes of the audience, which should be excited, although the match would be very tense," said the optimist but reasonable Bent.
"We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced that we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50 per cent of the chances to reach Euro 2012," said the successor of Carlus Cayros.
No one in the fight against Bosnia on Friday requires the Portuguese to win.
No one could set up the Bosnians.
"This is a good result in which, however, some risks are regretted by Bent.
"We will play against a team with many technical dignity and players with many individual dignity," he added.
As in Zenice, the Portuguese will have the maximum pressure on the Bosnians since the beginning, "do not give them time to think."
It's a good idea, only if it was realistic this time.
