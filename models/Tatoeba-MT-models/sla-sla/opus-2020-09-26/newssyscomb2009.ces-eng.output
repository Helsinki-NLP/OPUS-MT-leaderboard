The Triumph of Right Populists in Austria, totally, 29%
Substantial weaknesses of both parties of the present large coalitions and significant strengthening of the right populist parties have brought the first preliminary Sunday parliamentary elections in Austria.
In particular, the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered strong losses, where the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Corutan Hajtman Jörg Haider is preparing a triumfal return to state policy.
According to preliminary results, the strongest party in the country of social democracy (SPÖ) with 29.8 per cent of votes, however, loses 5.5 per cent of votes against the last elections of 2006.
Even worse, ÖVP was lost with 25.6 per cent of nearly nine percent of the votes.
These are the worst results of both of these major parties in the Austrian war history and especially in people who have induced early elections, literally a catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP came out of the coalition, people had a significant impact in preferences before the SPÖ.
However, the voters evidently punished them for letting the government lose.
In the first responses to the results, speculations for the possible resignation of the President of the Party and the Vice-Cancer Wilhelm Molterer.
The observers believe that this could happen on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the President of the Party.
Such development would apparently facilitate the path to the increasingly likely outcome of the election result, that is, to renew a large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both legally populistic parties - free (FPÖ) previously received 18 per cent and BZÖ 11 per cent of votes - however, social democrats also expressed concerns about the reproduction of 1999, when people agreed with populists (the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 BZÖ declined) to the common government, which even caused sanctions by the European Union.
Haider, who has already declared that he is willing to cooperate with any party and assumes return to Vienna to the global policy.
The Green Party has also reached Parliament, which has easily lost and fell between Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth place.
None of the other parties appeared to have overcome the four per cent border and has not reached the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India can be cold
If it would not be possible to solve the problem with Czech scientists who were accused of the illegal collection of bugs in India, the Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg said that a certain cooling of Czech and Indian relations would occur.
The Minister said it in New York after today's meeting with his Indian Pranab Mukherdz.
"If it had not been resolved, then yes, there would have been a certain cooling," he stated after the meeting that came from the Czech initiative.
After the negotiation, Mukherji said that it could be hard to interfere with the judicial matters.
However, he pointed out that in the case of Peter Swash, who was released and punished, the central government may deal with the local government in Dargiling, whose jurisdiction is the case.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kucher, sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherji's best to call for a higher instance.
He could then ask for bail release and wait for a sentence to freedom, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also expressed himself in negotiations.
"He recommends appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to be pardoned," said the chief of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech party can enter the whole matter is to provide convicted "competent legal support", the Indian Minister stated.
At the same time, he said that such assistance is already provided by the Indian Party.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining best relations with India that have long-term tradition.
The Indians also acknowledge this," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as the CTC said, he emphasized before his partner that the Czech Republic is attaching great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider it a really deep mistake in prison and accusation of these Czech scientists," he said.
Answer to the question whether he received a promise from the Indian party to deal with things, the minister avoided.
"I have already received relatively enough promises," he only stated.
Czech judges the struggle for the seabed
It comes to a wall electronic map, on which Australia is illustrated and suitable sea areas.
However, it is not interested in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it, and the suitable seabed.
The area is large as a continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the 30-member team of UN Division workers for oceans and marine law.
His boss, director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, is watching and sometimes complementing the interpretation.
There's a work elean and an excitement here.
The seabed hides a little famous world, rich in natural resources so far.
It can be found here oil, reds and other raw materials, but also unknown alive organisms that have the key to develop cancer.
Days greater than land
The coastal states today began to go on a new subsea territory.
According to the UN Convention, they use their rights, which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly a area of so - called continental shelf, which often touches up to a few hundred miles from the coast of the country.
In accordance with the Convention, it has exclusive right to all continental shelf sources.
"Simplely, for the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its floor, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It reaches beyond the border of the coastal sea, often even beyond the limit of two hundred sea miles, called exclusive economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the determination of the external borders of the continental shelf must be submitted by a comprehensive scientific documentation based on many expensive examinations and measurements.
It is the result of a number of years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and professional technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far discussed five applications, including Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three last mentioned countries have succeeded yet," Mikulka adds.
The world’s voice has recently recorded the success of Australia, which first significantly expanded its submarine countries.
But he also obtained New Zealand — the size of the seabed, which the Commission last week confessed to him, is about 1.6 million square miles, which is approximately six times greater than the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in the research.
The profits that will come from the use of the seabed will be invaluable, as they promise.
Other States shall submit their requests gradually.
They can do so until ten years since they ratified the Montego Bay Contract.
Where the continental shelf ends, the region of the ocean bottom begins by a convention declared "communal heritage of mankind".
There's none of the states who have exclusive positions here.
The law of purchasing in this area shall be granted by the Convention established by an international institution.
"The sea dno but there is no Klondike," said Director Mikulka in his superiority, saying that his "single areas are legally defined and their regime is treated".
Circuits in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the Common Interoceanmetal Organization.
It won in 1991 under the Convention, as well as investors of a few other countries, the status of the so-called "contributing investor".
He has the right to stretch in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific, lying between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and the Kiribati.
Investor's researched area is a little bigger than former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is partial, it's a submarine replica of Tater.
"It can be grabbed on the surface with a total size of 75,000 square miles.
The area is a rich finding of polymetalic concretes containing niklus, copper, cobalt and mangan," said another lawyer Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian worker of the Robert Sandev Division brings one such concrete.
Reminds a little potato or, in a little fantasy, a wonderful scheme that, according to the legend, he rebuild Golema.
Germany's special position units were released by hostages
The Egyptian government has asked for assistance from Germany in addressing the hostage crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation was warm, special units were ready, but there was no placement.
The public is gradually receiving further details of the circumstances of the release of 11 abducted European tourists in Egypt.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and Interior, German special forces also participated in the rescue.
According to the statement of the ministers, both the experts of the Federal Army and the members of the German police of GSG9 were released on the scene, as well as the experts in logistics from the Technisches Hilfswerk Technisches.
According to the further communication of the speakers, both ministries from Monday afternoon did not need German forces because the kidnappers left their prisoners and fled when they recognized signs of violent release.
The Egyptian government said that the assistance offered by Germany was accepted as supportive forces for action in the place.
"Fortunately there has not been," said one of the speakers of the General Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers abducted a group of passengers composed of five Germans, five Italians, one Romania, and eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19th in southern Egypt.
After kidnapping in the desert region in South Egypt, they moved hostages in border territories between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained uncertain until the last moment, as well as details on the release or possible redemption.
Currently, saving is okay in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said the exemption of hostages is in the care of the German embassy.
He did not express himself to the details of his release.
There is no information available in Berlin yet when saving will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" list, all five tourists should also fly with special forces by one of the German Airbus and to Germany on Tuesday.
The American Representation has rejected a rescue package
The first compartment of the U.S. Congress has left the near majority a rescue package for financial markets worth $700 billion.
The Dow Jones index has fallen very well.
In the ratio of 206 to 227 votes, the US Parliament rejected the government's rescue package for financial markets.
In spite of all the challenges of the US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians, both parties have not found the majority for the programme that should mitigate chaos on the financial markets.
The dramatic acts were desperately trying to convict the criticism of a package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called before the vote of the Member to make an agreement, even though, as he said, the plan is not popular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The concerns of the investors were that the state rescue package could fall down.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index was raised so that, after the notification of the loss of the package, the strictly fell.
Experts now count on other serious turbulences on international financial markets.
In order to enter into force the programme, the approval of the Parliament of the Representatives and the Senate is required.
Travel agents record increasing numbers of bookings
It looks like winter will be good for German businessmen in travel:
According to one study, it increased in the reservations of races for the next month compared to the previous year, even more than 30 per cent in the winter season.
In spite of the weak economic growth, the desire of the Germans to travel indefinitely.
In the winter season bookings, the travel offices recorded an increase of 31 per cent from the same period of last year, as the German travel union (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) stated in Berlin on Monday.
According to the study of the GfK Market Research Institute, there are already increased numbers of bookings available for the autumn months.
The turnover was thus expressed by the DRV on October compared to 2007 by approximately 11 per cent higher.
The basis for these results is the GfK numbers, which assesses data on the reservations of 1200 German travel offices each month and interpolates them to the total market.
This result included the reservations of railways that took place by the end of August 2008.
Because of a weak dollar course, the roads to the United States are mostly requested, stated the DRV.
In these ways, a booking increase is about one third.
In addition, the Germans are particularly demanded targets of Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters.
First of all, the organized trips are in course, the President of DRV Klaus Laepple declared.
In view of the rising energy and food costs, there are costs "for the client's easyest than for individually organised vacation".
Laepple explained that money can be saved, inter alia, by using discounts for a temporary reservation or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, they said the number of bookings was very good, so in comparison with the previous year, a higher turn will be renominated -- even though according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip, in comparison with the previous year, fell down.
My first Octoberberfest
Donecondensary repeated oops, beer of dumbs and prominents in the bars of famous designers.
It's the first time on the beer bowl.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't actually have much to do with it.
She's a blonde, TV moderator, and she's wearing a sewed belt.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is from the secondhand.
But one thing is connecting us: we're not even three minutes on the beer bowl, and we're already being thrown by photographers, and they're filling me with memory cards -- that's what I'm flattered, because I'm on the Octoberfest for the first time.
This is how you can be friends.
Looks like my cheap cock has fulfilled his goal.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equation, so my comfort was rather limited.
But right after the arrival in Theresienwes, it's all better than it seemed.
Almost everyone wears a woman's cock or skinny pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
The special views in the chocolate bananas are just my scratch.
One Monk reminds me that I was wrong to bond her, "Left you are free, in the middle of the virgin, in the right hand, in the back of the widow."
They're going to sweat on the back to the left.
"Okay," he says and laughs.
Others with subtile flirting techniques don't care so much and they wear simple pellets with the label "This drunk to get dressed!" and push on the past naked ass.
A young man with such exhibitionistic tendencies is named Bob, from England, and he came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He looks like "gorgeous", with a prolonged "ooo".
That tells me after you relieved about just a drinking master.
Right next to one of those hydrants who everyone thinks they're waste baskets.
So Bob is one of the feared "Wildbieslers", as it is called in Bavaria in the public of freely urging people.
The rest of the luck to get rid of alcohol like this.
About eighth nights running around the table where the Octoberfest is running, the healthcare who must take care of the poor drinkers.
Medicines always appear in the eggs - in four they wear covered noses from a tent to a tent.
They work like most of the visitors of the drinking ports: empty there, full back.
Who lies under the sail of this coffin from the mile, can't be seen.
"That's the ones who can't go on," calls on me in answer to my question one of the medicalians and disappears in the crowd.
The police have announced the name of the victim of the accident.
The name of a 30 - year - old woman was published, who died in the hospital after her car hit in Essex.
The case on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon hit Carol Paulson from Chelmsford Road.
She was transported to Queen's hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, an 11-year-old man was detained for suspicion of an unreasonable ride.
He was already released on the police bail.
Turkish diplomatic horizons are expanding
Long before Turkey began to seek access to the European Union, European powers wanted to invade deeply into the Turkish border.
On the east shore of Bospor, perhaps only 20 steps in Asia, is one of the best memories of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpash railway station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the non-orenesantic line.
I mean, the tourist guides will tell you.
The building is sitting around at the end of the tower with a tower on every corner of the front, in view of unrecognition from a provincial German city.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's falling down slowly.
But once a person gets inside a knitting treasury, he can't doubt the size of a business whose westest gate was.
In August 1908, the German consortium of Anatoly-bagdad corporation opened the station.
Germany, which has been involved late in the empire game, intended to control the Middle East through this railway to lead to Damascus, Bagdad, and to the territory that is Saudi Arab today.
But the German imperial ambitions have fallen down during the first world war.
Their railways were attacked by Lawrence from Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from surrounding territories, created by the freezing borders of the cold war, is gone.
The British and Colonial Units proceeded from Egypt and pushed Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And the Hydarpash station also came to the bad news.
In 1917, the explosion of the ammunition train was destroyed by her explosive roof.
Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
From then on, they gradually drowned, and history surrounds it.
But today this gate to Anatolia and on the east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The Ruling Party of Justice and Development - AKP - has created a new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from surrounding territories, created by the freezing borders of the cold war, is gone.
New policy is now applied - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian Hamas and Fatah fractions, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I went on a night train to the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I was to meet one of the front experts of AKP for foreign policy, Turkish Member Suat Kinikliogl.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after the codical ride by rails that reminded the ancient world rhythms of the famous Night Mail document, I arrived in a Turkish metropole designed as a new city for the secular state that wants to turn back to its Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamic roots, represents the movement of the Turkish consensus paradigm.
She woke up suspicion in the west, especially in Washington.
Taxic brought me to the headquarters of AKP, ultra-modern stone and metal buildings, intentionally built on a development suburb, surrounded half-deployed business houses and traders to power where middle-time managers in commercial suits - men and women - meet to make rapid injury stores.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a central policy of almost every other European political party.
Saco, tie, I'm sure he had Blackberry.
"The aim of the foreign policy of the party is to reintegrate Turkey into its nearest surroundings.
The cold war was anonymous," he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its obstacle.
Today they have to watch the east and the west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
It must have done both of them.
"But sure it will come a moment," I asked, "when Turkey may have to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "he didn't wish such a decision had to be made."
Then he emphasized what almost everyone I spoke to here said almost to remember: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East but also with Caucas and the Black Sea surroundings are as well for Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, Europe seems to, as a whole, can, metaphorically speak, ride along these railways to the east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back to Hydarpash Station, after the next majority of the sleeping night, I thought about the two German masters Herr Ritter and Herr Con, who watched this building build a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be if they discovered that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, from a major part, in Turkish hands.
And when I waited for the ferry back across the Bospor, I remembered that Turkey was called the sick man of Europe in those days.
So it seems at least then there was no much doubt that the continent should have the right to this fascinating country.
Memorial lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford’s music manager since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrolog, 11 September) was responsible for Guildford's philharmonic orchestra and the congregation.
As part of the district music plan, the excellent congregation of young Proteus founded a year.
He was supposed to be 21 years old, but the last time Proteus sang in 1979, some of us were nearly 30 — we simply refused to give up the congregation.
The name "Proteus" (Mytological Shape Shapes) represented the willingness and ability of the congregation to enter any music that was presented to him - whether madrigali or Messiaen, whether or not alone or with the entire orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young congregation was often impressive, always exciting, all by inspiring this single man and the enthusiasm of music that remained completely unchanging all the time.
How often only Todd told us to "let music speak for ourselves."
He said, "The Composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
Then sing it!"
His tactical technique was absolutely clear and precise, but it wasn't either dictatorial or mayate.
Whatever the music standard was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If some dirigent was supposed to be fitted with the knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades when he was directing the Guildford Filharominian from 1962 to 1982.
In the past about 40 years, I reviewed more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by any of them -- and I have been inspired many times.
Todd Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated dirigents who, according to his words, simply "crowded around the world one or two breadths."
Many of us will be missing.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrolog William Woodruff (September 25th) claims that "in 1946 he returned to the economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblin-Norman... and also studied at BSC, MA and phD."
This comes from Woodruff's note by the author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953, he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and then finished his dissertation work on the British Gumaren industry, which was led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and then published in 1958 as a publication of the British Gumaren industry.
He actually spent years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblin-Norman and summer 1952 at Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953 he definitely left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff went through this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philosophy Faculty
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resina "Flamenco and Life", because his documentary black-white photos are amazing.
I was caught with simplicity and a strong bullet with which the viewers work, and respect and respect for the photographed.
Exhibition that shows many empathy.
Resino can capture magic moments."
Honda will attack her bestseller twice.
In November, Honda starts the sale of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the precedent of this one-space vehicle has already had a significant space, it is now offering even more space interior.
The improved engines are connected to this, which increases the comfort of the ride and allows more fuel savings.
It's a evolution rather than a revolution.
That's the second generation of Hondy Jazz.
Although the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, this unispace car has made many changes.
It is necessary to mention, for example, innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Even before we examine the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz is coming to the market for six years after the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we'll notice is that Honda needed a shorter period to flip this model than other manufacturers.
Although jazz is a less famous model in Europe, on other markets he became a phenomenon.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz was the most sale car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
Since Hondy Jazz marketed in Japan, almost a million pieces have been sold.
The second market became an old continent with approximately half a million sold pieces in six years.
Honda, however, puts a goal on the new Jazz to increase sales in its category.
While this Japanese company sold totally 83,000 pieces of Hondy Jazz in 2007, the estimates were estimated by 100,000 cars, which would increase by 17% on the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 pieces of jazz model since 2002, which is 6.7% of the total sale of Hondy in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of Jazz, the leadership of the Spanish branch expects sale of 2,000 pieces a year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly reduce sales decline in Spain.
The drivership of the car so de facto expects the end of the year with a total of 22,000 sold pieces, which means 4,000 less than in 2007 and decreased by 16 %.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share in the Spanish market to 1,8 %, compared to 1,6 % of last year.
In 2010, this Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a five-way hybrid compact size with a length of 4.37 metres from which the Japanese company promises the world's sale of about 200 000 pieces a year.
As regards markets, the Japanese producer estimates that 50 % of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentages divide the old continent and Japan.
The start of Hondy Insight sale is expected in the first months of the next year, as soon as it will be presented to the public in January in Valencia.
In addition to the first generation, all the dimensions increased in the new Jazz.
His length rose up to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), a width of 1.69 meters (about two centimeters more) and a disposal of fixing at 2.5 meters, which means a length of five centimeters.
The height is not changing and still at 1,52 metres.
Increasing the dimensions also increased the internal space.
However, this benefit was achieved by the use of a new platform, but by storing the fuel tank in the middle of the car that has already been used in Hondy Jazz.
Also the volume of the luggage space - which has a double bottom system - increased to 399 liters, by 19 liters more than it made the volume of the luggage space for the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions appear at the engine 1.4, because the volume of the luggage space in Hondy Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Another improvement other than external elements - such as the back LED of the light or the possibility of equipped panoramatic roof - is easier access to the back seats.
The doors leading to the second seats allow the corner of opening 80 degrees against 67 in the first Jazz model.
The second generation of Hondy Jazz has new engines.
From the beginning, this small model will be offered with two gasoline engines 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology that allows lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions, and brings excellent improvements in the engine power system at the same time with a high circuit moment in the full range of engine rotation.
The first engine with a volume of 1.2 litres has 90 horses at 6000 rotations with the maximum rotating moment 114 Nm at 4.900 rotations.
This engine - which had 78 horses in the previous generation of Jazz - has a 5,3 litres consumption and an emission of 125 grams of CO2.
In spite of the previous engine, which has reached 83 horses in the past generation, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with the performance of 100 horses has combined consumption of 5.4 litres and an emission of 128 grams of CO2.
"Auto bee" prevents the crashes
To progress in the development of technologies protecting against accidents, Nissan was inspired in nature this time, specifically in bees.
This Japanese company created a robot who takes a model of flying bees, thus preventing the crashes.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in the technologies of the prevention of collapse.
The engineers of the Centre for Technical Progress Nissan Motor Co. robotka developed in collaboration with the Centre for Progress in Scientific and Technological Research of the Prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhir Doie, the Director-General for Public Relations for Technology, Research and Development of the Mark, BR23C is presented as an expansion of four zones of the Nissan security shield.
Robot has a task to strengthen the ability to prevent crashes from cars of this mark.
During the flight, every bee creates its own personal space of a oval shape, which is very similar to the Nissane safety shield.
But the most important are the complex bees' eyes that can be seen in all directions in an angle greater than 300 degrees, which allows the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
The engineers designed what they called laser location (Laser Range Finder) when creating this visual function.
This records the obstacles that are located up to two meters in the range of 180 degrees before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends the signal to the board microprocessor, which immediately transmits it to the warning of the collision.
"When the obstacle is recorded, the robotic will imitate the bee movements and immediately change the direction by turning wheels into the right or even greater angle to prevent the collapse.
The biggest difference against any existing system is that all avoiding maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If it were not, the robot would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Lab and the main engineer of the project.
Robot cannot move up and down, nor diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and to the direction that is allowed by turning his wheels, but not in the infinite amount of directions and options as in bees.
Therefore, in addition to acceleration and slowness, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent the robotic from the collapse.
"The device needs only to process information every few seconds and behave according to these data.
It does not require storage of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, which can work without interruption with only two dozen kB memory.
You may be surprised, but we're not talking about giga or mega."
This is the first step in developing new technologies to immediate prevention of collapse, the technology in which Nissan predicts use in serial cars in ten years.
Robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the installation of a unit into the GPS satellite navigation system that would lead the driver to the target and avoid obstacles on the road.
Enjoy fear before you take mortgage
It should be recognised that the U.S. Ministry of Finance, in addition to having enough capital for injections, does not miss either inventory.
It faces a crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from taking risk hypotheses from banks with doubtful solvency, it created a popular-scientific game on the Internet "The Bad Credit Hotel".
Or "Hotel of Bad Loans"... or a confused hotel.
The hotel and especially its recruitment seem cloudy to make a person once, twice and three times think about whether the right time is to ask for credit.
And especially where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, even if you're not too detailed.
It's a site more suitable for youth than a place for the whole public.
And what happens when the game's over?
There's a room of dreams inside the hotel.
At least something, because you'd rather not talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital MUFG
The banking house Morgan Stanley announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank that would spend nine billion dollars to gain 21% from its capital. The adoption of this report carried out a significant decline in its course on the bureau.
A week after they discovered their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that the MUFG will buy 9.9% of the regular stocks of Morgan Stanley at a single price of $25.25, which represents a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % than the value of securities by 31 August.
The MUFG Bank invests another six billion dollars in acquisition of convertable securities, which will provide 10% of its profit and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the entire operation would be performed on the basis of the average unit price of $29, i.e. 28% under its current course.
Morgan Stanley's shares still lost 6.79% and reached $23.07 around 17.00 Greenwich time.
"This strategic merger is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley to the bank holding status," explained John Mack, Director-General of this US Group.
The new Statute adopted Morgan Stanley last week, which allows him to distinguish his activities, but also places him under the surveillance of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His merger with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest eso from Wall Street to take a far more careful approach than before.
The conditions presented on Monday, inter alia, indicate that the agreement has been modified during the last few days: last Monday Morgan only announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for approximately $8.5 billion.
"We thought a week ago," explained Tokio Toshihide Mizuno, the Executive Director of the MUFG, that our participation would consist exclusively of common action.
However, given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to limit risks to minimum and also hide."
On the basis of the weighted average price, the MUFG will pay for valuable papers Morgan Stanley by 7 % less than their account value.
And the operation will result in reducing profits from the stock by about 20%.
The Agreement assumes that the IUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities within a year to the common shares if the last named for a certain period will be exchanged by 50 % over the exchange price, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that brings the MUFG will allow him to use investment opportunities, strengthen his balance and increase its cash.
However, the speaker group refused to provide detailed information on both new allies' strategic projects.
After IUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should be familiar with the ratio of Tier One’s payment eligibility around 15 %, which is one of the best in the sector.
Morgan stated that since the end of August, he "sensitively" decreased his balance.
The last few weeks were difficult for the group, since its burzing course has fallen by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of non-payment associated with debt have rapidly increased.
These costs took the opposite development on Monday, but remained high, about 12 %.
Last week she announced Goldman Sachs, the only other "life" from the large Wall Street Investment Banks after the crash of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the ransom of Merrill Lynch that she chose $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett Group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quit.
Reiterate the Republic around socialism in the 21st century.
This is the common project of Venezuelca Huga Chaveza, the Bolivian Eva Morales and the Ecuador Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third appointment submitted to vote, according to the model of his proteins and friends, the proposal for the new Constitution.
And his mission is fulfilled, since 64% of the voters, according to the official results covered by 80% votes, voted in the referendum "Yes".
"No" has received 28 %, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the voting tickets were empty.
In order to accept the proposal of the Constitution, he had to receive half of the votes plus one.
Two examinations carried out at the east of the election rooms and the number of non-governmental organizations predicted a clear victory "yes" on Sunday, with 63 % to 70% of them.
Rafael Correa demanded the victory of his proposal for the Constitution at the end of the night of Sunday on Monday.
"The Constitution won the entire line," assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians in the Guayaquil Guayaquil seat, 280 miles southwest of Quit.
He understands himself that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chaveza and Morales, as well as from his chile skill, Michelle Bachelet.
The voting, which, according to the Observation Mission of the United States (OEA), played peacefully, related to the text of 444 points constructing "new socialism" promoted by the President.
The proposal of the Constitution dedicates the power of the State over the economy by providing it with the "planing of development" of the country living mainly from oil-treatment by foreign companies and the devision that its emigrants send.
The proposal protected by Correa, which was selected in 2006, also extends the power of the head of the State that will be able to carry out two ongoing four-year mandates and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Parliament.
Correa has already announced that this power will be used and will be subject to a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution, inter alia, strengthens the principle of free health and education, which the President began to introduce in the country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live under the poverty limit.
Finally, it is also regarded as a prohibition of the presence of foreign armies, thus terminating the agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of the Ecuador base as the default point of American drug operations.
19 hostages were released in Chad
The Egyptian command took the attack of the 11 tourists and their eight-time companion who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held in prison ten days in the desert, were alive and healthy to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
During the morning, the Egyptian command released them in Chad.
The armies arrived around 15.30, apparently in good shape, on the deck of a special plane to the Al-Maza military base, who is close to the international airport in Cairo.
They were transported immediately without the possibility to express themselves in the press, the helicopter on board to the hospital in Maadi, the Cahira border residential quarter to be subjected to medical examinations.
"They are completely healthy" and "the kidnappers have not been paid any ransom," the Egyptian Minister for Tourism Zoheir Garrana declared on the roadway.
Since its captivity on September 19th during safari in a vehicle with a drive of all four wheels on the back of the mountain of Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages was dragged from one shelter to another 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border director of Aegyptous Agency, organizer safari.
A representative of the Egyptian security components indicated that 30 members of special units who approached the location of two helicopters arrived at the board during the night just before the dawn.
"There was a shooting, half the kidnappers were killed and others fled," said the source that wanted to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces were sent to Sudan, where they received the support of the German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomacy, Franco Frattini, from Belgrade, where he is now, mentioned the role played by the secret agents and the folders of Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that this result has been achieved through professional and effectiveness of people from our secret services, from special forces," he declared without further clarification.
He also denied that the ransom would be redempted.
In the evening, the Judanese Army announced that at the patrol, the vehicle was detained with a drive of all four wheels on which the kidnappers were located, and six killed, including the Chadish commander and two arrested.
The army claimed that they were connected to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Movement for Liberation of Sudan - Unita (SLA-U), which immediately rejected the movement mentioned.
Letters - Silent majority of cultural resort
The debate on cultural financing fills paper pages with thumb titles and is just the subject of the pre-election campaign.
That's better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still ignored.
Who will rise to lay down the poor amounts provided by small museums, archives, archaeological diggings and national memories that are starving?
Which politicians will remark the federal government that they will ignore their memories and their historic buildings?
That in Québek, as in Canada, do we not have laws that would really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government devoted three and a half million euros to a restaurant of a chinon castle in the Loiry Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all the elected representatives and all circuit organisations, in coherence.
In Québek, in the Federation of the History of Québek, it has aimed at at least 40,000 volunteers associated with 211 companies for history, memory, archives and genealogies on the dissemination of history, the preservation of a bunch of private archives and the protection of archaeological remnants in a few small ones.
Often these companies are the guarding dogs of our monuments, which the prosecutors and managers protest when they release their buldozers on old stones and forgotten cemetery.
When will we finally meet the tribunes for history and memories?
Benelux's governments will be the fortis bank
Benelux States will help the Belgic-Netherlands Fortis Bank, which first in Europe has encountered difficulties due to the widespread impact of the US hypothetical market crisis, by partial reservation: three countries will support the monetary and insurance institution which also has capital participation in Hungary, a amount of 11.2 billion euros.
This weekend was agreed at the highest level of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Dutch Government for the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Economic Competition.
The Fortis Bank is the first in the euro area that, within the crisis of international financial markets, spreading in waves for more than a year, has reached a major crisis, and the decision made in this matter could be assessed as precedents.
In the light of the decision born on Sunday night, all three States will redeem almost half (49%) of the bank's ownership.
The Bank will, with absolute certainty, sell part of its capital shares, in particular - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch Bank of ABN Amro.
The Fortis bank's actions began to fall rapidly last week, and in the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already occurred in the constitution.
However, the analysts agree that the bank is too large with its 85,000 employees to let it crash.
The company's valuable papers only fell by 12 percent on Friday, to the 14-year-old minimum.
Since January, the stock value of more than two thirds has fallen.
In view of the current stock prices, the total market value of the group is about 14 billion euros, but it is not real.
The company's leadership is finally blaming for the fall of the Fortis stock of uncertainty on the foreign market related to the adoption of an American package plan of $700 billion.
The stocks were slightly up on Monday.
On Friday, a new Director-General Philip Dierckx was appointed in the head of the bank.
The monetary institution has also been looking for private buyers, but no one has yet filed a more serious offer.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors should not be concerned, they will not lose their money.
The bank's clients haven't panicked yet, and the branches weren't attacked by a gate.
In Hungary, the Fortis bank has a separate branch and bought several leasing companies.
Liss in the chicken
Life and health insurance in America, based on data of people on the purchase of medicinal products, often denys the possibility to conclude a contract with the insurance provider.
Data protection experts fear that the data market becomes uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme that evaluates the use of data on the prescription of drugs in any case for the authorisation of the person concerned.
It must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we trust a leaf chicken," quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, the author of the program designed to monitor the prescription of medicines.
Insurance companies make insurance and the amounts paid for insurance events dependent on the health status of the stakeholders, and if the risk is considered to be too large, they shall not even close with it.
They used to send medical examinations and contracts only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: on the basis of the identification number, a customer from the pharmacists easily finds what drugs he has bought in the last year and a half of which the programme itself produces what he suffers and what his health condition is.
For example, if he regularly purchases large amounts of cholesterol reduction medicinal products, it refers to a practically uncontrolled blood fat level, which immediately puts it into a high-risk category.
There are a number of versions of the programme, some also determine the risk coefficient in the circulation, so insurance is almost no job, although there are minor problems.
Inconvenience includes that lecter medicines can also be used for several purposes, for example, some compounds are used against migraine or heat inflammation, but are also effective against depression.
These represent a significant factor in the view of commercial insurance, where the firstly appointed problems are not.
In order to request and process the data, special companies have been established, which have requested permission from the pharmacists before receiving the necessary information.
The authorities are now forced to do so, even though they were not punished for their real carelessness.
Some companies have recently processed the results of laboratory studies that link to data on medicines that can provide a more precise picture of the health of patients.
The data has access to more companies, at the same time the control of their use will be increasingly complex.
There is a special medical protection law, however, its effectiveness applies only to health providers and insurance providers.
The proposal of a law which will give the authorities the power to control also companies specialised for data delivery is before the Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: he therefore developed his program so that the transfer of data will be linked to the explicit consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the authorization concerned can barely deny, otherwise insurance contracts will not conclude with it.
So the chickens are just somewhat embarrassed to the leather of the good will.
Global Marseilles Menu
The European Union and India will double trade trafficking
Since the European Union and India are mutual business partners, this theme was led by the other topic, mostly global problems, also the series of the ninth meeting meetings at the highest level.
The French and Indian summit will also be held today, in particular on cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
Because the European Union recognizes that India is a developing democratic power that should be given a greater opportunity to speak to international matters, but Member States have not yet been able to find a common denominator in the issue of the support of the permanent membership of the New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not even further discussed at the yesterday, the ninth summit held in Marseille.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy as the current President of the Union, the respect of the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, and the High Representative for Foreign Policy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who also agreed that the trade would double up to more than a hundred billion euros in the period of five years.
Since between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 to 55 billion, it is not an excessive ambitious goal.
In a legal way, twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation have been receipted from the legal terms, so the green air transport has also reached the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that the negotiations will be accelerated.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is the first business partner in India, New Dillí figures between EU partners in the ninth place.
The summit also focused on global matters.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, respect for terrorism - both parties in all its forms condemned and called for an accelerated UN conference.
They also urged the closure of the trade negotiations from Dauh, although both have a great share in his original failure.
The European Union confirmed that it would insist on its energy and climate programme, which would like to reduce the emissions of harmful substances by 2020 by at least 20 per cent.
India also agreed to that, as well as that, at the next year climate conference, it would be necessary to conclude a global agreement and gas production caused by glass effect to reduce by 50 per cent by 2050.
Both parties would also like to prevent the increase in food prices and support the appointment of an international conference to address the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister today travels to the French capital, where at a two-sided meeting, he is about to close a trade on peaceful use of atomic energy.
Paris believes that the authorization to build Indian nuclear reactors worth twenty billion euros will acquire French companies.
According to the Agency's reports, the Agreement should be valid for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than 300 Italian publishers
Great participation of Italian publishers in the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmess, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from a hundred different countries to take 171,790 meters of square vegetation with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as a honourable guest.

Found a plane Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of the plane Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3th, 2007, flying over the desert in Nevada.
The trumpets were discovered on one upper edge of three thousand meters above the sea, in the Mammoth Lakes area in Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
But there were no human remnants inside the plane.
Sheriff Madera County, John Anderson, raised doubts that remained, "The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we are sure that it was exactly what Steve Fossett flyed on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
Thus, the sheriff stated that human remains were not found in either a plane or in the area.
63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The US Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) announced that several hours after recognition of the waste was sent a investigative team which eventually identified the plane: it is exactly Bellanco 8kcab, not familiar since 3 September 2007, when Fossett left Yerington in Nevada to a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, near the Nevada border, some Fossett's personal objects were found by a couple near their accommodation in Mammoth Lakes.
It's two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Air Management, cash and one jacket.
The search for Fossett was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
Miliarder got a place in history thanks to a long championship collection.
In 2002, on the sixth trial, he became the first man who finished the world's journey in the air balloon: two weeks of flight alone.
Three years later, the world flyed on the plane and without landing.
Among his many records also belongs flights at a height of 15,445 meters above the Andamas, even though with a pilot.
Glk, the advertisement you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and exactly defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk from the "compact" jeeps of the star's house, using which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring the faith of the news into this sector.
Its non-tradicial processing will be unexpected and unconventional and communication that will be accompanied by the Suv Glk market and which will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms since the next 17 October.
In this way, the advertising campaign that accompanies the debut of a new vehicle also starts an unofficial way of communication through a futurist poster campaign in 3D, which is used for the first time in Italy for a car mark.
The maxi poster project, divided into three different stages, will dominate the main military business class, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication begins by showing the car in stereoscopic vision and using special glasses that will be distributed near Corsa Como will be able to see a new Suv in almost real dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
Indeed, when you look at the picture, you will have the impression that the car leaves the poster.
Then, using innovative technologies Elumina8, the new Glk will be enlightened in different moments in all its minorities, so that it will be recompensed in one image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotype area of car communication.
Will he be able to wake up the interest of future customers in this way?
So we already know who the Italian huligans are
From Triveneta, they're risking Daspo.
Who are those 150-200 boys and girls who are now ashamed of Italy? They are part of the Ultras Italy group, which has been watching Nazionale azzurra for years and which, in fact, has never done excessive problems.
She never even met the adversary fans.
The orientation of the group is right.
The founders come from Triveneta.
From Verona, Padovi, Terstu is Udine.
In Sofia, few groups from Campania and Puglia joined them.
They have three colored flags that appear to the city of the origin of the participating: they were removed on Saturday night so that they were not recognized.
They're inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found real Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc gave the Italian fans 144 tickets to the match: all to the name, thus easily controlled.
And Viminale really checked all of them: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the Dassle, no one to be allowed to attend the stadiums.
Four blue fans who had previous offences from the stadium were rejected and the match was banned.
Now Viminale awaits to read the reports coming from the Bulgarian police, then takes action: In this case, Daspo can be given for at least five years to the fans who were arrested or to those who were identified during the explosion.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our huligans, simply, won't go any more on one stadium.
Fortunately.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that means that more than 50 will join the other ones.
"We must put this fire down immediately and do not justify those who act in this way," Viminal confirms.
So, "properly open eyes, especially because of the national struggle in the Wednesday in Lech."
There's a small core of supporters in Puglia.
Tomorrow, Osservatorio will meet, on Tuesday, Casms, who can also count on one part of the Aise, is a secret service that is taking care of stadium problems.
"Communical Leader-Leader and arms tied during Mameli's hymna?
This is the idea of Domenica Mazzilli (expressed in a very little way), which is a few weeks directed by the Viminal Osservatorio (he was looking for a place previously Francesca Tagliente and then Felicie Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli used to be a kvestor in Terst, where the core of the supporters of Ultras Italy was founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says that in Bulgaria there is no crime to celebrate the leader, but of course the behavior of these 150-200 fans is disgraceful.
"I'm not a sociologist -- the Osservatorian unit is supplied – crimes are pledged to the country in which they have happened.
So far, this group has remained in the borders, and now we'll see what's happened and we'll consider for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistle at Mameel's hymn: it's not a crime, but if you will, it's an inconduct...."
