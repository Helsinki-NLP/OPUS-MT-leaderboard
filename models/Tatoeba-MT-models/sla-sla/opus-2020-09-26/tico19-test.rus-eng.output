How long are these symptoms present?
and all the pains in the breast cell should be treated in this way, especially with your age
and with high temperature
and is also required to verify your cholesterol and arterial pressure levels
And do you have a high temperature now?
And do you now experience this pain in your breast cell?
And if it is hard for you to breathe
And can you tell me what other symptoms you have other than these?
And how high your temperature was
And I'm still coughing.
And I've got a little cough.
And I have a really strong pain in my breast cell today.
And whether this is the time for the shadow fever to which you are subjected
and a pain in the breast cell
And I think I've got a little heat.
And I want you to describe where you feel the pain of your breast cell.
and they also have a little higher temperature
and with your diabetes history

Any other symptoms or problems observed to you and related to muscle pain?
Do you have any other patients with the same symptoms?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Do you have a breath now?
Do you still suffer pain in the breast cell
Because it's a flu season
But we should also not be ignored because of the pain in the breast cell with cardiological nature
However, the more important problem now is this pain in the breast cell
But I'm having a difficult breath.
But I know a lot of people cough on me.
But we must approach any pain in the breast cell with maximum seriousness
But you're breathing right now, right?
'Cause I don't remember this pain in the breast cell anymore.
Does it seem like someone's squeezing your chest cell?
You're still breathing.
Are they complaining about the symptoms of bad self - feeling?
Do you have any other chronic diseases such as high arterial pressure or something like that?
Do you have any other chronic diseases or medical problems such as diabetes?
Do you have a breath in this pain in the breast cell?
Do you have a high arterial pressure?
Do you have this with a breath?
Do you know what symptoms she had?
Do you see this picture?
Sing a lot of fluid today
But I'm going through diabetes tests.
But she had symptoms exactly as I did.
How high is your temperature?
What's your arterial pressure?
if you still have high temperature
if you have the temperature of thirty-eight and nine or more
if you think your symptoms or problems guarantee improvement in the appearance
I got the temperature up yesterday.
I also got a little temperature up yesterday.
I had a temperature yesterday.
I'm having a sharp pain in my breast cell here.
I also have a little difficult breath
I'll send you a picture.
I'm having some pain in my chest today.
I've got a little headache today and a temperature has risen.
I think it's a flu.
I think it's a flu in a light form.
Does this remind you that as if a very, very heavy man is sitting on your neck?
This all began almost at the same time with the headache and temperature increase
I'm in the center of my chest.
It pressures like the pain in the breast cell
It's in my chest.
It's in the middle of my breast cell.
It's in the center of the breast cell.
I got a pain in my chest.
I'm really worried about this pain in my chest.
I want you to describe this pain in my chest.
as high arterial pressure or diabetes
as exactly in the center of the breast cell
From high temperature, you can now take tahipirin in the form of ice creams
And now, Mary, tell me how many days you've had these symptoms.
Now you said you felt a pain in your chest.
From time to time, I feel a little pain in my chest
Well, do you have any other symptoms other than pain
Or is someone sitting on your chest?
Exactly the same high temperature and cough, head and muscle pain
pain in the center of my breast
Show me on this picture where you feel pain
Because you have a high temperature.
So you think some of these symptoms could be related to pregnancy?
So, do your children have some of the same symptoms?
Tell me about your chest pain.
Temperature increases at night
The temperature I had in the last two days
Temperature began to increase last night
It's Dr. Porter at the recruitment point of assistance.
Okay, can you tell me a little bit more about the pain in your chest?
Well, I feel pain in the front of my body here, in my chest.
Well, I feel a lot of pain in my chest.
So when I feel a pain in my chest
What kind of pain do you feel in your chest?
When did you start feeling that pain in your chest?
Where exactly do you feel the pain in your chest?
Where exactly you feel that pain in your chest
You experience something like the feeling of shame in your breast
You know, I have diabetes and all that.
You said that you suffered this pain in the breast cell.
Rapidly growing rate of coronavir infection (CIVID-19) in the European Union and Britain from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The commulation of coronavirus infection (CIVID-19) has similar trends in the countries of the European Economic Zone and Britain, thus reaffirming that, despite different stages of its development in different countries, COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly growing in all countries.
In view of the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive therapy, it is necessary to increase the readiness of patients with COVID-19 who will need treatment and, in particular, intense therapy.
On 31 December 2019, several cases of unknown ethology were identified in the Uganda of the Chinese Province of Hubai.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centre for Control and Prevention of Disabilities reported that the infection is a new type of coronavirus now known as a severe severe respiratory syndrome of 2th Type (SARS-CoV-2).
Since now, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become called coronavirus infection (CAVID-19).
According to the data available today, approximately 80 per cent of the COVID-19 people are in a light form, i.e. in the form of respiratory infection with or without lung.
Approximately 14 per cent of the COVID-19 cases are developed in a more severe form with the need for hospitalization and 6 per cent are critical when intense therapy is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
This study analyses the trends of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union (EU) / the European Economic Zone (ECE) and the Great Britain, comparing them to the trends in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/ECE and the United Kingdom of Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/ECE and Britain
Following the explosion in China, COVID-19 spread into other countries, and now, in the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing according to the same dynamic as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the pandemic of COVID-19.
In the Eurosurveillance magazine dated 5 March 2020, Mr. Spitteri (Spiteri) and his colleagues reported the first confirmed COVID-19 disease in Europe, which met the criteria under which WHO defines the existence of disease.
Three first confirmed cases in the EU/ECE were registered in France on 24 January 2020, all three patients returned from Mr. Uganda of the Chinese Province of Hubai.
As at 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases of infection have been identified in all 30 EU/EEA and Britain, with 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths, including 1,441 deaths, only Italy.
Determination of the total quantity and cumulative disease of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates every day at 8:00 on the number of recorded cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of those countries, national and regional health management bodies and WHO.
These data are used to analyse the COVID-19 distribution trends in the EU/EES and in Britain and to compare them to Italy data.
The COVID-19 level of dissemination of active cases was calculated by the COVID-19 compilative disease in 14 days, taking into account the normal flow of COVID-19 in each country of EU/EECE and Britain for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the total number of cases identified in each country at 8:00, 15 March 2020, compared to Italy data from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 development trends in EU/EES countries and United Kingdom
The trends for COVID-19 in the 14-day period in EU/EES countries and Britain generally were in line with the trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubai (ris. 1).
COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and Britain in general increased on approximately 21 February, and on 28 February 2020 there was a sharp jump of this indicator (supplementary material).
This was mainly caused by a rapid increase in the number of registered cases of disease in Italy, but in all other countries, EU/ECE and Britain, there were similar trends to the growth of COVID-19 (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EES countries and Britain compared to the similar indicator for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to this, the total number of cases has already been registered as at 8:00, 15 March in 15 other EU/ECE countries and Britain, compared to the amounts recorded in Italy only 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of recorded COVID-19 cases in the EU/ECE and Britain.
The observed COVID-19 trends of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing comparable speed in all countries.
In spite of different stages in different countries, distinctions in response measures taken by national public health authorities and possibly different criteria for recognition of cases of disease and different patient selection rules for analysing the presence of COVID-19, including the “verifying” testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, the doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10 per cent of patients with COVID-19 required intensive therapy, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive therapy offices in these regions have already been maximised.
Currently, data on the entry of patients with COVID-19 to hospitals and (or) intensive therapy offices in the EU/ECE are only available for 6% and 1% of cases accordingly (not presented).
However, the systematic collection of such information is necessary to supplement the current monitoring data, subject to the number of recorded cases and the number of deaths.
According to the 2010-2011 study, there is a significant discount in the number of cocows in intensive therapy and intensive care offices: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100 000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 leagues in intensive therapy and intensive care offices for 100,000 people in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the results of the risk assessment on COVID-19 presents the modelling of the loading of health systems with evaluation data on infected COVID-19 in each country of EU/EES and Britain, where the risk of lack of access to cokes in intensive therapy is above 90%.
Since cases are now grouped in certain regions of EU/ECE and Britain and hospitals and intensive therapy usually serve the population of a certain territorial group, information on infections and numbers of coconuts in intensive therapy is recommended to provide at the 2nd level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for the purposes of statistics (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU/EES and the Great Britain.
Consequently, countries, hospitals and intensive therapy should be prepared for the contact infection scenario of SARS-CoV-2, which has not been weakened for a long time, and to increase the number of patients with COVID-19 needing medical assistance and, inter alia, intense therapy, which, for example, can be observed in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the last ECDC report on the results of the risk-environment expression, it is important to prevent the SARS-COV-2 dissemination of the operational, preventive and integrated approach with the subsequent transition from restraint to minimization of the consequences, as given the predictable rapid increase in the number of diseases, the decision-making of persons and hospitals may simply not be sufficient to consider, take and correct their responses, if such measures are not taken earlier.
The risk assessment report also lists public health measures aimed at mitigating the pandemic impact.
They only have a small period of time during which they can intensify their control efforts to slow down the SARS-CoV-2 spread and reduce the load on their health systems.
If not, in the coming days or weeks of the health system in other EU/ECE countries, the influenza of patients who will need intensive therapy.
The coronavirus infection of 2019 (COVIID-19) caused by a severe crown-respiratory syndrome (SARS) 2th type (SARS-CoV-2) has become a tragedy for mankind: at present in China and other countries of the world, more than 3,000 people were infected and more than 80,000 were infected.
Like a homological virus of SARS-CoV, which caused a severe severe respiratory syndrome for thousands in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from flying mouses and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and lower mortality than SARS, but it is much more infected and affected by older people more often than young and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, the present and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing subject of research is proposed.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, ethology, virusology, diagnosis, treatments, predictions of further fluid and prevention of this disease.
Although the answers to many questions are yet to be found, we hope that this review will help understand and eliminate the dangerous disease.
The spring celebration (China’s New Year), which fell on 25 January 2020, became an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all the Chinese, who were urged to stay at home for and for many weeks after it.
Given the high degree of similarity to the coronavirus (COV), the explosion of a severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 called this SARS-COV-2 virus, and the associated disease was a coronary infection 19 (CIVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese town of Uhan and quickly spread across the country and then almost 50 other countries of the world.
More than 80,000 COVID-19 confirmed cases have been identified on 2 March 2020, more than 40,000 patients have recovered, and more than 3,000 patients have died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the first enemy to society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than two months later, more than 200 publications on COVID-19, including articles on its virusology, epidemiology, ethology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which identified the sequence of the virus allocated from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarise the results of the research in the new and rapidly developing areas.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronavirus disease — the coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which had occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts currently known about prevention and predicting the flow of disease, as well as some other not less important issues.
Coronavirs were traditionally treated with patogens that are not deadly dangerous to humans and mainly cause about 15 per cent of the general respiratory diseases 4.
Nevertheless, in this century, we had twice faced high-patogen human coronavirus, i.e. a severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and the coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused the explosion of diseases initially in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively and soon distributed to many other States with a terrible level of disease and mortality.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third explosion of coronavirus in human history.
As indicated in Figure 1.1, the report on the classters of non-known background cases entered the NPC National Health Commission on 31 December 2019.
A genetic sequence of the virus was released seven days later.
On 15 January 2020, the first death case was registered in Mr. Uhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic was rapidly spread into neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was known for the infection of medical workers, which provided for the possibility of human transmission of the virus.
On 23 January, the quarantine was introduced to Mr. Uhan, stopped the city's public transport work.
On 24 January, the first clinical study of this disease was noted that 21 of 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contacts with the sea products market in Mr. Uchan, who was considered as a point of dissemination of an unknown animal infection.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the explosion of the coronavirus was a global emergency in public health.
During the preparation of the report, the disease has been spread throughout China and has already been invaded in about 50 other countries worldwide (ris. 2).
In view of the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and the extent of the danger of the explosion is still to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, following a multicentral clinical study in which 8 886 patients, including 4 021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented the next updated image of the epidemic development (https://mp.weixin.q.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has been infected by all age groups, but mostly people aged from 30 to 65 years of age.
Almost half (47.7%) infected were over 50 years old, few are 20, and only 14 infected have not yet been 10 years old.
Infection of SARS-COV-2 among men above (0.31/100 000) than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was distributed by clusters mainly in the Hubey Province and in nearby regions.
The diagnosis had been 5 (2 to 9 days before the diagnosis were diagnosis since the symptoms of COVID-19.
The incubation period was 4.8 (3,–7.2) of the day.
From the time of symptoms before death, the average was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) of the day.
The basic reproduction indicator (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
By 23 January 2020, an exponential increase in the number of infected persons compared with large transports before the Chinese New Year was celebrated.
The mortality among patients with a confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10 to 1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02 to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors in the case of COVID-19 were: gender (man), age (≥60) and severe cases of pneumonia.
The coronaviruss are the subsemination of major shell viruses containing one string of meaningful RNA.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and betacorononavirs are known to affect people.
In the case of damage by coronavirus type SARS and MERS, glycoprotein of the shell shell syropide (S) shall be linked to cell receptors of angiotensin converting ferment of type 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidilpeptidasis-4 (DPP4) accordingly, after which the membrane synthesis occurs.
The cytoplazm is released from the virus genome of the RNC; after replication of the virus genome, the RNA genome, along with the shell glycoproteins and nucleocopside proteins, generates virio-containing linkules, which then blend with the membrane cell, eradiating the virus.
The first genomic sequence reports of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on 10 January 2020.
It is established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronovir, whose genom is 99.98 per cent compared to 10 sequential samples collected in the first flash of the illness, on the sea-products of Juanan in Mr. Uhan.
Genetic SARS-COV-2 closer to SARS-COV than to MERS-COV.
The e-copy of the SARS-CoV-2 particle was found in the ultra-tonic cuts of human breathing epithel.
It is established that the human ACE2 enzyme is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, S-protein SARS-CoV-2 is weaker with the ACE2 enzyme than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients to have less severity than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also generate a previously known short-living protein coded orf3b and a secret protein coded orf8.
The orf3b protein of the SARS-CoV-2 can play a role in the patogenity of the virus and suppress the IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a collection of authors, headed by Jou (Zhou), presented reports on the cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of the full-dimensional ACE2 enzyme of a person with the authorization of 2.9 Å in a B0AT1 transporter.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed corporations, was gathered as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could link two S-proteins, which is proof of recognition and infection of the coronavir.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target in the medicinal warehouse to suppress the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and intermediate host
It is known that the source of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were flying mouses, from which the virus was transmitted to a person through a civet and a camel accordingly.
Through the philogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruss, it was established that the first owners of SARS-CoV-2 are flipping mouses, since the new virus is 96% identical to two similar to SARS coronavirus, namely SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown what kind of intermediate master has been able to overcome the type of barrier and infect the person; the transmission path is also to be discovered.
Mr. Ji (Ji) with his colleagues assumed that the transmitters of the virus from flying mouse to man became serpents, which occurred in the process of homological recombination in S-protein.
According to their research, Chinese scientists from Guanchjou assumed that the pangolines are long-term sycerers who are feeding ants and often used in traditional Chinese medicines, are potential intermediate masters of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 per cent genetic similarity between the pangolin coronavir and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference between both genomes is very large, so it is considered that the final results with concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (ris. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown mostly.
In laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive within 48 hours in the dry environment and up to 5 days below 20 °C and 40 to 50 per cent of moisture.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultrafial and heating up to 56 °C within 30 minutes; effectively blocking the virus activity may ether, 75 per cent ethyl alcohol, chloride disinficient, perux acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorhexidine.
Human population generally has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are perceptive to the new virus.
There are currently no data on detailed studies of immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can refer only to the early studies of other coronavirus, primarily SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (ris. 4).
In general, the system of the host will first recognize the inherent immune system by means of recognizing recipients (ORR), including C-type, Toll-like receptors, NOD-receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus provokes expression of lighting factors, dendrite cells and synthesis of type I interferons that prevent the spread of the virus and accelerate the fagocitosis of macrophags against virus antigens.
However, with the N-white SARS-CoV, it can avoid immune reactions.
Soon, a adaptive immune response is included in the fight against the virus.
T-limphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+, play an important role in the protection of the organism.
T cells CD4+ stimulate the generation of viral antibodies in B cells, and T cells CD8+ directly kill the cells affected by the virus.
T-helpers produce anti-fuel cytokines that help protective cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit T cell functions by causing their programmed death.
The humoral immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, also plays an important role in combating virus infection.
For example, the antibodies separated from a healed patient have neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, hyperreaction of the immune system involves local education of large numbers of free radicals, which may cause serious damage to lungs and other organs, and in the worst scenario, leads to polyorganised deficiencies and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by classter manifestation, is more likely to affect older people with patologies and pregnant women.
The probability of infection is higher for those who are affected by a large number of viruses or have immune system violations.
According to data studies on the first 425 infections in Mr. Uhan, the calculated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly 3 to 7 days.
However, the study of 1,0999 cases showed that the incubation period in the mean was three days, and the discount was between 0 and 24 days.
The later described study based on demographic data of 8 866 cases showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3,–7,2) of the day.
It is important for healthcare authorities to adjust the quarantine time limits for the most precise incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus by those infected with diseases without symptoms.
A 14-day quarantine was generally practiced for persons who had contacts with the virus or virus infected.
Should the quarantine be extended up to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often a high temperature, which can be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, breathing difficulty, muscle pain, headblood, headache, throat pain, moor, breast pain, diarrhoea, toughness and wheat.
Some patients had a breath and (or) hypoxia observed a week after the start of the disease.
In difficult cases, disease has progressed quickly, and patients have developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with high temperature and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be checked on the virus for early diagnosis, even if there are no patologies on chest cell photos.
The demographic study carried out at the end of December 2019 identified the following symptom dissemination rates: 98% high temperature, 76% dry cough, 55% drying and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients required lung ventilation.
Similar results have been obtained through two recent studies of family infections and transmission of virus from unsymptomic infected.
Compared results were obtained in 2012 in an MERS-CoV study with high temperature (98%), dry cough (47%) and breath (55%).
However, 80 per cent of them were required of artificial lung ventilation, which was much higher than the COVID-19 patients, and it corresponded to a higher rate of mortality than the COVID-19.
ERS patients also had diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%).
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high temperature (99 to 100%), dry cough (29-75%), breath (40-42%), diarrhoea (2-25%) and throat pain (13-25%), while the artificial light ventilation requires 14-20% of patients.
At 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2 per cent and the total number of world confirmed cases was 66,576.
In comparison with this, the death rate of SARS to November 2002 was 10 per cent of 8 096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, the demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed the mortality of 37 per cent of 2 494 confirmed cases.
According to early studies, the basic reproduction indicator (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 at 95 per cent confidential interval (CI) within 5.71 to 7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only from 2 to 4.
SARS-CoV-2 comparison with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV on symptoms, mortality level and R0 are listed in Table 1.1.
The above indicators indicate the higher capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to be distributed compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate in the case of infection of a new virus below compared to the last two.
Thus, the sustainability of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will be much more difficult than the epidemic of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The cluster manifestation is often infected within one family or group of people gathered together for any reason or at any transport, such as cruise aircraft.
Patients frequently traveled to Mr. Uhan or to other affected regions, lived there or contacted infected or with patients during the last two weeks before the start of the disease.
However, according to the reports, people may be victims of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and the healed patients, who have been left the hospital, may again become viral bearers, which is an alarming signal to extend the quarantine term.
At the early stage, patients have normal or lower numbers of lymphocytes (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,0999 patients with COVID-19 have established lymphopes with Leucocytes 4x109/L, including the levels of leucocytes 1×109/L, as well as an increased levels of aminotransferase and viruses.
Some patients found increased levels of liver, muscle enzymes and mioglobin, and most patients experienced increased levels of C-reactive protein and blood-related eritrocytes.
Patients with severe illness, D-dimer levels, fibrine declines present in the blood were increased, and the lymphocytes were constantly reduced.
Most of the patients with COVID-19 in the rentgenography of the breast cell have been found in the patologies characterized by inequality darkness from both sides or the darkness of the type of " math glass " in the lungs.
Patients are often developing atipical pneumonia, acute injury of lungs and acute respiratory disease (ADR).
In the development of the ERF, uncontrolled fuel, fluid and progressive fibrose have led to substantial gas exchange violations.
The dysfunction of types I and II shall reduce the level of surface-activated connections and increase the surface pressure, thus reducing the ability of light people to expand and increase the risk of falling in lungs.
Thus, the worst results of rentgenography are often in conformity with the most difficult cases of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the removal of pneumocytes, the formation of gyaline membranes and the intertaneous lymphocytary infiltration, and the multinuclear syncital cells in the light patients who have died from disease are in accordance with the pathology of virus infection and ORS and similarly found patients with SARS and MERS.
The main criterion for COVID-19 diagnostication was used by the method of detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA through a polymerous chain reaction with reverse transcryptase (PRC with reverse transcryptase).
However, taking into account the high level of false negative results that can accelerate the rate of epidemic development, since 13 February 2020, China began to diagnosis based on clinical manifestations (not only on the PRC with reverse transcryption).
Similarly, the SARS diagnostication situation was similar.
Thus, for effective diagnostication, it is critical and necessary to combine the history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and rentgenography results.
On 14 February 2020, the team of experts under the leadership of Mr. Feng Zhang described the SHERLOCK Method based on CRISPR for the discovery of SARS-CoV-2; this method allows the synthetic fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 RNAs with the density of 20 × 10-18 mol/l to 200 × 10-18 mol/l (1-100 copies per microliter) with less than an hour without the use of complex equipment.
This new methodology, if it is successful in clinical medicinal products, may significantly increase the sensitivity of the tests and the convenience of them.
Because of the lack of experience in opposition to previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can mainly provide only supportive therapy to COVID-19 patients, while trying to use any therapy methods used or proposed for treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other virus diseases (table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antiviral medicinal products, immune suppressors, steroids, plasmas of treated patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of healed patients was proposed for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are rushing to develop antibodies and vaccines to combat the virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks primarily the lungs and may at least affect other organs exposing ACE2 such as stomach and kidneys.
However, infringement of the work and refusal of respiratory organs are the main threat and cause of the death of patients.
Thus, for the relief of symptoms and rescue of life, it is critical to support the respiratory function, including the overall oxygen therapy, the delivery of high oxygen concentrations, the non-invasive artificial ventilation and the invasive lung ventilation which is designed according to the difficulty of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporal membrane oxigenation (ECMO), a modified extrapopulatory blood treatment method used to treat the risk of heart or breathing insufficiency.
Furthermore, the important importance for patients with SARS-CoV-2 is to maintain a water salt balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as the protection of the functions of vital organs.
It is known that cytokine storm is due to the hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected by SARS and MERS.
Cytokine storm is the form of a systemic inflammatory process developing in response to the series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFN and ICP-1.
These cytokines provoke immunities to an enormous quantity of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of the ERF and the polyorganized deficiencies.
In the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in severe condition, the immunity is essential.
The cytokine storm was used by corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monochlonic antibodies that served as an interlejkin inhibitor-6.
Other methods for the treatment of cytokine storm based on immune impairment include the modulation of immune reactions aimed at control of T cells; the IFN, IL-1 and TNF cytokine production blockade; the janus kinaza pressure; the use of blinatumomab, cytokine signals 4 and histondeacetalasis inhibitors.
In order to reduce the severity of the impact of the inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immune suppressors.
However, steroids in high doses do not benefit from the treatment of severe injury to the patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly deteriorate the forecast.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended to be used with caution to treat patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of the document, there is no confirmed effective antiviral therapy.
However, the internal introduction of the remdecivir, a nucleotic analog, has been effectively treated by an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a recently developed antivirus medicine, initially developed by the Gilead company to treat the diseases caused by Ebola and the Marbour virus.
Later, the remdesivir also demonstrated the possibility of accumulation of other viruses from the Universal RNA, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these data, the Gilead provided China's medicinal product for couple studies in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are eagerly expected.
Furthermore, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ritonavir were proposed as possible options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhoea, toughness, mutilation, liver loss and other side effects.
It should be careful to monitor the interaction of these medicinal products with other medicines designated to patients.
Plasma of healed patients and antibodies
Blood remedies have been used for the treatment of other patients suffering from the same disease or for the protection of healthy people for a long time.
In fact, the blood of the healed patients often contains relatively high antibodies to combat patogen.
The antityles are in the immunoglobulin produced by B-limphocites to combat pathogenics and other alien objects; they recognise individual patogen molecules and neutralize them addressedly.
Based on this prerequisite, the plasma was allocated from the blood samples of a group of patients healed from COVID-19, which was subsequently introduced to 10 severely ill patients.
During 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the acuteness and virus burden, and oxygen saturation increased.
However, in order to offer a massive use of this method prior to specific therapy, verifications and explanations have not yet been carried out.
In addition, taking into account the therapeutic effect, some of the plasma-related deficiencies should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can excessively stimulate the immune system and cause the cytokine emission syndrome, which, given the toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the plasma for the treatment of patients in critical state is required much.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to overcome the global epidemic.
Thus, more important and more practically, to allocate the B cells of healed patients and to determine the genetic code of effective antibodies or to carry out a record to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
So we can move to the mass production of antibodies immediately.
The Chinese have been using traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases for thousands of years.
However, its efficiency is significantly dependent on the combination of multiple components of the formula, which is different according to the diagnostic of the disease based on Chinese traditional medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have uncertain action, since the allocation and verification of these components or their optimum combination is difficult.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific therapy of COVID-19, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatment methods for patients with light and medium symptoms or for patients who are healing after a severe phase of disease.
For example, the capsules of Shu Feng Jie Du and Lang Hua Cin Wen (Lian Hua Qing Wen) were considered effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The largest share of the healed patients with COVID-19 was observed in a number of provinces of China, in which Chinese traditional medicine was used in the treatment of 87% of patients, including in Ghansa (63.7%), Ninsa (50%) and Junan (50%), while only about 30% of patients with COVID-19 were identified in the province of Hubai, where Chinese traditional medicine was used for treatment (13%).
However, this is a sufficiently rough comparison, as the assessment should take into account the number of other influence factors, such as the number of patients and the extent of the severity of their disease.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published research materials, which compared treatment exclusively from Western medicine and combined treatment on Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine methods.
They found that the periods of normalization of body temperature, the elimination of symptoms and medical assistance in the condition of the stationary have been less than in patients whose treatment was used in the combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicinal products than in patients treated only on Western methods.
The most surprising is the fact that the percentage of patients who have had a deterioration of symptoms (from the light to severe) was noted below in the group treated by combining Western and Chinese traditional medicines than the group treated only by Western methods (7.4 per cent compared to 46.2 per cent), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than the second (8.8% compared to 39 per cent).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more carefully controlled studies conducted in a larger and larger number of regions.
A certain interest is also to be given as possible to describe the mechanism of action and to explain the aspects of the effectiveness of components used in Chinese traditional medicine methods or combining them.
Patients suspected or confirmed the existence of COVID-19 are mostly aware of a severe fear of acute and even mortal disease, and people who are quarantine-closed are also bored, loneliness and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxie and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as corticosteroids, may cause further anxiety and psychological stress.
Early stages of the disease caused by SARS reported a number of psychiatric diseases, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychiatric excitement, psychotic symptoms, deliria, and even suicidal behavior.
The mandatory monitoring of contacts and quarantine in the number of measures taken by the healthcare authorities to sustain the COVID-19 epidemic may increase the anxiety and guilt of the dissemination of infection, quarantine and social clay on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric assistance should be provided to patients with COVID-19, suspected and contacted, as well as to all the other people they need.
In the context of psychological support, multi-proficial Psychiatric Assistance Brigade should be formed, clearly informed with regular and accurate updates of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and the treatment plans and use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in interrupting the transmission chain from animal carriers of infection and infected persons to perceptive hosts and are often used in addition to the antiviral therapy used to sustain epidemic caused by new viruses.
The establishment of vaccines was carried out on the basis of S-protein aimed at developing long-term and high-active neutralizing antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
Animal studies have developed live weak vaccines from SARS viruses.
However, prior to the start of clinical studies, the effectiveness of these possible vaccines should be determined under natural conditions when they are used in aged patients, the model of infecting death doses and the degree of protection against the infection of zootic viruses.
Perhaps the fact that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and since then no new case has been reported.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of the disease caused by MERS, which are born in the Middle East and spread into other regions through the preservation of endemic zoo sources.
In order to combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using an inactivated virus, DNA plasmide, viral vectors, nano particles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein elements, and some of these strategies have been assessed on animals.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune persons is an immediate and critical challenge that requires a decision to sustain an epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties caused by a long term (in average 18 months) necessary for the development of vaccine and dynamic change of coronavirus.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 only begins to demonstrate a complete clinical course of disease by thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to gradually recover without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with the high frequency of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
As a result, it is crucial for healthcare bodies to draw up a prognostic model of disease to identify the priorities of the measures taken, especially in areas where there are lack of resources.
Based on the data of the clinical studies presented at the current time, the following factors may affect the prediction of the flow of disease in patients with COVID-19 or be associated with it (table 33):
Age: The age was the most important factor in predicting the flow of the disease caused by the SARS virus, which was also the truth in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 is mainly affected by patients aged 30 to 65, 47.7 per cent of whom are over 50, according to the above-mentioned study, 8 866 cases.
Patients who have demanded intense therapy were more likely to have original diseases and complications, and they were much older than those who had not required such therapy (average 66 years to 51 years), which demonstrated that age was a prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: Infection of SARS-COV-2 among men higher than among women (0.31/100 000 against 0.27/100 000), as mentioned above.
Disease and complications: patients with COVID-19 who need intensive therapy are above the probability of acute miocard and arrhythmia damage.
Cardiological phenomenons were also the main cause of the death of SARS patients.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 could also be linked to ACE2 positive holangiocytes, which could cause the infringement of liver work in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and original diseases are closely linked and can distort results.
The deviations identified in laboratory studies: the level of the C-reaction protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to be considered as a potential prognosis factor in the flow of disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
It was also proposed to take into account the relationship between the P-reactive protein, the severity of the disease and the projection of COVID-19.
Furthermore, the results can be foreseen by increased levels of laktatdehydrogenase, aparagin aminotransferases, alanin-aminotransferases and creatinkinasis.
These enzymes in large quantities are allocated by different organs, especially with heart and baking, and their emissions occur when the tissues are damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Basic clinical symptoms: for the prognose of results and complications in the treatment of COVID-19 and other factors, rentgenographic studies of the breast cell and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account.
The use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immune suppressors used widely in infectious diseases as an additional therapy to reduce the weight of the inflammatory process.
Since corticosteroids have been widely used for the treatment of patients with severe forms of SARS, many survivors have developed avascular osteonecrosis, resulting in life disability and low quality of life.
Thus, if necessary, steroids to treat patients with COVID-19 should be appointed in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, many patients suffer from unexpected severe stress, because they often have to endure long quarantine periods, deal with high degrees of uncertainty and observe the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
In order to eliminate the stress of such patients and help them to return to normal life, psychological consultations must be held and long-term support.
According to the demographic studies, the COVID-19 epidemic is apparently different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replicating in lower respiratory routes, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as other coronavirus caused by normal cold diseases, can be successfully reproduced in the upper respiratory paths and cause weak symptoms or do not cause symptoms at the early stage of infection.
For this reason, those patients who have early or have not finished the incubation period may, in their ordinary life, distribute the virus significantly, which is significantly difficult for the epidemiological control.
However, the transmission of the SARS-CoV virus was considered to occur when patients were severely ill, while most of the early infections were not infected.
Thus, today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it is more difficult to control.
There is now a great work in China, in which a universal quarantine was declared in Mr. Uhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the quarantine regime has been extended practically for the entire population introduced to stop the SARS-CoV-2 spread chain.
While these measures have a huge injury to the economy and other areas of life, the number of new patients detected is reduced, which indicates the slowdown of the rate of epidemic dissemination.
On the most optimistic accounts, the explosion of the disease will end by March, and the silence phase will take three to four months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter, with his colleagues, estimated that the COVID-19, which seemed much more infectious than the SARS, would not end in 2020.
Students from the group headed by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) made a model to predict the end of the epidemic and assumed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two thirds of the world's population.
The Canadian Professional Group reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was discovered in nose and throat brackets taken from patients healed and expelled from hospitals two weeks earlier, which indicates that a new virus could become a cycle of similar flu.
However, reducing the number of new cases in China encouraging that the strategies currently applied may have had the effect.
According to initial forecasts, the fever of Ebola had to affect up to a million people and become the cause of half a million patients.
However, the strict quarantine and isolation of diseases have finally been controlled.
There is a possibility that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the infectious capability of SARS-CoV-2 will be weakened, and with time it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that is compatible with a human.
The comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemic (ris. 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by high speed of coughing or sneaking, as well as perhaps through direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus was also discovered in the collision, which means that there was also an orally-effective way of transmission.
According to one of the recent studies, 41% of the 138 studies may have been infected in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously detected diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Thus, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, relatives, colleagues, and even foreign contacts with patients or infected.
The first line of defence in combating the risk of infection is the massage for the person; and surgical masks, and N95 Respirators (series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
The surgery masks do not allow microcaps to fluid from potentially infected aircraft and sit on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to the environment.
However, only the masks of class N95 (series No. 1860s) can protect the respiration of virions from 10 to 80 nm, they only miss 5% of the virion; the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as the SARS-CoV, and they are both of approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can even be infiltrated through five joint surgery masks, medical workers who directly contact patients must wear class N95 masks (series No. 1860s) rather than surgery masks.
In addition to masks, medical workers should wear a protective coat on the figure in order to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruss can also fall into the body through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, the physician infected SARS-CoV-2 despite the fact that he was wearing a mask of class N95; perhaps the virus had been infected by his body through the burned eyes.
Therefore, medical workers should also wear transparency face shields or protective glasses of a closed type.
All populations in the affected or potentially threatened regions are urged to launder their hands more frequently by disinfecting means, try not to leave the house with self-isolation and limit contacts with potentially infected people.
Patient's distance is estimated at approximately a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus had not previously been known to mankind, the high degree of its similarity to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, had to become a alarming signal for China, taking into account the experience it gained during the SARS explosion in 2003.
However, only after 19 January 2020, the Director of the Centre for the Control of Diseases in Mr. Uganda reassured citizens, reporting that the new virus has low contamination and limited reproductiveness in transmission from human to humanity and that preventing the spread and control of disease would not be a problem.
This statement has significantly reduced social tension, especially in the period when the whole country was preparing to celebrate the New Year of China, and a critical time was declined when the disease could be held within Mr. Eagle with minimum losses.
China's health authorities can learn this rigorous lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements because each word is taken into account by citizens and may affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) more carefully monitor and respond to unusual information from the clinic, rather than to wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to sustain the potential epidemic in early stages of its development than to calm the public; and (4) to conduct more targeted and effective teachings to enhance the awareness of the population of epidemic diseases and regular verification and improve the system of response of society.
The COVID-19 explosion caused by the previously unexploded coronavirus of a severe acute respiratory syndrome of the second type (SARS-CoV-2) began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease was covered by the entire China, and at the time of the document, it was spread in 50 countries of the world.
Since the virus is very similar to the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the COVID-19 symptoms of the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), the COVID-19 recycling occurred.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are significant in the constraint of the epidemic and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than youth and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and the rate of mortality among elderly is also higher than among youths.
SARS mortality is higher than in the case of COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
The COVID-19 patients distribute the virus even in the unsympathy of disease, while patients with SARS usually infect the environment only in difficult cases of disease, thus preventing the COVID-19 dissemination of more difficult than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 is wider and faster than SARS-CoV.
Some COVID-19 patients may have negative normal samples for RNA SARS-CoV-2.
On the other hand, healed patients can reiterate positive tests on the virus.
This is a significant increase in the risk of spreading the virus.
Some of the major issues remain unsolved on the basis of such rapid promotion of COVID-19 studies, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96 per cent homologist between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronavirus of flag mice, we still cannot claim that the infection of SARS-CoV-2 has been infected by smooth mouses.
What animal has become a intermediate species transmitting the virus from the original master, such as flying mice to human?
Without awareness of the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely interrupt the transmission path, and the epidemiological environment can rise at any time.
Molecular modeling and biochemical samples showed that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to ACE2, but how is the virus introduced into respiratory cells and provoked the following pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with the ACE2 cells in other bodies?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic take?
How does the virus genetically evolve in transmission from human to human?
Will it be the cause of a global pandemic, whether it will disappear as SARS or periodically renew like a flu?
These aspects are primarily important, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other issues.
However, we have no other choice than whatever it is worth to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
Zootic origin of human coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the coronavirus core and their carriers, including people, for millenniums.
Until 2003, two human coronavirus (HCoV) have been known to cause light diseases, such as normal cold.
The explosion of a severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) changed our perception of how catastrophic and dangerous for life can be human coronavirus.
The appearance of a severe severe respiratory syndrome of the second type (SARS-CoV-2) in Central China at the end of 2019 renewed the attention to the coronavirus and surprised us with high transmission, but weakerly expressed patogenity of this virus compared to the SARS-CoV family virus.
The corono-viral infection of a person is a zoonosis, and the understanding of its zootic origin will be very useful.
Most human coronavirus originate from flying mouses for which they are not patogenous.
Some human coronavirs are also known for the intermediate reserves.
Definition of animal carriers directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Studying the interaction of animals who are caronal-virus carriers can also light on the coronavirus pathogenesis of humans.
In this review, we provide available data on seven human coronavirus, focusing on the history of their discovery, as well as their zootic origin and the ways of intervision transfer.
It is important to note that we have comparison and comparison of various human coronavirus in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, today's epidemic of coronavirus found in 2019 (CIVID-19).
Furthermore, the conditions necessary for successful change in the carriers and the impact of the virus on the severity of the disease.
The coronavirus refers to the Coronavidae family, which represents a group of shell viruses with a positive-polar RNC thread.
These viruses with the largest PNC-containing genome containing 26 to 32,000 nucleotics have received a name by their form that is like the crown when dealing with electronic microscope.
In terms of the structure, coronavirus contains unsegmented genomes with an identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large partially open-closing calculation frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into polyprotein replications pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins marked as nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains the open calculation framework for structured proteins, including the shifted protein (S), the shell protein (E), the membrane protein (M) and the nucleoprotein (N).
Other coronavirus lines are also encoded by a number of specific accessor proteins.
On the basis of differences in protein sequences\ coronaviruss are divided into four species (alpha, beta, gamma and deltacorononavirs), while the type of betacorononavirs includes the majority of human coronavirs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There are philogenetic evidence that the genetic source of the majority of alpha and betacorononavirs are flipping mouses and hungers, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and deltacorononavirs.
For thousands of years, the coronavirus has constantly overcome intervision barriers, and some of them have evolved to the dangerous human pathogens.
Seven human coronaviruss are known for today.
These include human alphacorononavirs HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The remaining five betacorononavirs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the cronavir of a severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), the coronavir of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and the cronavir of the severe severe respiratory syndrome of the second type of SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronavirus HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause symptoms of light form, such as cold and (or) diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV viruses, MERS-CoV and recently detected SARS-CoV-2 are extremely pathogenic, causing severe infectious respiratory diseases in relatively larger numbers of patients with higher respiratory probability to develop acute respiratory disease (ORS) and intravenous symptoms.
The first string of the human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample separated from the nosorogue of patients who were cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive studies have accumulated more detailed knowledge of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause local infection symptoms.
Indeed, before the explosion of a severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that the human coronavirus was considered harmless.
The SARS explosion in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in the current history; more than 8,000 people were over and the total mortality rate was approximately 10 per cent.
Ten years later, the explosion of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic in the Arab Peninsula, while the disease was rapidly spread into the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed as SARS-CoV-2, was a stimulator of the current coronavirus infection epidemic 2019 (COVIID-19), which had taken over 3 120 lives as of 3 March 2020, and the number of infected had exceeded 91,000 people.
The alarming signal was received and the world should be prepared for the coming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven human coronavirus have a zoo origin, their sources are flying mouses, mouses or domestic animals.
Many data sets indicate the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronavirus from flying mice, whose organisms have well adapted and in which viruses do not manifest pathogenic properties but demonstrate wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has abandoned China and the world with a severe medical, scientific, social and moral view.
The study of the zoo mechanism for human coronavirus origin will allow them to understand their natural history, the forces of their evolution and the factors limiting intervision.
It may also indicate or accelerate the search for a reservoir, intermediate and amplifying SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent the re-proliferation of disease in the future.
This review contains general information on zoo origin, inter-visual transmission and patogenesis of human coronavirus.
In particular, we mark and consider the following common features: the original viruses of human coronavirus are not usually patogenous for their reserves, but they acquire a pathogenic nature after the intervision of the new carrier.
We also analyze the trend of human coronavirus evolution, which often accompanies the increase in transmission of pathogenic properties.
The result of the current SARS-CoV-2 explosion is also considered in the same context.
Animal coronavirus has been known since the end of the 1930s.
Before B814 HCoV-229E was first obtained from a sample separated from the cold-coated patients, various coronavirs were found from various infected animals, including indians, mouses, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronavirs have been identified in the past decades.
Table 1 presents a brief history of human coronavirus discovery in chronological order.
The first type of HCoV-229E virus was obtained from tests taken from respiratory paths of patients with infectious defeat of upper respiratory paths in 1966; further, the virus adapted to reproduction in the lines of WI-38 lung cells.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had cold symptoms, including headache, sneaking, general illness and throat pain, while high temperature and cough were observed in 10 to 20 per cent of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was selected from organic culture and followed by a serial passage to the brain of the juice.
Clinical signs of infection with HCoV-OC43 appear similar to HCoV-229E virus, whose symptoms are independent from the infection of other respiratory pathogenic pathogenic pathogenics, such as type A influenza and rinovirus.
The HCoV-229E virus and HCoV-OC43 have a widespread spread in the world and are usually transmitted in moderate widths.
Mostly, the incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, and it follows approximately two weeks of disease.
According to volunteers ' research, healthy people infected by HCoV-229E have developed a common cold of light form.
Only a few patients with a weak immunity had a severe infection of lower respiratory paths.
The SARS explosion, also known as “Atipical Pneumonia”, became the first in the history of mankind a well-documented pandemic caused by human coronavirus, and the sickness was the SARS-CoV virus, the third of the identified human coronavirus.
The first case of SARS disease was found at the end of 2002 in the Chinese province of Guandun.
During the SARS epidemic, 8 096 cases of disease and 774 death have been documented, and the disease has been spread in many countries and different continents.
Without the overactive disseminators, it was estimated that each sick person could infect more than two people; the incubation period was between 4 and 7 days, while the pixmap of the virus load was 10 days of the disease.
Patients infected by SARS-CoV were initially affected by muscles, headaches, high temperature, general disabilities and respiration, while breathing, coughing and respiratory disadvantage were reported among later symptoms.
The dissemination of laboratory indicators from the SARS standard is lymphony, liver sampling disorders and increased creatinkinasis.
SARS patients also have difusional alveolar injury, proliferation of epithelial cells and macrophags.
Approximately 20 to 30 per cent of the patients need intensive therapy and the mechanical ventilation of the lungs.
In such difficult cases, the lower respiratory paths can also be infected by other organs, including stomach and renal tracts, livers and kidneys, which are usually accompanied by cytokine storm, which may be flying, especially for patients with weakened immunity.
For the first time, the virus was selected from the open biopsy of the lung relatives who arrived in Hong Kong from Guangjou.
Since then, huge efforts have been aimed at human coronavirus research.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was assigned to a seven-month child from the Netherlands.
At first, it was found that it was primarily impressed by children of younger age, older people and patients with weak immunity and respiratory diseases.
HCoV-NL63 diseases are characteristic for such manifestations as wetness, conjunctivity, high temperature and bronchiolite.
Another independent study describes the extraction of the same virus from the nazal material taken from an eight-month boy from the Netherlands who suffers from pneumonia.
The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but it was actually widespread.
According to the estimates, HCoV-NL63 is the cause of approximately 4.7 per cent of the widespread respiratory diseases, and the peaks caused by their diseases are at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is linked to an obstructive laringite, which is also called a circular.
HCoV-HKU1 was allocated to Hong Kong the same year from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolite.
In addition to inhibition pneumonia and bronchiolite, HCoV-HKU1 associated with the astmatic diseases.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the respiratory diseases of the light form have been identified worldwide.
All these four human coronavirus caused extra-viral infections have been well adapted to humans, and their mutation, involving high pathogenic diseases, is generally unlikely, although the incidents were and their causes were unknown, as a rare example of a more viral HCoV-NL63 subtype, which, according to recent reports, caused a serious infection of lower respiratory pathways in China.
Usually, with the ability to effectively transmit and preserve in the human body, these human coronaviruss become less virtual or pathogeneous.
The coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first assigned to Saudi Arabia in 2012 from a light 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
Most of the laboratory confirmed cases have occurred in the Middle East, but in different European countries and Tunisia, there are cargo cases and dissemination through episodes of secondary infections in close contacts.
Another secondary explosion with 186 confirmed cases took place in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) remind the symptoms of a severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) — for both infections, the progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed a sharp renal insufficiency, which still differs from the other diseases caused by coronavirus transmitted to a person.
Over 30 per cent of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and rip.
As at 14 February 2020, more than 2.500 lably confirmed cases of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome with high mortality (34.4 per cent), therefore MERS-CoV is considered one of the most fatal viruses known to the person.
During the mid-and-end of December 2019, the Hungarian Province Hubai classters of patients with pneumonia were detected, which now connected with the infection caused by the coronavirus of a severe 2rd-type respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization announced that the ongoing infection of lower respiratory paths caused by SARS-CoV-2 was a global emergency in public health, and the disease itself was called “coronavirus infection 19” (CIVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases have been registered in the world, with approximately 3.4 per cent mortality.
It should be noted that the mortality in the Chinese province of Hubai is 4.2 per cent and is 1.2 per cent beyond it.
SARS-CoV-2, like the coronavirus of SARS and MERS, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by temperature, cough and dishes.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most difficult symptoms and is able to quickly become a respiratory disorders syndrome.
Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, taking into account the high homology of nuclear sequences (82%), these viruses, however, form different branches of the philogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but is more capable of transmitting compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The cases of infected in symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 have been registered, showing the ability of this virus to rapidly spread around the world.
As a result of the comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other six human coronavirus, important similarities and differences are shown.
First, the coronavirus transmitted to the person have a similar incubation period and the length of the flow of diseases caused by them.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the same trend as the other six human coronavirus.
Secondly, the COVID-19 symptoms are between SARS-CoV and four human coronavirus caused by extra-bolic infections (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the infection of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that it is commonly observed in human coronavirus caused by extra-bolic infections, including non-specific symptoms, light symptoms, or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infected, a small subgroup of difficult cases can be allocated to COVID-19, although the ratio is a little below.
Thirdly, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also notes the interesting standards characterized both for human coronavirus that cause extra-bolic infections and for SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least the same high as the human coronavirus caused by extra-bolic infection.
On the other hand, it is still necessary to verify whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 with every subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e. infection of each person), as in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as other human coronavirus caused extra-bolic infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the cala samples.
We still have to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral path of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
The issue of possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, which is characteristic of human coronavirus that cause extra-bolic infection.
However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 explosion will depend on the SARS-CoV-2 characteristics, including transmission, pathogenicness and sustainable dissemination after human transition.
All four human coronavirus caused infection with light form symptoms have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, they may have adapted well to these four human coronavirus.
In other words, those and others could be referred to as the only survivors after the pandemic of human coronavirus in the past.
Human coronavirus that cause severe diseases in people and people with human coronavirus cause severe diseases simply failed to survive.
In order to do so, human coronavirus should be replied in the human body sufficiently to accumulate adaptive mutations that contradict the limitation of the carrier.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 explosion will be extended and the more people will be infected, the more the chance that the virus is fully adapted to the person.
If it is adapted well, its transfer to humans will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other activities to control infectious diseases.
For many years, four extrabolic coronavirs have circulated in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require animal reservoir.
The high-coated coronavirus of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not adapt well to a person, and their transfer to humans could not be supported.
They need to remain and reproduce in their zoo reserves and look for a case of affecting human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or enhanced carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics as SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV extra-bolic viruses.
It is very easily transmitted as HCOV outside the hospital, at least now.
But it is more pathogenic than HCoV non-HC, and less pathogeneous than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to see whether it is adapted fully to a person and whether it will circulate in human environment without a reservoir or with a intermediate animal bearer.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, we will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutional, natural, intermediate, enhanced and reserved HCV viruses.
The animal is an evolutionary host of HCoV, if it transmits a close-born ancestor from the same high homology at the sequence of Nucleotides.
The ancestor virus is usually well adapted and unpatogenous in this carrier.
Similarly, the reservoir carries HCoV permanently for a long time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural HCoV or its parental virus.
Unlike this, if HCoV was only put into the intermediate carrier before or about the time it was brought to the person, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and often patogenized.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoo source of human infection and play the role of a stronger carrier, allowing the virus to replicate and then transmit it to people, increasing the scale of human infection.
HCoV may endure a tumor infection if it cannot endure the transmission within the intermediate carrier.
On the contrary, HCoV viruses can also adapt to the intermediate carrier and even establish long-term endemicness.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reservoir.
Epidemiological data have retrospectively indicated that the SARS zero patient had anonymous contact with hunter-industrial animals (wild).
Further studies of serum prevalence show that animals have the proliferation of IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV virus above compared to populations as a whole.
The Himalayian civetes (Paguma larvata) and the one-wide dog on the living animals markets have become the first established virus operators, similar and almost identical SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that, after the destruction of all the civic on the SARS markets, no more was reported.
At the same time, it was reported that Himalayian civets living in nature or on farms without markets were not defined in most cases that allowed to conclude that the Himalayian civetes could serve only as a intermediate enhancing carrier, not a natural reserve of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that since 80 per cent of different animals in Guangjou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, there is no way to exclude the probability that the intermediate carriers can also serve numerous types of small peanuts.
All of them seem to be tramped with the SARS-CoV virus.
The subsequent search for a natural animal carrier SARS-CoV revealed a close-born CoV flying mice, which was called the atipical pneumonia coronavirus of HKU3 subcutaneous flying mouses (SARRRRH-BatCoV HKU3) and which is present in Chinese subcutaneous flying mouses.
These mouses are positive for the antibodies of SARS-CoV and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other flying mouse coronaviruss have 88 to 92 per cent the same homology of nucleotic sequences as SARS-CoV.
These studies found the foundations of the new concept that the flying mouses became the bearers of new human patogens.
A number of SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) have also been identified but none other than one that marks WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
It is known that the SARS-CoV receptor is a human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1, obtained from a sample of flying mice, used ACE2 flying mouses, cyvity and human as a cell receptor.
Interestingly, sulphurs of healing patients with SARS could have neutralized WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest relative ancestor of SARS-CoV in flying mouses, dividing 95 per cent of the homology of nuclear sequences.
Despite high homology between these two viruses, it is generally considered that WIV1 is not a direct parental SARS-CoV virus, and the flying mouses are not a direct reserved SARS-CoV.
The Filogenetic Analysis applies to the same group as CoV-HKU4 flying mouses and CoV-HKU5 flying mouses.
CoV-HKU4 flying mouse and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptildipeptidaze-4 (DPP4) to invade viruses.
The RNC-dependent RNA polymeration of the MERS-CoV virus philogeneticly closer to the betacorononavir sequences identified in Europe and Africa.
Still no live MERS-CoV virus has been found in wild flying mouses.
The homology of the ERS-CoV sequences and its nearest CoV-HKU25 coincidence conforms only to 87 per cent.
I mean, flying mouses may not be a direct reservoir of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, research in the Middle East showed that the single-arbitrary camels were positive to the neutralized antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as well as to the camels of the Middle East in many African countries.
A live MERS-CoV, an identical virus found in humans, has been selected from nazal mass of single berries, which further reaffirms the role of the camels as the true merc-CoV reservoirs.
It is also worth noting that there were minor symptoms, but massive virus-generation, of camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that infected camels have allocated the virus not only in a respiratory way but also in a fecal oral way, which is also the main way to allocate the virus to flying mouses.
However, there are still issues, since many of the confirmed cases of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome had no contact with camels before the symptoms occurred and were likely to be transmitted to a person or to transmit unknown channels including unspecified animal species that were the mercury-CoV.
The homology of SARS-CoV-2 by 96.2 per cent corresponds to the CoV RaTG13 flying mouses allocated by Asian subcutaneous Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the diversgence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to associate parental relations with them.
I mean, flying mouses could not be a direct residue of SARS-CoV-2 unless nearly identical coronavirs of flying mouses are found in the future.
Probably, the direct animal bearers of the SARS-CoV-2 should be among wild species sold and deteriorated in the sea-product market in the Swan, with many of the initial cases of COVID-19, which indicates the possibility of transfer from the animal.
Several recent studies, based on metagenom sequence, have concluded that the group threatened to destroy small peanuts known as pangolines (Manis javanica), could also carry a parent betacorononavir, a family of SARS-CoV-2.
The homology of the sequences of these new pangolinic coronavirus genomes is 85 to 92 per cent compatible with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely linked to RaTG13, and the identity at the level of nuclear sequences is approximately 90 per cent.
They are classified in two realities of the distribution of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in a philogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-related domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with the identical sequence of amino acids at 97.4 per cent.
On the contrary, the RSD of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more different, despite the higher degree of homology of sequences throughout the genome.
In early studies, the diseased pangolins also reported the definition of virus contigations in lung tests that have been similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study applied other methods of collection and manual processing to obtain genome sequence, which includes approximately 86.3 per cent of the full-dimensional virus genome.
It is not possible to exclude that the pangolin has become one of the intermediate SARS-CoV-2 animals.
However, due to the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin betacoronous viruses, relative SARS-CoV-2, there is no evidence at present in support of the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and betacorononavirs of pangolin related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been established in flying mouses, pangolins and other syringes.
While the highest homology of sequences was found in RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and betacorononavirs of pangolins, related SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, the highest homology of sequences within the entire genome.
Very theoretically, a high degree of similarity between pangolin betacoronous viruses, relative SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is related to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal is a recombination between the betacoronovir of pangolines, the relative of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As the evolutionary power, the recombination is widely widespread among betacorononavirs.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoo origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to high pathogenic HCoV viruses, the zootic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 is also studied.
Filogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E can come from flying mice coronavirus, while parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 are found from glooders.
It was reported that the coronavirus of flying mouses called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected by a North American three-colour-colour communities demonstrated a close relative to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E genetically linked to another coronavirus of flying mouses called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was suspicion that its intermediate carrier could also be a camel.
For clarity, modern knowledge of animal origin of known coronavirus is summarized in drawing 1 and in table 2.
The philogenetic analysis has demonstrated the events of the inter-visual transmission of HCoV in an anamesis.
When about 1890 the intervision of the HCV-OC43 virus was transmitted and people were infected with domestic animals, the pandemic of respiratory infection was registered.
The history of the inter-visual transmission of HCoV-229E is not so clear.
Alphacoronavirs of flying mice were discovered, near-born HCoV-229E.
There is an alphacorononavir alpaka.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from flying mice to a person.
First of all, people, not alpaci, could contact flying mouses in a common environmental thread.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the alpacs.
Secondly, the alphacorononavirs of flying mice, relative to HCoV-229E, are variety of mice, while alphacorononavir alpaki caused a respiratory disease infected animals.
Finally, alphacoronavir alpaki has not been found in wild animals.
Thus, it is not possible to exclude the probability that alpacians have received an alphacorononavir, a relative HCoV-229E, from humans.
In fact, flying mouses are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the virus of rage, the Ebola virus, Nipach virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the flying mouse could directly transmit HCoV-229E to people.
On the other hand, while the alphacoronavirs of flying mouses could serve the HCoV-229E genetic pulp, alpaci and single-arbitrary camels could be intermediate carriers that transmit viruss to people, just as in the case of MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of inter-visual transmission from flying muscles to single welves and one-rbs to a man.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from flying mouses is known by its original identification and then confirmed by follow-up studies.
Apparently, flying mouses provide a rich pulp of virus varieties for inter-specific exchange of gene fragments and intervision transfers.
The long-term, dense settlements, close social interaction and the ability to fly make flying mouses “perfect spreaders”.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to single cabbages a decade ago.
He has adapted well to these camels, which have become a stable and natural tanker from the intermediate carrier.
These animals have an MERS-CoV virus of very light disease and have relatively low frequency of mutations.
His episode to the person is a coincidence, and the person remains a mercury measuring merc-coV because its transfer is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transfer of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if there is, is different in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In particular, the betacorononavirs of pangolins are highly pathogeneous in pangolins.
They may be beauty bearers of betacorononavirs, related SARS-CoV-2, as well as civilians in the case of SARS-CoV.
The future studies need to confirm or exclude several inter-visual transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to a person.
First, flying mouses can be a reservoir for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical SARS-CoV-2.
People can share the environmental nit with flying mouses by means of a view or a separation of these animals.
Secondly, the pangolines may be one of the intermediate enhancing devices in which a relative SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently been affected.
People are infected by a separator of towels and eating meat of wild animals.
It is quite possible that many animals, including households, are perceptive to SARS-CoV-2.
The survey of domestic and wild animals on antibodies is justified.
Thirdly, as indicated above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could occur in a third form that contacted both flying mouses and pangolins.
The search for animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to various animal types, three major factors from the virus have also contributed to crossing inter-vision barriers.
First of all, they are relatively high in the replication of RNA mutations.
In comparison with other viruses with the Universal RNA, the calculated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered “a moderate-high” with a medium frequency replacement of approximately 10 to 4 replacements per year in one section 2 depending on the adaptation phase of the coronavir to new hosts.
Coronaviruss have a corrective exoribonuclease, which leads to an extremely high frequency of mutation and weakness or even unlife.
Interestingly, the nucleotic analog of Remdesivir suppressed the replication of coronavirus through the inhibition of this exoribonucleasis and the RNC-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising means against SARS-CoV-2 to be checked during clinical studies.
Nevertheless, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is nearly a million times higher than their carriers.
Furthermore, the frequency of mutation may often be even higher if the coronavirs are not well adapted to the carrier.
In comparison to SARS-CoV with high frequency of mutation, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently below, which indicates a higher level of adaptation to humans.
This virus has probably already adapted to another human-looking bearer.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, well adapted to single-cutting camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that vaccines and antivirus medicines from SARS-CoV-2 will quickly lose their efficiency as a result of the genetic drift.
Secondly, the large RNA genome in coronaviruss has increased plastic modification in the genome modification of mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the probability of inter-vision co-evolution that is favourable for new coronaviruss to occur under the relevant conditions.
This contributes to the numerous unique opening frameworks for the reading and functions of proteins encoded in the 3′ end of the genome.
Thirdly, thanks to the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronavirs randomly and often switch matrices during the replication of the RNA.
During the transcryption of the DNA of the coronavirus in a mixed vessel, there is often a switching of threads.
High-economic full-dimensional and subgenomic RNAs can recombinate and create new coronavirus.
Filogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and in animal coronavirs such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 flying mouses.
Interaction with the transmission virus
In addition to the three above-mentioned virus factors, another key factor important for inter-type transfer is the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor.
The article as a typical example, which also demonstrates a positive selection in the event of inter-wide transfer, provides the SARS-CoV recombination.
On the basis of a comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV and civilians, it is considered that SARS-CoV has a rapid adaptation in various carriers, especially with regard to mutations on RSD protein S.
In general, the RSD protein S of the coronavirus interactions with the cell receptor, and the response of the carrier's antibody is intensely choosing it.
RSD of SARS-CoV are amino acids, with 318th to 510th, on S1 part, which links the virus to the cell with angiotensive enzyme 2 (APF2) of human and its coreceptors.
RSD of the SARS-CoV virus is capable of recognizing APF2 different animals, including flying mouse, civilians, mouses and one-wide dogs, making possible inter-visual transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found in RSD, which differed from human virus and cyvites, and 4 of them were in the connecting receptor motive for interaction with the APF2.
SARS-CoV civetes have K479N and S487T mutations in RSD, which may increase the affinity of the interaction of the squirrel protein with the human APF2.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be particularly important to adapt the virus to the human.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S leads to a change in the linking protein S to human APF2.
Indeed, a study with the cryoelectronic microscope indicates that the affinity of this connection is 10-20 times higher than between the APF2 human and the S protein of the SARS-CoV virus.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other correspondents are required to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
It is surprising that HCoV-NL63 is also linked to APF2, but to another part of the protein S.
There are many other HCoV receptors such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetyl acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronavirus in people after inter-visual transfer from animals.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of the inter-wide transmission of HCoV is also managed by other factors of dependency and limitation.
The divergence of these proteins between humans and natural reservoirs of HCoVs, such as smooth mouses, single-derb camels and hungers, may be a barrier for intervision transfer.
In order to successfully transmit the HCoV viruses, the factors of dependency have to be auxilised and subject to the limitation of the carriers.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the bearer still need to be defined and categoryd.
Good results can provide an impartial full-genome determination of the dependency and restriction of carriers for SARS-CoV-2 through the latest CRISPR technology.
New HCoV emergence: back to zero mark
The diversity of flying mice coronavirus creates a wide range of opportunities for new HCoV.
In this sense, the coronavirus of flying mice are a genetic pool for HCoV.
Furthermore, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the force of HCoV evolution and are two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has a potential for radical modification of virus phenotypes.
Accessor protein SARS-CoV is considered important for human adaptation by ORF8, since the Flying Mice viruses, the SARS-CoV relatives, were isolated, but it is established that they have coded different ORF8 proteins.
A 29-nucleoid delegation was found in the isolation of human epidemic, which was characterized by the coronavirus of SARS-CoV.
This delegation breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is considered to be a adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of the bearers.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha and gammacorononavir lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant stakeholders have been identified in the RNC-dependent PRC.
The localization of the recombination was also defined in non-structural proteins nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, the epidemic MERS-CoV had been subjected to recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in the single-crowd camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoV, where HCoV recombined with other animal coronaviruss in its non-structural genes.
It is also necessary to warn that the artificial selection can contribute to uninterested changes in virus genomes, which is likely due to the elimination of the virus from selective pressures, for example, by the immune system of the carrier.
Example of these effects is the loss of a full-dimensional ORF4 in the prototype HCoV-229E through a binucleotic delegation.
While an intact open frame of ORF4 can be observed in flat mouse and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alphacorononavir alpaka demonstrates a single-nucleotic insert, which leads to a movement of the framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoV is also due to the pressure of selecting on their reservoirs.
Infected by flying coronaviruss, weakly expressed symptoms or absence of them have been registered, which indicates mutual adaptation between coronavirus and flying mouses.
It turns out that flying mouses are anatomically and physically adapted to coronavirus.
For example, inflammatory response deficiencies in flying mouses effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronavirus.
Furthermore, the natural activity of homicide cells in flying mouse cells has been suppressed by the inhibitor receptor of NKG2/CD94 natural killers and the low level of the expression of the main hypercompatibility complex of Class I.
Furthermore, the high level of active oxygen, which is provided with high metabolic activity of flying mouses, may suppress the replication of the coronavirus, at the same time affecting the reading of the exoribonucleasis, thus creating the selection pressure for the generation of virus stams that are high-patogenous when entering the new carrier.
The more pathogenic coronavirus can also evolve due to the recombination, which leads to acquisition of new proteins or protein properties for the adaptation of the carrier.
Thus, it is not accidental that three new human coronavirus have appeared in the last 20 years.
Coronaviruss are non-patogenetic or have light symptoms in their reservoirs, such as flying mouses or camels.
They are confidently replicated without a strong immune response from the bearer.
This is the secret why we see non-symbols and which causes severe human infection.
The severe symptoms are mainly related to hyperactivation of immune response and cytokine storm, with immune response as much as possible, more seriously the loss of light.
On the contrary, immune response to the replication of the coronavirus is not compromised by the non- symptoms.
The same strategy of immune response may have favourable effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
Flying mouses have a strong interferon response.
Thus, the adoption of an interferon I of type, at least at the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2, should be a favourable effect.
Furthermore, the activation of NLRP3-inflammasom has been violated by flying mouses.
The inhibition of NLRP3-inflammasom through MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The development of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general scheme of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While the betacorononavir was found by flying mice, the nucleotic homology of which 95 per cent corresponds to SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus of flying mouses, the nucleotic homology of which corresponds to 96 per cent of SARS-CoV-2.
Although it was found that the civetes and other animals on the market were transmitted by viruses, identical SARS-CoV were not established directly for SARS-CoV-2.
The betacorononavirs of pangolin, impressively homological SARS-CoV-2, indicated that the pangolines could serve as one of the intermediate carriers or that fragments of betacorononavir genes of pangolin could enter the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intended or accidentally created by a person.
The coronavirus has drawn general attention because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 explosion.
Study of coronavirus in flying mouses and other animals dramatically changed our perception of the importance of zoo origin and animal reservoirs of HCoV in human transfer.
Convincing evidence showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were made from flying mouses and were transferred to a person through intermediate mediators.
If the SARS-CoV infection comes from the contact between people and civilians on the market, the closure of the wildlife markets and destruction of the civete could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the opening of various betacoronovir lines of pangolines, close-born SARS-CoV-2, the pangolins should be removed in order to prevent zoo transmission of infection from product markets.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to a person through pangolins and other syringemen and how this may remain the task of future studies.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in single-crowd camels.
These camels are an important vehicle, as well as the main source of meat, milk, skin and waist products for the local population.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and in Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control the MERS, as it was done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the periodic explosions of MERS, an integrated approach should be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels combined with other infectious control measures.
Since we can't remove these viruses, new genotypes may occur, caused by illness.
The world circulate various zoo-coronous viruses.
Especially variety of coronavirus of flying mice with zoo capacities.
There are huge opportunities for evolution and recombination of these zoo coronavirus, which will in the future lead to new coronavirus that are more transmitted and (or) more deadly for humans.
In order to reduce the number of extraordinary contacts between humans and animals, the culture of use to food wild animals in certain areas of China should be rejected.
Following severe tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, it is necessary to improve its readiness and response plan to such situations.
In fact, many viruses existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reserves until new territories are captured.
Although many flying mouse properties are favourable for the spread of viruses, learning people to stay away from them can minimize the probability of human contact with flying mouses and other species of wild animals.
In order to better understand the ecology of the coronavirus and their natural carriers, the continuous epidemiological surveillance is needed to prevent the transmission of coronavirus from the human and future diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the virus zoonosis is to keep people away from the environmental reservations of natural zoo viruses.
There are still some fragments in the puzzle of the zootic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if the flying mouses have transmitted the ancestor virus SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it is interesting to see the situations where smooth mouses and pangolines divide the same environmental thread.
Secondly, if flying mouses play a more direct role in transmission to a person, it is necessary to determine how people became in touch with flying mouses.
Thirdly, if the role of the true intermediate carrier is played by the third syringe, it is necessary to determine how it interferes with different types, including humans, flying mouses and pangolins.
Finally, since many peanuts, including domestic animals, may be perceived to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological oversight and experimental infections should be carried out.
Whether a flying mouse, pangolin or other syringe, it is expected that in the future, SARS-CoV-2 or its predecessor viruses will be identified by their natural carriers.
Further studies in this area will light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2, which will have important consequences for prevention and control of COVID-19.
The diagnostic criteria for “suspicion of disease” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19 are needed.
On 6 February 2020, our group published a brief guide on diagnostic and treatment of a new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information on the experience that we have gained and recommendations to combat this pandemic throughout the world.
However, the coronavirus infection 2019 (CIVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of the current research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and introduced the latest diagnostic criteria for “suspicion of disease” and “affirmed cases” in accordance with the document “Recommendation on Diagnostic and therapy for COVID-19” (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the CNB.
In December 2019, a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was now officially named coronavirus infection 2019 (CIVID-19), and the virus itself was called “a heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat the infection of SARS-CoV-2, our group developed a brief guideline and published it on the Internet on the Military Medical Research Web site on 6 February 2020.
This publication has drawn great attention.
Notice, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of current studies and clinical experiences; thus, diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, between 16 January and 3 March 2020, seven publications of the document “Recommendations on Diagnostic and therapy for COVID-19” published by the National Health Committee of the CNB (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), and the content of some of its provisions had been significantly changed.
Recently, the work prepared by Jou (Zhou) with the co-autors made comments on our recommendations, which contained simple proposals for diagnostic based on the already existing clinical experience.
This work added new practical witnesses to our recommendations and provided valuable background information on this pandemic covered by the world.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the last issue of the COVID-19 Diagnostic and therapy Recommendations (seventh test) and the results of current studies, and their work is needed to be updated.
In accordance with the seventh issue of this document (Date 3 March 2020), a single element of epidemiological history with two clinical symptoms of disease should be combined:
Epidemiological history: (1) The history of movements or placement in Mr. Uhan and other settlements, or other human settlements, where cases of COVID-19 have been reported 14 days before symptoms; (2) the history of contacts with patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 (a positive test based on nuclein acids); (3) the history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Mr. Uchan and its circuits or other settled places where the COVID-19 cases have been registered during the last 14 days prior to the symptoms; (4) the history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (≥ 2 cases characterized by high temperature or respiratory symptoms, registered during two weeks in small parts, such as house or office, and so of the school.
Clinical manifestations: (1) High Temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) External infections of COVID-19; (3) the total number of leucocytes is normal or reduced with reduced lymphocytes at the early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis for a confirmed case of disease should be based on a high homogenety suspicion with one of the following pathogenetic or serologic evidence, namely: (1) the PRC test in real time is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full-genom sequence of the virus shows high homogenity of new coronavirus; (3) the positive results of the serotest for specific SARS-CoV-2 antitels IgM and IgG; or the change of the result from a negative to a specific for SARS-CoV-2 antibody, or the titra growth of no less than 4 times at the stage of the recovery of the appropriate healing rate of axe.
It can also be noted that, in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) the issues of the document were added to the CSD test in real time for Nuclein acids in respiratory paths or blood tests.
Patogenetic blood sampling diagnostic was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020) issues; then the seventh issue added the need for serologic evidence.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers looking for a optimum set for detecting Nuclein Acids in the rapid diagnosis, as well as on the testing of respiratory tests, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of various samples and facilitates the inclusion of positive tests for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirmation of disease.
However, there are increasing evidence of the need to be cautious in treating patients with athipical symptoms and patients without symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in the work of Jou (Zhou) and so on, should be updated, since the person who has no clinical symptoms is classified as a low-risk group.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practices and studies.
In conclusion, we hope to obtain more direct evidence and call on readers to leave their comments.
As regards diagnosis of "suspicion of disease" and "reaffirmed cases", we invite readers to monitor and closely implement the recent recommendations given in countries where they live.
Our group will also update its recommendations in time to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new death cases as a result of COVID-19, a daily maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new death cases as a result of COVID-19 per day.
It's the largest number of deaths from the virus a day.
As at yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for epidemiology, control and studies of diseases (IEDCR) reported that 114 current cases were included in the registered cases of infection, as well as 33 healthy patients at home.
The total of 17 deaths were registered.
In the online briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said that four men and one woman were victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two aged aged 60 years old, two years old from 51 to 60, and one aged 41 to 50.
She also reported that two of the dead were from Dakka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Clinic Officer informed the local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission in the Kuwait Clinic of Meitry.
On Saturday, in the online statement, the Minister for Traffic Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh Obidhul Quader stated that public transport work would be terminated for a longer period than was planned at the beginning, until next Saturday.
Public transport has been stopped since 26 March and had to be resumed on Saturday, 4 April.
Transport of goods of the first need — medicinal products, fuels and nutrition — was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 were registered in Bangladesh on 8 March in two people who returned from Italy as well as the wife of one of them.
As at 19 March, these three have already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has overcome a million cases of infections throughout the world
According to the University of Jones Hopkins, the total infection of Crown-CoV-2 throughout the world exceeded one million on Thursday.
The COVID-19 coronavirus killed at least 52,000 people.
The same day, the first infection in Malawi was confirmed, and the first death of the coronavirus was identified in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that as a Thursday, it was one of the few countries in which there were no cases of coronary infection.
As at yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051 635 infections confirmed, including 79,332 cases for twenty-four hours before 10:00 for Central-European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, over 244,000 cases of coronavirus infected were registered, of which at least 5,900 had a summer outcome.
CBS News with reference to the University of Jones Hopkins reported that more than 1,000 deaths caused by coronary infection were reported in the United States Wednesday.
Worldwide countries announced a strengthening of measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobinin extended the regime for the isolation of citizens of the city until 1 May.
Previously, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians across the country, despite their self-izolation, would receive a salary up to 30 April.
Parliament of Portugal voted for the prolongation of the emergency situation for 15 days; the results of the vote: 215 votes " for ", ten abstentions and one " versus " .
Saudi Arabia extended the command hours in the holy towns of Macka and Medina for a full day, while the early command hours were only three hours to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to introduce a command hour from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.
The Governor of the State of Ohio, Mike Dewaine, announced that the domestic isolation regime in the state territory was extended by order to 1 May.
Australian stores limit the number of packages of toilet paper that can be acquired at once
On Sunday and Saturday night, the Australian Wallworths and Coles shop networks reduced the number of packs of toilet paper that could be acquired at once in all shops of the country, to two and one packaging accordingly.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a limitation to one pack.
These restrictions were reported in the records and on the Facebook website.
Citizens were reportedly starting to make extraordinary stocks because of the fears that COVID-19 could initiate a general isolation regime.
Wednesday, the Woolworths network also limited the number of purchased toilet paper to one pack.
Earlier, on 4 and 5 March, Woolworths and Coles have already limited this number by 4 packages.
Coles' trade network in its press release dated 8 March reported that, with the introduction of four packs restrictions, “in many stores, the toilet paper is still exhausted too quickly — one supply in an hour”, and called the demand“ unprecedented”, while ALDI in the Facebook post published on Tuesday, referred to the trend of "unexpected".
According to the representative of Woolworths, the sales were rapidly growing last week.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited this number with two packages last week.
To fulfil the deficit, Coles began to order larger parties from suppliers and increase the frequency of supplies, Woolworths ordered additional parties, while ALDI made reserves for the special rapid sale.
Russell Cimmerman, executive director of the Australian Ritel Association, said that the rhylers were trying to fill out stocks, but it was difficult for local authorities' restrictions on the schedule of car transport.
He expects the product to increase, since suppliers are trying to meet the demand, but there are still less profitable proposals available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, due to the exhaustion of stocks, some shops could not share in the environment.
In the News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a expert on the diversity of the Queensland Technology University, said that shops are filling stocks every night.
He noted that the toilet paper was a gross goods, so the number of storage stocks was small, and after all the sales of the goods remained empty, the long series of shelves were increasing the lack of stocks.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if the poles could be filled, and goods such as toilet paper rolls and disinficiency tools could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers would probably not panic," said Russell Cimmerman.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of the reconstructed toilet paper Who Gives a Crap reported the completion of stocks.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, Cleenex and Solaris Paper toilet company, also producers of the Sorbent Mark Marks, reported that they work around a day to ensure sufficient amounts of goods.
Domain.com, a real estate selling site, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne decreased because of the absence of buyers on the week of the Labour Day, some real estate sellers began to offer free toilet paper for the first participants.
The Thursday publication of the NT News daily printed in Darwin included a tab from eight pages for cutting and use as a toilet paper.
According to Australia ' s ABC report dated 3 March, the shops first unwantedly imposed restrictions on the quantity of the goods obtained, claiming that they did not plan to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also used by high demand, including medical masks, disinficiency for hand, galanteries, hand-laundering and torture.
Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, on Sunday night, it was observed that the online store of the British Ocado supermarket also restricted the sale of the toilet paper Andres with two packages of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization announces the pandemic of COVID-19
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the pandemic of COVID-19 infectious disease caused by the CRONAVIR SARS-COV-2.
Although the term “pandemia” characterizes only the extent of disease rather than the danger of specific cases, WHO notes that the Governments of countries need to take action:
“All countries are still able to influence the progress of the pandemic development”.
This is possible if countries are to investigate, test, treatment, isolation of sick persons, monitoring the occurrence of disease and mobilization of their citizens," explained Mr. Tedros Adan Hebreisus, Director-General of WHO.
"We are deeply concerned about both the dissemination and seriousness of illness and the disturbance level."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases, this pandemic is “neprecedental”.
He said, in his interview on CNN in February, that “no one other respiratory virus except the flu has yet been monitored from the time of its emergence until the continuous global dissemination”.
Mr. Hebreius expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never observed the pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before."
At first, in January, WHO announced the explosion of this emergency situation in the field of international health, and then acquired a new status, a pandemic.
The Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said: “This is only the beginning, it will continue to be worse.”
According to the Associated Press on Thursday, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 have been registered.
The Coronavirus Pandemic 2019-2020 is currently a pandemic of coronavir disease 2019 (CIVID-19) caused by a severe coronavirus severe respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The explosion was identified in Uhana, China, in December 2019, and on 30 January 2020, an emergency of international health care was declared, which was subsequently recognized by the pandemic, on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million of COVID-19 cases were registered in 210 countries and regions, resulting in some 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people were healed.
The mortality rate in China is 4 per cent, while it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficult breathing.
The possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The period from the first symptoms to the peak is usually about five days, but may also variety from two to fourteen days.
No vaccine or specific treatment are currently found.
The primary treatment is a symptomatic and supportive nature. The recommended preventive measures include the washing of hands, covering mouth at cough, respecting the distance between people, identifying and ensuring self-izolating of people suspecting their infections.
The authorities throughout the world reacted to the situation by setting restrictions on travel, quarantine measures, command hours, risk control and closure of various facilities.
The Pandemia has led to serious global socio-economic implications, transfer or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as to the widespread lack of goods affected by panic purchases.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional levels in 193 countries, which affected about 99.4 per cent of students worldwide.
On the Internet, there were disinformation on the virus, xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of East and South-East Asia, or people reminding them of their external and other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of spread of the virus are noted.
As a result of reducing the number of travel and closing of heavy industrial enterprises, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of Uhan (the capital of the Hubai Province), China, reported that the situation of pneumonia occurred for unknown reasons, and in early January 2020 the situation was initiated.
The cases of infections were mainly linked to the sea-products of Juanan, so the virus is believed to have a zoo origin.
The virus that caused the explosion of the disease known as SARS-CoV-2. This is a recently open virus with a large similarity to the coronavirus of the flying mouse, the pangolin coronaviruss and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first case of disease occurred on 1 December 2019, and the infected did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of the infections registered in December 2019 were relevant to the market.
On 13 March 2020, the publication of the South-Chinese Office of the Morning Post, which was not verified, suggested that the first infectious incident occurred with the 55-year-old Hubai province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new infections in China had fallen, but was unexpectedly growing in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new cases of infections outside China had first exceeded the number of new infections in China.
The number of cases of disease may be significantly reduced, in particular because of a number of cases with lowly expressed symptoms.
By 26 February there were relatively few cases of infection among young people, with patients who were 19 years old and younger, less than 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide, and the United Kingdom's chief scientific adviser Patrick Wallans estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected until the effective group immunity of the country.
Statistics include cases of infections of people checked at COVID-19 and whose test was positive under official protocols.
As at 23 March, no country has been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, has been adopted an official policy that prevents the testing of only small symptoms.
Study published on 16 March showed that in China before 23 January, 86 per cent of the COVID-19 infections were not found and that such unregistered patients became source of infection for 79 per cent of registered cases.
The statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of actual infections in Italy was significantly higher than the number of recorded cases.
The initial estimates of the base reproductive infection (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
The study published by the United States Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases is expected that this indicator could be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 are well healed.
In other, more difficult cases, the period from the beginning of symptoms to the moment of death was between 6 and 41 days, the most common time of 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were associated with COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, about 80 per cent of the death cases were over 60 years old and 75 per cent of the victims had associated diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official data on the mortality of the COVID-19 pandemic usually include information on the deaths of patients with positive results of the COVID testing carried out under the official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, since official numbers may not take into account dead people without testing, for example, in the case of death at home, in houses of elderly, etc.
Incomplete data on Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic has exceeded the official COVID rates 4-5 times.
The press Secretary of the United States Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) recognizes: “We know that [the reported number of the dead] is below the actual”; its words are confirmed by reports of some single cases in the United States. Similar data accounts are often met in pandemic, such as a pig flu epidemic of H1N1 2009. The first confirmed death was registered in Uhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside the landscape of China was registered on February 1, while outside Asia, on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths were registered outside the landscape of China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions on all continents, except Antarctica, reported death cases, and several methods were usually used to quantify mortality.
All indicators are different depending on the region and the period of dissemination of disease; they are also affected by the levels of testing, quality of health systems using the treatment schemes, from the beginning of the disease and the parameters of the population, such as the age, gender and general health. The rate of " mortality/illness" is the number of deaths shared with the number of diagnosed infections during the time interval.
According to the statistics of the University of Jones Hopkins, as at 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204).
Data on different regions differ.
In China, the rate of mortality to disease decreased from 17.3 per cent (for those with symptoms occurring from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those who had symptoms since February 2020). Other methods include the definition of the rate of mortality due to the disease (CFR) as the percentage of diagnosticated patients dying from disease and the percentage of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (as diagnosticated and non-diagnosed) patients.
These statistics are not bound for a specific time and reflect the indicators of certain populations from the time of infection before the disease is completed.
Some scientists tried to calculate these indicators on specific human groups.
According to the Centre for Proof of the University of Oxford, the rate of mortality from this pandemic is 0.1 to 0.39 per cent.
The top figure of the range is consistent with the results of the first arbitrary test on COVID-19 in Germany, as well as with the statistical study analysing the impact of CFR testing.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the explicit duration of the explosion shall not be defined and may be different according to the location.
Macey Boni, a Pennsylvania University Officer, claims that “incontrolled infectious explosions usually go to the plate, and then, when the number of available disease carriers is completed, they start to turn off.
However, in the present situation, it is practically impossible to make any reasonable forecasts about when this will happen."
The chinese Government's Senior Medical Adviser, Jun Nanchan, claims that “everything could end until June” if all countries could mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kučarski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, stated that SARS-CoV-2 would “will circulate, perhaps, within a year or two”.
According to the study conducted by the Imperial College under the leadership of Neil Ferguson, “before the vaccine (possibly 18 months or more) is required to comply with the measures of physical distance and other measures.
William Shaffner, Officer of the University of Vanderbilt, believes: “I don't think that this coronavirus will ever disappear forever, because it is so easily transmitted”, and that he “may become a seasonal disease, exploding every year.”
The virality of the new explosions will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
The COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively unspecific, and some infected persons may suffer disease without symptoms.
Two most common symptoms are increased temperature (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include tiredness, wet education in breathing routes (lips), loss of smell, breathing, muscle pain and joints, throat pain, headache, vomiting, drowning, bleeding, diarrhoea or kyanose. WHO claims that it is seriously ill in the form of breathing problems, some six people.
The United States Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) lists immediate symptoms such as breathing difficulty, continuous pain or density in the chest, sudden feelings of consciousness, difficulties with awakening and drowning of a person or lips. If these symptoms are available, they should be immediately contacted for medical assistance. The further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepssis, septic shock and death.
Some infected people may have disease without symptoms, but the results of the analysis confirm the fact of infection, so the doctors recommend that people who are in close contact with patients whose diagnosis are confirmed under strict control and survey infections.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of unsymptomic disease rates declines from several units to 44 per cent of all cases.
The ordinary incubation period (time between infection and symptoms) declines from one to 14 days; it usually consists of five days; yet there is no full clarity on the symptom of smell: at the initial assessment, the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who have developed this symptom was initially 30 per cent and then dropped to 15 per cent.
Some details on how to disseminate disease are still unknown.
It is considered that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small drops of coughing, chichening or during the conversation; in close contact, contact between 1 and 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, the drop can be spread from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet) at open cough.
There are suspects that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops thrown into the air during the conversation that are capable of staying in the air for a longer period of time. The respiratory drops can also be produced at the expiry, including during the conversation, although the virus is usually not air-flowed.
The drops can get in the mouth or noses of people in the neighborhood, as well as in lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular reanimation (LLR), may lead to dissemination of gastrointestinal products and therefore to air-proliferation.
It can also enter the body if a person refers to the polluted surface, including the skin, followed by his eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus can be transmitted through fecalys, but the risk of this transfer is considered low.
The Government of China denies the possibility of a fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most infected for the first three days after symptoms, although it may occur before symptoms and later stages of disease.
There were cases when the tests were positive three days before the symptoms appeared, which indicated the possibility of transmitting the virus before the symptoms were expressed.
There are only a few reports of the laboratory confirmed cases of unsymptomic disease, but in some countries, there were also cases of transmission of disease from unsymptomic carriers.
The European Centre for Prevention and Control of Disabilities (ECDC) claims that it is not quite clear how easily the virus is spreading, however, it is known that one patient is usually infected by 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive from the surfaces of several hours to a few days.
In particular, it was found that on plastic surface (polypropylene) and on a non-running steel (304) virus is able to live up to three days, on a cardboard surface within one day, and on copper surfaces up to 4 hours.
These data, however, are varies depending on the moisture and temperature, and the results of COVID-19 have been positive for home and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to people, although the British authorities advise to wash their hands after contacting animals, just like after contacting other surfaces that people could touch.
A severe respiratory coronavir syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first discovered in three people with a plasma group with sharp respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All signs of a new SARS-CoV-2 are encountered in nature in relative coronavirus. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed by a home sauce that solves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 has a great similarity with the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is expected to have a zoo origin.
The genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it was genetically classified with Betacoonavirus, subnational Sarbecovirus (cluster line B) together with two other types of flying mice viruses.
At the full-genom level, it is 96 per cent identical to other models of the flying mouse coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in the amino acids of certain sequences of pangolin and human genome.
The full genome comparison to this day has shown that the largest percentage of similarity (92%) is between the pangolin coronavir and SARS-CoV-2, but that is not enough to prove that pangolines are intermediate hosts of the virus.
The virus can be diagnosed priorly on the basis of symptoms, although this should eventually be confirmed by analysing a polymerous chain reverse transcryption (RT-PCR) infected secret or computer topic.
The studies compared the PRC and CT methods applied in Uhan show that the CT is much more sensitive than the PRC, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions are consistent with other pneumonia and disease flows.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College has issued a recommendation “do not use CTs for crowning or as a method of testing the first line in COVID-19 diagnosis”.
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols on SARS-CoV-2 and the first was published on 17 January.
Polymerate chain reactions are being tested in real-time mode (RT-PRC).
It can be conducted on breathing samples and on blood samples.
The results are usually ready for a period of hours to a few days.
Usually the test is used by a nose-gul, although it can also be used by the grains. A number of laboratories and companies develop serological tests that allow antibodies to be detected.
As at 6 April 2020, none of them had been sufficiently precise to obtain a comprehensive approval.
In the United States, the serial test developed by Cellex was approved for urgent use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of visualization of rentgenogram symptoms and computer tomography (CT) are asymmetrical peripheral disturbances in the type of math glass and the absence of pleural exhausts.
The presentation of the international database of photos of confirmed infections is conducted by the Italian radiological society.
For similarity with other infections such as adenoiverus, the COVID-19 photos not confirmed by PRC tests have a limited clinical specification.
There was a major study in China, comparing the results of the CTs of the breast cell and the testing of the PRC, and it was found that, although the images are less specific in the case of infection, they could be decrypted faster; they were also more sensitive, and therefore, the method of diagnostic can be considered as a tool for creaming in the infected areas.
In order to diagnose the virus with X-rays and Computer Campography, vertical neuron networks were developed on the basis of artificial intellect.
The prevention strategies include the maintenance of common personal hygiene, washing of hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, using coughing or sneaking walnuts that should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may have been infected should wear a medical mask in human places.
In order to prevent the transmission of disease, it is also recommended that many Governments avoid any immediate trip to countries and areas affected by the explosion and limit the movement of citizens.
Nevertheless, the virus was able to spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is widespread among the population, some of whom do not know where or how they have been infected, and the medical careers who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, as well as the precautionary measures in contact with other people and the means of eye protection. The monitoring of contacts is also an important method used by the healthcare bodies to identify the source of infection and prevent further dissemination.
The use of data from Governments on the location of citizens with their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about respect for confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International (International Amnesty), as well as more than 100 other organizations, have made statements required to limit this type of observation.
The various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; more than a dozen expert groups have worked on the development of decisions to ensure the confidentiality of personal data, for example, registration of user closeness to other mobile phones through Bluetooth technology.
If the mobile phone user was in close contact with the person whose test at COVID-19 was positive, it has received the corresponding notification. There are also unfounded versions of how to prevent the infection, for example, the folding of the nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.
There is no vaccine from COVID-19 at present, although many organizations are working on its creation.
A washing of hands is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
CDC (Control and Prevention Centre) also recommends to wash your hands more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting toilet or with severe pollution of hands, and before food, after smoking, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary because, outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by a home sauce that opens its protective shell.
Furthermore, if the powder and water are not available, the CDC recommends that disinfective means be used to treat alcoholic hands with at least 60 per cent.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
The surfaces may be disinfected with a number of solutions (on the surface of the non-running steel, the disinfecting device starts to operate a minute after the intake) with 62 to 71 per cent of ethanol, 50 to 100 per cent of isopropanol, 0.1 per cent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 per cent of hydrogen oxygen and 0.2 to 7.5 per cent vision-yode.
Other components such as benzalconium chloride and glucona chlorphexidine are less effective.
CDC recommends that, in the case of suspicion of COVID or its confirmation in the establishment, such as office or daily station, all spaces of such a premises, including offices, toilets, general use facilities, electronic equipment, such as panels, sensors, keyboards, remote controls and bankomates used by sick people, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend that, when coughing or sneaking, the mouth and nose be covered by the back side of the elbow or the salvete and immediately discard the use of hygiene.
Those who may have been infected are recommended to use medical masks, as the use of the mask may limit the volume and range of dissemination of dissemination products that are dissolved in the air when talking, chishing and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Steven Griffin, a virusologist from the University of Lids, “the use of the medical mask may reduce the tendency of people to touch their face and touch the face with dirty hands is the main way of infecting.” The masks are also recommended for the use of those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends healthy people to wear medical masks only if they are highly risked, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that the use of a mask actually allows to reduce the number of touches to a person.
Several countries began calling for the use of medical masks in public places.
The CDC, U.S.C., recommends that wear non-medical facial masks. China separately emphasizes the importance of the use of one-time medical masks of healthy people, especially if they are closely contacted (1 metres (3 feet) or less) with other people.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended that wear medical masks in public transport or human places.
The officials in the field of health of Thailand call on people to make facial fabric masks in their home conditions and to delete them daily.
Citizens in the Czech Republic and Slovakia are not allowed to go outside without masks closing their noses and mouths.
On 16 March, the Government of Vietnam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria pledged all visitors of food shops to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks are produced daily from the middle of March, all passengers in trains and intergrad buses were recommended to use medical masks.
In Panama, the inhabitants are obliged to wear a medical mask by leaving the street; those who cannot acquire masks were recommended to sew them in their own home conditions.
Medical masks are also widely used by Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is a measure to combat infection aimed at slowing the dissemination of disease by minimizing close contacts between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, school closure, jobs, stadiums, theatre and trade centres.
People can use social distance measures by staying at home, limiting travels, avoiding human places, using incontact welcomes and physically distant from others.
Many Governments of regions, particularly severely affected by the explosion, now prescribe or recommend social distance.
The maximum number of people that could be gathered in one place in accordance with the recommendation of the United States Government and Health Organizations has been rapidly reduced, starting with 250 (in regions where no COVID-19 dissemination has been available), to 50 people and to 10 people later.
On 22 March 2020, Germany forbids to gather in groups of more than two people. The elderly people and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart diseases, hypertension and weak immune system are facing an increased risk of having a virus in a serious form. CDC recommends that they stay at home as long as possible, if the region is observed by the explosion of heart disease. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term “social distance” to “physical distance”, thus specifying the objective of this measure, to reduce physical contacts within social links, whether through virtual communication or respecting the physical distance.
The use of the term “social distant” was understood in such a way that people should be fully socially isolated instead of being in contact with other people in alternative ways, and some offices have published the guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, it was recommended that only your permanent partners whom you live, and whom you are confident that he has no virus and symptoms.
Persons with the COVID-19 diagnosis and suspects that they are infected are recommended domestic isolation.
Health agencies have published detailed instructions on appropriate isolation, and many Governments have also made their mandatory order or recommended that the population of the affected regions put themselves on the quarantine itself.
The high-risk groups were prescribed by the strict quarantine.
Persons who may have contacted the infected COVID-19 or have recently visited the country or region, significantly affected by the epidemic, have been recommended that quarantine be found within 14 days since the last possible contact.
Strategies for combating the flash include constraints to the dissemination of disease, its depression or mitigation.
The dissemination of disease is conducted in early stages and aims to track and isolate infected, as well as other measures for infectious control and vaccination to stop the dissemination of disease among the rest of the population.
At the stage where the dissemination of disease is no longer possible, efforts are directed to mitigate the consequences: measures aimed at slowing the spread and reducing the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Measures to restrain and mitigate the effects of the dissemination of disease may be taken at the same time.
The infection impairment requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of infections to below 1. Part of the efforts to manage the illness of the infectious disease is aimed at reducing the epidemic epidemic pic, known as the equation of the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overloading health services and provide more time to develop vaccines and treatment methods.
The non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help to address the explosion include measures of personal prevention such as hygiene of hands, use of medical masks and self-izolation; public measures aimed at physical distantness, such as closing schools and discharge of mass activities; the involvement of the community in promoting such measures and participation in them; and measures to protect the environment, such as the cleaning of surfaces. After the seriousness of the explosion has become obvious, there have been more responsive actions to sustain the explosion, such as the exclusion of cities and the introduction of strict road bans.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass warehouse and localized quarantines have been introduced, as well as have been organized a system of notifications on displacement of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to infected individuals who were self-izolated and punished those who did not do so.
In Taiwan, medical masks were increased and fined for the accumulation of excessive drugs. The United States and Britain model showed that there are serious problems with regard to mitigation (slowing but not stopping the spread of epidemic).
Optimal policy to mitigate the effects of the dissemination of the disease may reduce the peak load to 2/3, while mortality is double, but still leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapse in health systems.
Suppression may be preferable, but it must be used until the virus circulates among the population (or until the vaccine is developed, if it occurs earlier), as otherwise the dissemination of the disease will be renewed quickly when measures are weak.
Long-term intervention with a view to the oppression of the pandemic leads to social and economic costs.
There are no antivirus medicines approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including the testing of existing medicines.
Receiving unreceptural medicinal products from cold, drinking enough liquidity and rest may help to facilitate symptoms.
The patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous liquid and respiratory support, depending on the severity of the disease.
Use of steroids can only harm.
Several links that have previously been approved to treat other virus diseases are also considered to be used for COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and domestic resources” may facilitate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers the increased capacity and adaptation of health to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a major response to the explosion of disease.
The European Centre for Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Bureau have issued guidelines for primary medical and health care services in order to facilitate the re-deployment of resources at several levels, including the focus of the lab testing services on COVID-19, the cancellation of immediate procedures, where possible, the detection of virus and isolation of patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as enhanced intensive therapy through training and increasing the number of available IVL equipment and cock.
There are various theories of where the first case of infection could occur — the so-called Zero Patient.
The first known infection of a new coronary infection was probably on 1 December 2019 in the city of Uhan province Hubai, China.
During the month, the number of coronavirus infections in the Hubai province has gradually increased.
They were mainly linked to the global sea-products of Juanan, which was also sold by living animals, and one of the theories was that the virus was invaded into the human organism of one of these animals; in other words, the virus had a zoo origin. On 26 December, the Hubey Province Clinic registered a case of mass disease of unknown origin with which the doctor Jean Tenzin worked on this case in the Centre for Control and Prevention of Cianhani in Uhan City.
On 30 December, a group of doctors from the central clinic of Uhan warned their colleagues about “coronavirus similar to SARS”.
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Venillian, were warned by the police of responsibility for the spread of false rumors, and IFEN, doctor, received an appeal from its chiefs for panicing.
Later, 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of the Uchana published a public notification and informed WHO of the situation.
The health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which was sufficient to initiate investigation at the beginning of January. In early stages, the number of cases was doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus was also spread in other Chinese provinces, which contributed to Chinese new celebration and the fact that Uchan is a transport and main rail node.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new infections in one day, including two people in Beijing, and one in Shanchen.
According to the later official data, by 20 January 2020, the symptoms of disease have already occurred in 6,174 people. As at 26 March, more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have been recovered.
Some 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one registered infection case.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries of the Schengen Zone limited their free movement and established border control.
National response measures included measures to prevent the dissemination of diseases, such as quarantine (known as a compulsory residence of the house, mandatory hiding house or isolation), as well as a commanding hour. As at 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the United States population, were in any form of quarantine, more than 50 million people are in the Philippines isolation, about 59 million people are in isolation in South Africa and 1,3 billion people in India.
On 26 March, 1,7 billion people worldwide were in a form of isolation, and two days later, this number increased to 2.6 billion people — about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Uchan on 1 December 2019; the second report that the validity of the information was not verified on 17 November.
On 26 December, Jean-Cysian worked with a case of mass disease with unknown type, as notified by the Centre for Control and Prevention of Chianhani's Disease in Uhan 27 December.
The initial genetic testing of the samples of patients held on 27 December 2019 showed the existence of a CARS-like coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of the Uchana issued an appropriate public notification.
WHO was notified the same day.
In connection with such notifications, the police warned the doctors in Uhan about the responsibility for the “proliferation of rumors” of the explosion.
Originally, the Chinese National Health Commission claimed that there was no “reasonable evidence” of the ability of the re-detected virus to be transmitted from human to human.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to prevent the spread of the virus, which was later referred to as the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China, Si Zingpine, “national war”.
The events of “the largest quarantine in the history of humanity” began to be deployed on 23 January as a sanitary border and the prohibition of entry into Uganda and backwards, and later the measure spread in a total of 15 towns of the Hubai Province and touched about 57 million people.
The city has been prohibited from the use of personal transport.
In many places the celebration of Chinese New Year (25 January) was cancelled.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary Hospital of Huoshenjan, which was completed in 10 days.
The other hospital, Leishenshan, was later constructed, who took other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also re-profiled 14 other institutions in Uhaan, such as conference centres and stadiums, in temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government has taken additional measures to prevent the COVID-19 explosion, including the delivery of health certificates for travelers and the extension of the period of the New Year of China.
The universities and schools were closed throughout the country.
Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions, the authorities introduced a remote mode of work.
There were restrictions for travel in the Hubai Province and beyond it.
The public transport work schedule has been modified and the museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
In many cities, civilian movement control was introduced, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (or more than half of the population) encountered a form of free air-related restrictions, and since the flash came into a global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the “import” of the virus from other countries.
For example, a 14-day mandatory quarantine was introduced in Beijing for all international travellers who entered the city. As at 23 March, only one case of transfer of infection from the country, which occurred five days earlier, was registered from the person returned to Guangjjou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Prime Minister of China, Li Kezan, reported that the dissemination of diseases transmitted within the country was mainly suspended and the flash was taken under control in China.
On the same day of visits to Hubai, except Uchan, it was withdrawn two months after the quarantine was closed. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that from 28 March, the entry to persons with visa or residence would be suspended.
Those who wish to come to China will have to file applications for visas in Chinese embassy or consulations.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on businesses and factories to resume the work and provided the packages of money-credit stimulation to companies. On 4 April at 10 a.m., a national " three-minute " minute of silence " which opened the day of the victims of the coronavirus, announced by the State Council of the country and coincided with the celebration of Quinmin, but the central Government requested citizens to give respect to the dead online, respecting the physical distance to avoid the re-explosion of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of reaffirmed diseases, which had a great deal because many followers of the new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus Shinchongji, were gathered in Tag.
The followers of Shinchongji arrived in Tagu from Uhan, which is supposed to be a source of explosion.
As at 22 February, of 9 336 church followers 1,261 (approximately 13 per cent) reported their symptoms of disease. On 23 February 2020, the highest level of anxiety was announced in South Korea.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed infections have been registered in Korea, and it has already increased to 3, 150.
All South Korean military bases were placed on quarantine after three soldiers had confirmed the existence of the virus.
The emergence has affected the number of travels, therefore, the schedule of airlines has been modified, and the South Korea has developed the programme for the coverage of the population on the presence of the virus, the tracking of contacts and the organization of quarantine measures for contacted persons. The programme is considered to be the largest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.
The storage methods included mandatory information on their symptoms through mobile application by all arriving from abroad, the primary testing on the virus, which had been prepared for the next day, as well as the empowerment of testing, which allowed to test up to 20,000 people daily.
The South Korean programme was considered successful in the fight against the illness, despite the insulation of the entire cities, and the South Korean society had initially been divided because of the response of President Mun Jae Ina to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either approve of the President ' s actions or called for Mr. Moonu ' s impunity for inadequate, in their view, the response of the Government to the explosion of disease.

The United Kingdom responded to this virus the most calmly from all affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not oblige citizens to comply with any form of social distance or quarantine measures.
As a result, the Government was criticized for the insufficient and serious response to the danger of the country ' s population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement in which it recommended that all visits and social contacts without priority, offering people to work from home and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatre.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment facilities, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible, and promised workers to pay up to 80 per cent of the salary, but not more than 2.500 pounds of sterling per month as a measure to support the population during the crisis.

On 5 February, WHO requested the world community to allocate $675 million to ensure strategic preparedness for the low-income epidemic in countries, noting the need to provide immediate assistance to those countries who "no systems for the detection of people infected by the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries".
Mr. Tedros also stated that the “indicator of our preparedness was a degree of preparedness for the epidemic of our weakest bond” and called on the international community to make a choice: to invest today or to pay in the future. At a press conference held on 11 February, the WHO established an official name of COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of UN, Antonio Gutherish, agreed to provide “a potential for the entire UN system to respond to the problem”.
As a result, the United Nations Panel for Crisis Management has been established to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, as WHO states, will “concentrate on health responses, while other departments can use their experience to combat the illness in a broader social and economic manner”.
On 14 February, WHO and China were initiated by a joint special group, which provided the work of international experts and WHO staff in the fields in China to assist in addressing the situation in the country and the assessment of “serious disease and infectiousness”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as exits to evaluate “efficiency of response measures at the provinces and districts, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “the peace should do more to prepare for the possible pandemy of the coronavir, noting that“ yet too early to call this pandemic disease, but countries, however, should be prepared to do so”.
On 28 February, the WHO sent a united group to assess the situation. The WHO officials stated that the probability of global coronavirus dissemination would be increased with a “high” to“ very high” — the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO Emergency Health Programme, warned in his statement: “It is a check of every government on the planet at the preparatory status of cases: time to act.
This virus may be on its way to your country, and you must be prepared," and stressed that correct responses could help the world to avoid the "worst development scenario of events".
Ryan also stated that the current data were not a basis for the proclaiming the global pandemic as officials of the public health sector, and added that the declaration of pandemia would mean that “we would essentially recognize the fact that each person on the planet would be risked to be infected by this virus”.
On 11 March, WHO announced a pandemic coronavirus explosion.
The Director-General of WHO stated that WHO is “deeply concerned about both the high level of dissemination and seriousness of disease and not less anxious level of unambiguation in this issue”. WHO is being seriously criticized for the inadequate approach to the concept of pandemia, including the later announcement of the emergency situation in the field of public health and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
Mr. Tedros Adanom was petitioned as a response to the situation addressed by the Director-General of WHO, with a proposal to resign, signed by 733,000 persons as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, tens of UN human rights experts emphasized the importance of respect for human rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Expert Group stated that each had the right to apply to life-saving measures, and the Government was responsible for the organization of such measures.
The Panel emphasized that the lack of resources or health insurance should not at any extent be an excuse for discrimination against a specific group of people.
Experts emphasized that each person has the right to health, including people with limited capabilities, representatives of minority groups, elderly citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, citizens living in extremely bad conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other uncertain groups that need public support.
International governmental organizations consider the economic and social implications of the COVID-19 crisis.
The organization of economic cooperation and development has created a platform designed to provide timely and comprehensive information on response policy measures throughout the world, as well as to awareness of views and recommendations.
The digital node contains information on the political measures of various countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health and global economy, to eliminate the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions in order to help countries learn from each other and to promote coordinated global response measures to combat coronavirus.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, Minister of the Great Britain Cabinet, Michael Gova and Edwardo Bolsonaru, the son of President of Brazil, Jaire Bolsonar, for the actions carried out to combat the pandemic, which began with the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) of the provincial level have been dismissed for the quarantine measures they have taken in the central part of China, and these releases have demonstrated dissatisfaction by responses to political explosion in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this step aimed at protecting the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China, Si Ziningpine, from the anger of the public about the explosion of the coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Jao Litzjan, expressed disagreement with the previous statement that the explosion of the coronavirus began in Uhaan, but took the side of the theory of the conspiracy that COVID-19 had formed in the United States or Italy.
The Administration of the President of the United States, Donald Trampa, called the coronavirus “Chinese virus” or “Huhan’s virus”, claiming that “censorship in China only impairs the situation of a virus that has now become a global pandemic”, and this statement, in turn, has been criticised by some commentators who claim that such a approach is racist and“ distracts the inability of the U.S. Administration to prevent the dissemination of disease”.
The Daily Beast had access to the U.S. Government telegram, in which the communications strategic trick is apparently designed by the National Security Council, and there were the following mentions of the strategy: “All in China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any way, including press conferences and television talks.” Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg stated that the efforts of China to assist countries suffering from the virus are part of “propaganda efforts” to acquire global influence.
The head of the EU External Political Office, Joseph Borrell, warned about the presence of a “geopolitical component that includes the fight for influence through the pyar and so-called generosity policy”.
Borelle also stated that “China has insisted on its role in a responsible and reliable partner, as opposed to the United States”.
China also called upon the United States to cancel sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while, on some grounds, sending assistance to the last two countries.
The sacrificing by Jack Ma, 100,000 medical masks to Cuba, was prohibited in connection with US sanctions on 3 April.
The U.S. authorities are also accused of redirecting assistance for other countries to their own country.
Medical masks have also raised disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Czech Republic and Italy.
Furthermore, Turkey has adopted hundreds of IVL devices for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government criticised the lack of support by the European Union for the coronavirus of Italy.
Mauricio Massari, Italian Ambassador to the EU, said that “China only reacted bilaterally.
This clearly does not indicate European solidarity."
On 22 March, following a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Italy, Juzeppe Conte, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, organized a sending to Italy of Russian military sanitators, specialized disinfective transport and other medical equipment.
The Italian La Stampa quotes an anonymous “politic source of high-level” claiming that 80 per cent of Russian assistance was“ useless or less useful for Italy”.
The source accused Russia of seeking a favourable impression on the world's public at the “geolitic and diplomatic” level.
The President of Lombardia Attilio Fontana and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi Di Mayo, rejected the media attacks and expressed appreciation for the assistance provided.
Russia has also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
The Press Secretary of Kremlj Dmitri Peskov stated that “in proposing assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] suggests that when the American health equipment and material producers increase in production, they will also be able to provide responsibilities if necessary”.
NATO Military Doctrines “Protecter-2020” planned in Germany, Poland and the countries of Baltia -- the largest military teachings of NATO after the end of the cold war will be conducted in a short format.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, has criticized the teachings of Defender 2020 (Defender-2020) " , " In the crisis situation that has occurred today in the field of public health, the conduct of these teachings would threaten the lives of not only US military and many European countries but also the people of countries where such activities should be conducted " . The Government of Iran has suffered severely from the virus. About two dozen members of the Parliament are infected and 15 other political actors.
On 14 March 2020, the President of Iran Hasan Ruhani, in his open letter, called on world leaders with a request for assistance, noting that his country has experienced difficulties in combating the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets in connection with the sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran. The epidemic called for the adoption of social policies distributed in other states, including the implementation of a single health system and care for children paid for family leaves and increased financing of public health.
Politologists expected that this could have a negative impact on the chances of Donald Tramp to re-elect in the presidential elections of 2020, which has resulted in a deterioration of diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea has criticized Japan ' s " indifferent and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that any citizens arriving from South Korea would be placed on a two-week quarantine to the places specially placed by the Government.
The South Korean society was initially divided because of the reaction of President Moon Jae-in to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either administered the President's actions or called for Mr. Moonu ' s impunity for inadequate, in their view, the response of the Government to the explosion of disease.
Some commentators are concerned that this step will allow Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, the Parliament voted for providing the Prime Minister Victor Orban the immediate right to manage by means of orders, suspend the work of the parliament, and conduct elections and punish those who will be accused of the distribution of fake information on the virus and government measures to combat the crisis.
The explosion of the coronavirus was called the cause of several cases of deficit of supply in connection with global growth in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the gross of goods under the conditions of panic and the disturbance of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Administration for Monitoring the Quality of Food and Medicinal Products has issued warnings about the lack of medicines and medical equipment, which resulted in increased consumer demand and disorders in the work of suppliers.
In several settlements there were also panic purchases; this has led to the situation where the goods of food, toilet paper and bottled water disappeared from the shops, such as food, food and water, which, in turn, led to a deficit of stocks.
In particular, the technological industry warns of delays in electronic goods delivery.
According to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, demand for individual protection has increased 100 times.
This jump led to the twenty-fold increase in prices compared to the normal price, as well as to the delays in the supplies of medical appointment for four to six months.
It also caused lack of individual protection throughout the world, and WHO warned that, for that reason, health workers would be hit.
In Australia, buyers on the Daigo system received a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This activity led to lack of child food in some supermarkets and was subsequently prohibited by the Government of Australia, despite the high proliferation of COVID-19 in the Northern Italy and the Uhan region, as well as the high demand for foodstuffs, has been avoided in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation of stocks and illicit trade by critically successful products have prevented a sharp lack of food that was expected in Europe and in North America.
Northern Italy, which has small agricultural production, has not experienced significant declines, but, according to the representatives of the industry, prices for agricultural production can grow.
Food shops remained empty only temporary, even in Uhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pig stocks to provide full nutrition.
Similar laws that require food products to preserve food for emergency circumstances exist in Italy.
The world economy damage has affected China: according to the media data dated 16 March, China's economy has suffered significantly in the first two months of 2020 because of the measures to combat the spread of the virus taken by the Government, which resulted in reducing the sales by 20.5 per cent.
The Material China is a large economic and production centre; therefore, the virus explosion is considered to be a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
According to Agatha Demaraj, the Economist Intelligence Unit, market volunteer will remain until a more clear concept of potential results occurs.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic implications of the current epidemic in terms of global growth could overcome the consequences of the epidemic of atipical pneumonia 2002-2004.
One of the estimates made by the expert from the University of Washington in St. Louis, the damage to the world supply chain may exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact may last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Oil Exporters (OPEC) has taken “instant measures” after a sharp reduction in oil prices due to the drop of demand from China.
On 24 February, the world fund markets have fallen due to a significant increase in the number of people infected by COVID-19 outside the mainland of China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the explosion of the coronavirus, various United States Fund Indexs, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and the Dou-Johns Index for Industrial Company shares, showed the most rapid fall since 2008, and the Dou index fell by 1191, the largest one-day fall after the financial crisis of 2007-2008.
At the end of the week, all three indexes showed more than 10 per cent decline.
On 28 February, the Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative forecast.
The actions have fallen again because of the concerns about the proliferation of the coronavirus, and the biggest decline occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a probability of economic recession.
Economist Mohammed El-Erian highly assessed the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks react faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in connection with the bans on movement, the closure of public places, including tourist remarks, and the recommendations of Governments to do no travel.
As a result of all these measures, many airlines canceled flights because of a rapid reduction in demand for aircraft, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional airline Flybe stopped existence.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has been as strong as ever.
Several railway stations and shipping ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chung-June, the main tourist season of Chinese new-day celebration.
National and regional Governments have been abolished by a number of activities involving a large number of people, including annual new festivals; private companies have also closed their own stores and tourist competences, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneylands.
Many new events have been cancelled and tourist observations were closed to prevent mass bunchs of people; for example, in Beijing, the Prohibition City was closed and traditional temple shops were cancelled.
In 24 of 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended new holidays until 10 February, with the instructions for most enterprises not to be opened until that date.
These regions had 80 per cent of GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
The Hong Kong authorities raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest and announced an emergency by closing schools before March and canceling the New Year's celebration. The trade sector was globally affected: the shop hours were reduced and some shops were temporaryly closed.
The visit to discount trade points in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40 per cent.
Business of diversity in North America and the Middle East reduced sales by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, 33 to 43 per cent of the visit to trade centres in March fell compared to February.
Trade centres throughout the world have introduced additional measures, such as the improvement of sanitation conditions, the installation of equipment to check visitors' temperature and to cancel activities. According to the United Nations Economic Commission on Latin America, the Latin American recession caused by pandemic, could leave 14 to 22 million more people beyond the limit of poverty than that would be in a similar situation but without pandemic.
In January and February 2020, about 5 million people lost jobs in Uhan in China.
Many of the 300 million Chinese rural migrants were homes in their country provinces or locked in the Hubai province. In March 2020, over 10 million Americans lost their jobs and contacted the Government.
According to the Federal Bank of St. Louis, the explosion of coronavirus in the United States could deprive workplaces of 47 million people, while the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent. The measures imposed in India would leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers who receive daily wages. Study conducted by the Angus Reyd Institute showed that 44 per cent of Canadian households have encountered unemployment in any event. Almost 900 000 Spanish workers have also lost jobs since the strict isolation in Spain in the middle of March 2020.
During the second half of March 4 million French workers filed statements for the temporary unemployment benefit, and 1 million British workers received a single social payment. Almost half a million companies in Germany transferred their staff to the Government's short working schedule, a full working day.
The German labour salary scheme was also introduced in France and Britain.
Art and cultural heritage are also severely affected by a pandemic that affected the activities of organizations, as well as individuals, whether officially established or independent, throughout the world.
Cultural and art organizations have tried to support their (publically financed State) cultural heritage mission, ensuring the safety of their staff and the public, as possible by supporting art people.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions were closed throughout the world for an uncertain period, or access to them was differently limited and exhibitions, activities and submissions were cancelled or transferred to other dates.
In return, active efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and acquisition of the result of the spread of the virus, the cancellation of religious services, major sports activities and other public activities, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and trends.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Fascinating Week in Rome, which was held last week of the Christian Repentant period — the Great Post.
Many episodes recommend that elderly Christians stay at home and do not attend Sunday services; in some churches, churches, churches have started to transmit on radio, directly or television, while some church leaders are proposing to conduct worship in open air.
The Roman Catholic Ephrase closed to visit its churches, clocks and squares of St. Peter, where Christian pilgrimages have not yet appeared, and later other religious organizations also canceled worship and restricted access to public worship in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and guuders.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the explosion of the coronavirus and the holidays were closed later; Saudi Arabia has prohibited access to foreign pilgrimages and its own residents to the holy places of Macka and Medina.
The Pandemia has led to the most significant changes in the world's sports events since the Second World War.
Most major sports activities have been cancelled or transferred, including the League of UEFA championships 2019-20, the Prime Minister of League 2019-20, Euro-2020 UEFA, NBA season 2019-20 and NHL season 2019-20.
The explosion of the coronavirus also destroyed plans for the summer Olympic Games of 2020, which were to begin at the end of July; on 24 March the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be " transferred for the period after 2020 but not later than the summer of 2021." Casino and other games throughout the world were closed and the poker tournaments that were usually transmitted directly, were either transferred or cancelled.
This has resulted in the fact that many players have moved to online mode and many gambling sites report significant increases in the number of new subscribers. The entertainment industry has also suffered because various music groups suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many large theaters, such as shipways, have also cancelled all their spectacles.
As alternative to traditional offline activities, some artists and musicians began to study the options for continuing their activities and exchange of results on the Internet, organizing direct online concerts or websites; this helps people of creative professions to continue to carry out, publish or publish their works.
There have been many Internet mimes on the subject of the coronavirus, many of which are humorous and collapse alarming moods characterized for uncertainty periods.
Since the COVID-19 arrival of predomination, xenophobia and racism, the citizens of China and the people of East Asian origin, as well as those of the population of hot points of Europe, the United States and other countries have been observed.
In many countries, particularly in Europe, Eastern Asia, North America and the Asia Pacific, there were cases of fear, suspicion and hostility.
In the information summary of February (when most cases of infection were still limited to China), racist moods expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who seem to have deserved this virus or have received fair retaliation for anything.
In some African countries, anti-Chin moods are also increasing.
Many inhanja and Hubaya reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Citizens of China, as well as those who live in viral areas, were supported both in offline and online mode.
The epidemic began to spread in new countries, in particular in Italy, the first country in Europe faced a serious phenomenon of COVID-19; in this regard, the citizens of such regions may also feel suspicious and xenophobic. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea in early stage have signed a petition, insisting on the prohibition of the entry of Chinese citizens in their countries to sustain the epidemic.
In Japan, heshtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan #Chinese Do not arrive in Japan) took leadership positions in Twitter.
Citizens of China, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report on a growing level of racism and even attacks.
The President of the United States Donald Tramp faced criticism for what he called the coronavirus “Chinese virus”; the criticism considers it a racist and anti-China.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses transported to New Sanjara of Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Ukhan.
Students arriving from China to North-Eastern India and training in large towns in India reported persecutions related to the explosion of coronavirus.
Dilip Ghosh, President of the State Division of the Party of Bharatia Janata, West Bengalia, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and “God revenged them”.
Later, these statements were convicted by the Chinese Consultation in Calcutta, which called them “trauma”, and the pandemic re-exploded xenophobia and racism with regard to non-Chinese citizens: foreigners began to be called“ foreign trash” and objects to “utilization”.
Many newspapers with wage access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made open access to their scientific articles on the explosion of the coronavirus.
Some scientists decided to give short-term access to the results of their studies in the preprint publication servers, such as bioRxiv.

Smuggling of wild animals and diseases transmitted from a person is the Health Risk associated with the trade in exotic animals.
Laboratory testing of the respiratory coronavirus 2019 (CAVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes the methods of detecting the presence of the virus and the methods for detection of antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by the OTC, which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and intended only to identify the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm sufficiently recent or active infections.
The deployment of anti-thels (serology) may be used both for diagnostic and for population control.
Antibody analysis reveals the number of people who have suffered diseases, including those whose symptoms were too small to be treated in the hospital or not.
The precise mortality rate of this disease and collective immunity can be determined by the results of this test.
As at March 2020, there was no reliable data on the proliferation of the virus among the population because of limited testing opportunities in no country.
By 23 March, no country has been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and information on the number of tests carried out in different countries is very contrary.
Such differences are likely to significantly affect the recorded mortality rates that may be significantly overwhelmed in some countries.
With a polymerous reaction of the reverse transcryption in real time (RRT-PCR), the test can be conducted on respiratory samples obtained by different ways, including a swallow or a moisture sample.
The results are usually available within a period of hours to two days.
The PRC test taken from the throat is valid only during the first week of disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, continuing, however, to be multiplyed into the lungs.
Infected patients tested on the second week of disease may be taken as alternative from lower respiratory paths by sucking cateter, or wet products may be used.
One of the early PRC tests was developed in Charite Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020, using a polymerous chain response with reverse transcryption in real time (RRT-PCR) and a lie based on 250,000 sets which the World Health Organization (WHO) subsequently distributed.
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom has also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean Kogenebiotech developed a set for the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of the clinical level (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It detects the gene E, common for all beta coronoviruss and RdRp, specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese BGI Group has become one of the first companies that have authorized the National Management of Chinese Medicinal Products for Emergency Use of the Urgent Detection of SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of the PCR. In the United States, the Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) distribute through the International Reagent Resources of their diagnostic panel for the real time (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests from the older versions of the test sets was incomplete because of the unreasoned reactors and the narrow area of the CDC testing in Atlanta; the average was less than 100 samples per day during February 2020.
The two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that, public and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Office for Monitoring the Quality of Food and Medicines under the emergency authorisation. The U.S. Trade Laboratories began testing at the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 on the basis of RT-PRC throughout the country.
Quest Diagnostics began the COVID-19 testing throughout the country since 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limits have been reported; the fence and analysis should be carried out in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology, WECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Oversight Service. It was reported that on 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic has developed a test for the detection of COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the approval of the FDA for the use of a test that could be conducted for 3.5 hours at a large number of tests, allowing one car to process approximately 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, FDA issued an urgent authorisation for the use of Abbott laboratories for Abbott m2000 tests; the FDA had previously issued a similar authorization of Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also receives EUA from the FDA for a 45-minute test.
FDA has also approved a test in which the technologies for isothermic nuclear acids are used instead of PCCs.
Since the test does not require a series of cycles of recurrent temperatures, this method may detect positive results in only five minutes and negative in 13 minutes.
In the United States there are about 18,000 such vehicles, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests a day, and now in Taiwan there is a monochlonic antibody test, which is specifically linked to the Nucleocopsid protein (N-White) of a new coronavirus, and hopes for the possibility of obtaining results in 15-20 minutes, like the flu-expression.
The review of the specialized literature of March 2020 concludes that “rentegenograms of the breast cell have a small diagnostic value in early stages, while the results of the CT [computer tomography] may have such value even before the symptoms appear.”
The typical signs identified in the course of the CT include bilateral multi-dollar subplaural focuses on the type of "math glass" with peripheral, asymmetrical and territorial distribution.
Subpleural domination, the symptom of the bullid bridge and consolidation are developing as the disease is progressed.
Studies compared to the PRC and CTC methods used in Uhan during the current pandemic have shown that the CT is significantly more sensitive than the PRC, although it is less specific, since many of its visualization functions are consistent with other pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College has published the recommendation “do not use CTs for decoration or as a method of testing the first line in COVID-19.” As at March 2020, it recommends the use of the CSD method.
Partially the immune response to infection is expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies may be used to identify infection in people after the 7th day of the existence of symptoms, to identify immunity and to monitor the population. Analysis can be conducted in central laboratories (CLT) or by diagnosticing in the place (PCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these studies will be able to perform high-productive automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.
CLT usually uses one sample of peripheral blood, although serial samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
At the PCT, one blood sample is usually obtained through each shelter.
In contrast to the PRC methods, the blood fence phase is not required to take a breeding analysis. On 26 March 2020, the FDA referred to 29 organizations that have passed all necessary registration procedures and can now extend their tests to antibodies.
As at 7 April 2020, FDA approved only one emergency resolution test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European permissions for the use of their test sets that can be identified in the antibody models of IgG and IgA with the ability to combat the virus.
The production of the test consists of several hundred samples over a few hours and therefore this method works much faster than the normal PRC virus RNA analysis.
At the beginning of April, Britain found that none of the antibody acquired to analyse the antibodies would give satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, there was a scheme that allows patients with suspicion of the virus to remain at home: “Competers of Urgent Assistance transmit to a sample sample to the patient”, swimming back into it, and after a while receives the results of the test. The British NHS announced the launch of their pilot scheme for suspicious cases in home conditions that eliminate the risk of infection by other visitors of the clinic, or the need to disinfect the emergency car if it was used to transport the patient. During the COVID-19 suspicious trial, the medical worker takes analysis with all appropriate precaution measures.
The test centres helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and largest testing procedures than in any other country. On 2 March in Germany, the National Association of Committed Medical Insurance Activities stated that it was ready to conduct about 12,000 tests per day in ambulatory conditions and only 10,700 tests a week earlier.
If the survey is designated as a doctor, the costs are covered by medical insurance.
According to the President of the Institute of Robert Koh, Germany's overall productivity in the testing plan is 160,000 tests a week.
As at 19 March, the expression was proposed in several major cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of German tests was unknown because only positive results were registered.
The first laboratory study showed that, as for the calendar week 12/2020, the Israeli Technion and Rambam Hospital Clinic had developed and tested a simultaneous testing of samples taken by 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further analysis only if the combined sample showed a positive result. In Uganda on 5 February 2020, the BGI company had opened a temporary laboratory on the area of 2000 squares for finding extraordinary cases called Hoo-Jang (Chinese or Fire Eye), which could process more than 10 000 miles per day.
The lab was organized by the founder of BGI Van Zyan and completed in only five days; the modeling showed that if this lab had not been initiated in such a rapid pace, if the disease occurred in Hubei would have been 47 per cent more and, accordingly, quarantine costs would also be twice higher.
At the opening of the Uhan Laboratory, the Huo Jan laboratories in Shanchen, Tenzzine, Beijing and Shanghai were immediately opened in 12 cities of China.
By 4 March 2020, the total ability rates were 50,000 daily tests, which were released by open multiplexic Origami Assays, which could test up to 1,122 patients on COVID19 with only 93 samples. Such balanced structures could work in small labs, except for the use of robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, due to the lack of reactions and insufficient numbers, the mass testing in the EU, Britain and the United States has become difficult.
As a result, some authors have requested the test samples protocols which provide for the heating of samples at 98°C (208°F) for five minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the amount of testing for the coronavirus carried out by the United Arab Emirates on the soul of the population is above the indicators of any other country and that the majority of the population will soon be tested.
This occurred by the possibility of expression testing, along with the acquisition of a mass test laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (formed on the basis of their labs for the detection of emergency cases of Juo-Yan in China).
This laboratory, developed in 14 days, is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PRC tests a day and is the first in the world a so large lab that works outside China.
Various testing options for various parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted a German version of the production of test sets that are sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop their own sets.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States sanitation and epidemiological centres was not available until 28 January, which led to the lack of test sets in the United States.
In South Korea, according to experts, the broad availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the Government of South Korea has worked on providing opportunities for testing, mainly in private labs.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization encouraged the development of testing programmes as the best way to slow down the COVID-19 pandemic distribution. As a result of the increase in the demand for testing due to the rapid spread of the virus, many U.S. private laboratories, in which there were hundreds of thousands of samples of analysis, were overloaded, and the stocks of materials for the clothing of marrows and chemical reactors were rapidly exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the precision of its test sets.
The American test sets developed by CDC had “deficiencies” and therefore the Government removed bureaucracy barriers that prevented private test developments. Spain acquired test sets from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of these sets were incorrect.
The company explained that the cause of incorrect results could be a misconduct of samples or the wrong use of the sets.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would revoke the incorrect results and replace them with other sets — Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80 per cent of the test sets that Czech Republic has acquired were also incorrect. 1.2 million test sets acquired by Slovakia in China.
The Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they should be dropped into Dunay. Atesh Kara, a staff member of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the test sets acquired in China had “a high level of errors” and the Ministry had no use of them. Britain purchased 3.5 million test sets in China, but at the beginning of April 2020 was announced that these sets were uncomfortable.
The quarantine measures for persons whose analysis had a positive impact on SARS-CoV-2, as well as the monitoring of people contacted by such patients had positive results.
Researchers in the Italian city of V, where the first time in Italy died a person from COVID-19, conducted two testing cycles of around 3400 people in about ten days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were placed on quarantine.
The entry into the territories of the population was closed, and this measure has completely halted the spread of infection.
In the context of intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the Singapore was much less tense than in other developed countries, and there did not have to be extreme restrictions such as forced closing restaurants and shops.
Many events were cancelled there, and on 28 March Singapur began to urge the inhabitants to stay at home, but schools in which holidays ended on 23 March were opened by the schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also managed the pandemic by intense monitoring of contacts, entrance restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but limitations were less aggressive.
The statistics have shown that in countries where more tests have been conducted compared to the number of deaths, mortality rates have been much lower, probably because more patients with lowly expressed symptoms or lack of symptoms have been identified.
WHO recommends that countries with no resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative results to COVID-19 into one of the 16 WHO control laboratorys for confirming the testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The following schedule is dependent on the test policies adopted in a specific country.
The country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have higher positive results in percentages compared to the country where all citizens are tested, regardless of the existence of virus symptoms, under other equal conditions.
The washing of hands also known as “hygiene of hands” is a process of cleaning hands to remove pollution, fat, micro-organisms or other harmful substances.
Regular washing of hands with sauce at certain critical times during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera that are transmitted fecally orally.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or ordinary cold, for example, if he touches his eyes, his nose or mouth (this is slippery shells) with unauthorized hands.
Five critical moments during the day after which the hands of sauce should be washed: before and after defecation, after the washing of the baby's belly or the change of the peppers, before the baby's feeding, before food, and before and after the preparation of raw meat, fish and domestic birds.
If water and sauce are not available, the hands can be cleaned with gold. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
Do, during and after the preparation of food.
Before and after the treatment of a sick person.
After the change of the peppers or the washing of the child who went to the bathroom.
After sneaking, coughing or sneaking.
After touching animals, feed or waste of animal origin.
The medical hygiene of the hands refers to the hygiene of medical procedures.
Washing hands before taking medicinal products or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the dissemination of disease.
The primary medical goal of the washing of hands is to cleanse hands from patogens (bacteria, viruses or other micro-organisms capable of diseases), as well as chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who are preparing or working in medical fields, but it is also important to all other people.
The washing of hands is very useful for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious diarrhea, reduces respiratory infections,
and also reduces infant mortality at home.
The 2013 study showed that more quality laundering of hands could result in a small increase in the growth of children aged up to five years.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhea diseases may be reduced by acquiring simple habits such as washing hands with sauce.
This elementary procedure is able to reduce mortality from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminders on the benefit of hand-laundering may reduce the number of diarrhoea cases by approximately a third, compared to the benefit of low-water income regions.
Reducing the number of diarrhoeas by 48 per cent may be related to washing hands with sauce. Washing hands with sauce is the only most effective and low way to prevent diarrhoea and sharp respiratory diseases (ORS) under the conditions of developing relevant habits in each house, schools and other public places worldwide.
Pneumonia, one of the main complications of ORI, is the main cause of death among children aged up to five years of age, which lives about 1.8 million children per year.
Almost 3.5 million children die from diarrhoea and pneumonia every year.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund reports that washing hands with sauce before food and after the toilet becomes a strong habit may save more lives than any separate vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce the mortality of diarrhoea almost twice and the mortality of acute respiratory infection to a quarter.
The washing of hands is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out in water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
The washing of hands also prevents the occurrence of an impetigo, a disease transmitted in direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of frequent laundering of hands is that it can lead to drying the skin, and therefore to its damage.
The 2012 Danish study showed that too frequent laundering of hands can lead to skin-shuffled disease known as an exemption or dermatitis of hands, which is particularly widespread among health workers.
The too frequent laundering of hands may also be considered one of the symptoms of obsessive and compulsive disorders (OPC).
There are five so-called "critical moments" during the day when washing hands with sauce is important for reducing the risk of fecal oral transmission of disease: after disposal (smoking, defecation), after the washing of the baby's belly (swallowing), before feeding the child, before eating and/before preparing or processing of raw meat, fish or birds.
Some other cases where hands should be washed in order to prevent the transmission of disease: before or after the processing of a cut or wound, after sneaking, coughing or turkey, after touching animal waste or animal waste, after touching the trash.
In many countries, the washing of hands with sauce is very little.
Study on the washing of hands in 2015 in 54 countries showed that the average of 38.7 per cent of sauce washing families was generally accepted. Study of 2014 showed that 97 per cent was found in Saudi Arabia; the U.S. list was closer to the middle, the 77 per cent; the lowest rate was established in China to 23 per cent. There are currently several methodologies for the change in behavior and the development of the habit of washing hands in critical situations. In developing countries, the grouping of the hands of schools at the time of the day is one of the lowest methodologies that helps children learn about this procedure.
The programme of urgent medical assistance, implemented by the Ministry of Education, is an example of widespread activities to strengthen child health and to improve the education of children.
The national programme is based on degelmintization, which is conducted twice a year, as well as daily washing of hands with sauce and daily teeth cleaning.
The same programme is successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Micro-organisms are more effectively removed from each shelter when the washing process is added to sauce or washing.
The main action of the sauce and washing means is to eliminate barriers for solution and to improve its level.
Water itself is not considered an effective tool for skin cleaning, since fats and proteins that are part of organic pollution are badly dissolved in the water.
The sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the cleaning process.
The solid powder, due to repeated use, may also contain bacteria that may affect it in previous use.
A small number of studies devoted to each cover of bacteria from a polluted piece of solid sauce suggests that the bacteria is unlikely to be caught, as the bacteria washed with a pen.
The CDC still claims that “the grain sauce with the hand-dosator is preferable for the washing of hands”.
The antibacterial sauce is actively advertising in the health-keeping communities.
Today, there is no evidence that the use of the recommended anti-septical or disinfecting means has a selective impact on organisms that have sustainability to antibiotics on their own nature.
However, the antibacterial sauce contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclossane, to which many resistant organisms are sustainable.
Thus, even if antibiotics are not selective to antibacterial sauce, their efficiency may not be in conformity with the advertising.
In addition to the surface-activated substance and the means for the protection of skin, complex complications may contain acids (oxus, acorbine, milk) as an RN regulator, as well as an anti-microbial active gasoline acid and other sulphurs (oe faith, vitamins, mentol, plant extracts). The comprehensive analysis carried out by the School of Public Health of the University of Oregon showed that in the way of preventing diseases and disposal of bacteria from the skin, the simple variety of sauce was as effective as the usual antibacterial soap containing triclosans.
Hot water comfortable for human skin temperature is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria is multiplied much faster at the body temperature of 37°C.
However, to remove natural fats that contain pollution and bacteria, warm washing water is more effective than cold.
In contrast to the common view, research showed that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbe load on hand.
The disinficient tool for hand (sanitazer) or antiseptics for hand is a means of non-water hygiene.
At the end of the 1990s and early the 21st century, the tools for alcoholic hygiene have become popular (also known as disinficiency for alcoholic hands, antiseptic means for disinfecting hands or sanitation).
Most of these funds are produced on the basis of isopropyl spirt or ethanol with a supplementary carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of helicopter, or moisters such as glycerine in a liquid or pen, providing the comfort of the use of these means and reducing the drying effect of skin alcohol.
The additive of the dissolved hydrogen oxygen further increases anti-microbial activity, and the disinficiency of minimum 60 to 95 per cent of the spirte is effectively destruction of microbes.
Disinficiency on the basis of alcohol kill bacteria, including multiple medicine sustainability bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis stick and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rinovirus, vaccine, flu and hepatitis) and mushrooms.
The disinficient funds containing 70 per cent of spirt kill 99.97 per cent of bacteria (bacteria reduction 3.5 similar to 35 decibels) on hand 30 seconds after the use and 99.99% to 99.999 per cent of bacteria (bacteria reductions 4 to 5) on hand in one minute after use. Dezinfeking tools for hand are the most effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Disinficiencies on the basis of alcohol are practically ineffective against norroviral viruses (or Norwalk) of type, the most common cause of infectious gastroenterity. It is necessary to use sufficient antiseptic or spirt-containing means to carefully process and reconcile the skin of hands on both sides.
The face and rear surface of both arms, as well as the space between the fingers all over the length of about 30 seconds, until the liquid, pen or helmet are fully emptied.
The United States Centre for Control and Prevention of Disabilities recommends choices for the washing of hands rather than the use of disinfective means, especially if the hands are severely polluted.
The increase in the popularity of such disinfective means is due to the simpleness of their use and rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be replaced by full washing of hands if there is a possibility to use water and sauce.
The frequent use of disinficiency for alcoholic hands may cause the dryness of the skin if it does not contain mitigatory means and (or) skin moisters.
The effect of drying the skin can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and (or) other mitigating substances into the funds.
In clinical trials, disinficiencies for alcoholic hands containing mitigating components have caused significantly less irritation and dryness of skin than sauce or antimicrobial washing.
Allergic contact dermatite, contact coating syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or supplements present in disinfecting means are practically not arising.
The lowest probability of an irritating contact dermatite has been a factor in selecting disinfective funds compared to sauce and water.
Despite its efficiency, water-free means do not cleanse hands from organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, disinficiencies for hands are not so effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic micro-organisms, such as ordinary sauce and water, as pathogenic micro-organisms are still in hand.
The efficiency of the disinficiency of non-spirit arms depends significantly on components and compositions, and historically was significantly lower than the spirt or spirt-containing.
It has recently been proven that the medicines in which the benzalconium chloride is used have a steady and cumulative antimicrobic activity, in contrast to the spirt, which has been proven to lose efficiency after repeated use, probably due to progressive side effects.
Many people in low income communities cannot afford sauce and replace it with gold or clay.
Zola or clay can be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than sauce.
One of the problems with this method is that if clay or evil are polluted by micro-organisms, it may, on the contrary, increase the spread of disease.
Like the sauce, the gold is a disinfective tool, as the water-containing solution forms a gastrointestinal solution.
If the sauce is not available, the WHO alternative recommends use of evil or sand.
In order to prevent the infection, the United States Centre for Disease Control recommends that the laundering technique includes the following phases:
Shake your hands under warm or cold flowing water.
It is recommended that water is stream, because waters can be polluted, but the water temperature is not relevant.
Wash your hands, washing them with a large amount of sauce, including the back side of your arms, as well as the area between your fingers and the nails.
The sauce removes microbes from the skin, and studies show that in use of sauce (and not only one water) people are inclined to wash their hands more carefully.
Shake your hands at least 20 seconds.
It helps to remove microbes from the skin, and the longer you shake your hands, the more microbes are removed.
Keep your hands shaved carefully under the flowing water.
Shakeing hands in the standing water may cause a reinfection.
Wash your hands with clean arms or let them dry on your own.
Wet and wet hands are more polluted, and most often people leave the areas of such as a big finger, wrist, the area between their fingers and their nails.
Artificial nails and acute nail can contain many micro-organisms.
It is often recommended to use a moist lozone to prevent the drying of the skin of the hands that can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If the water and sauce are not available, there are many different ways of laundering hands: water pouring from a hanging canist or bottle tube with holes and (or) use of gold, if necessary, for example in developing countries. In areas with limited water supply (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries) there are water saving decisions, such as knife pedal cranks and other low-dear options.
A cran with a knife pedal is a simple structure consisting of ingredients hanged on the rope, and a knife, which should be pressed to make the water lean on the hands, and a piece of sauce should be used.
Effective handcuff is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but some disputes are being held on the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing number of studies shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric dryers for hands that are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the Westminster University in London was conducted by a study sponsored by the European Symposia for paper salts and towels; the study was compared to the level of hygiene of paper towels, hot air dryers and more modern air dryers for hand.
It was found that after washing and drying of hands in a warm air, the total number of bacteria on finger pillows average increased by 194 per cent and the arms were 254 per cent.
It was also clear that, after washing and drying hands in the airflow drying, the total number of bacteria on the fingers increased by 42 per cent and the hands were 15 per cent.
After washing and drying hands with paper bricks, the total number of bacteria on fingers in the average decreased to 76 per cent and on the hands to 77 per cent. Scientists also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-infection of several toilet rooms and the toilet environment at each type of dryer.
The air drill that releases the air with the declared speeds 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 miles/h) is able to remove micro-organisms from the hands and from its own bloc and potentially infect other toilet users and sanuzzle in the radius of up to 2 metres.
The use of heat air dryers spreads micro-organisms within a radius of up to 0.25 meters from drying.
No significant distribution of micro-organisms has been detected in the use of papers. In 2005, T&V Product und Umwelt conducted a study on the evaluation of various hand drying methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the hand drying method:
There are many different hand drying producers, and hand dryers compare to dry paper bricks.
Cleaning hands with disinfecting sulphurs can be an alternative solution during the journeys without sauce and water.
The disinficiency tool on the alcoholic basis should contain at least 60 per cent of the spirt.
The medical method of washing hands has become obligatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignac Zemelways discovered its high efficiency (in 1846) in prevention of diseases in stationary conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget.
According to one study, the use of such devices really helps to reduce the level of infection.
Medical washing of hands lasts at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of sauce, water or hel for washing and washing each part of the hands.
Hands should be thoroughly wiped on each other by screaming your fingers.
If there is dirt under the nails, the brush can be used to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water present on their hands, it is important to wash them well and to wipe the dry clean towels.
After the drying of the hands, closing the cran and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, the paper towel should be used.
This allows us to avoid reconciliation of hands from these surfaces.
The aim of washing hands at medical institutions is to remove pathogenic micro-organisms ("microbs") and prevent them from spreading.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the order of washing hands remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: many doctors and nurses are regularly forgetting to wash their hands before they touch patients and thus spread micro-organisms.
According to one study, the correct washing of hands and other elementary procedures may reduce the level of bleeding infections related to the use of the categories by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization published a leaflet with the image of the standard washing and hand processing that should be applied in the health sector.
The WHO ' s Hygiene Instrument is also available on its website and open for public discussion.
The Whitby review was conducted in collaboration.
If it is necessary to confirm compliance with the regulatory requirements, commercial devices can be used to measure indicators and verify the hygiene of the hands.
The World Health Organization marks “five moments” when it is necessary to wash the hands:
after contact with blood or biological liquids,
Before the use of antiseptics, as well as
After the treatment of the patient. Adding antiseptical chemicals to washing hands (medicnic) or an antimicrobic sauce) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be needed before surgical operations or in the middle of a high content of antibiotic organisms. To clean the hands against surgical operations, cranes that can be included and disabled without touching their hands; also a little chlorhexidine or iodine water should be used to lay hands, sterille hand-launds for washing, sterille brushing and other sterille cleaning tools.
All decorations must be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of hands and precipitation to the elbow usually within 2 to 6 minutes.
There's no need to wash your hands too long, for example, ten minutes.
During the slaughter, the water from the precipitation should not fall back into the wrists of its hands.
After the washing is completed, their hands dry with sterille tissue and wear surgical coat.
In order to reduce the spread of microbes, it is better to wash your hands or use antiseptics for hand before and after the treatment of a sick person.
To combat staphilococ infections in the hospitals, it was found that the first 20 per cent of the washing of hands was most of the benefit, and that very few additional benefits were received when the laundering frequency was increased by more than 35 per cent.
In comparison with antibacterial sauce, the washing of hands with ordinary sauce results in more than three times the increase in the frequency of bacterial infections transmitted through food. The comparison of hand-bacterial disorders and antibacterial sauce, in average by 30 seconds for each procedure, indicated that the processing of hand-containing spiral solution reduced bacterial pollution by 26 per cent compared to antibacterial sauce.
However, the powder and water are more effective than the alcoholic solutions for hand, in terms of reducing the number of flu A H1N1 virus and the dispute Clostridium diphphile. The activities for the development of the Hygiene of hands in medical institutions can include training of personnel by washing hands, improving the availability of spiral solutions for hand, as well as the written and oral reminders of the personnel of the need to wash their hands.
Additional studies are required on the most effective types of measures in various medical institutions.
In developing countries, the washing of hands with sauce is recognized as a economically effective and important tool for improving health and even nutrition.
However, the lack of stable water supply, sauce or means for washing hands in houses, schools and jobs makes the habit of regularly washing hands.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are far from any private or public toilets to wash hands, although there are also cheap ways to organize washing hands in such places.
However, insufficient arm hygiene can also be caused by rooted habits, not by lack of sauce or water.
Propaganda and promotion of washing hands with sauce can affect political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of washing hands and lead to long-term changes in population behaviour.
In order to ensure that such measures are effective, monitoring and evaluation should be carried out.
During the 70 studies, it is found that, in order to improve the healthy-hand situation in countries below the average level, the health and epidemic surveillance of the community, while public marketing campaigns are less effective, and one of the examples of propaganda for the laundering of hands in schools is the approach of the United Nations Children ' s Fund for the United Nations: it promotes the implementation of simple economic measures in schools that stimulate the washing of hands by students using sauce and other hygienic requirements.
By ensuring compliance with the minimum standards, schools can increase their level from one to three stars.
The establishment of manuscripts is one of the possible measures carried out under the information campaigns on hand-hygiene to reduce the level of illness and child mortality.
The World Day of Washing Hand (Global Hand Washing Day) is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour. As a result of the pandemic of the coronavirus 2019-20 years, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use of emodzi symbolising the washing of hands.
During some studies, the overall efficiency of laundering of hands in developing countries was considered compared to the DALYs indicator (life without disabilities preserved).
However, one study suggests that the stimulation of washing hands with sauce is a much more economic solution compared to other sanitation measures.
The importance of washing hands for human health, especially for vulnerable categories of people such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the middle of the 19th century by two innovators in the field of hygiene of hand: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis (Ignaz Semelweis), who worked in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale, English nurse and “the founder of modern care for patients”.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by dirty smells called miasms.
In the 1980s, in connection with the explosions of diseases spreading through the food tract and infections related to medical assistance, the United States Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases in the United States began to enhance the promotion of hygiene of hands as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the explosion of pig flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries began to understand the importance of washing hands with sauce to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, along with public toilet mannels and office buildings and airports, the posters with “right hand-laundering techniques” were deployed.
The phrase “moving hands” means that it is unwanted to accept responsibility for anything or to be participating in anything.
It comes from the Bible, Matthew’s Gospel: Pontius Pilate ‘ washed his hands ’ when making a decision on Jesus Christ’s dispatch; the phrase later became more wider in some English communities.
In the Shakespeare Macbeth play, Lady McBett begins to wash her hands in an inadmissible attempt to cleanse from the imaginary spot, symbolizing the unclean conscience, in connection with the crimes she committed herself and encouraged her husband.
It was also established that people who remembered or observed any non-ethical acts were more likely to wash their hands compared to other people, and the handmakers were more important to them.
Furthermore, it is less likely that people who have the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing will participate in any other “clearing” compensatory activities, such as voluntary activities.
In religions, the washing of hands is both a higienical goal and symbolic. The symbolic washing of hands with water, but without sauce, is part of the ritual provided in many religions, including bahaism, hinduism, tevils, and netilate yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe the hygienic washing of hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam prescribe the mandatory washing of hands after the toilet visit.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sykhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash the hands before and after taking food.
Manufacturing factors in connection with COVID-19
The productive control of COVID-19 implies the use of labour safety and health methods to control the risk and combating the coronavirus of 2019 (CIVID-19).
Suitable risk control in the workplace depends on the place and job, based on the assessment of risks, the seriousness of the situation with the community and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Office for Labour Protection and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) reported that the posts with less risk have minimal vocational contacts with public and colleagues, and in such cases basic measures are required to combat infection, including hand-laundering, stimulating workers to stay at home with symptoms of illness, compliance with the respiratory label and conducting daily cleaning and disinfections of the environment.
The medium risks require common or close contacts with people who have no confirmed or suspected COVID-19, but are likely to be infected with the ongoing dissemination of society or international travel.
Such a category may include public-related workers, such as schools, work environments with high density and some large stores.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to the basic measures to prevent the infection, include aircraft using high-effective air filters, the use of protective screens and accessible personal protection for contact with the person infected by COVID-19.
OSHA believes that medical institutions and morgue staff contacting a person with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 are high-risk and that the risk increases to very high in the conduct of such agricultural education procedures, or the collection/processing of human samples with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
The risk control measures suitable for such staff include the use of engineering security facilities, such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure, as well as the means of personal protection suitable for the task.
The COVID-19 explosion may have a variety of job impacts.
Workers may be absent at work in connection with their own disease, the need for care for other persons or the fear of possible infection.
Commercial templates may be changed both with regard to the types of goods that are demanded and the means of acquisition of such goods (e.g. buying in non-peek periods of delivery or service without leaving the car).
Finally, possible conquests with the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19 can be used by the Protection Plan for Epidemic Preparation and Responsible Action.
Plans deal with risks related to various jobs and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors of home and community, as well as risk factors of individual workers such as age or chronic diseases.
The plans also indicate the means of control necessary to address such risks and the emergency plans for situations that may result in the epidemic.
Plans for preparation for epidemic and response may be subject to national or state-level recommendations.
Some of the goals to ensure response to the epidemic: reduction in the spread of the virus among staff, protection of people under greater risk of serious health complications, maintenance of business operations and minimization of negative consequences for other organizations in their supply chains.
Responsible measures affect the degree of seriousness of diseases in the community where business is.
The risk control hierarchy is a structure widely used in ensuring safety and labour hygiene for the grouping of such funds depending on the effectiveness.
In the absence of the risk of COVID-19, the most effective engineering security, then administrative measures and, finally, personal protection.
Security engineering means the isolation of employees from job risks and do not rely on the behavior of the employee, which may be the most economically profitable decision.
Administrative measures imply a change in working policies or procedures required by a worker or staff member.
Personal protection (PPE) is considered less effective compared to engineering or administrative measures, but can help to address some risks.
All types of personal protection must be selected depending on the threat to the worker, the size (e.g. respirators), to be used permanently and properly, to be regularly checked, maintained and replaced as appropriate and correctly removed, cleaned and stored or used to avoid the infection.
The U.S. Office for Labour Protection and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) believes that the posts with the minimum risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all workplaces include frequent and careful laundering of hands, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, respect for respiratory labels, including closing the mouth by coughing and sneaking, providing salts and containers for trash, ready for remote or shift work, where necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, as well as daily cleaning and disinfecting of the environment.
Fast detection and isolation of persons who may be infected potentially is a critical step to protect workers, clients, visitors and others at workplace.
The U.S. Centers to combat diseases and prevention (CDC) recommends that staff with symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home before the heat ceases, lack of a body temperature and many other symptoms within 24 hours without the use of hepatitis or other symptoms, as well as prescribes flexibility of hospital politics, allow staff to stay at home to care for a sick family member and to ensure that staff are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, the medium-level risk posts require common and close contacts at a distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) to persons with no confirmed data or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, but there is a probability of SARS-CoV-2 dissemination in the territory of business, or in relation to recent visits of such a person to the COVID-19 dissemination site.
Such categories include public contact workers, such as schools, high density and some large diversity shops. The engineering and safety facilities for such groups and groups with a higher risk are the establishment of high-effective air filters, the increase of the intensity of the ventilation, the installation of physical barriers, such as transparent plastic protective screens, and the mounting of the windows for customer service without leaving the car. Administrative measures for such group and groups of higher risk include recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, to replace personal meetings for communications with virtual means, indicating the change of schedules, termination of non-critical travels to the area of COVID-19, the development of communication plans in emergency situations, including the responses appropriate, insufficient responses, incentives, prevention and preventive mechanisms, prevented by other workers, and prevented by means of prevention, and prevented by the mechanisms, and prevented by prevented mechanisms
In rare cases, risk workers from such a group may need to carry respirators.
If a person is sick in a plane, for the safety of workers and other passengers, measures such as isolation of a sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, appointment of any member of the crew to care for a sick person, the provision of a sick mask, or the treatment of a person with a request to cover his nose and mouth with a cough or chewing.
Second-step crew members should wear one-time medical gloves when approaching a sick traveller or in relation to physical liquids or potentially infected surfaces and possibly additional means of personal protection if the patient has a fever, a regular cough or respiratory difficulty.
The use of gloves and other one-time items should be placed in a biologically safe bag and the infected surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected. In cases with commercial shipships, including crusades and other passenger ships, the safety measures are to be deferred in case of illness, self-izolation and immediate information of the health centre on the ship when there is a heat or other symptoms on board.
In ideal, the medical survey should be carried out in the isolated cabinet of such a person. In the case of schools and care institutions, the CDC recommends a short-term closing for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the dissemination of the community.
With the minimum or medium level of dissemination of the infection in the community, social distant strategies may be implemented, such as dismissal of private meetings, meetings and other mass activities such as exercises by physical or chronic singing, food reception in cafeteria, increased distance between ports, arrival control and care, restriction of non-existent visits, use of a separate location of health institutions for children with flu symptoms.
In a significant rate of dissemination in the local community, in addition to social distant strategies, the measures may be considered to be considered to be low for the long non-school. For law enforcement officers who perform daily responsibilities, the direct risk to health is considered to be low, according to the CDC.
The law enforcement officers responsible for contacting persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of the infected COVID-19 are encouraged to follow the same instructions that are prescribed to the relief agents, including the use of appropriate means of personal protection.
In the event of close contact during detention, workers should clean and disinfect their formed belts and crews before re-use by house cleaning aircraft or by washing, comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the dissemination of illness and the use of personal protection, as well as with the use and washing of clothes.
OSHA believes that some of the categories of health and morgue workers are high or very highly risked.
High-risk posts include medical assistance, support, laboratory staff and medical transport, contacting patients with confirmed diagnosis or expected infections of COVID-19.
They have a high risk of infection in conducting procedures accompanied by aerosol education or in collecting/processing samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or alleged infections of COVID-19.
The procedures accompanied by the aerosol education include sondying, coughing, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and surveys or sampling invasive methods.
High-risked morgue workers are employees who are processing bodies with confirmed illness or suspicion of COVID-19 infected at their death; if such officers have an autopsy, they are in a very high risk category; additional engineering and safety facilities for such groups include the use of isolated facilities for patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of COVID-19, including in the conduct of procedures accompanied by the aerosol education.
In some health and morgue institutions, an effective measure may be the use of special ventilation with negative pressure.
The samples should be treated with the precautions provided for for the level of biosafety 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come to a distant expectation zone depending on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other personal protection measures, OSHA recommends that respirators be used to interact up to 6 feet with patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2, as well as those conducting procedures accompanied by the aerosol education.
In the United States, NOSH-approval respirators for N95 or higher-class filters should be used within a comprehensive programme of respiratory protection, which indicates the requirements for individual fund selection and medical surveys.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for the staff. WHO does not recommend use of special clothing, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease transmitted rather than physical liquidity.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for the patient's recruitment.
Persons collecting samples from respiratory paths in patients with COVID-19 or transmitters of this disease without procedures accompanied by the aerosol education, WHO recommends that wear surgical masks, protective glasses or protective screens for the face, coat and gloves.
The N95 or FFP2 respirator should be carried in procedures accompanied by the aerosol education.
In view of the inadequate inactivity of individual protection across the world, WHO recommends that only those who provide direct care, minimise the need for such protection through the use of remote medicine, physical barriers, such transparency, the access to the COVID-19 patient, only those who provide direct care, the use of the means of personal protection needed for specific purposes, the continuous use of the same respirator, without taking off, with multiple patients with identical diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protection and recommendations for persons who have no symptoms.

TOTAL: [Covid-19] Relief for loading and preparation for future
DATE/Time of amendment: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LISTMENTS: CC0: Protected rights are absent
This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that has made light on the relationship of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We had no precedents of such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to compass, collaborate and development of communities worldwide, which is based on such organization.
We have seen the social and caring relationship between all our colleagues, reflected in the electronic mailing, calls and chats, a wonderful confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, we are working with amazing people.
I speak with great gratitude and pride about you as colleagues.
Last week, I was informed of a high evaluation of our work.
I was reminded of how important the opportunity for the world to contact Wikipedia right now and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible because of your work, whether to ensure the employment of sites, paying our colleagues or protecting the community.
The world needs information presented in Wikipedia, and today it is even more important than ever before.
At this time, not only what we do is important to achieve significant results for the world, but also how we do it.
With regard to the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the order of our joint work, starting from the next week.
Correction of the order of our work and schedules
As Robin had previously said, the c-team team was gathered last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
During the communication, we have considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
The suppressing majority of us wanted to remove the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to retire, let it be that way.
For all personnel, contractors and foreign staff:
We expect to have to work about 4 hours per day or 20 hours a week before the following orders are made.
We do not announce the weekends: if you can work normally for more hours, this is permitted for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs are, whether you care for your family, get food goods or go to your doctor's reception, your welfare is our priority number one.
We're not watching your working time.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
It is understandable and undoubted, but we mention it.
No hospital leave or holiday is required: just inform your manager and help the team to review the calendar and work schedule to ensure the coverage of key areas.
(If you have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, inform Brian from T&C Ops, so that T&C can provide support and due attention from your situation).
The salary of the time rates will be carried out in full.
We have already announced and reaffirmed our intention to fulfil our obligations to our contractors and staff with timely salary rates.
Each person will receive payments under normal time rates applicable under normal circumstances.
This, in particular, implies sickness periods when you can't work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use the job as a way to make their efforts towards peace around us.
What we do can bring surprising results, especially in these times.
And again, it's about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your leader so that we can know what to expect, and we can correct our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered significant.
We must always support such activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising teams (in addition) are doing critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating the process for all units to assess the current objectives and emphasize support, which is essential for our mission.
There are many tasks for each of us, and we are just focusing on the most important projects.
The delay today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work “double more to overcome the missed” after the completion of the pandemic.
You will not have to work overtime to comply with the unreal deadlines for the current time.
We acknowledge that the circumstances have changed, and we will work on the setting of new goals and deadlines as possible.
What is going on with APP (annual plans)?
In order to build up a new reality and expectations of the daily working time, we intend to adjust the deadlines for the implementation of our Year Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose a prolongation of time for our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for the budgeting, allowing staff to pay priority to critical work, self-help and care for their loved ones, and with all those who need or want to work will provide a reduced schedule for the next few weeks.
Such extension allows to significantly reduce the current load of planning and tension throughout the organization.
The next week we will present our proposal to the Council, inform the representatives and teams of the relevant information on the following steps immediately after the receipt of an appropriate confirmation.
Thank the APP team for the leading role in this work.
Status of office, risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco could be infected by the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to many precautions, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the office in San Francisco.
They used anti-viral medical class decisions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as for reception and elevator halls, which allow access to our floor.
The building applies to its own rules to observe caution with the use of products providing the safety of their renters.
We feel that the office will be well prepared until we decide to return.
Our office in Colombia (DC) is in the WeWork network, which shared with us and all the DC staff, with its rules related to COVID-19.
Last week, our office in Colombia was fully transferred to a remote work in accordance with the instructions entered in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues from New York were aware, we also discussed the rental of a premises in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but they can be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working away for the first time.
Our old colleagues working remotely know about the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings be limited to one or two hours.
If you need to take longer sessions, consider how to break them into a course of several days.
Determine clearly the objective of the meeting, the agenda and beforewards the materials for awareness.
Defaultly use video connections, to facilitate interaction and communication tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
To be comfortable, appoint a co-ordinator, a person who will monitor the admission of issues in the chat and control the list of speakers, as well as responsible for the conduct of notes (or joint conspection).
If necessary, please contact the e-mail technical support service.
Use your advantages on the Wellness Reimbursement programme when you acquire breakfast.
Connect to the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work.
The HR Operations team is studying ergonomics guidelines available in the web format to promote the efficiency of allocated work throughout the organization.
Last week, we asked all the recipients of the community to cancel the mass activities funded by Wikimedia, such as "editathons", until the WHO announces the completion of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such abolition and other restrictions may result in the impossibleness of agreed grant activities, and no one will be punished for delays or changes in such purposes.
In the next week, we will conduct follow-up activities with additional Wikimanania instructions as well as other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
Universal moods in the global community are not only a distress about the discontinuation of work but also a sense of relief in terms of understanding and the opportunity to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia, and not only.
With regard to the prospects, CRT is working on the Meta-Wiki page, which will provide space for the community to monitor the impact and communication.
We remain on issues related to COVID-19
We will send to your calendar an invitation to a special staff meeting, which will be held on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we will use the opportunity to further share the relevant information, answer your questions and spend time together with each other.
We are together in this situation and are willing to help everything we can.
You can continue to receive information from such electronic mailing and other important information on COVID-19 from the Wiki Office.
CRT will update such pages and all information will be gathered in one place.
We are also working on maintaining regular communication with personnel living in countries that have significantly affected the current situation.
With regard to travel, activities, key working streams, information lighting problems or other assistance, please contact the CRT.
We are willing to support and make communication as necessary.
With the problems of confidentiality, please contact Brian Judan (Bryan Judan), director of HR International Global Operations.
No such changes should be considered as refusal from our work and our obligations.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible current need for a cardially new adaptation of our work and obligations.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to provide the opportunity to continue work, to provide the necessary support for our movement and the world through the necessary service.
Our plan will wait until the time is appropriate.
Today is the time to support each other and create a space for the important work that is ongoing in the coming weeks and perhaps months.
In order to do so, we will need help from every one of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and work with the greatest relief as soon as the need comes.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and other Leadership Team participants (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the external surface of cells in lungs, arteries, hearts, kidneys and wombs.
ACE2 contradicts the activity of angiotensin conversion enzyme (ACE), reducing the content of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution to the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as an entry point for some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
An Angiotensin transforming enzyme 2 is a cink-containing metal ferment located on the surface of endotelal and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-conclusive Peptidas Domain M2 and the C-conclusive Domain of Renal Amino acid Collectrine.
ACE2 is a one-way membrane protein of type I, its fermentatively active domain falls on the surface of the lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 in cellular domain is vaccinated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddaza, and the dissolved protein is released into the bleeding and eventually released with urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most alveolar cells of light type II, fragile entrances, arterial and venomial endotelal cells and smooth muscles of artery of most organs.
Biosynthesis of ACE2 iRNK is also found in the brain core of the brain, the stray, the hypothalamus and the brain body.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE opposite.
ACE is diluting angiotensin I hormone into condemning angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, dissolves the carbon amino acid of phenylalanine II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into a vasodilator angiotensin (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also dilute a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] - bradikinin, appeline, neurotensin, dinorfin A and greline.
ACE2 also regulates membrane transportation of neutral amino acids SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves the main entry point for certain coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (viral caused by SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (covid-19 virus).
Strictly speaking, the linking of the S1 spike of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the fermentative domain ACE2 on the surface of the cells leads to endocotose and translocation of both virus and endosome enzyme within the cells.
This entry process also requires the serial protease of the TMPRS2, which is currently inhibited as a potential therapeutic tool, and it has led some to think that ACE2 levels reduction in cells can help to combat infection.
However, many professional communities and regulatory bodies recommend that the standard therapy continue with APF and BRA inhibitors.
According to the systematic review and metaanalysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of APF inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34 per cent compared to the control group”.
Furthermore, “the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients receiving APF inhibitors who have been more risked by pneumonia, especially patients with infarction and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors has also been associated with reducing mortality from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than patients with the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a new innovation in therapy with acute injuries of the lung and apparently improves lung hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with a respiratory insufficiency syndrome caused by lipopopolisaharids.
The period of semi-exhaust rhACE2 is approximately 10 hours and starts at 30 minutes, except for the length of 24 hours.
Some data indicate that rhACE2 may become a multipromissible tool for people with non-tolerance of classic inhibitors of the renin-Angiotensive system (RAS ringibitors) or for diseases in which the circulated angiotensin II has been evaluated in clinical trials in the treatment of a severe respiratory dyspiratory syndrome.
The COVID-19 annexes are programming applications for mobile phones intended to assist in epidemiological investigations in the conditions of the coronavirus pandemic 2019-20, i.e. in identifying persons (contacts) which could contact an infected person.
Several applications officially supported by the authorities have been developed or proposed in some regions.
Several options have been developed to monitor contacts.
This led to a debate on confidentiality issues, especially on systems based on the geographical location of the app users.
More softly in this regard options include the use of Bluetooth signals to register user closeness to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would integrate their efforts to integrate such applications based on Bluetooth directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government, together with Alipay, developed an annex that allows citizens to verify whether they were in contact with people infected by COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore it is used as a TraceTogether application.
The annex has been developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be transmitted to the Government. North Macedonia has launched the application “StopCorona!” working at Bluetooth, helping to track contacts with potentially infected persons and providing operational communications with health authorities.
The annex was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As at 14 April 2020, the app expected registration at Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking annex is at the final stage of the development and will be available for deployment within several weeks. Similar applications are planned to be launched in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering the possibility of using applications on the basis of the Singapore TraceTogether and the BlueTrace Protocol. Russia intends to use the application with the geosonation function, which aims to ensure that COVID-19 patients living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a security professor, Cambridge University, highlights a number of potential practical problems that can occur with systems based on annexes, including false processing and potential ineffectiveness in the application only a small part of the population.
Given the concern of the dissemination of deceptive or harmful “coronovirus” annexes, Apple limited the list of organizations that can offer their applications related to coronavirus, including only “official” or other reliable organizations in this list.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
Confidentiality campaigns expressed concern about the effects of mass monitoring of the population through the applications related to the coronavirus; inter alia, the question was whether the monitoring infrastructure would be unmounted to combat the coronavirus pandemic when the threat was disappeared.
The International Amnesty Organization and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for a restriction of such supervision.
The organizations announced eight conditions to public projects:
Observation must be ‘lawful, necessary and proportionate’;
Enlargement of monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by reservations on the limitation of the deadline;
The use of data should be limited to the goals of combating the distribution of COVID-19;
The safety and anonymity of the data must be protected and evidence of such protection should be provided;
Digital monitoring should exclude cases of aggravating discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be determined at the level of law;
The protection of abuses and the right of citizens to respond to abuse must be guaranteed;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple offer their joint plan to address the problem of continuous monitoring, which is to remove the monitoring mechanism from their operating systems as soon as it is necessary.
In some countries, a network monitoring of the location is used instead of annexes, excluding the need to load the annex and to avoid monitoring.
The network monitoring was approved in Israel.
Network solutions that have access to sources of location also have major potential problems with confidentiality.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of systems have been developed to maintain confidentiality that use central servers only to communicate (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-exploratory system was used to monitor contacts.
Instead of using the special application, the system gathered information on monitoring from various sources, including monitoring of mobile devices and transactions with maps, and then combined them to provide text messages that were sent to potentially infected persons.
The Government has not only used this information to prevent citizens from potential contacts with infected persons, but has also made information on the location of public accessible, which has been possible due to substantial changes in the legislation on the protection of information that had been introduced after the explosion of the MERS in that country.
The access to such information can be obtained through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider the possibility of using both centralized systems and systems that maintain confidentiality.
As at 6 April 2020, details have not yet been published.
The monitoring of contacts that maintain confidentiality is a sustainable concept, a significant number of research literature dated by at least 2013. More than ten expert groups worked on decisions providing confidentiality, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register user approaches to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized tracing with the preservation of confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols to ensure confidentiality, monitoring mechanisms (PACT) and other.
These protocols are responsible for never leaving the device, and all the comparisons were on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is working on the development of SafePaths, a platform to maintain confidentiality in the collection and use of data on location or crossing paths to monitor the distribution of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on the studies contained in the document “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” (Huliganese annexes: how to maintain confidentiality during the epidemic), published in March 2020. Another similar project is the Safe Trace platform developed by Enigma MPC, the developer of confidentiality technology, which was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technologies that allow users to exchange confidential data on location and health with other users and officials without risking the confidentiality of those data.
On 5 April 2020, a global TCN coalition was established by groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols, aiming at reducing fragmentation and ensuring global compatibility of the monitoring and notification applications, which is a key factor in widespread distribution.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it opened the source code of BlueTrace used in its official application.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control mobile Android and iOS platforms, announced the contact tracking initiative that they claimed to ensure confidentiality, which is based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography.
They also published the technical features of basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system must be developed at three stages:
Deployment of instruments allowing Governments to create official applications to monitor the movement of civilians infected by the coronavirus but with the preservation of data confidentiality
Integration of this operation directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple planned to solve permanent monitoring problems, first introducing the system through the update of the operating system and then removed it in the same way after the threat was disappeared.
Repository of the medicinal product (also known as reprofilement, redirection, change of tasks or therapeutic redirection) is the re-profiling of the approved medicinal product in order to treat disease or medical condition excellent from the disease initiated in the development.
This is one of the scientific studies that are currently used to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment methods.
Other studies include the development of COVID-19 vaccine and the reconvalescent plasma transmission. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 proteins subject to the effects of medicinal products, each of which has several leagues.
Analysis of these linking parts is an appropriate basis for developing an effective antiviral product against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important protein targets for SARS-CoV-2 are the papain-like protease, the RNA-dependent RNC-polimeraze, helicopter, S proteins and ADF-ribophosphatease.
Hussein AA and coautors in their doclinical study studied several candidates, which were then optimized, and analysed their similarity by the structure with the most approved medicinal products to accelerate the development of high-effective drug against SARS-CoV-2, which would be recommended for clinical studies.
Chlorochin is an anti-malary medicine that is also used to treat some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chlorochin and associated hydroxichlorochin would be included in four medicinal products studied under the clinical test “Solidarity”.
The Governor of New York Andrew Kuomo announced that chlorochin and hydroxichlorochin tests would begin in New York on 24 March. On 28 March, FDA allowed the use of hydroxichlorochin sulfat and chlorochin phosphate in accordance with the urgent authorisation for application (EUA).
The treatment scheme has not been approved during the FDA clinical trials and is only authorised in accordance with EUA as an experimental treatment for immediate assistance for patients who have been hospitalized but cannot be treated in clinical trial schemes.
CDC stated that “the order of use, dose or duration of the administration of hydroxychlorochin for prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2” has not yet been established.
The doctors say they use the medicine when “there is no way”.
The Turkish Research Group in Istanbul conducted a small study on chlorochin in combination with cynic and vitamins A, C and D.
The large-scale studies are conducted at the University of Duke and the Oxford University.
The New York University Medical School in Langon studies the safety and efficiency of the preventive use of hydroxychlorochin.
China's clinical trials in Uhan and Schenchengen showed that the favipiravir was “specially effective”.
35 patients in Schenchen, who had taken this medicine, had been negative in average 4 days, while 45 patients who were not taking the drugs were 11 days.
A study was conducted in Uhana with 240 patients with pneumonia, one half of which received favipiravir and the other half was umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Office reminded the public that the results of the effectiveness of the product should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that, to fill its stocks, the product will be purchased in Japan and its delivery to university hospitals where the medicinal product will be used to treat patients with COVID-19 is used by military resources.
According to the South China Morning Post, Cindzo Abe reported Trampa's administration that the product could be less effective in the illness-related cases.
It may be dangerous for pregnant patients or patients who are trying to become pregnant.
According to one study on the combination of antiviral medicinal products “lopinavir” and “ritonavir” (Kaletra), it was concluded that “a productivity has not been detected”.
The preparations were developed to inhibit the HIV replication by linking the protease.
The University Research Group of Colorado is trying to modify medicinal products to find a link to the SARS-CoV-2 Protease. In the scientific community, it criticizes the reprofiling of medicines that have been specially developed for HIV and AIDS therapy.
WHO included a combination of lopinavir and rhytonavir into the international solidarity test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat the Ebola virus and the Marbour virus infections. The staff of the Gilead Sciences have discovered that the remdesivir has antivirus activity in vitro with regard to the multiple fillo, pneumo, paramixo and coronavirs.
One of the problems related to antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and transmission.
Some early preliminary studies show that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance, and there are currently several clinical trials, including two Cleveland university clinics; one is conducted in patients with moderate form of disease, and the other is in patients with a more severe form.
Three clinical trials are currently carried out for the intravenous introduction of vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without the use of placebo (Italy).
On 24 March 2020, the antibiotics of acidromicine began to be tested in New York.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical study of Alvesco (cyclesonide) Tajina, the inhalation corticosteroid for the treatment of astma for its use in the treatment of pre-symphomic patients infected by the new coronavir.
The test of phase II, the form of angiotensin transforming enzyme 2, is conducted with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria, hospitalized with severe forms of disease to determine the efficiency of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with poorly expressed symptoms of COVID-19.
For a COLCORONA study, 6000 adults, 40 years old and older, who have been diagnosed by COVID-19, were invited with light symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant, breast-feeding and non-useable contraceptives of women cannot participate in this study.
There are several coagulants at the test in Italy.
Lowcomolecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, which has encouraged the Italian Medicinal Products Office to publish recommendations on the use of this medicine.
On 14 April, a multicentral study in Italy was announced with 300 patients on the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientific attention was focused on reprofiling approved antivirus medicines developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and Western Neil virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th issue of Chinese recommendations.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics which have been considered potentially appropriate for the use of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (receptor anti-IL-6): approved in China.
Also tests in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus in 2019 (CIVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical trials, many attempts to develop such vaccine continue to be taken.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 to be obtained earlier than 18 months later.
In April, five vaccine candidates conducted a security study of phase I.
The COVID-19 virus was identified in December 2019.
In 2020, the major explosion of this disease has spread throughout the world, leading to significant investment in the development of vaccine and research activities.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key tasks of the CEPI initiative to develop vaccines are to ensure the necessary speed, production powers, extensive deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, there were 10 different technological platforms to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in phase I safety research:
Nuclein acid (DNC and RNA) (developing phase I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, IRK-1273)
Viral vector (faza I developer and candidate for vaccine: CanSino Biology, Adenoversal Vector of Type 5)
As CEPI reported in April, 115 potential vaccines are in early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79, according to Milken Institute); additional 37 candidates have been reported, but there are little public information (such assuming, at the stages of planning or development).
At stages I-II, preliminary safety and immunity tests are usually conducted, randomised, placebo-controlled and in several placebo-controlled sections with a simultaneous definition of more precise and effective doses.
Phase III usually covers more participants, including the control group; medicinal products are tested to be effective in the prevention of disease and at the same time adverse effects are monitored in optimum doses.
Of 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not been tested on a person (here are still at the stage of doclinical studies).

At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of 275 million Canadian dollars to finance 96 research projects against COVID-19, including the development of many candidates for vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskachevan University.
Approximately at the same time, the Canadian Government announced 192 million Canadian dollars to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 as well as plans for the establishment of a national vaccine bank, where several new vaccines could be used in the event of a new explosion of the coronavirus.
On 2 April 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh of Medicine reported the testing of a possible vaccine against the COVID-19 on mouses, saying that MNA had introduced “SARS-COV-2 S1 individual vaccines” involving strong responses to antigen-specific antithels [in mouse] that had occurred two weeks after immunization.
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian University of Waterloo Pharmaceutical School announced the development of potential vaccine based on DNA, which may be released in form of nazal spray.
The DNA bacteriophags will multiply within human bacteria and create harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, industry and three U.S. universities united IBM supercomputer resources together with the cloud calculations of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects also referred to as unspecific effects.
This means that they may have other advantages other than the prevention of diseases.
Another randomized study conducted in Australia covers 4170 health workers.
The vaccines may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies on the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transage mouses, other laboratory animals and lower primates, indicate the need to prevent biosafe infection 3 in the processing of live viruses, as well as international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
The vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested on animal models.
As for 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines that would be safe and effective for humans.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicinal products for the treatment of atipical pneumonia was a priority for Governments and public health institutions worldwide, and there is also no vaccine checked against MERS.
When the MERS began to be distributed, it was considered that the SARS study that was being conducted at that time could be a standard for developing vaccines and therapeutic means against MERS-CoV infection.
As at March 2020, there was one (based on DNA) vaccine from MERS, which passed phase I of clinical trials on humans, and three other vaccines, all of which were vaccines based on a virus vector and were developed, two were adenovirous (CHAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social networks distributed a conspiracy theory that COVID-19 virus is not new and that the vaccine already exists.
Publications in social networks quoted the words of some patients who claimed that there were patents on the genetic sequences of other coronavirus species, such as the SARS coronavirus and the vaccines for these species.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (CIVID-19), which is an infectious disease caused by a severe respiratory syndrome of coronavir 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing difficulty.
Other symptoms may include tiredness, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The period from the first symptoms to the peak is usually about five days, but may also variety from two to fourteen days.
Most of the cases are affected by light symptoms, but in some cases the disease is transfused into viral pneumonia and polyorganized insufficience.
More than 2.24 million infections in 210 countries and regions have been registered as at 17 April 2020, more than 153,000 people have died from this disease.
More than 568,000 people have been healed, and the virus is mainly distributed in close contact with each other, often through microscopic drops that are excreted in the air by coughing, cheating or conversation.
Although these drops are formed at the exhaustion, they are usually threatened by falling on the ground or on the surface, but are not transmitted through air at large distances.
People are also infected with the polluted surface and then their eyes, noses or mouth.
The virus may live on the surface within 72 hours.
It is most infected for the first three days after the symptoms, although it may be possible before symptoms and later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymerous chain response with reverse transcryption in real time (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as a smack from the nosorogue.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspicion of disease, as well as those who care for them.
Recommendations for the use of medical masks are different: some offices recommend not to use them at all, some recommend their use and others require it.
The vaccine or specific treatment of the COVID-19 virus are currently not available.
The local dissemination of disease was registered in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may have no symptoms or symptoms of flu, such as fever, cough, tiredness and breath.
Extreme symptoms include difficult breathing, continuous pain or breast density, consciousness, awakening difficulties, absorption of face or lips; if the above symptoms are present, medical assistance should be called immediately.
The symptoms of upper respiratory paths, such as sneaking, moor or throat pain, may be rare.
There are also a variety of percentages of stomach and pocket symptoms such as mutiness, flinch and diarrhoea.
Some of the diseases registered in China were primarily manifested only as a breast pressure and heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease may progress through the development of pneumonia, polyorganized deficiencies, and the result is death.
This is called the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five-six days, but may varies between two and 14 days.
97.5 per cent of people are infected within 11.5 days after the infection, and according to available data, symptoms are not shown in all infected.
The role of such unsymptomic carriers in the transmission of disease is still unknown, but preliminary data indicate that they can contribute to the proliferation of infection.
The percentage of infected people with unsympathy of disease is currently unknown, it is only studied; Korean Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations on the virus during the period of disease was unlikely.
The National Health Commission of China began to include non-simptomic cases in its daily summary of 1 April; from 166 cases of infections registered this day, 130 (78 per cent) refused to be unseemed at the time of the testing.
And wetness, and snow can have a large concentration of the virus.
More drops are produced in a loud voice than in normal volumes.
A study conducted in Singapore showed that the drops can be extended at a distance of 4.5 feet (15 feet) at open cough.
The virus is generally not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences assumed that the transmission of particles of the virus by bioaerosol, and the testing of air processed by air collectors located in corridors outside the human rooms, showed the presence of the RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular reanimation (LLR), may lead to dissemination of gastrointestinal products and therefore to air-proliferation.
There are also concerns that the virus can be spread through fecalies, however, is considered low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; the proliferation of the virus is possible before symptoms occur, but the risk is small.
The European Centre for Prevention and Control of Disabilities (ECDC) claims that it is not quite clear how easily the virus is spreading, however, it is known that one patient is usually infected by 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive on the surface from a few hours to a few days.
In particular, it was found that on the cardiac surface the virus is able to live within one day, on plastic surface (polypropylene) and on a non-running steel (AISI 304), up to three days, and 99 per cent of the copper surfaces are up to 4 hours.
These indicators, however, varies depending on moisture and temperature.
The sauce and washing means have a pretty useful effect in combating the contamination: the sauce destroys the fat protective layer of the virus, deactivating it in such a way, as well as able to remove it from the surfaces of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorphexidine gluconate (surgery disinfecting) are less effective against the virus. During the study conducted in Hong Kong, the samples of the pellet were taken in the mean two days after the hospitalization.
Five of the six patients had the first test showed the highest concentration of the blood virus, and the sixth patient had the highest blood content of the blood on the second day of the test.
A severe respiratory respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe coronavirus respiratory syndrome, first discovered in three people with lung from a group with sharp respiratory diseases registered in Uchan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 are also met in the nature of coronavirus.
A virus outside the human body is destroyed by a sauce that opens its protective shell. SARS-COV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected body of COVID-19 because the virus is infiltrated into the household cells through angiotensin transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in the alveolar cells of type II.
The virus is connected to ACE2 and infiltrated into the master's cell using a characteristic surface glycoprotein, “ship” (peplomer).
12 per cent of the infected people in the Uchan hospital have been diagnosed with a severe miocardial injury, which is frequently encountered in a severe form of disease.
The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms highly due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during the progression of the disease, but a sharp miocard damage may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large numbers, because they are participating in the work of the body.
The high frequency of trombos (31%) and vein thromboembolic (25%) was observed in patients in OIT with COVID-19 and could indicate the disadvantaged forecasts. The autopsy of patients killed by COVID-19 showed the existence of difusional alveolar injuries (DAD) and the lymphocytochist influenza influenza in light.
Although SARS-COV-2 is tropical to ACE2-expressing epithelial respiratory cells, patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms of systemic hyperfusion are observed.
In particular, it was found that the pathogenic GM-CSF T-clusters correlated with the recruitment of IL-6 ignition monocytes and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
The autopsy was also identified by lymphocytary infiltrates.
WHO has also published several test protocols on this disease.
The polymerous chain response in the real time mode (RT-PRC) is a standard test method.
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained from a nose-gul and can also be used by a nose or wet.
The results are usually ready for a period from a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be taken, but they require two blood samples taken with intervals within two weeks and their results are not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists have been able to allocate the coronavirus shame and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists around the world can self-develop tests by a polymerous chain reaction method (PRC) to identify the existence of this virus.
As at 4 April 2020, antibodies tests that could detect the infection for the current time and the fact of the possible infection in the past had not yet been widely distributed.
The Chinese experience in studying the results of the test results showed that their accuracy was only 60 to 70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the Office for Monitoring the Quality of Food and Medicinal Products (FDA) approved the first diagnostic test at the end of this month, indicating the methods of detection of infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
The bilateral multi-dollar subplaural focus on the type of mathematical glass with peripheral, asymmetrical and territorial distribution are common symptoms identified at the early stage of disease.
Subpleural domination, violent bridge symptom (sufficiency with alveolar variable) and consolidation develops as the progression of the disease.
There are few data on microscopic damages and COVID-19 pathophyology.
Basic results of the autopsy study:
Macroscopy: pelvic, pericardite, pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary emissions
Four types of virus pneumonia can be observed:
light form of pneumonia: lung, hyperplasia of pneumocytes, large atipical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytary infiltration and multinuclear cell education
severe form of pneumonia: difusional alveolar injury (DAD) with difusional alveolar exsudate.
DAD is the cause of a sharp respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Living pneumonia: organised exhausts in alveolar lines and lung interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: Diffusive intra-trained rotation (DVS syndrome); leucoerythroblast reactions
Prevention measures to reduce the probability of infection include staying at home, avoiding human places, frequent washing of hands with sauce and water for at least 20 seconds, compliance with the rules of breathing hygiene, as well as avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unlauled hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a cough or sneaking, or, if there is no salt, cover the mouth and nose with the internal side of the elbowed arm zone.
After coughing or chishing, a quality hygienic procedure for hand is recommended.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of fabric masks in public places, in particular in order to reduce the transmission of infection by persons with unsympathy of disease. The social distant strategies aim at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; these measures have been closed by schools and enterprises, limiting the movement of citizens and abolishing major public activities.
Recommendations on distance also implied that people should be at a distance of at least 6 feet (1.8 m) from each other.
Since the completion of the vaccine is expected not earlier than 2021, the majority of the measures against the COVID-19 dissemination is reduced to the epidemic pica known as “exit to pay”.
CDC also recommends to wash your hands more frequently with sauce and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after a toilet visit or with severe pollution of hands, and before food and after coughing, coughing or sneaking.
CDC also recommends the use of disinficiency-containing spirt-containing (the content of the spirt is not less than 60 per cent), but only when the sauce and water are not available. The regions where such disinfective means are not sold, the WHO provides two receptures for local production.
These compositions use ethanol or isopropanol with antimicrobial activity.
The hydrogen transmission is used to eliminate bacterial disputes in the spirt and is not an appropriate tool for antiseptic hand processing.
Glycerol is added as a moist.
Patients have shown supporting therapy, which can include infusion therapy, oxygen support and support for other affected vital bodies.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect that they are infected by the virus wear a normal medical mask.
The extracorporal membrane oxigenation (ECMO) was used to address the problem of respiratory inadequacy, but its advantages were still being studied.
In order to strengthen immunity, the rules of personal hygiene, healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended.
Supportive therapy methods can be shown to patients with light symptoms at early stages of disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, doctors of intensive therapy and pulmonologists summarized therapy recommendations of various institutions in free resources, IBCC.
As at April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
In order to treat symptoms as first-line medicines, some medical workers recommend choosing for paracetamol (acsetaminofen) compared to ibuprofen.
In the implementation of procedures in which air-capped emissions, such as intubation or handcuff, need to be taken precautionally to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in the medical institutions.
Medicinal personnel with COVID-19 recommends that the CDC be placed in an air-capped isolator (AIIR) — an additional measure in addition to standard precautions in contact and air. CDC published recommendations for individual protection (SIS) during the pandemic.
Recommendations for individual protection: protective coat, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves. From the above, it is preferable to use respirators rather than medical masks.
The N95 Respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA allowed the use of these respirators in accordance with the urgent authorisation (EUA).
They are intended to protect from particles in the air, such as dust, but the effectiveness of the specific biological agent is not guaranteed in the instruction.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of protective facescreens or, in extreme cases, make masks alone under home conditions.
In most cases, the COVID-19 fluid form is not difficult to require the artificial ventilation of light or its alternative, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where it is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory deficiencies related to COVID-19 is currently actively studied, and there are some evidence that the intubation can be avoided by a nose oxygen channel with an intense air flow or two-level positive pressure in breathing routes.
Not yet known whether any of these two ways for patients in critical state is as effective as IVL.
Some physicians make choices for the invasive lung ventilation if available, as this method significantly restricts the distribution of particles in the air compared to the nose canal with the intensive air flow. The risk of severe disease for older people (over 60 years and especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
In many developed countries there are lack of hospital juice per capita, and the health systems are too limited to deal with a rapid increase in the number of infections of COVID-19 in a severe form of hospitalization.
According to one study conducted in China, 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in the intensive therapy offices, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for the work of light ventilations and 1.4 per cent ended.
In China, about 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually reanimated.
The artificial ventilation task is complicated because a sharp respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developing at COVID-19, and the oxigenation is increasingly difficult.
The IVL, with the support of respiratory pressure and PDCs, is necessary to deliver the maximum oxygen in lungs and to ensure the minimum injury by the ventilation, which may result in the development of pneumotorex.
The high PDCs may not be available in early ventilator models.
Research of potential treatment methods began in January 2020 and several antiviral medicinal products are currently in clinical trials.
The most prospective remdesivir is.
The development of new medicinal products may take place until 2021, but some of the tested medicinal products have already been approved for other purposes or are at the latest stages of testing.
Antiviral medicines can be tested in patients with severe diseases.
The recommended WHO volunteers participate in the tests of efficiency and safety of potential treatment methods. FDA has provided temporary authorisation for the use of reconvalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where human life is threatening a serious or immediate danger.
Its application was not subject to clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficiency of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to combat the illness.
For login, users must enter their name and identification number.
The annex can identify close contact by monitoring data and therefore determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is detected, the application recommends not only self-izolation, but also sends notification to local health authorities. Analysis of large data collected from mobile phones, recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intellect are used to track infected persons and persons with whom they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel allowed the security authorities to track the data of the mobile phones of people who are allegedly infected by the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who may contact infected citizens.
Also, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom provided the Federal Public Institute of Germany and the Institute of Robert Koha aggregated data on the location of mobile subscribers.
In Russia, quarantine violents were introduced to identify persons.
The Regional Health Officer of Italy, Julio Gallera, said that mobile network operators reported that “40 per cent of people continue to move across the territory”.
The Government of Germany held a 48-hour weekend programming maraton, in which more than 42,000 participants participated.
The President of Estonia Kersti Kalulaid also called for creative decisions against the proliferation of the coronavirus.
People may be stressed about quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor's words: “The increased social isolation, loneliness, concerns about health, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harming mental health and human well-being.”
Sickness may occur in a light form with minor or absent symptoms similar to other common respiratory diseases such as normal coldness.
Patients with a light form of disease usually heal within two weeks, while the treatment of severe or critical patients may take three to six weeks.
Women who are pregnant may be more risked to obtain a heavy form of COVID-19 on the basis of other viruses such as SARS and MERS, although such data are not available. Some COVID-19 people may be illustrated by lungs and complicated.
Persons with the most severe COVID-19 disease may quickly progress in a sharp respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory deficiencies, septic shock or polyorganized inadequateness.
The complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, anonymous thrombo-education, as well as heart problems, kidneys and baking.
Trombo-education anomalies, particularly the increase in protrombine time, were described in 6 per cent of patients entering the COVID-19 hospital, while the kidney function was observed in 4 per cent of the group.
Approximately 20 to 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 have increased liver enzymes (transaminase).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, of which five patients were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to intensive therapy has been seven days.
According to studies at early stages, the average period from the initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), male mortality rate was 2.8 per cent and 1.7 per cent among women.
Histopathological studies of after-death samples of light indicate difusional alveolar injury with cell fibromixoid exhausts in both lungs.
Pneumocytes have experienced virus cytopathic changes.
Easy appearance was like a sharp respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS).
11.8 per cent of the deaths registered by China's National Health Commission were heart problems in improving troponin or heart stops.
According to the reports provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of the hospitalized patients had previous health problems, as well as the availability of health resources and the social and economic situation in the region may affect mortality.
Mortality assessments depending on the condition are different due to such regional differences as well as for methodological difficulties.
Insufficient computation of cases in a light form may increase mortality.
However, the fact that deaths occur from the diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is undervaluable.
Smokers have developed severe symptoms of COVID-19 as a total of 1.4 times more, and these patients were approximately 2.4 times more needed intensive therapy or died compared to non-smoking.
The administration of one of the Hong Kong clinic found that some patients who have been treated with this disease have reduced the amount of lungs by 20 to 30 per cent, and their scan has detected damage.
After healing, this may also lead to the intensive therapy syndrome.
As at March 2020, it was not known whether the patient ' s healing is steadily immunity against it.
According to other coronavirus, this was considered likely, but also reported cases when the COVID-19 coronavirus tests were still positive after the recovery of COVID-19.
It is estimated that in these cases there was an increased duration of disease rather than reinfected.
The virus is considered natural, animal origin and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the dissemination of the infection was almost incompletely caused by human transmissions.
The study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet calls on 1 December 2019 the early date of the first disease.
According to the official data published by WHO, this date was 8 December 2019.
Several methods are usually used for quantitative mortality assessment.
All quantities are varied depending on the region and the period of dissemination of disease, and have also affected the levels of testing, quality of health systems used for the treatment schemes, from the beginning of the disease and the parameters of the population, such as age, gender and general health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO granted the ICB-10 urgent aid codes: U07.1 — for the death of the laboratory confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 — for the death of clinical or epidemiologically diagnosticated COVID-19, without the laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. The ratio of deaths and infections is the number of deaths shared to the number of diagnosticed cases during a certain period of time.
According to the statistics of the University of Jones Hopkins, as at 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9 per cent (153 822/2 240 191).
This quantity is varies depending on the region. Some other methods include the definition of the mortality rate due to the disease (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosticated patients resulting from the disease and the determination of the mortality rate as a result of the transmitted infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (as diagnosticated and undiagnosed cases) of disease.
These statistics are not bound for specific time and reflect the indicators of a certain layer of population from the time of infection before the disease is completed.
Although the antibodies are not produced in all infected patients, the presence of such antibodies can be seen by how many people were infected.
In an epicentre of explosion in Italy, Castillon D'Ada, a small village with a population of 4600, 80 people (1.7%) are no longer alive.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread during the celebration of a youth carnival, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all cases of death from COVID-19 could have been formally classified as such.
Furthermore, the health system of Germany has not been reloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population can have antibodies, according to donor blood indicators.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 death cases (0.004 per cent).
The impact of pandemic and mortality is different for men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher in men.
The highest risk group is men over 50 years old; the breakdown between men and women is only reduced from the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for this distinction are unknown but may be genetic and behaviour factors.
Gender immunological differences, lower smoking among women associated with men's diseases (e.g. hypertension in men younger than women) may cause higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected men were infected, and 72 per cent of the deaths of COVID-19 had to be men.
As at April 2020, the Government of the United States does not conduct gender statistics on COVID-19.
Research showed that virus diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and ORVI have different gender statistics.
Most healthcare workers, especially nurse staff, are women, accordingly, more likely to be infected.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of this disease, COVID-19.
The WHO leader, Mr. Tedros Adan Hebreisus, explained: “CO” means “crown”, “VI” — “virus”, “D” — the disease” (disease), and 19 when the explosion was first discovered: 31 December 2019.
Such a name was selected to avoid reference to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), species of animals or groups of people, such as international designation recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The COVID-19 virus is called a severe coronary respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
In public communications, WHO also uses the terms “COVID-19 virus” and “virus responsible for COVID-19”.
And the disease, and the virus itself is usually called coronavirus.
During the initial explosion in Uhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly called “coronavirus” and “smoking coronavirus”.
In January 2020, in accordance with the recommendations of 2015 on the use of geographical sites in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended that the terms of “acute respiratory disease” of 2019-nCov and “2019-nCoV” be used as temporary names of virus and disease.
On 11 February 2020, official names “CIVID-19” and “SARS-COV-2” were published.
Because of the limits of standard supply chains, some digital service producers print medical materials, such as tampons for nose wires, as well as details of IVL devices.
In one of these cases, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier could not deliver it within the required time limits, and one of the local productions was re-profiled and was able to print the required 100 valves per night.
After the first time the COVID-19 explosion, the Internet has become high-speed to spread various theories of conspiracy, dezinformation and fial information on the origin of the virus, its scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects.
Probably people can infect other animals.
Research did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
At present there is no approved vaccine from the virus or medicines for its treatment.
Government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers are currently conducting various international studies of vaccines and medicines from COVID-19.
The WHO launched the SOLIDARITITY Trial in March, which aimed at assessing the healing effect of four existing links that are considered the most effective for today.
Prepared vaccine is not yet available, but various organizations are actively developing vaccines for vaccine.
As SARS-CoV, as well as SARS-CoV-2 are infiltrated into human cells by the ACE2 receptor, so the results of previous SARS-CoV studies are used in scientific developments.
There are three vaccine strategies.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole-viral vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether an inactive or dead form, is intended to cause a rapid immune response of the human body to the new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the establishment of an individual vaccine, is designed to create a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain virus entities.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at destruction of the S-Shipovid protein that helps the virus invade into the receptor of the ACE2.
The third strategy is to develop vaccines based on nuclein acids (DNC or RNA vaccine, new vaccine creation methods).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be verified for safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical test of vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an inadequate genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. The anti-saved increase was marked as one of the potential problems in the development of vaccines from SARS-COV-2, but this presumption has a dispute.
More than 300 active clinical trials are carried out as at April 2020.
The preparations approved for malaria were assessed during seven tests, four of these studies were based on hydroxichlorochin or chlorochin.
The reprofilement of antiviral medicinal products is a majority of Chinese studies; at the end of April, nine remdesivir studies were conducted in several countries.
As at April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 was conducted, with a view also to consider several other existing antiviral medicines for COVID-19, including remdesivir, chlorochin and hydroxichlorochin, lopinavir / ritonavir, as well as lopinavir / ritonavir combined with beta interferon.
As at March 2020, preliminary data on the effectiveness of the remdesivier.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients who received remdesivir as exception.
The use of chlorochin used earlier for malaria was considered in China in February 2020.
Nevertheless, there is a need for an expert assessment of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chlorochin.
The Uhanian Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose in a single gram, but notes that the double of this dose is very dangerous and can lead to a flight outcome.
On 28 March 2020, FDA issued an emergency use of hydroxychlorochin and chlorochin for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. The Chinese instructions of the 7th edition also indicate interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir as means against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for detailed in vivo study by demonstrating the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations. Studies showed that for the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with ACE2 receptor, the protein of the transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary.
Studies of the use of chlorochin and hydroxichlorochin with acidromicine or without it have serious restrictions that do not allow the health community to use these treatment methods without a more detailed study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Hypercytokinemy may occur as complicated at the late stages of the heavy form of COVID-19.
There are confirmations of the fact that hydroxichlorochin may have the properties of hypercytokine, as a result of a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China included in the coronavir treatment recommendation.
This medicine was two stages of a non-randomized test conducted at the national level in Italy after the positive results of its use have been received in patients with severe form of disease.
In combination with the analysis of ferritin blood sulphur for cytokine storms, it is intended to counter the factors that are considered to be caused by death in some patients.
In 2017, FDA was approved by an antagonist of interlejkin-6 receptor, based on retrospective thematic studies for the treatment of the CAR steroid cytoclin syndrome for release, caused by another cause, the CAR cell therapy.
Today there are no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective tool for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome.
Transfer of cleaned and concentrated antibodies produced by immune systems of patients treated with COVID-19, to those who need them, is now considered an inaccible method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested in the treatment of SARS patients, but its results were unreasonable.
The neutralization of the virus is the expected effect that the passive antibody therapy can protect from SARS-CoV-2.
However, the use of other mechanisms such as anti-body cytotoxicity and/or fagocitosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive therapy by antibodies, for example, using monochlonic antibodies, are at the stage of development.
Reconvalescent blood sulphur, which consists of the fluid part of the blood of the healed patients and contains antibodies against the virus.
Corono-viral diseases, high-like syndrome group
Lee Venjljan, a doctor of the Central Clinic of Uhanja, who later died from COVID-19 after he reported the spread of the virus.
