In China and the area, two men killed suicide
Previously, one of the hanged had already attempted suicide.
30 October, approximately 1 a.m., in the village of Lugovo on its place of residence, 1947, a man was born to commit suicide by hanging.
It is known that he had already committed suicide attempts before.
Which made a man not known for that.
31 October, at 11 to 50, inhabited by a 41-year-old man in China.
No signs of violent death have been found, reports the IMD "Kineshemski" press service.
The black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair the drifting system, many begin to see a solution in a small black box carefully built on your car.
These devices, tracking every mile by the car and transmitting that information to the officials, are in the centre of a dispute attempt to modernise an old American autoway financing system adopted by the Washington and State planned authorities.
Usually, the boring planning arena of roads has suddenly produced intense debate and colored alliances.
The Liberians joined the environmental groups in lobbying the Government's right to use small boxes to monitor the number of miles you have passed, and even perhaps where you go, and then to use that information in the drawing of tax accounts.
Tea motion in shock.
The American Union of Civil Freedoms is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions on private life.
Even though the Congress is still unable to negotiate, continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They think about the way the drivers can go to the system for each mile of the road they travel.
Thousands of carriers have already tested these black boxes, part of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is really necessary for our country.
"It is not the issue that we may have the right to choose," said Hasan Ihrat, executive Director of the Southern California Association, which is preparing plans for monitoring by the authorities of the state of miles by each Californian carist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There are technologies for that already.
The need for this is aggravated by the lack of funds from the Government's Highway Building Fund funded for taxes paid by Americans on auto-fuels.
The Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel more than miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not been raised for 20 years.
Politicians don't want to increase tax even for one cent at high prices of gas.
"The tax on gasoline cannot be saved," said Lee Mannich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices have recently been installed on vehicles to test the receipt system.
"It will be the best alternative in a long-term perspective," he said.
The bothers call it a pleasant user wage.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as taxes can change the nature of travels to reduce the loading of roads and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The California planned bodies are considering this system in the development of strategies to achieve the objectives established by the ambitious laws of the State to combat global warming.
However, a member of the Chamber of Representatives Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the Transport Committee, said that he also considered the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free market commitments in the Reason Fund are also delighted in making drivers pay for each mile.
"It is not just a tax to go to the black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President for Political Affairs, Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former United States Transport Ministers, who called on the Congress to move in the direction of a mistaken wage in 2011.
The United States Senate adopted a pilot project costing $90 million last year to participate in about 10,000 cars.
However, the leaders of the Chamber of Representatives rejected this proposal because of the fears of rural legislators representing voters, who often have to travel a lot of miles in order to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, go on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is shown in the Oregon state, where 5,000 drivers are attracted to participate in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for miles of race instead of gas taxes.
The pilot project in Nevada has already been completed.
It is considered in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with cars.
The I-95 coalition, which includes transport departments of 17 eastern coastal states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), examines how they can make these changes.
This concept has not received universal recognition.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, the drivers were concerned that the Government could follow each step.
“The concern about the “great brother” and such things is a major problem”, said Alauddin Han, leading the issues of the strategy and management of the transport department of Nevada.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were completed, the American Union of Civil Freedoms in Nevada warned on its website: “It will not be difficult to turn these devices into instruments of full-scale monitoring.”
There is no need to create a huge, massive technological infrastructure that will be inevitably expanded to store records of daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of the several states where there is difficult searching for low cost technology that would allow the authorities to take into account the car miles but without information about the location and time.
If you can do that, Han said, society will feel more calm.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
The company was not initially assisting in the collection of state taxes.
She endeavoured to enter the development market of auto-insurance, where drivers were paid on the basis of a race.
However, the devices that it tests are attracting road projectors because they do not use GPS and provide limited amounts of information periodically loaded with modem.
"The people will be more inclined to do this if you do not follow their speed and do not follow their location," said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
There were several major mistakes in some of these pilot programmes in the state.
There are much less expensive and less obsessive ways to do this.
In Oregon, projectors experiment with various options to provide drivers.
They can choose a device with or without a GPS.
Or they may completely renounce the device, deciding instead to pay a fixed collection based on the average number of miles that all the people of the state travel.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea of the guarded public, making the devices do more than less.
In New York, transport officials seek to develop a taxpayer that will also receive a parking charge, to provide “payments as you drive” insurance and collect data on speed in real-time mode from other drivers that cars could use to avoid traffic.
“Automobilists will be attracted to the benefits offered to them”, states the urban design document.
Some transport systems designers, however, are wondering whether all the talks about the mistaken salary are just an enormous distraction factor.
In the city transport commission in the area of San Francisco Gulf, officials say that the congress could easily overcome the bankruptcy of the Traffic Trafficking Fund by taxing gas.
The additional simultaneous or annual tax could be taken from drivers of hybrid vehicles and other persons whose vehicles do not use much gas to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery when all you have to do is take aspirin” said Randy Rantshler, director of the Legislative and Public Relations Commission.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their private life and the many other things.
The EU is preparing support measures for Ukraine in the event of Russian economic pressure
The European Union has a reserve plan to ensure Ukraine with gas and to achieve an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of the EU and Ukraine Association Agreement at the Wilnius Summit.
The IMF has been negotiating stand-by loans, and another EU official, directly involved in the negotiations, added that their aim is to conclude the agreement soon.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF Ukraine, there can be 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts questioned by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and IMF are able to overcome long-term financial disagreements.
It does not believe in the possibility of reforms necessary to obtain assistance, and the international S&P rating agency declined by the sovereign rating of Ukraine on Friday by one degree to " B" with "B".
However, EU representatives say that IMF can be flexible in terms of credit, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the EU's financial support plan, there is a reserve option to ensure Ukraine with gas, which is now a part of the supplies from Russia.
Maybe it'll be the gas from the Northern Stream or the reverers from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in case Russia " isolate" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that such reverse delivery could only be used within a few weeks and would likely reduce supply to other regions.
"The EU and Ukraine countries have negotiated how to create favourable conditions to enable Ukraine to import gas from other sources, not from Russia or from the same source, but by other routes," added Reuters.
Russia outside the fight for car pollution
The attempts to address transport problems of major cities were seen in most megapolis of the world, starting from the second half of the 20th century.
In general, it was either about restructuring and expansion of roads or attempting to reduce the demand for road trips, the number of vehicles and the time of use.
Singapur is a widely known example, where a strict quantification of the number of private cars has been introduced and the right to acquire them is acquired at auctions.
His price may be twice or three times above the price of the car itself.
The European cities, including London, introduced a wage for entering the city center.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stutgarth, the so-called green zones are introduced, where only cars with certain ecological classes are allowed to use high quality fuel (including biofuel or electrical vehicles).
The Beijing Environment Agency, for example, approved in 2012 the “five-year clean air plan” of a total value of about 250 billion yuanas (approximately $40 billion).
As told by the Director of the Municipality Disease Control Division, Pekina Lee Kunching, the main objective of the five-year aim is to reduce air pollutants by 20 to 35 per cent by 2017, to increase the number of private vehicles to a level of not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million), and to increase not more than 5 per cent of the use of fuel in one vehicle.
According to the Agency, the transport of air pollution in Beijing is now responsible for 22.5 per cent of the total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the programme, the limitation of the use of vehicles and the introduction of additional taxes for the owners.
Furthermore, urban measures include acceleration in comparison with the other country of transition to fuel eco-standarders, the introduction of the local system of ecostandards and vehicle marking and fuels, the restriction on the entry of vehicles to the central city, the prohibition of the use of old vehicles (including the establishment of promoting financial programmes to replace old vehicles with hybrids or electric vehicles), the development of electricity (including public and service), the development of public transport (including high speed).
Beijing's car innovation is also prohibited for all private vehicles to move within the fifth transport ring (all in the capital of the CNB six) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the vehicle number) and the issue of registration marks for vehicles based on the lottery (e.g. in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of registration permits for private vehicles in Beijing was only a third of 2010).
According to the current Environmental Protection Programme for 2012-2020, the number of towns with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 was 138).
According to Min приroda, 41 per cent of all pollutants in the city's atmosphere had been in 2011.
In Moscow, for example, car emissions ten times exceed industrial, and in St. Petersburg nine times.
The RF is just starting to think about the possibilities of restrictive control of cars on urban streets.
Director of the Institute for Transport and Transport Policy, Michael Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at impairing the demand for road journeys are not aware of the unpopular case, they may be taken by society only if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem related to the structure of its autopark, where there are two clusters with low sensitivity to any regulatory impact, official and personal vehicles, as well as vehicles of "privileged" users, whose total number is at least 200 thousand (about 5 per cent of the total Moscow park).
During the day, urbanists from the ECOM Centre in St. Petersburg have prepared a study where urban territories are analysed between housing, road covering area and the quantity of transport.
The main findings of researchers: The city center is provided twice as required, and most carriers living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them on parking or just in the streets for a long time.
As a result, it is proposed not to build parking, but to expand car storages, but to reduce the passing part (to reduce the streets to become more friendly for pedestrians), as well as to limit the use and disposal of personal transport within the territory of the historical security zone (a total of around 3212 ha, covering a number of central areas of town).
Punishments for unauthorized street trade in Vogde will grow at once
According to urban authorities, the increase in fines will help to order in Vogde and free the streets from natural tents and bottles.
Most street traders do not pay taxes, the product they are carrying out often does not pass the corresponding sanitation control.
This means that wet health is threatened.
Thus, the lower currency limit for non-authorized trafficking from November will increase six times from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, reports the Vogda Press Service.
Goldman Sachs warned about the risks for the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned about growing risks for the main driver of strict economic growth in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payment on unsustained consumer loans and mass reductions in employees.
Our main concern is now not that growth has slowed, but rather the structure of this growth.
Recently, it is fully caused by consumption that almost does not reduce traffic," said the main economist Goldman Sachs in Russia Clemens Grafe, presenting a quarterly report of the Russian economy yesterday.
The nominal salary growth in Russia is about 10 per cent.
At 6 per cent inflation, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at approximately the current level, expected in Goldman Sachs.
However, the rental of Russian companies is declined, so it is likely to deal with the optimization of staff costs.
Today we see a significant increase in GDP salary: if the salary increases by 10 per cent, GDP is only 2 per cent, Mr. Graffe explained.
Companies faced a reduction in rentality.
If she does not grow up, it can lead to dismissal and unemployment growth.
The Russian business cannot raise salary, comments the main economist Barclays Capital for Russia and CNG Vladimir Pantusin.
Unemployment close to historical minimums, high competition for workers.
In order to trigger or maintain current staff, employers have to raise wages.
The consumption in Russia is also a very rapid increase in consumption.
Mr. Graffe believed that, due to extremely high consumer loans, this type of credit has not been affected by the country's economies.
"We have not seen any benefits for the economy from the growth of the consumption, money is not distracted by the economy, but returns to the same banks as interest payments," said the economist.
The problem is, however, the Goldman Sachs expects an increase in insufficient loans.
They are primarily taken by wealthy people who have nothing to provide.
Percentages for such loans are high.
As a result, they are often not returned," said Mr. Graffe.
Therefore, the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is a possible crisis of insufficient loans.
The Director of the Banking Institute of WCH Vasilij Solodkov has already seen the signs of the banking crisis.
Small credit organisations, without access to cheap resources they have, were forced to attract people under high percentage.
In reply, the guests went to the race of war and began to reduce credit rates, the economist continued.
Small credit organisations cannot loan at the same rate, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the hosts do not give up the dempingue, Russia is threatening a full banking crisis, according to Vasili Solodkov.
The only licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks, the economist considers a mass collapse.
"The guests will not be able to deal with this situation: the insurance system was not initially counted on the systemic crisis," warned the head of the Institute.
However, consumption will slow down and without the crisis of non-payment, the investment is believed, because of the refusal of the indexing of the fees of the servants and soldiers in the current version of the budget project.
Partial impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of natural monopoly tariffs (and as a result, reduced inflation).
But only partially: if investments do not grow (and the prerequisite is not yet available), consumption growth will still slow down, as sure as Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantushine from Barclays Capital has not yet seen a prerequisite for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still the fall of oil price," he said.
It estimates that the Russian economy will reduce the cost of oil below $90/barr.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the CB is still unable to reduce interest rates in the economy.
Paradoxal image is observed: inflation fell down and banks began to raise rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the CB that announced the transition to the inflation tariff," said Clemens Grafe.
The interest policy of the Central Bank on market rates does not affect, only affect interbank credit rates.
"For C.B., it's a collapse of all hopes," Clemens Graffe appreciated.
Money received at BC auctions banks use not to loan the economy, but to manage their liquidity
Once the rate is lowered, the currency rate is immediately changed, which means that funds are trying to go to speculation against rub.
" Early or later, the CB will realize that this strategy is not working," said Mr. Graffe and recalled that the State planned to put a rubber into "flood" by the end of 2015.
But either we have to do this before or to raise the key rate of the BC (5.5 per cent), he considers.
According to his assessment, the laundry course is now artificially higher by 10 per cent.
Only one way is to weak, the expert's conclusion.
But if the CB slides in financialists at least a shadow of doubt that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the laundry weakness policy, it could break the ruble much stronger.
There was a second meeting of the Southern Ural peoples in Chelabinsk.
The Forum is based on the Day of People's Unity, the 400-year reconstruction of the Russian State and the 20-year adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
Delegations from all cities and areas, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious confessions, legislative and executive authorities participated in the meeting, as a total of about 350 people.
The Forum course aims at strengthening international consent.
We can give an example not only to other regions but also to other countries.
We don't have a difference or a disagreement.
We live in full understanding," said Feophane, mitropolith of Chelabinski and Goldoustovski.
A number of issues, including patriotism, cultural cooperation, were discussed during the meeting.
As a result of the meeting, the resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theatre.
It opened a national and cultural exhibition of the Chalabin area.
Snowden is willing to cooperate with Germany on the issue of U.S. Intelligence
Edward Snowden, an intelligence investigator of the United States, stated that he was willing to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the United States National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander could not answer the questions of their activities.
The German deputy Hans-Christian Strebelle met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was given asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
The letter from Mr. Snowden, who was presented by the MEDI in Berlin on Friday, stated: “If my efforts were clearly positive, my Government continues to treat the other thought as a treason and strives to criminalize political statements by criminal accusations without protection.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States Government to renounce criminal charges against him.
The charges made by the United States Ministry of Justice include spying and stealing State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, said to Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to do so.”
The relations between the United States and Germany have become tense after allegations that the NSA was listening to Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy head of the parliamentary intelligence courier, said that if there is a possibility to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness, “without the danger of him and not completely destroying the relationship with the United States”, it should be used.
Mr. Straubelle, a parliamentary parliamentary representative of the Green Germany, published his photograph with Mr. Snowden in his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strebelle said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden would not have been able to return to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden had testified in Germany, he would need guarantees that he would be there “in security”, said the deputy.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had encountered a “heavy and permanent” campaign of persecution, which forced him to leave his house.
He said, however, that he was excited by the global response to “his political expressions”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-level officials, including in the United States, considered the uncontrolled system of supervisory monitoring useful for society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will take the wage for a manual bet
Frontier Airlines plans to take from passengers up to $100 for carrying a manual on their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start taking up to $100 for a hand bet and $2 for coffee or gasoline, although their announcement on Wednesday said that passengers would be able to keep the whole bank.
The new wages for the hand bet are spread to the bags in the upper luggages, so the small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said that it would take $25 if the collection was paid earlier, and $100 if the travellers were to pay, only by coming to landing.
The representative of Frontier Kate O'Malley said that the $100 pay must make passengers take care of the payments in advance.
"We don't want to pay for it," she said.
The airlines began to pay for the first and second bag to the luggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these gatherings are as much as they can, as they can, in a manual layout placed in the upper baggage sections, which often lacks space in these sections.
The congregations are one of the ways to make passengers move less to the ship.
O'Malley said that this new gathering isn't really for money.
The point is, the most loyal Frontier clients claim that finding a place in the top baggage sections is getting more difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline would not have to pay.
This means that one passenger at the turn of the Frontier flight can be able to deliver the bag free, while the next passenger in the order may pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that the modification of procedures on the website and the Frontier registration stackers was intended to guarantee that passengers would know about the collection before they got to land.
The new Frontier collection for the manual layout will not start to be taken until summer, although the date is not yet set.
Passengers often complain about the baggage fees and other collections, but airlines love them.
They claim that the processing of the luggage is worth money, and passengers who need this service should pay for it.
Many in Wall Street believe that the supplementation of the baggage signifies that airlines are taking enough money to cover aircraft costs after a few years of loss.
However, most of them did not deal with manual collections.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first manual collection three years ago, and another discaunder Allegiant Air later followed her example.
The only other aviation company with such a collection is Hungarian Wizz Air, said the Aviation Company advisor Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the supplementary collections.
According to his assessment in the report of December 2011, the manual collection of Spirit is $50 million a year.
Sorensen, the former top manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flyed by the Spirit flight, and he was wondering what he would find at the landing exit when passengers faced an unusual collection of Spirit for a manual bet.
"The landing process was the smoothest one I've seen for my career in airlines," he said.
I was expecting to see the teeth cut and the fight coming out of the landing.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing went quickly."
Frontier is also followed by Spirit for a $2 salary for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who receive soda or juice could keep the whole bank and that the flow of coffee would be provided free.
It will continue to distribute water freely.
US Airways tried to take a drink in 2008 for a short time, but refused seven months after the passengers began complaining, and no other major airline followed her example.
The Frontier Initiative to take the wages for a manual, when passengers do not buy tickets directly in the airline, is its last step to attract customers to their website.
Aviation companies pay online ticket sellers, such as Orbitz, $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than to the tourist online agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, she began to give twice the bonus miles of the frequent flying passenger to customers who bought tickets through the online tourist agency.
On Wednesday, it cut the premium number of miles to 25 per cent from the journey.
So, a thousand miles from Frontier, acquired from the online tourist agency, would make it possible to get 250 miles.
Furthermore, passengers can be chosen in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a base of loyal clients in Denver's hometown, but its business is reduced and lost.
The delivery declined by 9 per cent, and summer opportunities were reduced by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published by the parents' company Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the sale of airlines.
ANB blames the internal error, not the hackers for the cessation of the website
The Occupied Secret Security Agency stated on Friday night that the cessation of their site for a few hours had caused a technical failure, not a hacker, as it was said in the network.
“NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of the internal error that occurred during the planned update”, the intelligence agency reported in the official electronic letter.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The statements that the interruption of the work was caused by a distributed type of “service refusal” [DDOS] were wrong.
Preceding this evening, server monitoring systems registered that the NSA website was not working at least six hours, and the site remains unavailable for some users.
Previously, the representative of the ABC News reported that the internal secret network of the "none" agency had been broken.
No secret information is in danger, said the representative.
At least one online group of activists stated that it was responsible for the withdrawal from the ANB website through DDOS attack.
The DDOS attacks are designed to squeeze the target site with traffic until the servers are reloaded and the site is out of line.
Hackers' tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not intended to invade into the internal network of the target system.
Previously, the NSA, once received the title Non-Agency, has been found in the centre of public attention and criticism in recent months after a row of disclosures on its widespread programmes of monitoring abroad and in the country, was all the response to the UNB secret files stolen from the agency and published by the former UNB officer Edward Snowden.
The growing dispute around the agency has fought that today's incident was the result of targeted hackers.
Bombardier's income is reduced with the drop of supplies and the number of orders for aircraft
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported on Thursday the reduction of net income by 15 per cent under the impact of reduced number of orders and aircraft delivery in the third quarter and contracts in its railway unit.
The Bombardier, located in Montreal, has also not published any data on summer tests of its latest CSeries aircraft and has not provided new information on whether ambitious plans for the introduction of the aircraft will be implemented for the next September.
After the first flight of an experienced aircraft model, which took place about a half a month ago, he flew only three more times, which raises questions about whether the scheduled testing stages are ongoing.
The results did not justify the projections and resulted in more than 8 per cent in the Toronto Fund.
Cameron Doerxen, analyst of the National Bank Finance, reduced his assessment on Thursday from " above medium-night" to "medium-night" because of the conviction that the growth of shares was limited to the next quarter or two.
"Although the reduction in aircraft supply was generally predictable, we are undoubtedly disappointed in the profits of the transport department," said Doerxen in the stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries when the summer testing programme continues.
However, if no new orders are announced in the next months, we assume that the market will be more skeptical to the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow her to take place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus are now dominated.
The first experienced sample of the aircraft was presented in March and for the first time flyed in September after a few months of delay.
However, CSeries' hard orders are not too large to 177, since potential buyers are waiting for summer tests to verify the approvals of the company of fuel efficiency and potential economies of the new aircraft.
There are 403 orders and arrangements now with 15 clients and operators.
The Chief Executive Director Pierre Bodwan was convinced that the Bombardier would reach its goal in 300 firm orders until the first plane was launched in commercial operation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured the analysts and the media that the programme progressed according to the plan.
“The test model of the plane was not longer on the ground than it was expected” said Bodwan during the telephone conference, adding that land tests and updates were planned during the simple plane.
All producers are planning different tests.
We decided to take the first flight and make a break for updates, so we did.
This will happen throughout the summer testing programme.
The second of the five test samples should take a flight in the next weeks and all the others will soon follow it, as the company reported.
However, the analysts sceptically refer to the statement that the first client would be able to use the CSeries plane 12 months after his first flight.
The Bombardier said that it evaluated the term of introduction and would provide new information in the next few months.
"This slow summer test rate - even if allegedly corresponds to the internal graph of Bombardier - reinforces our view that the introduction into operation will be transferred to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerxen.
In the third quarter, on 30 September, the net income of Bombardier decreased to $147 million, or 8 cents for a share, with $172 million, or 9 cents, last year.
The adjusted share profit remained a previous - nine cents.
The gross income decreased slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
The analysts expected 10 cents for stock and gross income $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth in the world, the aircraft producer reported that he put 45 aircraft in a quarter, less than the previous year, 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The Aviation Division's purse portfolio was $32.9 billion per 30 September, without changing 31 December.
“In the aviation area, the results were in conformity with our goals, but the low number of orders and the common market conditions became an unpleasant factor," said Bodwan.
The gross income in the aviation direction fell by 13 per cent — to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the largest train manufacturer in the world, reported that gross income in this sector increased by almost 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
The order portfolio in the transport unit amounted to $32.6 billion per 30 September, a little higher than the rate of 31 December.
Transport unit incomes have had a negative impact on the implementation of several major contracts.
The Guide stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's actions, which also announced that the chief financial director of Google Patrick Pichett would enter the Board of Directors, dropped by 8.5 per cent to C$4,83 in trades in the middle of Thursday.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the third world-wide commercial aircraft producer and the closest competitor of Bombardier, reported on Thursday that the quarter income decreased by 10 per cent.
Sony counts on a lower annual profit
The Japanese electronic producer, Sony's corporation, completed a net-deficit quarter of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, had reduced the projection of income for the current financial year.
The results of Sony for the period from July to September 2013 were more disruptive than were expected to be related to the fall of demand for television, videocams and Japanese corporation computers.
The Sony Television Business, in the second quarter, brought the first operational profit of 5,2 billion Yen in the first three years, has fallen to 9.3 billion in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronic market has suffered difficult times, especially because of television demand reduction.
While competitors are trying to seek out a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of the main contestors of Sony, the Panasonic Corporation, has recently accented to industrial compilation: the sales of companies are highly raising, especially through road systems and environmentally clean technologies.
As a result of the financial year ending in March 2014, Sony expects 179 billion of operational revenues against the expected 230 billion yen.
According to Thomson Reuters, the analysts suggested that this indicator would be significantly higher and would be 221 billion yen.

Gen of speech was a stimulator for synapse education
Scientists from the University of John Hopkins and the Mount-Sinay Medical School found a protein that foxp2 has made its function by stimulating the education of new links between neurons.
The study was published in Science, and its brief content can be read on the site of the magazine.
Gen Foxp2 is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
The role of the family has been established in 2001 by identifying a number of people who could not properly speak and sometimes not even understand each other.
Scientists found that family members had broken the work of the Foxp2 gene, but how it performed its function remained unknown.
A new study showed that at least a part of its functions, Foxp2 is a stimulator for new synapses in the brains related to the formation of speech.
It implements this through another gene, SRPX2.
The latest was found as a result of finding factors that stimulate synapse education.
SRPX2 was one of the 10 similar genes found by the authors, with only Foxp2.
What SRPX2 really affects the vocalization, scientists confirmed in the mice experiment.
When the animal's gene activity was artificially reduced, they were less screaming when dividing with the mother.
If the gene activity was restored, the frequency of the sound produced was also restored.
The links with the foxp2. were also shown on the mouse before.
Animals that were introduced to human copies of the gene were more active and at a lower frequency than usual mouses.
Still, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, according to SRPX2 has been managed with purely " mechanical" qualities of sound education or more thin processes.
Lawyer with cocaine dependence, who warned the head of the criminal group on the police investigation in prison
42-year-old Basarat Ditta provided information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarboro
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be discovered.
The Liverpool Royal Court was sentenced to three years of imprisonment.
The prestigious lawyer, who told the narcotics about a major police investigation because he feared to reveal his secret drug addiction, was locked in prison for three years.
The 42-year-old Basarat Ditta had transmitted secret information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarboro on his investigation on illicit drug trafficking after he was threatened by his cocaine dependence.
The Lawyer, who received the name Bash and called “cool lawyer”, was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police surveillance surveillance operation for Scarboro, which he had before presented in a drug-related court.
The officers noticed that the 32-year-old Scarboro left three cocaine packages at the house of a lawyer in Blackburn County of Lancashire while he was at the evening of a lawyer association with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta “regularly used ” the drugs of class A after the tests showed cocaine traces in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
During eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to get illegal information on the arrests of two persons under Scarboro, as well as one of his companions.
All four suspects were at this time under police surveillance in a large investigation of the criminal organization ' s heroin and cocaine acquisition in Lankashire, Cambria, Merciside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police took heroin and cocaine in the series of heroin and cocaine in the amount of $1.5 million and more than 200,000 cash.
The 42-year-old Ditta provided information to criminals because of the fear that his cocaine addiction would be disclosed.
Today, in the Liverpool Royal Court of Ditta, who is working at the Forbes Solicitors legal company in Blackburn, was ashamed of recognizing his guilt in two cases of intentional obstacle to the implementation of the justice of the three-week court in the Liverpool Court of the crown.
He recognized the storage of cocaine at one of the previous trials.
The disclosure of the lawyer happened after the Scarboro investigative police found that he had regularly spoken to Ditta on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives were tracked by the suspect and discovered how he approached Ditt's house in Blackburn and placed 60 per cent cleanness in a black golf glove under the junior trash box.
Shortly after Scarboroy transfer, he repeatedly contacted Ditta, who was at the football stadium at the Iwood Park Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; there were nine talks between them.
The Court found out that Ditta was using cocaine regularly after the tests found drug traces of class A in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later, but denyed the use of cocaine, said he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication was a “advocate secret”.
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to extract several credit cards, but they were confiscated, and he also had a sample of hair.
At the police interrogation, he said he had a house office, and his clients came to him for legal affairs.
However, the court was aware that after the major arrests, he called the largest participants of illicit drug trafficking, a number of whom he had before represented in the court to tell what the detectives knew about them.
Anne White, in the accused speech, said: “If anyone knows that it should not be violated, it is a criminal attorney.”
Mr. Ditta was accused of abuse of his criminal attorney ' s position as he had become too close to certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies drugs with his own lawyer.
Some of his talks will certainly prove to be legitimate because he was their lawyer.
This, however, has significantly crossed the limits of normal relations of a lawyer and client.
He prevented police investigation as much as possible to allow those persons to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't respect his profession, but embarrassed her.
He was too close to certain clients, in particular Scarboro, and he made doubts about his uninterestedness.
Ditta did not admit his guilt and stated: “If I were a corrupt lawyer whom I am not, and I would like to give the information to Mr. Scarboro, I would not wait 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
However, after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Holstead of the Lankashire Police said: “Mr. Ditta became a criminal attorney as soon as he began to acquire drugs from organized crime.”
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the purposes of the main criminal groups, which had instructed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Advocates should follow the highest standards of professional ethics and ensure confidence and confidence to society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide his profession.
Mr. Ditt's investigation led to the Lankashir Division on a particularly dangerous organized crime, which had already been sentenced on three cases of cocaine storage and now to prevent justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve a fair punishment for criminals.
Let this case be a warning for criminals that no one is outside the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarboro himself was convicted for 14 years after recognition of his guilt in the conspiracy with a view to delivering heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 perpetrators were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his Ditta site, he organized a conversation in the form of questions and answers in which he said that his dream work was a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, an ideal companion for him at dinner, Mohammed Ali, and the motivation in work is an inequality.
The Yaroslave stadium was not ready to receive 22,000 observers, noted police officers attending the meeting of the CDC RFS today.
The ticket programme was, in their view, overwhelmed about twice.
During the 1/16 final of the Russian Cube with Spartacus, only a thousand stewards were activated under a regulatory rule in nine thousand.
The Spartacus Battlers had 2,200 seats, 10 per cent from the stadium, but, according to the agreement with the Moscow club, they were sold to 5,000 tickets.
These data were announced by the chairman of the CDC Arthur Gregorianz.
The Americans were listening to Japanese high-level officials
On Friday, 1 November, one of the representatives of the US, who preferred not to disclose their name, stated that the States were listening to the phone talks of high-level officials of Japan.
The man confirmed that there were several points in the country of the sun in the incoming country for the audience.
He noted, however, that the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand did not conduct intelligence against each other.
He said that it was during World War II when these countries were allies.
However, Japan, like Germany, despite the alliance relationships with the Americans during the after-war period, are facilities for intelligence, the NHK telecanal.
None of the parties have yet commented on that information.
Recall, the news about the monitoring of the U.S. Special Services for the Officer of the F.R.A. last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA could have been listening to Merkel's phone for the past ten years.
The Chancellor itself, according to some data, took a very painful note of her audience.
She stated that allies, which she considered FRG and the United States to be unacceptable for decades, were inappropriate for such observations by the head of the Government.
In the meantime, Edward Snowden stated that he was willing to share details on the telephone hearing of Angela Merkel with German prosecutor staff.
The German flew specially to Moscow to meet the former CIA staff.
Baskiria may expose grain to trade not earlier than 2014
Baskiria may not before the beginning of 2014, the Minister for Agriculture of the Republic of Nicolai Kovalko considers during public procurement interventions.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
As long as the price on the market is higher, there is a demand.
"The grain may be exposed to trade, after the New Year," he said at the press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that the current year the seed of agricultural cultures under the harvest of 2013 amounted to 3.1 million gas, including the grain area of 1.7 million gas, by 3.3 per cent more than last year.
Under the harvest of 2014, 550 thousand gas were planted (for 105,000 ga more than in 2012).
Increased areas under the wheat and triticale, the fetus remained at the previous level.
In the IMD database, there is no Brother Circle grouping to which Lepsa was found in the United States.
The databases of the Russian Force Group of the Brother Circle, to which Washington lived the singer Gregory Leps, do not mean.
As the Interfax noted in the law enforcement authorities of the RF, after all databases of the United States Ministry of Finance came to the media, Gregory Leps had not been detected in the lists of suspicions of the Euro-Brathian Crime Syndicate.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of a mith of so-called “Russian Mafia” which appears to act abroad, is considered in force structures.
"And in the very name of the "Broth Circle" there is some element of mysteriousness, which is a hiding bed.
"It's all like a piar-action," said the agency's interviewer.
The U.S. Ministry of Finance announced on 31 October its lists of suspicions for the euro-based Criminal Syndicate of the Brother Circle of Arthur Badaljan, Gregory Lepsveride, Vadim Lalin, Sergei Moscalenko, Jacob Ribalski and Igor Šlikov.
Persons listed in this list are suspected of links with some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered influential members of the criminal groups and are in the U.S. lists of sanctions since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Gregory Leontieva is a courier for delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev.
In the Producer Centre, Gregory Lepsa refused to comment on the United States charges on the singer, called them "bradom".
In 2011, the President of the United States, Barak Obama, took the Brother Circle Syndicate into " substantial transnational organized criminal groups" and commanded the minfine to "dip their global criminal operations " .
The introduction of a man into the black lists of the American Minthin is the embarrassment of its assets in the United States and the ban on business contacts with the people living in the States.

Turkey's policyman announced hunger against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began building a separative wall in the area of Nusaibin in the south-east of Turkey.
Local inhabitants and representatives of the Prosecutor's PMD have spoken sharply against construction.
The mayor at the border with the Turkish city of Nusaibin Aishe Hekhan announced the hunger, protesting against the construction of a separative wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, reported the RIA News in the press service of the Party of Peace and Democracy (PMD) on Friday.

Venezuela will set a currency course for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency-bolivar for tourists.
The Bloomberg Agency reported this on 1 November with reference to the government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange the amounts equivalent to $10,000 in a year.
Venezuela will also allow to sell up to 25 per cent of the bolivars in the country at the time of their departure.
The specific course of the ballivar on the dollar will be established later.
In February, Karacas had to devaluate the local currency up to $6.3.
However, one dollar in the black market is estimated in 57 ballivaries.
Since the beginning of the year, the Bolivar lost almost 70 per cent of its value.
Inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 per cent in September.
The Minister for Oil Industry and Vice-President for Economy, Rafael Ramirez, said on 18 October that Venezuela had no plans for devaluating the Bolivar.
According to informal information provided by the Agency, Karakas may still decide to reduce the national currency course after municipal elections in December.
The general consumption of products and goods, as well as the highest level of Venezuela economy, has resulted in a deficit of a number of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media said that there was a lack of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Director of Yugar, Andrej Belmac, noted that it is difficult to say how long it will take to find a new chief coach.

The resignation took place just a few hours ago, so to say how long it takes to find a new coach, I am not ready,” the ITAR-TASS of Belmach's words.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We are examining all possible options.
The priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I wish not just to find a coach, but a man who will work in our club for several years and get some results.
Kenyan press is disturbed by the Provocation Law on Media
“It is a terrible place, and there is a reason for the question: What can not allow the independence of the judicial system to be destroyed by Parliament in the future?”, said the newspaper, calling the law non-constitutional.
"This law is very severe and punishable, and we reject it," said Cyrus Camau, director of the Capital Group, the mother company CapitalFM, which includes one of the most respected independent radio stations and the news site in Kenya.
He said that the new media ' will always be addictive because it is the Government ' s continuation, and the restrictions of content and advertising will harm Kenya's situation in the global economy.
"I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this law and return it to the deputies," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new law would in fact allow the Government to “take a dead capture”, and the Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had “a serious impact” and criticised the draft law as “draconic”.
The adoption of the draft law is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security after the September attack of Muslim terrorists in the Westgate Trade Centre.
Kenya's media caused anger by power by transmitting records of observation cameras where the troops who were sent to the scene of the attack must have robbed the expensive trading centre.
The reaction of the chief of the police of David Kimio was the challenge of two journalists and the media official to interrogate, although the call was canceled after the media protests.
According to the new issue law, up to 20 million Kenya shillings can be damaged, and individual journalists are up to one million with an additional risk to be “excluded from the lists”, which is prohibited from obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The Court also has the right to confiscate the offender's property if the penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “one fine is enough to paralyze the work of the majority of FM radiostations”.
It also stated that these measures could have a destructive effect on the so-called " revived blogosphere" of Kenya.
Politicians realize that by making the media shut up, they will be able to do whatever they want to do is impunityless.
“No one will ever know,” wrote journalist Nation Mutum Matthew, characterizing Kenya's media as a key source of restraining and balanced forces in public life.
“Politicians themselves will destroy the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
The Kenyan legislators were aimed at public anger in the past.
In May, they voted for the cancellation of the reductions appointed by the National Payment Commission and the reconstruction of their large salary of about 532 thousand shillings per month, one of the highest taxes in the world.

The most approximately for the standard two-room apartment since the new year, it will have to be supplemented from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The precise norm will determine the Government of the region.
However, when you paint the approach, order the staircase cells or even replace the elevator, residents will decide.
Such a law has been approved by the deputies of the regional thought.
Vladimir Keynikov, Chairman of the Voronij District Think, noted: “In this case, there is also a need to be ordered - to set up the order of house copremonting, to accumulate funds not in governing companies -- which are often registered in Moscow, or in Orenburg, somewhere else, this will be the establishment of public control over the expenditures that the inhabitants collect for repair of many apartments.”
Under the control of the State now and the left-hand construction.
The law that protects from frauds has been approved by a fraud in final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4,5 thousand people have suffered from unfair buildingers.
Most of the problems have been resolved.
By the way, the new law provides rights and responsibilities for all participants.
Vladimir Keynikov, Chairman of the Voronija Regional Think, stated: "No secret is that in this area there have also been abuses associated with the same shareholders in the 98s and in 2000s the same shareholders."
People began to earn money to cover the lasey, including those two laws.
Under the Voroniage, it is decided to build a temporary stay centre for foreign citizens to be deported.
The district parliament adopted such a law not only under the pressure of the Federation.
At least dismiss the problems of illegal migrants in the region.
For the past year, more than 100,000 aliens arrived at the migration account.
But only every fifth issued the official permission to work.
Where the rest work and whether they pay taxes, it's a big question.
Vladimir Keynikov, chairman of the Voronijian Area Mind, said, "They have violated legislation but are not criminals."
There's no trial, and deportation must be deported somewhere.
Such a decision the Federation adopted that, through regional means, such places should be equipped.
In the Voronija region, this is the Old Olshanka of the Semiluc region.
Well, the regional parliament has finally given new benefits to many children's parents.
First, 5 and more children are fully released from transport tax.
In this case, the budget loses 3.5 million -- but that is the amount of savings and many children's parents.
Secondly, this is the main thing for those who adopt three and more babies, since the new year, they will issue grants for housing.
For each member of the family, the new law provides 18 square meters, at a price of 30,000 per meter.
The family, for example, is a six - person - father, mother, child and three - adopted.
For them, according to the norms, the State acquires accommodation by 108 square meters, for 3,30,000 rubles.
For the left shore or the South-West Microrround, it is quite acceptable.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage in the center.

Italian intern workers retire the way young people
Italian unemployment beats records.
The data published on Wednesday showed that 12.5 per cent of the people of the country had not worked.
Such bad things have not been done since the Second World War.
This is a number of times higher among young people.
40.4 per cent of people aged 15 to 24 are unemployed.
According to the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is the preliminary retirement of older workers.
Such an experiment has already been conducted by the largest energy company of the country, and the laws adopted allow regional authorities to provide part of prior retirement for stakeholders.
On the other hand, Italy is awaiting the common problem of the ageing population for Europe.
And economies are not sure that the advanced rotation of staff will justify themselves.
What will lead to the construction of TPU in Moscow
With each year, the capital authorities promised to build more transport and transplant nodes (TTP).
By 2020, it was planned to introduce 255 PTPs.
Our correspondent was dealing with the project.
A few months ago, a construction fence was built at the Smolenska subway.
The sign said there was a transport-transplant device.
It was all very strange because no land transport is stopped next to Smolensk, and there is no way to sit on it.
To reach the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, it is necessary to reach about 130 meters, including the groundway through the Carmanic Street.
Smolensky's almost over now.
The flower larect, the disconnected stand for newspapers, and the asfalt was changed before the entrance.
That's the whole transport node.
Transport and transplant nodes are flat and capital, explained in the press service of the capital transport department.
The captain's TPU is not yet.
The planes suggest the construction of parkings, the conclusion of trade objects preventing the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and accommodation.
In fact, the PTP is not even carriers, but professional service providers from the capital repair department of Moscow.
The transport node is not necessarily an complicated structure, explains the Director of the Institute for Transport Economy and Transport Policy of the High Economy School of Michael Blinkin.
Sometimes there are enough roofs over the head and tables that tell about the arrival of transport.
For example, the metro of Yasenovo recently opened a full plane transplant node.
Let's not screw up, but with the parking machines and the table that indicate when the bus is coming.
But in the pursuit of the number of officials, they record anything in the PTP.
In 2011, the Maya planned to build all about 151 knots, 59 with capital construction.
The plans are now up to 255 PTPs until 2020.
One and a half of them is promised to give up this year.
Although there is a TPU development programme in the city, there are no quality criteria, states Alexander Mrozov, Co-Chairman of the City and Transport Public Organization.
The number of objects is reported, but the quality of the transplant on each of them is often deteriorating.
The criteria, in the expert ' s opinion, should be two: first, reduced time of transplantation, second - comfort.
First of all, the possibility of changing the mode of transport without raining.
In Moscow, when the TPU is emerged, it is the opposite.
A bright example of the DNSH subway.
Pretty long before the predested buses from the Yaroslavian road were on the square before the main entrance to the WC.
Their stops were now transferred to the opposite side of Jaroslava to the street of Cosmonauts.
Far from the subway, far away from the monorels, but closer to the living houses.
The inhabitants didn't want the bus under the windows completely and complained about all possible instances.
The capital TPU in Moscow had not been issued at once.
The first one started building five years ago at the Planner Metro.
The project was designed to be a model.
It was indeed a model of how the transplant node given to the investors is transformed into a banal trade center.
No, there's a bus peron, an axle to keep the metro under the rain, and three floors of the car.
Truth is, no principal places were given to chemical trolleybus No.202 and No203 in the Moscow PTP.
They've been removed from the metro.
But there's more trade places left.
One of the 32 shops, and there's almost everything from the zoo to the car salon.
Well, actually, if any of the bus passengers would need to buy a new car on the road?
When we build a capital PTP, we always have a trading center.
The situation has recently reached its logical completion when a part of the car station has decided to be marketed.
Now, on the third floor of the PLANER, there is a fighting trade among parking grounds.
Fruits, spears, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and guards who look badly at our photographer.
The transplant node has finally turned into a market.
The thing is, the metro had a market before, but it was taken off.
In the prefecture of the traders, they regretted and released the receiving parking of the transplant node.
Still, because of high prices there is always empty.
The funny thing is that the market was taken down to build a new plane TPU.
That's the rocking.
In the metro, "Calužská" was 50 meters away from the metroway to the bus, says Alexander Mrozov.
After the construction of the Trade Centre, it is likely to have a distance to 170 meters.
To get to the bus, we need to go through the whole trading center.
After 22 hours closed, it has to be circled under the open sky.
However, the designs in the Planner and Calugia will soon be shown with flowers.
In mid-September, the Bureau's urban-world commission adopted planning decisions for the first eight capital PTPs.
Four of them will be 25 floors without two or three underground yaruss.
The main monster will grow at the Tushino subway, with 418.7 square meters of the area.
Representants of the RGD railway stations, responsible for the construction of the CEP at the metro, have already told journalists that stores, hotels and apartments are available in future multi-stages.
The officials are assured that the multidimensional parkings are mutted from third to half the area.
Let's take the "national" garages for example.
Let's say that the garage of 258 car places recently built on the International Street has an area of 8015 square meters.
So for the parking lot of 2,6 thousand cars, "Petrovsko-Intelligence" is going to take about 80,000 squares.
It's less than a third of the machine they're going to build there.
Let's get one or two floors on all the bus perrons.
At least 150,000 square meters of commercial real estate remains.
And this is, for a minute, almost two GUMs.
If the capital PTPs build railways at stations and stations, the other grounds will be conquered by metropolitans.
They also promised that there would be many " functional appointments", including hotels, offices and even sports rooms.
By the way, in the Moscow property department recently told journalists that they were developing a draft decision that investors would be able to request a PTP station directly to officials.
No contests.
Therefore, please that transport issues for the city are priority.
The ideal PTP is, for example, the Harvard Station in Boston or the Spacyne in Toronto, Alexander Mrozov.
The trolleybus and tramways go down to the ground level of the metro and the distance from the train train to the tramway is only 50 metres without going to the street.
There's no excessive trade around.
But the Moscow officials are thrown in extremes.
We're not building anything or we're going to take 25 floors off with offices and apartments.
Esser proposes to compare the insult of patriotic feelings to extremeism
For the legislative protection of patriotical feelings of citizens against the provocation and insults against Russia, " fair Russia " suggests comparison the injury of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and punish for that five years of prison.
As the Notifications reports, such amendments to the legislation prepared by the Immediate Energy Committee, Oleg Micheev, are already aimed at receipt of the Supreme Court and the Government.
Under the patriotical feelings of citizens, the author of the amendment suggests that the emotional relationship of a person with the country whose citizen is the character of love for that country is responsible for its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As indicated by Micah, domestic legislation has sanctions for abuse over the formal signs of the State authorities by flag and herb.
The parliamentary believes that the protection of Russians, whose feelings may be affected and insulted by public symbols, and other indifferences of disrespect to our country, are not sufficient in the Russian legislation.
As an example, it brings the debate to the Canon of the Victory Day every year, when some media persons allow themselves to question the heroic movement of the SSSR people in combating fascists.
The present vakhanalia is opening each year before the main global celebration - Day of Win 9 May.
While practicing in a embarrassment and "alternate view" of history, some publicists have thought that it is unfortunate that the cultural Germans did not win the wild Soviet Union!
I consider that it is absolutely inadequate in the country where pride for history remains the main “duch” of the nation,” is disturbed by Oleg Micheev.
Furthermore, according to Micah, the patriotic people in Russia are much more than religious, but the law punishes the feelings of believers, and the insult of patriotic feelings can be practically impunityless.
In the view of the people ' s elected, the insult of patriotic emotions to extreme activities should be compared to and the punishment in article 282, of the Criminal Code.
The draft law imposed punishment for the insult of patriotic feelings: from 100 thousand fines to 5 years of imprisonment.
The earthquake of 6.6 took place on Thursday, 31 October, in the Cokimbo area in the central part of Chile, reports the Reuters Agency.
The earthquake was located in the ocean depth of 10.7 miles [10.7 km] and 54 miles south-west of the city, set out on the U.S. Geological Service website (USGS).
The pumps were fixed at 20:03 at local time (3:03, 1 November) in Moscow.
Victims or underground ruins are not yet reported.
Recall that Chile is in one of the most seizmoactive areas of the earth, so the earthquakes of different forces are not rare.
One of the most serious things happened in 2010.
The earthquake of 8.8 and tsunami caused more than 550 people in Chile and destroyed 220 thousand buildings.
In addition, the most powerful earthquake occurred in Chile in the latest history: in 1960, the magnitude of 9.5.
More than five thousand people died as a result of the natural disaster.
Dmitri Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be considered fairly
The Prime Minister of RF Dmitri Medvedev reported on Friday that the Greenpeace Activists would be considered in strict compliance with Russian legislation.
France may have doubts that the case will be conducted in accordance with the legislation; we hear all concerns.
"We can guarantee law enforcement," said Dmitri Medvedev at the meeting with the Prime Minister of France Jean-Mark Ero.
There is a French citizen among detained Greenpeace activists.
Pierre Pizania, like the other activists, has been accused of bullying.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture with regard to the detained citizen," Mr. Ero quoted " RIA News " .
"Our country cannot support activities that could harm the environment, no one is entitled to violate laws," said, in turn, Dmitri Medvedev.
He said that the activities of any structures that are trying to influence technologically complex and insecure processes, including energy gain, are dangerous.
He emphasized that these objects were "as a dust bowl" and recalled what was happening in the Mexican Gulf, the RIA News.
UN announces new goals to overcome poverty
The United Nations should immediately work on a new set of challenges to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty throughout the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting " sustainable development goals" for the change of the MDGs, which expired in 2015, before the UN Sustainable Development Summit started in Rio de Janeiro at the evening.
They were included in the final version of the document signed by the world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Pan Gi Moon told the summit at the evening that it was time to “be higher than national interests”.
"I am glad that the UN member countries agreed to launch and control the process of establishing universal sustainable development goals, the CER," he said.
These CERs will be based on our progress in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, which will become an integral part of the development concept for the period after 2015.
I will make every effort to use the powers made by the Member States to make our vision of sustainable development goals that are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
The concern of the security in Mozambique increases in the conflict of influenced people
Under the statue of Samara Mašela, the founder of Mozambique, looking at them above, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to scandal peace slogans on one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Executive Director of the Investment Company.
As she fears the future of her country, she changed the business suit for a shirt decorated by "We demand security" in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on the capital square of Independence on Thursday.
For two weeks, practically daily reports of conflicts between government troops and Renamo are one of the most cruel conflicts since the reconciliation had been concluded over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, which was supported first by the white authorities of Rodesia, and then by the Government of South Africa, the age of the apartheid in the framework of efforts to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After the 1992 reconciliation, it became an opposition party.
The analysts believe that the country would hardly revert to a full conflict, but recent events have forced foreign investors and local residents to be nervous.
Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States will be high for the rapid economy, since the opening of huge gas shelf stocks and coal landscapes in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years.
The Ruling Party of Frelimo, the leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo Party accused each other of the tension.
The Renamo Party claims that the Government had become a closer to the last conflict, attacking its members in the Sophala Province, the traditional renamo salary, on 17 October.
The attacks on former rebels then increased when government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakam, the leader of the group, reported to the Financial Times Fernando Mazanga, representative of Renamo.
The Government blames Renamo for initiating conflicts, accusing the Party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Gabuza tried to dissolve concerns about instability.
Hebuza said to the French information agency AFP on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt as a " loser" who wanted to use "all that remained from his power to try to prove that he could bring his own decisions to the Government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid wars.
However, the concerns increased after the report that Mazanga said that Renamo was rejected by the 1992 peace agreement.
He reported the Financial Times that he had in mind the non-compliance with the agreement of the Party of Frelimo.
" Our goal is to return to negotiations but with all seriousness," said Mazanga.
The previous negotiations between parties have made little to weaken the tension that a series of collisions had increased this year.
“There are two influential people (Gebuza and Dhlakama), collapsed with the skull," said Joseph Hanlon, a preacher of the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to go to the necessary penalties.
The Renamo Party, which attempted to acquire electoral reform, has already stated that it would combat municipal elections for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for the next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt to acquire declines and financial bonuss from the Government.
The share of votes for Renamo has been reduced since 1992, while the new Party is the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which is expected to improve its indicators at these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuza, who should leave the post next year when his second term ends, wished to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the president's position," said Mazanga.
It is not clear what Renamo is capable of, but it has already launched destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on the key road leading from north to south.
Most of the conflicts were held in the Sofala Province, a few hundred miles north of Maputo, but includes Bayra, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railways about a week after Renamo threatened the railway attack.
Mazanga was embarrassing when he was asked whether Renamo would repeat that threat.
The Renamo Party wanted “to warn the international community that things in Mozambique were not doing well”, said Mazanga.
Instability has increased dissatisfaction by the Government, and many are also concerned about corruption, slow development rates and recent abductions, said Fernando Lima, head of the Independent Mediacoop.
“People think that the government and the President are responsible for the future, which should also find a solution to these problems,” he said.
Omar Sultwan, a participant in the demonstration, said that people just want stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace renewal, they want free access to roads," he said.
A series of Prime Ministerial Film Shows will be held in Moscow
A series of Arctic Mainstream films, where the viewers can see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before they go to the market, will be held in Rolan's cinema from 1 to 5 November, reports the RIA News with reference to project organizers.
Opens the Arth-Mainstream programme of the French director and actress Reim Kerichi Paris at any price.
This is a story of the worker in the French capital of the Maya model (Kerici), which was deported to Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to the film, Kerichi will also show a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Duke Mebius, the melodramatic bayopique of Oliver Hirschbigel "Diana: the history of love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the main role and the main film of the Cann's Film "Život Adel" Abdelatiff Keshish.
The only Russian participant of the Arth-Mainstream will be the winner at the Kinotaurus festival, the film of Alexander Veldenian Geographic Globe has broken out on the motives of the one-named novel, Alexei Ivanov.
The main role of the charming teacher, Victor Sluškin, played in the film Constantine Habenski, whose work was also marked by the Kinotaurus prize.
Children should study myths and legends as “models of life,” says the author.
The accounts of Tora could show that “the gross power cannot overcome a delicate trick, ” and legends of King Arthur show the importance of having dreams.
Saying that many myths will be “sufficient, too scandalous, and in some cases too rude to teach in schools”, Crossley Holland is pronounced as a “familiar selection” of texts fit for age.
"I believe it is wonderful that myths and folklore in America are already part of education," he said.
I've been proposing for introducing them into the training programme for 20 years.
He added that "excessive moralization" of authors and teachers "beat interest" in children, and the basic ideas are "subscribed" in fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holand, who translated Beowulf from the English-Saxon language, as well as wrote the Norwegian Myth Congregation for Penguin and the British People's Tales, said: “You may certainly have intentions, but you better keep them with you.”
Perhaps the great difference between the adult author who writes for adults and the adult author who writes for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or ended happyly, but it is necessary for the inherent understanding of good and evil.
And this must be sublimated; it is revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
Old principle: show, not tell.
A football fan was detained in the Voroniya area that broke the window in the waiting room
At 9:00 a.m. on 29 October at the Gryzi Vronegi transport police station, two Moscow football fans were removed from the passenger train.
After going to the game of the favorite team, the boys made a drunken debosh on the train.
Young people were delivered to the police line office at the Gryzi Station to establish a protocol on administrative offences.
There the fans regretted their anti-public behaviour.
The police formed administrative material on them and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and the station began to wait for his arrival.
At half the first night the fans left the railway station, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and broke the door window in the waiting room.
A transport police officer and a CHOP guardian "RJD" came to the bell of the broken glass.
They managed to detain a criminal who tried to hide from the scene of the incident.
Russian South-Eastern LU workers are reviewed.
The issue of the criminal proceedings is addressed, the senior referencer to the information and public links of South-Eastern LU of Russia on the transport of Sergei Olchovik.
Vitalius Mutko: Watermetes?
I think we've been back 15 years ago.
The Minister of Sports Vitalij Mutko expressed his view of disturbance at the tribunal during the Russian Basket of Shinnik, Spartacus.
I am an advocate of all of this to organizers of sports events: clubs, leagues, RFSs.
But we see they've taken a second position.
They're waiting for someone to come by and order it.
It's a very good position, but it's not exactly right.
We have to organize the cheerleaders, clubs should invite their stewards, not let the case go.
We have now developed a special order of the Government on the rules of conduct at stadiums.
After it is accepted, we will deal with this intimately.
But I still have to invite all soccer organizers.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
State, please, let's get the law fast.
It feels like the Bavaria Bavarians came to Yaroslavle and made it all.
We're foreign observers.
And it's awful to see the tribune floating from the brandspooth.
And it's in a country that is preparing for the world's championship.
"I feel like we're back for 10 or 15 years ago," said Mutko.
Snowden can be interrogated in Russia
The expert of the US Special Services, Edward Snowden, probably will not leave outside Russia to testify on the phone talks of the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel.
As Interfax stated on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, the American may answer the questions of the representatives of the Prosecutor of Germany in writing or eye in Russia.
Edward Snowden's exit outside Russia is practically excluded.
"In that case, he will lose refugee status and may be issued to Washington by United States Allies," said the interviewer of the agency.
" However, in principle, the FRG prosecution could send its representatives to RF or transmit written questions to Snowden," added the source, adding that the issue should be developed at the intergovernmental level.
Previously, the German bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebelle reported that Edward Snowden was ready to testify in the case of the US Special Services of the Chancellor of Germany.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in Germany.
The ClA's Expert Associate made it clear that he knew a lot of things.
Although the U.S.A.A.B. has blocked all its movements, Snowden is ready to arrive in Germany.
However, it is necessary to clearly determine all the conditions of his arrival," said the Strebel Television of Euronews.
Snowden's lawyer Anatoli Koucheren, commenting on the source of Interfax, stated that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he would decide himself.
U.S. Citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the United States National Security Agency (ANB) and the CIA, ran to Hong Kong in May 2013, and then published information on the secret operations of the United States Services on the Internet.
Snowden flyed through Moscow through transit, but he couldn't leave the airport because his passport was cancelled by the US authorities, which had been prominently accused of him, and remained at the Transit Areemievo airport before the beginning of August.
On August 1, Snowden received a document to provide a temporary asylum in the territory of Russia for a year and the same day left " Sheremethevo " .
Yesterday, American lawyer Anatoli Kucheren said that his client had a job in a large Russian company.
The NSA observed Angela Merkel last week by the German media.
According to journalists, the Chancellor's telephone talks have started to hear from the Americans in 2002.
The tracking station appeared to be in the US Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, following the publication of these informations, stated that the observation of Merkel violated the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Ponomaries left "Free Russia"
The Deputy of the State Voice from the Party of Just Russia, a member of its office in Novosibirsk, Illia Ponomarev, filed a statement of withdrawal from the political organization.
As the parliamentary said, he made a statement to the New Syberian Regional Division of the Party.
According to her statute, it automatically means that Ponomarians have left the lines of justice.
We're sitting, drinking tea...
"Why do many want to see the picture "Ilia Ponomares put on the table" but there is no such an era," the representative commented his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintained good relations with the regional office of the Eshers.
In the meantime, it was not intended to refuse the mandate of the Deputy Illia Ponomarev.
He explained that, despite the exit of the party, he remained a member of the fraction and, in law, could not get out of it.
Communications on the intention of Elia Ponomarev to leave the Party of Just Russia appeared on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitri Goodkov and Valerius Zubov would be expelled with him, but the last had soon denied this information.
Japan will discuss the conclusion of a peace treaty with Russia
Japanese head of MIDA Fumio Kisida met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss issues relating to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"I would like to expressly exchange views on further political dialogue, discuss issues relating to the conclusion of the peace treaty," said Kisida at the meeting.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that, after the Prime Minister of Japan, Sindzo Abe visited Russia, relations between countries became bilateral and acquired bilateral nature.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the RF would meet Japan in addressing complex political issues, said the RIA News.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies solutions to the issue of dispute Northern Territories.
Consequently, today, in Tokyo, protests have taken place with the requirement to return the country lost after World War II.
The Japanese capital drives cars from which the speaker says: “Return the northern territories! ”
The police are not stopping the protesters; they are watching noises not exceeding the level of noise.
Ben Greenman: The tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It can be bold to claim that New York is the place of birth of a stendap comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, an estradic artist Frank Fay, who worked in the theatre Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to talk to the public in a conversation manner.
Féya's innovation was eventually captured by other, just recently, the New York Comedian Festival.
The created and courized Caroline Hersh, the founder of the Stendap Club, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, counting over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“The majority of these hedliners started in Carolines and then made more progress, achieved the level when they were already too famous to speak at the club,” said Hursh.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year, the event includes Vanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the Standap for Heroes, a annual musical and commercial charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, where other Bruce Springstein, John Stuart, Roger Watters and Bill Cosby will appear.
The widening of the festival also expanded the world of comedia.
A number of comics participating in the festival this year acquired popularity in a non-traditional way, for example, through small television shows such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was familiar with the role in the comedian series at a low-known cable television channel (e.g. the FXX Liga on the FXX topic of football), and now he's running his own sketch show at Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate joined the actress as well as the "Saturday Eve" and "Parks and Rest Areas", although it is most famous in the series of viral shoes "Marcell's shoes".
And Kroll, and Slate, as well as other young comedians with self - style (realisticly pessimistic Anthony Jesselnik, a creepy, focused on racial theme Camau Bell, is the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be the interview of David Steinberg with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stendap comic, but then became a successful director on TV and the movies as well as an informal comic historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he was a TV show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held in the Town Hall in the centre of Manhattan.
“This city is definitely the central element of Larry's entire work”, said Steinberg.
He told me that when he arrived here, he sometimes walked around a street between two houses and thought, "If I'm out of money, I might live here."
Pakistan authorities began negotiations with local Talibans
Pakistan's authorities have started negotiations with the Taliban movement.
This was reported by the embassy of this country in Britain, where the Prime Minister of Pakistan Navaz Sharif was visited.
The Chief of the Government of Pakistan made a statement of negotiations with Islamic extremists during the meeting with the British Vice-Prime Minister Niko Clegg, with whom he discussed Pakistan and India ' s relations, the world energy market and economic reform in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister said that the Taliban movement dialogue began," said in the statement of the embassy of Pakistan in London.
He said that he hoped and prayed for dialogue to earnest in accordance with the Pakistan Constitution," the diplomats added.
Pakistan Taliban (Techric and Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the so-called Afghan movement, but act independently in the northwest regions of Afghanistan.
Pakistan Talibans seek to establish an Islamic State.
Previously, the Islamabad Government had attempted to begin negotiations with local Talibans, but the movement was denied dialogue.
It stated that it would only go to negotiations if the authorities had placed the permanent dislocation of the troops in areas where the Talibans operated and released from prisons of arrested Islamists.
Navaz Sharif arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, David Cameron, the head of the Pakistan Government and the Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai held a trilateral meeting in London discussing the prospects of the peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil dropped up to $96 for a barrel.
The oil price continued to fall on Friday, when the concerns about the education of large stocks had eclipsed by a communication showing that China's energy production sector has become strong.
The U.S. oil series arrived by 14 cents in December, and its price was $96.24 for a barrel for the European morning in electronic trades in the New York Market.
On Thursday, the contract reached 39 cents, which amounted to a drop of prices per October by 5.8 per cent.
The rich oil stocks have affected its value in the past weeks.
The Ministry of Energy stated on Wednesday that US stocks had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, more than 25 million barrels were filled.
However, on Friday, there was an indication of possible increase in demand, according to two reports of the Chinese industry that demonstrated the explosion of its activities.
This indicates that the recovery of China's economy could continue to be forced after the growth rate in the third quarter rose to 7.8 per cent after the twenty-year minimum in the previous quarter.
The oil of Brent, the oil of international oil used also by US oil-processing enterprises, reached 26 cents to $108.58 for a barrel on the Intercontinental Bank in London.
The Chief Coach, Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release the Hilliper of Semen Warlamm from the first minute in the Friday game with Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night behind the prison did not fail his confidence in the Russians, transmitted from Dallas the S.E. Sabcore of Natalia Schmeleva.
And what should we wait for, "reached Roo after the morning's breakdown, Lavin.
Of course, all of us are concerned about what happened, but we are sure of it and feel that it will be useful for it today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show his usual level.
So you're absolutely sure that the situation hasn't been in the condition of the doorman?
We'll see today.
Our players will undoubtedly support Warley by helping him protect the gate, as it was in the previous games of this season.
The main thing is, no one in the team is going to make any conclusions until the court finds out.
In Siberia, we should not be vegan: the heat tomato will not replace the juice
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, a correspondent of RIA News found out.
People who are completely denied animal origin should not live in Siberia.
They do not carry their winter without losing their health, and no heat tomatoes compensate for them, considers the newly-siber dietologists and doctors before the Day of Vegan.
Drink oil with litres
Strict vegetarianism, not only from meat and fish but also from milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashion of life.
However, dietologists are convinced that in Novosibirska and other towns of Siberia, such strict nutrition standards are at least not useful for health.
Full denial of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain unchanged amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for plants.
At least the milk or eggs must be incorporated into the railway," surely dietologist Marina Bogy.
It sets for example fish containing unchanged fat acid Omega-3.
The richest of their plant oil is lazy.
"To need it in the quantities needed for humans, it is necessary to drink with litres!" said the dietologist.
Medicines are confident that Siberia’s residents need special attention to winter.
In this season, vegetarianism is particularly doubtful.
Our realities require high food requirements.
To avoid freezing, you need a high calority.
"If a person restricts himself on animal products, he does not take this calories," said the expert.
That's what the dietologist Olga Pozniak agrees.
It adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not a way out.
It is better for humans to eat precisely foods that are grown in the living region or where he was born.
The genetic code is designed to better adopt and convert these products.
And in winter people wish not to bite a coat, but a hot juice or something more supplied," explains the doctor.
She said that the vegans can eat, and they really benefit from different crops, bulbs, beans, local vegetables, apples remaining in winter, frozen beans.
But this is definitely not enough for full food.
According to Claudia Arifulina, the siberians in the organisms have only sufficient vitamin levels from the middle of August to the middle of September.
The full transfer to vegetarianism in our severe natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees in the day and in May, it is unfit.
The body needs energy for life, and this is primarily fat," states the medicine.
The doctors note that veganism is particularly harmful for children and pregnant people.
Children grow, they need construction materials, including amino acids.
And by sticking to vegetarianism, we give them incomplete.
Pregnant people also need increased protein, vitamins and microelectrics in the menu.
"They don't get the vegans," I'm sure God.
Arifulina says that a grown man is free to choose anything, to play with the toys he wants.
He has already formed organism, skeleton, organs.
The children still have to eat full food.
If parents deprive him of some microelements or amino acids, choosing what he will eat, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of any substances for brain development, the view, the bones are no longer restored tomorrow," she said.
All medicinal experts are compared with the view of the low quality of winter growing in warm and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us and grown in the warms, contains less than the required microelectrics than the (increased) in open soil.
"It's not the quality of the products," said Gody.
Arifulina also notes that imported and heat vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to collect large harvests is damaged by quality.
"The apples do not become brown on the cut, the barbers quickly yellow and swallow, the tomatoes tasteless and inaromatic," the medical examples add that they are probably overwhelmed by excessive quantities of fertilizers.
And they become suppliers, not vitamins, but cells.
The Siberian Physical and Technical Institute of Agriculture was disagreeable with that, a candidate of Vera Petruk ' s selhosis science.
She said that, with the right approach and compliance of all the standards and requirements in the warms, it is possible to grow full vegetables.
If they try to expel a larger square meter, they will, of course, become more frequent to pour, and to feed plants with mineral destiny.
For example, when too many nitrogen fibres are rapidly growing, they are large but wateristic and disgusting," she explains, adding that the quality issue, primarily, depends on the manufacturer's conscience.
The Court has suspended the implementation of the " stop-and-execution" decision at the New York Department of the Police
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal of the Federal District suspended the execution of the Judiciary Requiring Amendments in the “Call-and-Saw” programme of the New York Department of the Police and removed the judge from the case.
The Court of Appeal of the Second District stated that the implementation of the decisions of Judge Shira Shandlin would be suspended until the outcome of the appeal issued by the city.
In August, the judge decided that the city had violated the constitution in the way he was executing a street detention and interrogation programme.
The city filed a complaint on its decision and regulations on corrective measures, including the order to appoint a supervisor to help the police change the practice of work and the programme of training.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard the debate of the parties on the request for a suspension of the case.
The Court of Appeal stated that the Judge was required to be withdrawn because it violated the U.S. Judges Code of Behaviour and did not count on the need to avoid the manifestation of predominance, partly due to a series of interviews with the media and official statements containing a public response to the court's criticism.
The Judge decided that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, unjustly refering to the black and Latin Americans on the programme " stop-and-exclude " .
It appointed an external controller to supervise large change, including policy, training and control reforms, and decided to launch a pilot programme for television testing videocams in the police stations where most detentions occur.
In August, New York decided to stop the practice of preserving names and addresses of people in which cases were ceased after the police check.
The city appeal debate should take place after 14 March 2014.
Tactics “stop and search” were criticised by many civil rights lawyers.
The “Subby” has been practiced for several decades in a form, but the number of documented stops has rapidly increased in the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684 330 people in 2011, most of which are black and Latin Americans.
In 2004, four people, all representatives of national minorities, filed a collective court.
Participants of the change in the “Call-and-Out” programme in the New York Police Department said that these changes would end in unconscious practices, form a more reliable and effective police service and may influence how other police departments implement this practice.
The opponents argue that the change would reduce the fighting spirit of police rather than the level of crime, will lead to unnecessary money waste and will not address the global problem of complex conditions in the police because of the reduction of officers by a few thousand in the past decade.
The Judge noted that it had not ceased the practice of “stop-and-shooting” that was in accordance with the Constitution, but changed the way the New York police stopped people.
In the area of the Third Gallery, a walking zone was opened.
A new walking zone appeared in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Third Gallery and takes the station two kilometers from the metro station Novokuzneska to the Moor Square.
All over the time, street torchers, flowers, chambers, urnas and toilets have been installed, deaf fences are cleaned and illegal advertising.
In addition to Clementovski and Laurusinian streets, which have already been walking, five streets were closed for the cars - the Ordyn Stupid, the Great and Small Talmacevian streets, the Kadshev Shore and the Moor Square.
Motion of transport on the streets of Morosayka and Petroka is not limited.
In the Friday Street section, the New Kunetic Station to Clement's Level, the conditions for pedestrians have been established without removal of movement and cutting, transmitted by newsmsk.com.
The Third Gallery, the temple of the Pope Clement, the Museum, the Libraries, the monuments, and other observations.
Previously, the Trust Travel, the Highways of the streets and the Kuznecki Bridge were fully walking.
The large Dmitrovka, where the walking zone was opened in early September, is determined to close for holidays and weekends.
Coulson ran into a phone breakthrough to check the confidential message.
The former editor of the News of the World Andy Coulson had allegedly used the “corruption of the phone, observation and resistance” in an attempt to confirm false information about Charles Clarke's novel at that time as Minister of Interior.
The Prosecutor, the Royal Advocate Andrew Edis, informed the Court of Old Bailey that in May 2005 the News of the World received untrusted news that Clark was meeting with his "privacy special adviser" Hannah Polby.
The newspaper commanded the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to break the Paulby voice mail and warned her at home to take an interview, but Coulson also called her and left voice messages, “the court heard.
“The accusation believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now editor of NOW, is not a person who will stand near someone's house, hoping to find someone surprised, he is a man who loves to offer history to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He said that the News of the World used three ways to investigate stories: telephone breakdown, observation and opposition.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the broken phones?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!"
The records of Clark's romance first attracted the attention of the News of the World, when the source of sexually interested in Ms. Polby said: “Don't waste time, she's with Charles.”
The voting records received from her phone at least three times were removed from the Mulcaire house in August 2006.
Furthermore, the investigators found records on the computer of a private detective in which Ms. Polby and her sister were represented as Projects.
During the period under surveillance, Ms. Polby and her grandfather received anonymous calls with requests to provide information about it, said Mr. Edis.
At that time, former major reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherap monitored Mrs. Polby's movements.
After leaving her a voice message on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: “I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and I would like to discuss with Charles.”
Mr. Edis said that Coulson's participation in this history was on the same scenario as with other powerful people, such as the former Minister of Interior, David Blankett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson encountered a confrontation with Mr. Blankett about the romance with a married woman while he was meeting with the correspondent Rebecca Brooks, who was at the time married.
Coulson and Brooks deny the entry into agreement with other people in order to break up phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulker, Thurlbeck and Weserape confessed in a telephone breakfast.
Snowden states that he is willing to communicate with the FRG authorities in the hearing case
The ClA Expert, Edward Snowden, is willing to arrive in Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity for that, and to meet the representatives of the FRG authorities, transmitted the RIA News.
A letter from the former ClA officer to the FRG authorities for a meeting with journalists in Berlin presented to the bundestague bundestag Hans-Christian Strebelle, through which Snowden transmitted the message to the German authorities.
Shrebelle first met with Snowden in Moscow.
Four people were injured by fire in the Twer Street
As a result of the combustion in a collector in the centre of Moscow, in the Twerd Street, four passing people were suffered.
According to Interfax, with reference to the source in emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, the peripherals that were inhabited during the fire in a smoked underground transition have suffered.
According to RIA News, with reference to the head of the capital department of the Fuel and Energy House, Paul Livinsky was now fully renewed in all houses in the Twer Street.
Fire in a heat collector near the house of 15 on the Twerd Street took place on the evening of 31 October.
A strong smoke went out of the lion seasons, and the underground crossing at the Armenia store formed a smoke.
As a result of the explosion, 11 homes were deployed in the Trust Street.
At 9:45 a.m., the moscow fire was eliminated.
United States cut off food for the poor
Food benefits are reduced by $36 per month
Since Friday in the United States, the financial provision of foodstuffs known as Foodstemps has been reduced since the action of the relevant public programme is completed.
Food benefits from the four family will now be allocated by $36 a month less than before, the officials say.
This will affect 47 million poorest Americans.
According to the Reuters Agency, in 2012 the financial year, the benefit of one person was an average of 133 dollars per month.
Food aid costs in the United States increased to $80 billion a year due to the growth of unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14 per cent of the Americans rely on free food aid issued on "foodstomps" with such a name from previous times when they had a form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicans in the Congress require further reducing the funds allocated to the programme, claiming that it should be aimed at helping those who need more than others.
Food stores owners across America are concerned that reducing consumer costs will reduce.
The United States Congressmen continue to dispute about how much more funding the Government can be reduced.
Blizzard freely released a 19-year-old platformer
The Study of Blizzard released free to PC its platformer in 1994 Blackthorne.
This is what WoW Insider reports.
According to his data, the game was available at Battle.net in the classic game section of Blizzard.
However, some gamers note that only those users whose accounts are related to the US service are currently able to download it.
The game is not available for Russian users.
According to the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC is not different from the original version of the game.
The Blackthorne saundréc also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne Platform, which Blizard released 19 years ago, originally entered the SNES console.
His events were deployed on the Tuul planet, whose residents were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
One day, the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the light King Vlaros and become a single ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was saved from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to combat Sarlac’s associates and protect the inhabitants of the planet.
The original Blackthorne was the first game that the studio released after its rename in Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, it was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne was an Interplay company.
In the Moscow Metro, new machines will appear.
But they're not gonna sell tickets to passengers, they're not for money, they're going to seat.
One trip worth 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger in 30 seats.
The number of seats will calculate the special device through modern technologies, reports ITAR-TASS with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first equipment will be set at the Exhibition station on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of new tickets, the President of the Olympic Committee of Russia, Alexander Žukov, and the Olympic Champions of Alexei Nemov and Elena Zamladikova will be adopted.
The recognition of the National Security Agency strengthens the paranoid of corporations on public observation
A warm day at the end of August the German police helicopter flew low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, German financial capital.
According to the instruction of the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the Internal Intelligence Service of Germany, it was a task to photograph the roof of the United States Mission building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
The German media say that BfV was hoping to find antennas of listening devices, and these actions led to negotiations between the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Germany in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of the National Intelligence of the United States, reassured in September that the United States did not use external intelligence “to abduct commercial secrets of foreign companies in the interests of American companies to improve their international competitiveness or to increase their profits”.
But since Edward Snowden, a contractual employee who became a disclosure, began to publish his treasure of the U.S. Intelligence secrets, European governments and companies are no longer sure whether to trust the director.
Reports that the US National Security Agency had been watching the Brazilian Petrobras oil company and had access to data stored from United States cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, raised a paranoid of corporations caused by the State's observer to new heights.
The latest drops were reported that Angela Merkel had been listening for about ten years.
If the most influential person of Europe can be a target, of course, potential targets are also business leaders.
Snowden made obvious intense cooperation between United States Intelligence Services and Company.
I think it's quite likely that these data are used with mutual benefits.
“Germany must wake up”, said Oliver Grün, President of the BITMI Jointship, representing the small and medium-sized IT company of Germany.
The German companies are convinced that the United States is now almost the same risk as China in the field of industrial spying and data kidnapping, according to the study published by the EY advisory agency published in July.
In all documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, there were still no evidence that the United States had transmitted commercial secrets of foreign companies to their own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain information technologies and the Internet, and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says we must create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“It is not an option”, said Gusso Plattner, president of the German software company for SAP business.
If there was a need for a powerful European IT industry, it was not worth letting it die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidised in Germany, from car to cars and farmers.
All except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the scope and technological development of United States spying agencies known as Snowden's discoveries have been shocked for some companies who had previously thought that the largest risk of monitoring was China.
The large movements occur in cloud technologies where European companies have better realized that data stored in the United States are in the same jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to the Trade Association of Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants have refused to use the services of a cloud provider in the United States after the discovery of the American programme for intellectual analysis of Prism data.
Jim Snabe, an executive director of SAP, said: "We see consumers ask a new question that had not been raised a year ago, namely: where my data are stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction."
Many German leaders argue that the latest communications are just a confirmation of what they already knew: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data should be protected at any price.
What happens to economic spying is not surprised.
He always had a place.
“It was a matter of discussion for many years and has not significantly changed in the current debate,” said Kurt Bock, chief executive director of the BASF Chemical Company.
The Americans are spying on us at a commercial and industrial level, and we are also spying on them, because this involves our national interests, to protect our commercial businesses.
The leaders of corporates usually do not like to praise for the response measures they have taken, as this may give the advantage of the opponent.
The major companies have long been aware that taking a free flash on the exhibition, or leaving the laptop without care in the hotel room, is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of the Audi Automotive Company, said that it has been a standard practice for years to gather mobile phones before the government meetings so that they could not be used as a surveillance device.
The Federal Constitutional Service recommends that firm managers consider the possibility of using simple mobile phones during foreign travels due to smartphone vulnerability.
Mobile phones are subsequently thrown out.
However, there are concerns that small and medium companies remain vulnerable to invasion and observation.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders of the world market in their specific lowness.
“The small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access”, warns BfV.
The United States has warned their own companies about economic spying from other countries.
The National Intelligence Intelligence in February placed France together with Russia and Israel in a second series of violents who are hacking for economic intelligence, after China, confirmed the Washington Post.
The member of the Prestigious German Company Board confirmed that, when it comes to economic spying, “Francuses are the best of all”.
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency of DCRI, reportedly said in this month ' s interview: " Services know well that all countries, even when they cooperate in counter-terrorism, are spying on their allies."
Adolescents in Georgia, who died in a “uncomfortable coincidence ” believe that their son was killed
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, whose body was found inside a twisted sports mat in his high school's sports hall, believe their son was killed, said a family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the city of Waldosta of the state of Georgia, was found in the vertically standing mate in the back of the tribunes in his high school sports.
Investigators of the Sheriff of the Loundes County concluded that Johnson died on a tragic accident, but the family of a 17-year-old teenager disputes that.
“They are absolutely confident that their son was killed,” said FoxNews.com Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacques Johnson.
They never believed he was dead as sheriff says.
“They believe that this is contrary to logic, physics laws and healthy sense”, said Kramp.
They think it is a cover for the protection of man or people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was brought back to their body bag," he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation of Johnson's death, noting that several key issues remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at the press conference on Thursday.
I'll study all the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to learn the truth.
"I follow the opinion that there are sufficient reasons for an official investigation," he said.
Moore told the reporters that the initial autopsy showed that Johnson died as a result of the “pozitional asficiency”.
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, indicated another cause of death.
“There are several questions to be resolved or clarified”, he said.
Moore added that if he discovered enough evidence to demand a criminal or civil investigation of Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to carry it out.
The representative of the Office of the Sheriff of the Loundes district was not available to comment when he was contacted on Thursday.
Judge of South Georgia told the authorities on Wednesday to publish all the videos of the surveillance cameras reviewed by investigators.
Adolescent parents said that they hoped that videos had a key to finding how he died.
Spartacus: For information on persons who hang the fascist symbol
The Moscow Club's official website had a statement on the tribunal in Yaroslava of the Fashist Flag.
"Shainnik"'s cup match, "Spartak" on 30 October, unknown provocators at the Yaroslave stadium showed a fascist symbol.
Refer to all who have reliable information on those who have committed this criminal offence, with a request to provide it
"The remuneration is guaranteed," the statement states.
We're looking for fans weighing the fashist flag in Yaroslava
Recall that in the 1/16 final of the Russian Shank Cube, Spartacus had been interrupted several times because of the tribunal disorder.
Furthermore, a fascist symbol has been demonstrated in the Spartacus Fascist.
In a punishment, Spartacus can take about three matches without a watcher.
The meeting of the Committee will be held on Friday.
If you have any information about the one who has brought and hanged this symbol, please contact us.
Disabilities control and prevention centres issued recommendations for schools relating to allergy to children
Wednesday, the control and prevention centres published a list of food allergy recommendations in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations made by the Government of the United States, while the number of children of school age suffering from food allergy is growing.
Now one of the 20 children in the United States has food allergy.
Disease control and prevention centres found that food allergy has increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The Guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of the teachers and the child ' s food allergy staff and how to assist in allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools maintain adrenaline stocks, mostly for injections, the automatic EpiPen medical syringes, to assist in potentially deadly anaphilaxia.
The legislative authorities of the States have recently amended the Regulation to allow schools to make adrenaline stocks with smaller difficulties.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children with allergic reactions.
Children can say, "It feels like something's in my tongue, it feels like I have hair in my tongue" or "tongue stipple".
Inter-sexual parents can choose “indetermined sex”
Germany has become the first European country that recognized the third sex of children born with foreign sexual organs of the intermediate type.
The newborn will no longer have to assign male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to call for any sex of such children, allowing parents to indicate the sex as “indetermined” or “indetermined” in their birth certificates.
The aim of the law was to remove the pressure from the parents who could have a hurry decision on gender-born gender-based gender operations and to counter discrimination against inter-sexual people.
A intersexual person, according to BBC, said many years later: “I am not a man or not a woman.”
I'm going to be the doctor's screw-up with blues and scars.
Approximately one of the two thousand children born annually is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of approximately 60 pathological states that are diagnosed by “female disturbance” — a collective term for people with atipic chromosoms, gonades (eggs or seeds) or unusually developed outdoors.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
Gender identification is still insufficient, but most experts in the United States say that, if the gender cannot be defined, it is better to use all the information available and accompany it than to wait and monitor the child’s psychological and physical development before the operation, if any.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drisher, who is specialized for gender identification, said that the new German law would "sound like a good idea".
Intersexual children create ethical dilemma.
“Some people have violent violations that require operational intervention, but most of them are not involved” he said.
You can adopt the floor without surgery and then see how the identity develops.
The science of the child’s gender identities is not too accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people are homosexual.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes inter-sexual people as different from trans-gender or transgender because their condition does not relate to gender but to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to male or female, but typically to both of them or to either of them.
These characteristics may be displayed in secondary gender signs such as muscle mass, hair dissemination, breast and body; primary gender signs such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in chromosom and hormones.
The report also presents a general perception of discrimination faced by inter-sexual and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of anxiety, cruelty and prejudice crime.
The boys with gender deviations now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to put male, female or third sex in their official documents.
In June, the 52-year-old inhabitant of Australia, Norrie May-Walby, became the first person in the world recognized as a “unpoled”, standing in court to preserve “indetermined” sexual status for the rest of his life.
According to the Ministry of Interior, the German passports will use the third label in addition to M and F to X, which is intersexual.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still conflicting, according to the news issue in France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislation from France, this strongly expressed Catholic country, signed a petition on the exemption of the “gender theory” from school books.
The American Catholic Online website also expressed disagreement with the German law, noting that “in the situation where the world is involved in a new state where sex is subject to choice and sexual activity is no, we turn two other stages of civilization.”
A mother of a newborn child from Maryland also informed Baby Zone's Baby Zone website that she would prefer children to have sex at birth.
“To grow a child is hard enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child,” she said to the parents' website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historic children born with male and female gender organs were called hermaphrodites, named by a beautiful Greek god, who had signs of both genders.
And only ten years ago, the medical community considered gender as a leaf that could be deleted and then drawn again.
But now many challenge the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and sometimes the doctors make a wrong choice, without knowing how the child will take the gender when he grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called an urgent psychiatric case”, said Drisher.
When such children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist; you called the surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate genitals was suggested by Dr. John Manny from the University of Jones Hopkins, who felt that gender was easy to change.
He introduced the term “gender identity” and argued that environmental signals, including social, were the way parents grow up the child, were interacting with child genes and hormones, determining whether a person would consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case of 1966, known as John/John, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged during the unnecessary circumcision, to cast the child completely, to remove his balls, and to raise it as a girl.
"Mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but it was not," said Drisher.
When a boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Drisher said that some doctors are still “applying this model.”
But in the 1990s, when the Internet came, the people who survived these gender change operations declared themselves "inconscious of the result".
This was the case of Jim Bruce, 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosoms but genitals of the intermediate type.
The doctors were unable to determine whether he had a large clitor or a small penis and were convinced that he would never be able to live a man's "full life".
Soon after his birth in 1976, the external sex organ and Bruce’s egg were surgeryally removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He began to give female hormones when he was 12 years old.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said, ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At 18, he was assigned to vaginoplastic.
But when he was depressed and realized that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he knew was horrible.
I was sterilized when I was born, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with sexual infringement, which did not allow his body to produce sufficient testosterone for normal genital development.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, getting the testosterone injections and removed his breast.
The operation made him inferior.
Today, he is defending others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to normalize perception of people with intersexuality.
However, Anne Temar-Mattis, executive director of the California Legal Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law “inscents to haunt marks and stigme”.
“A number of activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a rush decision and give the child an uncertain sex”, she said.
We are afraid that he will contribute to intervention.
We believe that it is better to have a male or female sex, and then to wait.
But we haven't seen this law manifest, so all we can do is build speculations.
Temar Matthis said that her organization supports the Australian law, as “he allows adults to make choices for the third sex”.
“The adults should be able to make their own decisions on formal sex”, she said.
The German law implies its adoption at birth.
This is a battle in which small children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to decide on their own body.
But Dr. Arlin Barrac, mammolog-rentgenologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with sexual infringement and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law would “support” both parents and children.
The daughter of Barrac, Katie, was born with male chromosoms, but she has a sexual disorder called “insensitive syndrome to androgens”.
As her andandrogen receptors are not working properly, Kathy has developed female signs.
She's got a vagina, but there's no mattress or eggs.
Now, at 29 years of age, Katie is married and conducts a child psychiatric office at Pennsylvania University.
Despite her immorality, she hopes to become a parent by adopting or gestational surogative motherhood.
“The law gives parents time to avoid rushing decisions themselves," said Baratz.
It gives them time to make some analysis and to figure out the situation, as well as the period of time before they write "man" or "woman".
In that case, you are fine — growing a child, loving a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't need to do a surgery that's not converted.
“It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates anxiety that moves their parents because they do not feel right," she said.
In the end, the child will decide with which he or she are more comfortable, and that is great.
This allows children to make a decision on their own.
Nicolai Habibulin's gateman emphasized that he realizes he should play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard on training.
In the last two meetings, Habibulin first missed six shabes from Tampa Bay, and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game, he was replaced after the fourth missed shabe.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I didn't make it -- the words of Habibulin CSNChicago.
- I need to find confidence in training, I probably need to approach them as a game, and try to make better results.
You must study your past games and work on the shortcomings you have been.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in the training, I feel pretty good.
But somehow after a few heads, everything turns into some snow comma.
Maybe I need to relax.
The doormen, I don't think I'm alone, always try to play a perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not excited.
No matter what's going on in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself so that I don't miss so much.
Well, it's great that my clubs support, but it's basically simple: I have to play better.
Two games are not the whole season, but I wanted to spend them much better.
But it happened.
I have to put it away.
I'm just gonna try to play the next match better.

Medvedev expects the SSJ-100 aircraft to be placed in Europe
Russia expects that after the markets of Latin America and Asia, superjet 100 aircraft will be placed in Europe.
"We hope that, as a whole, we will receive more than 170 instances of aircraft like this," the Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev, said to them at the press conference with the Prime Minister of France Jean-Mark Airo.
The head of the Russian Government noted that serious cooperation was made with French colleagues because it was a joint project.
We have discussed today some financial issues related to insurance, but we hope that after this plane is strengthened in Latin America and Asia and the Pacific markets, it will also be placed to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he will be placed in France once," stressed the Russian Prime Minister.
SSJ-100 is a plane built by the Civil Airplanes of Suhogo in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
Liner is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high quality standards and comfort in a segment of 100 passenger places.
Energy of the Dneuproperty started a unique rescue programme...
In ancient times, the settlers in the high pillar were setting a wheel from the car, and the heavy nest was well held on it.
Such special resistance has not been placed for a long time, so the arists loved the branch lines of electrical transmissions - the branches are based on the wire, and the arist house is reliable.
Grandma Ania, who has been living in the village of Ivanovka Petrikov for 20 years, began to observe the nest sitting down despite all the efforts of its residents.
The birds put the new branches above, and the lower layer has already passed between the tubes, and it's just going to fall.
Of course, a sad family of ayists, who were sitting at the yard every year, had taken and feeded three or four birds in the summer, but would not want to stay without light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm edges, Ania’s grandmother called the Crown RES, which belongs to the resistance.
And I didn't even expect them to react so quickly.
When our experts arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding up, said the Technical Director of DTEK "Dneproproblenerge" Sergei Berezovski.
In fact, the corrosion began within the 150 - 200 - pounded nest.
At any time, birds could have died from electrical level.
The locals also risked to stay out of light because of the injury.
Therefore, linear monters started an operation to save the nest, not for the first time in our practice.
Scientists and ornitologists from the National University of Dnepropetrov have helped to develop a nest transfer scheme.
They were trained for circuit network staff.
The famous ornitologist Alexander Ponomarenko consulted energy at all stages of reconstruction of nests.
For the beginning, it was estimated that there were more than 50 auxiliary apartments in the area of emergency.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms were prepared, resembled.
The foundation was plunged with the branches, and then the old nest was transferred there.
The experts believe that the old branches are enough to be founded as a basis for birds to know the nest and return to it.
Afterwards, the aisters will build their own places.
A month ago, the first nest was renovated in the village of Sandchanka of the Novomoskov district.
In addition to the electricity, the new railroad pillar was set up and placed on it a platform with an old, already ripped nest.
The entire operation cost energy in nine thousand bracelets.
In the day, the same settlement was held in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovski district at the backyard of Annie's grandmother.
The platform was found in the former place, just raised over the tubes.
Ornitologists are confident that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice that their "apartment" was capitalized.
Until the end of the year, the same reconstruction is expected by four more nests in the Pokrovski and the Carican regions of the Daily Property.
By the way, while some are saving rare birds, others kill them unfortunately.
At the day, the whole area of the sad news -- in the village of the Ust-Camenk of the apostleic region, on the day of the opening of the fazana hunt, the bandiers fired the swan family in the local beach.
Pleasant birds were not afraid of people, the local inhabitants feeding them or insulting them.
When the villagers heard the shots and ran to the pond, four beauty swans were already lying on the water.
At this point, the officers of the Milition Division of the apostles find out who shot the birds taken into the Red Book.
Russian march becomes more popular
On 4 November, on the Day of People's Unity, in Moscow will be agreed with the Mayor of the Russian Marsh.
According to the Levada Centre survey, the support of the Russian Marshals is growing -- 40 per cent of the citizens are in different degrees approving the idea of their conduct.
According to Levada Centre, 40 per cent of the citizens are differently endorsed by the Russian marches: 11 per cent of these shares are definitely positive and 29 per cent are “faster positive”.
The popularity of the Russian marches is gradually increasing -- only 14 per cent of the Russians welcomed in 2006, and in December 2010, the implementation of such activities had already supported twice the number of citizens (28 per cent).
"Decisively negative" to "Russian marches" are only 7 per cent of Russians, "faster negative" - 19 per cent.
Another 35 per cent have failed to formulate their attitude to the share.
This year, the Mayor of Moscow agreed to hold the Russian Marsh by up to 15,000 people in Lublino, today the head of the Department of Security of the capital of Alexei Mayor.
This share of nationalists takes place every year on the Day of People's Unity since 2005.
On the question of the sociologists, did you hear that the Russian marches were held in Russia on 4 November under the Russian rights logs? Three quarters (75%) have responded negatively.
Only every fifth Russian (20 per cent) knows about this share now.
It is noted that nearly a third of the citizens (31 per cent) were heard on the Russian marches in December 2010.
Recall that three years ago, on 11 December, the Manage Square held a natural myth of nationalists, which became a mass disorder.
The Levada Centre also asked the Russians about the celebration of 4 November.
In two years, the number of people who know the right answer (National Unity Day) has increased from 41 per cent to 49 per cent.
However, only 15 per cent of the citizens are gathered to celebrate this celebration.
Approximately the same (17 per cent) intends to celebrate the Day of October Revolution on 7 November.
Most citizens (62 per cent) will not celebrate any of these celebrations.
As the Mayor of Moscow agreed to the Russian Marsh in Lublino
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to hold the Russian march on 4 November in Lublino.
The leader of the Unitedation of the Russians, the organizer of the march, Dmitri Demuskin.
In addition to the Sixth in Lublino on the Day of People's Unity, the Colorat Group ' s rock concert will also be held in line with the authorities.
As the Russian march-2012 passed.
On the Day of People's Unity in 2012, the nationalists passed a sixth of the Hawaii coastal to the Central House of Artist, where there was a myth.
The organizers evaluated the number of participants in 20,000, and the IMD referred to as a figure of 6,000.
Communication: Obama's pre-electoral headquarters considered the exemption of Bayden for Hillary Clinton
According to the New York Times, the nearest advisers of President Barack Obama were in secret to consider the possibility of substituting Vice-President Joe Bayden as a candidate of Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election list.
This opening is the brightest sensation of all the anticipated books of Mark Galperin and John Halemann on the 2012 campaign "Double Stacks: Game has changed 2012."
The Times received a copy prepared for the exit of the book and reported on Thursday night that the nearest president's assistants conducted “maximum research in focus groups and public opinion surveys at the end of 2011” to assess whether the exemption of Bayden could help raise out the hopes for the reelection of Obama.
According to the political observer The Times Jonathan Martin, the book gives detailed description of the attempts of highly elected officials of the Bureau and the White House, namely, the former Chief of the White House of Bill Daily, to assess the impact of the vote of the former Secretary-General Clinton as Vice-President.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully protected headquarters in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only six of the nearest president's advisors, including Daily, the former head of the Bureau of Obama Messin and former senior advisers of the White House of David Axelrod and David Pluff, knew that the replacement was considered.
The " Staffs are doubled" claims that Daily was an initiator of the attempt to replace Bayden, despite their "near personal relations", but eventually rejected the step when their data showed that the Clinton's addendum to the list of choices would not "maintain the chances of Obama".
In an interview with Martin Daily confirmed that the administration was really considering the possibility of replacement of Bayden Clinton.
"I have been active for considering a number of things, and it was one of them," Daily said to the newspaper.
You should remember that the president was in a terrible shape at that time, so we thought, "Oh, my God, what do we do?"
Although Dailey described the study as “necessary verification”, Martin told the representative of CNN Anderson Cooper that the pre-electoral headquarters had invested enough in examining whether this dividend would bring a vote.
“Optional headquarters do not spend such money on surveys and focus groups unless they consider anything seriously”, said Martin in AC 360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team had studied the possibility of replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daily if his executive then knew about the possibility of handling.
Although Dailey also said that he did not think that the president was “knowing” of the possible replacement, the former head of the administration recognized that “possibly” did.
Martin added that “Double Staffs” did not give a clear answer to whether the results of the political sensation had come to the Obama table.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously believed that Obama did not know about the examination of the possibility of excluding Bayden from the election list.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
Do you want a lighting in the darkness of ice cream?
The British entrepreneur created the first ice cream in the world in the dark.
Charlie Francis used fluorescent properties of the seafish to develop light food.
He came to this idea by reading the scientific article on meduses, and convinced scientists in China to chemically reconstruct the light protein.
The ice cream reacts with the language of the one who eats it, increasing the pH level in the protein and making it light.
Chris says that since the ice cream starts to shine when it reacts to the warm mouth, that means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company, I'm delicious, says: "It's an amazing thing, but it's still at the starting stage, if you talk about production, so you'll get about 2 g for $200."
The protein that we use in ice cream is responding with your language with the neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, it increases the pH level and the ice cream starts to shine.
We tested it over the past few months, and it seemed perfect to present it to Halloween, because it creates such a wonderful lighting effect.
This may be the most expensive ice cream I've ever done because the luminescence of meduse is four times more expensive than gold.
So every ball is worth about 140 pounds.
But it's pretty nice.
Charlie's experimental company in Bristol is famous with its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and taste of dry gold.
But his next creation should be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is definitely impossible because of the fracture of ice crystals, which consists of ice crystals, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent qualities of the medus synthesed by Chinese scientists
Avangarda Coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking of the preparation of his team for the regular KHL championship against Salavat, noted that Omichi had conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat from the Magnitogorian Metallurg.
The specialist emphasized that the Awangard needs to pay increased attention to the defence game.
We were watching a video game against the Magnitogoran Metallurg, -- the official Avangard Web site of the words of Chebaturkin.
- They missed a lot of shaibs, not a very pleasant moment.
They were missed because of their mistakes, because of the non-compliance of the game mission.
We knew the competitor had the executors.
The statistics tell us they had five attacks from the course, three shaives we got killed.
It's very good.
These errors were taken into account in preparing for today's game?
The boys and I understand each match carefully, we talk after the game, we prepare for a new rival.
The main thing is the installation to be carried out.
Everyone saw the first time of the Mettallurg match.
The game mission was performed, and the account was 2:0.
They missed the goal in the dressing room and began to be wrong in the third period.
Given how hard the game was composed, I had no sense in the connection of defenders.
We need a whole team to defend.
Now Awangard has a long home series, the matches go in a day, the team gets tired?
All teams are in the same conditions.
The main thing now is the implementation of its moments and the performance of the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you do the installation, it's not so difficult.
Because of the new rules introduced by the Russian Customs, nearly a week on the border with Russia, there are hundreds of foils in order.
Today, the donetical officials promised to provide drinking water drivers and to establish biotoaletes
There were hundreds of flours in the borders at the entry into Russia.
This situation has occurred because of the modification of the customs rules of the goods.
Ukrainian borderers and customers confirm that the Russian party is in line, which has not warned the innovation earlier.
Since 28 October, the Russian authorities have taken additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods,” said Deputy Head of East Customs, Vladimir Denisov.
The new sample document is applied in countries that have joined the Convention on International Transport.
The passport items are working in a stronger mode.
The FACTOV correspondent was on the border and contacted with remote players who were hostages of the situation.
The prices in the Coffee Travel Store at the Novoazsk missile point are growing every day as well as the queue.
The trucks stand in several rows, stretching about two miles.
The Tavied Novoazovsk Terminal - Wesselo-Vassesca provides one of the most important transport routes from the south of Ukraine on the international road.
This is where the goods are sent to the Stavropol Land of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday until midnight, the rules have been launched and then introduced -- the remoteman Alexei Glavanov (on photo) complained that the tranzit was transported through Russia's goods from Turkey to Kazakhstan and was staying in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and commodity insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the goods and the distance to which it is transported.
Minimum insurance - 4.5 to 5 thousand rubles (about 1100 to 1300 groceries).
Some 15,000 rubles (3800 groceries) are paid and traveled by those traveling nearly (for Georgia, Armenia) with a load of up to $50,000.
And the others are stuck, because no one has that much money with them!
You imagine if the driver carries only four thousand dollars, but until Moscow, he needs 90,000 rubbers (because 23,000 groceries) to pay for transit!
Conditions for survival on the border - none - are set by remote players eating next to their cars.
In border shops and cafeteria, it's always expensive, but the prices like this, we've never met anywhere!
Sellers coordinated and quickly mounted them: 15 bracelets are worth a baton, seven cup of coffee, 25 groceries of soup.
A café is one.
There's no toilet.
We're sleeping in the steps, we're going to the bathroom.
Or wash, or shave...
I can't get out of my car for a week, my wife made it all up on my way.
A week of time, another remote player Victor Scottarenko is comforting himself.
Will my car just come up for a week?
Why do you have one and a half litre of water?
There's 11 and 15 bracelets.
What, the bottle of crustace or the water insist on silver?
We have coffee, not a store.
Take while there's something else, a seller's pair.
After the situation began to be highlighted in the media, Ukrainian drivers had drawn attention to the authorities of the region.
The leadership of the Ambrosia and Novo-Azaw Ragosadinestrations received an assignment to ensure that all those who lift in turn to the Ukrainian-Russian Border, drinking water, are responsible for the Chairman of the Donetsk Obgosandministership of Sergei Dergunov.
Emergency troops are now in the missiles.
The biotowers will also be installed for human comfort.
The official said that the problem with the lines will be resolved in the coming days.
According to the Press Service of the Donetsk Obgosandry, as at 31 October, the Uspinka and Novoazovsk passed on 32 and 68 cars accordingly.
FACTS will monitor the development of the situation.
Willnus suspected Moscow in trying to disrespect the Lithuanian President
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-level persons of Lithuania and Eastern Partnership, such a statement to the BNS was made in the Department of State Security (GBB).
Information is published on the DELF portal.
According to the report, Moscow, in particular, will " speak" to the President of Lithuania, Dahl Gribaushkate and publish the falsified documents found in the Russian Gosarhiva, which are likely to relate to the facts of the Lithuanian leader's biography.
According to the Special Service, the Department of Public Administration of the President of Russia on Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries is analysed by the Department of Public Administration.
The structure is headed by the Eugeneum Umerenkov visiting Lithuania and participating in the Lithuanian People ' s Party meeting.
The Officer of the Department of W. Smirnov also seemed to be a participant in the operation.
According to the Special Service, Smirnov, under coverage of scientific work by the end of 2012, regularly arrived in Lithuania and contacted local policies, politicians and media representatives.
Smirnova is now prohibited from entering the territory of the country.
The President of Lithuania, Lithuania, said that she knew about the information that was prepared on it.
In her view, the main reason is the successful chairmanship of Lithuania in the Council of the European Union and the " strike of the country to energy independence "
The Lithuanian leader had not criticised the actions of the Russian authorities before.
So she claimed that the Kreml to Lithuania was "insufficiently respectful".
Furthermore, the Guide of the RF, Vladimir Putin, was accused of moving to Lithuania “only requirements”.
Recall, in September, Rossenger suspended the import of Lithuanian milk into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of production was not in conformity with the sanitation and epidemiological standards.
The leader of Lithuania then stated that if Russia did not remove the ban, the Government of the country should prepare the WTO treatment.
In the United States, the school director shot adolescents.
The director of one of the American high schools, the teenagers literally desperated.
The man said he had to take his weapons and start shooting.
The incident happened in Tennessee.
As New York Post says, juvenile huligans were throwing the house of a man with a toilet paper.
This led to the opening of adolescent shooting, which resulted in a few injuries in the leg and hand of a 15-year-old boy.
Since the huligans were not in the territory of the director's property, he was accused of attacks under difficult circumstances.
A man was released from jail in $125,000.
Note, the shooting of peaceful inhabitants in the United States becomes a terrible model.
A man literally opened a shooting in the center of Ridgecrest in the U.S. state of California right in the streets.
After that, the criminal took two random passages in hostages, hid them in the car's trunk and tried to hide.
Previously at Newtown's initial school, Connecticut, was fired.
Adam’s mother worked at school, she was a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat cupcakes, not to bed and make a maskard for our area.
Now I'm more like a crush.
I haven't been calling for the last two years to distribute cupcakes in my apartment, and I probably won't be in this year.
However, statistics show that I'm a white crow about Halloween.
According to the National Federation of Dispute Trade, most Americans, namely 158 million, will celebrate Halloween this year and will spend $6.9 billion per cupcakes, suits and decorations.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is trends.
The National Federation of Dispute Trade predicts that the costumes will be $1.2 billion out of $6.9 billion.
This year, in the fashion, sexually unhappy objects.
Women are no longer required to be representatives of sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
With regard to men, I think we'll see a lot of zombies thanks to the Walking Dead, and I'm sure that astronauts in Daft Punk will fall into our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the costumes that seek most of all are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
There may be nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We had our dogs dressed last year, and, to my surprise, we were not the only ones.
Furthermore, according to the National Federation of Difference Trade, the Americans will spend $330 million this year for household suits.
That means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to cupcakes, we don't get tiny.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to Nelsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of hershey chocolates, ice creams, milk duds cupcakes, Twizzlers and Clark Bar candy.
According to the U.S. Ministry of Trade, this is a great news for 41 million children's demanding cupcakes that are prepared to conquer our areas.
Furthermore, we'll buy and -- we're not gonna cheat on ourselves -- we'll eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is cupcakes in the form of corn seeds; however, according to the National Association of Condiers, almost 35 million pounds are sold under Halloween.
It's about 9 billion of separate corn grains.
That's a mystery I've got to figure out.
None of the facts of Halloween as a house with ghosts.
They have remarkable names, such as "Shock House" (which, by the way, is in the present prison), "Voy and cry" and "Home of Shock".
Furthermore, in America Haunts, there are 1200 officially recognised houses with ghosts generating about $500 million income, as well as those amazing photos where you were almost described, which your friend put on Facebook and you can't clean up, and then the guy you like sees this photograph and leaves a commentary like the "class expression of your face".
And in conclusion, we'll talk about ducks.
Charlie Brown introduced us to Big Tiquo when we were children, and the cutting of Jack's lamp is like a decoration of the Christmas tree, what we've been doing since we were children.
Fortunately for us, the fashion for the baby in the tickle started only last year through the Pinterest, so most of us grew up, cutting these puppies off, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. census Bureau, this year the Americans will spend about $106 million per tiquo.
Jack's lighter, slowly drying on your wing, probably arrived from the state of Illinois, who raised 542 million pounds of tickles this year.
If you want more complicated tasks, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in the city of Napa State of California and try to cut something out of their tickle at a weight of 2032 pounds.

The work of the Estonia Ministry of Defence has been restored after the morning cyber attack, reports the office's press service.

Our experts quickly set it up, so far the website's work is restored.
"The damage incurred to the Ministry is minimal," Petersop said to the posttimees issue.
According to Peterscope, it's early to talk about who organized attacks.
"We must analyze the causes of the incident and make our conclusions, but preventing such incidents is ultimately impossible," he admitted.
Naponim, on 1 November, the group of Anonymous Ukraine has placed a network of treatment in which confirmed the hacker attack on Estonia's Mino defense site and spoke against the partnership of Ukraine and NATO.
We want NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be NATO servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine does not need NATO block.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine doesn't need Russia either.

Some schools and hospitals had to be closed because of the brutal force
Four schools in the Zimbabwean province, South Matabelleland had to be closed because the students were attacked... goblins.
As the local elder said, children were panicing, and the continuation of classes was impossible.
The story of goblins may sound like a child for a European, but in Africa it is a very serious argument to close school.
Adults are also afraid of unclean power.
In summer, for example, in Zimbabwe, the hospital was closed because the medical personnel was also attacked by goblins.
It was announced that the Land Rover series was issued
There are race seats and six-point security belts, as well as internal communication system.
Furthermore, modernized brakes, a package of services that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and car storage between activities.

Some of them are not experienced racers, but people seeking concerns, adventures and access to world class activities.
We are pleased to offer this way in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try the various disciplines of the rallo in Britain and abroad, as well as to prepare participants to the difficult conditions and realities of the rali-rail.
We were very pleased to develop Defender Challenge's car -- it would be a really interesting championship.
Furthermore, Defender Challenge provides for one day in February for training and tests, as well as the opportunity to participate in activities in the desert in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian rapes are not aware of the grouping of the Brother Circle - New Notifications
INTERFAX.RU refers to an informed source in the law enforcement bodies of RF.
"After the media reported on the introduction of the U.S. Finance Ministry of Lepsa into the suspicion lists of the Euro-Brath Circle Criminal Syndication, we have examined all databases, but no grouping found," said the interviewer of the Agency.
He believed that the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of a mith of so-called Russian mafia, which appears to act abroad.
As previously stated, the United States Ministry of Finance published the list of the alleged members of the Crime Circle of the Brothers on its website yesterday.
Among them was also the Russian singer Gregory Leps.
He's in the list as "Grisha," they put it before.
They coincide with the popular Russian executor.
The precise name is Gregory Lepsevride, creative alias, place and date of birth.
Besides Leps, there are five more men mentioned.
Two Russians, Israeli citizen, Uzbekistan citizen and another member of the former SSSR, whose citizenship is not indicated.
The United States is convinced that Gregory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, transported money for the gangs on their orders.
This message applies the photograph of the singer and indicates all its data that corresponds to the reality.
Furthermore, Leps actually bought a house in Phuket recently.
The Office noted that they intended to initiate sanctions against Leps.
The introduction of a person into the black lists of American Minthin involves the blocking of its assets in the United States and the prohibition of business contacts with him in the United States.
Assistant Fines Maya Serikov said that no notifications were made to the singer, "It's difficult to answer the question of whether Gregory is being spoken now about the scandal in the United States."
All Leps knows is the media information.
There were no personal notifications to him, although I don't know if they were in such cases.
"And, of course, it's all, on the one hand, funny, and, on the other, surprisingly and unexpectedly," she said, RIA News.
She said that there was no living in Phuket Gregory Leps, but, according to the U.S. Minfin, he really has a home on the Thai Island.
She stated that Leps was now in a long tour on the Dale East and Siberia, and that the news had come to him during the flying to the city of Blagoštešsk.
Running on the field at the Shinnik game.
There are some details of the identity of a fan who fled on the field during the 1/16 final of the Russian Cube between the Yaroslav Shinec and the Moscow Spartacus.
As the head of the CDC RFS Arthur Gregorianz stated, referring to the IMD data, this master is a Moscow.
He's currently detained.
"In addition, Gregorians told me how the fan man had been able to break into the field: "It turns out that the person that we call him a viewer had passed to an emergency assistance in accompanying two viewers, referring to heart problems.
He came to an ambulance -- that's what the ambulance doctor confirmed.
And then he pushed two companions and ran to the field.
He ran from the corner of the East and South Tribune to the corner of the East and North Tribune.
He ran through all the fields.
That's what the stewards are responsible for.
Before the sports law is enforced, the Stuards' area cannot interfere with what is on the field.
He ran to the tribune, crossed the East Tribune.
And at that time, the disorders in the East Tribune and the runways began," said the CCC chapter.
Recall that the decision of the CDC of the Moscow Spartacus will take the 15th tour of the Russian Championship against the Locomotiva and Zenita, as well as the fine of 600,000 rubles.
Fire teams were called to save the lost puppy, which was stuck at a height of 50 feet above the ground on a dangerous career.
Coker-paniel Ruby fled after she got into a small DTP.
After three days of her career, a man who walked out the dog
The firefighters descended on the rope on the slope to save the dog from the unmindable death
The puppy was happy to be saved after the fire teams were called to raise it and deliver it to a safe place, after he was stuck at a height of 50 feet at a dangerous decline.
The nine-month coker-paniel Ruby fled after a car accident on Sunday, and spent three days alone before she was saved from a career to Wednesday.
Her master, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, were at Flappy's career in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunify with Ruby, and thanked the western Yorkshire fire satellite service.
They heavily looked for their missing dog and placed contacts on social network sites after she ran away from her career after a small accident.
About 14:15 a.m. a star dog noticed Ruby, a 50-four-four-four-four-four-seconded retirement.
The Technical Rescue Unit from the Clecthiton fire station has hurried to the scene of the incident, descended down on the ropes to save Ruby, and used the transmission to raise it up the hill.
Andy Clayton, rescue officer, said: “It was in a dangerous situation.”
It was right in the middle of the slope, 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move and muscle during the rescue, she was completely cold.
But now she's okay.
Then she ate biscuits.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was noticed is amazing.
Peter Lau, rescue officer, said: “Ruby was very lucky to be saved.”
It was likely that she could get a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian to the survey, and it was found to be fine, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Galifax, West Yorkshire, said: “It was terrible to watch rescue.”
I couldn't believe she was there at all.
It was amazing when she was in our hands again.
The veterinarian said that if she hung up and lost consciousness, she would probably fall down.
Firemen were great.
That was very courageous — what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson from Kitley added: “We feared that she could fall, but she remained there.”
Firemen were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't play with Katie Perry when she was 18.
During the interview at the Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was a beck-walker for Jagger's song in 2004 Old habits die hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a roker veteran, and she said, "He was playing with me when I was 18 years old."
She added: “It was a long time ago, and he was very good.”
In a statement on Thursday, the representative of the seventy-year-old Jagger said that the “categorically denied that he had ever been in favour of Katie Perry”.
The representative added: “It may be confusing him with someone else.”
Perry was among the executors who appeared as guests in the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted first this week.
George Kerevan: Breakdown with Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another independence scary.
This time, we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the general European free movement zone as a EU membership.
There are stories of passport controls in Berwick and the border with a thick-blow along the Adrian val.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper indicated possible economic benefits from more free movements across the rest of Europe, although, as foreseeable, it did not appear in the titles.
No one also pointed out that EU Member States were wasting a lot of time to turn their formal rules as they were comfortable.
Since Scotland is not now in the Schengen Zone, the continuation of non-compliance with the requirements will be a cheap decree for Brussels in exchange for what he really wanted from the Scots.
So that's not an interesting story.
And so old that it turned into stone: the first time I heard that "independence means passport control" at least 40 years ago.
However, there is an interesting moment that was lost when the old story was overwhelmed.
Why should independent Scotland even comply with European commands?
Why change London's yoke into Brussels's yoke, especially now?
Here are the present European news: the great after-war plan to join Europe has finally stopped.
With the European crisis, the European project is officially dead.
Parties all over the European Union who act against the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency are forced.
Even in Germany, the European Sceptics Party Alternate for Germany, based only this year, came from nowhere and received almost five million votes at September's federal elections, thus exhausting the Free Democrats (analog of our Liberal Democrats) from Bundestag.
There was always an internal opposition to the federal Europe plan.
However, the current economic crisis has become a breakthrough.
The strict savings measures introduced by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the chains imposed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency have led many people to think that the project “Europe” has gone too far.
The euro crisis was unrelated to the fact that national governments work in excessive budget deficiencies was just for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members at the exchange rates benefited from German exporters — that German policies are willing to preserve.
Without the possibility of devaluating the national currency, Southern Europe is in an outstanding production situation compared to Germany.
The only means of saving is to cut off wages and public costs, which is actively supported by Berlin.
The current budget and currency problems are a deeper problem of Europe's productivity.
As a result of the “Green” Energy Invested in Brussels, a code that means the subsidiary of French and German energy companies from consumers, the European industry pays twice as much as electricity and four times more gas than in the United States.
It's a paralyzing disadvantaged price conditions, as we've seen in Grangemut.
No freezing of salaries in the world will stop the destructive victory of US cheap sun gas over the European oil industry.
As a result, the rebellion, especially in France, is once the most irritating participants of the EU.
After war, the French political elite considered the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris at one level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and he has already imposed his own economic policy to Europe, leaving the destructive economy of France in a poor situation.
The result is the right counterparty Marin Le Pen ' s National Front ' has just won decisive additional elections, dropping the ruling party of socialists to the third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24 per cent of votes, the timely warning of British layborists that it cannot be assumed that the dissolution among the right will automatically be made for the left.
What does Le Pen do to its newly converted popularity among the French white working class?
She wished to use EU elections next year to establish a block in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If that is very likely, the parties against the EU will receive support at these elections, the branch will be able to take the dominant situation in the European Parliament for the first time.
This is my opinion: rapidly growing moods against the EU and against the single currency in Europe are sailed together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become a kind of "European (sover) nations" that liked General de Gollu.
Germany and several dependent economies can save the euro, but France and Southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I assume that Britain is distant from this project, hoping to draw closer to the United States.
Nevertheless, the increasing interest of Washington to the Pacific indicates the probability that Great Britain will remain out of attention in the Atlantic cold.
In what position does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (usually) of Small England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, besides, send Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed in a more free European agreement, provided we can keep our currency.
Cooperation with other single-country countries will be easier in the non-Federal Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway's experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Government of the Scotland National Party in Scotland is, unfortunately, the most successful political movement in Europe against the measures of severe economy, which have received an impressive majority of votes in 2011 by objection to the reductions of the costs proposed (and implemented) by the Leiborist penalty Chancellor by Alister Darling and the resulting coalition of the Torri and Liberal Democrats.
Scotland would now be ridiculous to vote for independence only in order to take the measures made by Berlin and Brussels.
Early sex maturity: ageing earlier
Afro-American and Latin American girls generally achieve sexual maturity before their white peers show research.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual maturity is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are guilty
Experts believe that the abdominal epidemic may be one of early sexual maturity mechanisms
The tendency to early sexual maturity is not so expressed in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Eteridge is a journalist specialized for child health and family issues.
Should the mother be frightened if her daughter starts to start breast iron and grow her head hair at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, the child endocrineologist, Dr. Paul Caplovitz, explained that these early physical changes were quite widespread to American girls and are a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time calming my parents -- that usually does not mean a rapid attack of full maturity," said Caplovitz.
The apparent signs of development, such as the growing breasts, the skull hair and the smell of the body, appear earlier in the girls.
However, there was only a small decrease in the age of the menarch (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years old and decreased compared to 12.75 in 1970.
“When the breast begins to grow, it is at least two or three years before the menarch”, said Caplovitz, also author of the book “Earliest sexual maturity in girls: how to deal with this common problem”.
Time is the most accurate check of how sexual maturity will progress.
There is a debate on the fact that gender maturity occurs, but it is considered “preliminary” when the increase in breasts is accompanied by a rapid increase of growth to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop — that the pediatrician can monitor carefully.
More rapid progress can be a basis for analysing the endocrinolog to exclude serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruations and prevent another consequence: preliminary age of bones, which may eventually slow down growth and low growth in mature age.
Recommendations on medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on child age, level of development, growth rates and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is cautious with medicines, but acknowledges that “the suppression of sexual maturity can mitigate the behaviour and feelings of girls that they are different from their classrooms. ”
Another big problem is that parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have menstruations.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or even how they can deal with hygiene”, said Caplovitz.
“It was a shock, ” recalls one woman whose daughter began the menstruation at 10 years.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was first among her friends.
There are many advertising theories on the reasons of early sexual maturity.
Nevertheless, there is no consistent evidence that the milk or other food hormones, chemicals in the environment or sexual media are guilty.
Boys, like girls, have early sexual maturity.
Caplovitz claims that the prerequisite, which has the highest weight, is an epidemic of fatty.
In 2001, it helped to conduct a study of girls between 6 and 9 years of age, which links the number of fat in the body to the period of sexual maturity.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other factors.
In this country, African and Latin American girls generally reach sexual maturity before their white peers.
There are various explanations.
The world's early sexual maturity appears to affect everything: from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Also a mystery: Although boys have hair on their face and skull appears in a younger age, the trend for full early sex maturity is not as much as girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
Even in babies and children of jassel ages, the appearance of thickness and skull hair is presented.
"We should be careful about how we define the genuine attack of maturity," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, child endocrineologist in the Horeeb child hospital in Morristaun, New Jersey.
Parents should not be ashamed to receive guidance from a pediatrician about how to talk to their child.
“This may mean more early than it was expected to be,” explained Caplovitz.
If you remain calm, your child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need to confirm that even when this happens before, this process is a normal part of life.
The U.S. Boeing stuck in Chita is preparing for an outlet.
In the Open Sky Treaty, the observative flights over the territory of Russia and the unplanned landing on Friday, 1 November, on 8:30, will leave the city's airport on Wednesday.
The airport leadership permitted a deployment by getting money for fuel.
As reported at the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan Woode.
Otherly, he will go to the United States.
The plane flying in Ulan Wood was reported to land in the Zabaikal Land because of the fog.
Because of unpaid accounts, he was not released from the Chita airport.
There are 30 people on the plane, including the crew, who spent two nights in the airport, reports ITAR TASS.
As reported in the MID RF, under the conditions of the Open Sky Treaty, people who are on the aircraft are not entitled to leave outside the Chita airport, they can only carry out border control in two Russian airports in Cubank and Ulan-Ude.
The Open Sky Treaty was signed in 1992, with 34 States involved.
Observative flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, the countries of Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to develop transparency, to facilitate the implementation of arms control agreements, to enhance the possibilities for the prevention of crisis and to address crisis situations within the framework of OSCE and other international organizations.
How many dead IC celebrity earnings in the United States of IC
The highest income rating of live celebrators in 2013 led Madonna, who earned $125 million.
However, the dead Michael Jackson, whose death income from October 2012 to October 2013 amounted to 160 million.
It is noted that the other famous ones who left the life of the celebrity, who have earned a few times less last year.
The second "constant" of the "forbes" celebrations in the "Forbes" magazine of the year was Elvis Presley 55 million per year, and the shortlist of the Peanuts Charles Schulz comic books below, with 37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, former leader (25 million) and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein were also included in the list.
The first bottle of Igora Gulayeva opened in Moscow
The first flag bottle of Igor Gulayev in Moscow was opened on 23 October.
Designer Igor Gullayev is known to the wide public with its wonderful articles from the mecha class of luxury.
And now they can be evaluated by more fancy fans -- in Moscow, his first bottle was finally opened, and the designer made a party like a dolce vita.
I'm sure the most beautiful girls live in Russia.
So I am particularly glad that I have a shop opened in Moscow.
It's not just a office, it's a place where there's really part of me.
That's what Igor said, cut off the red tape and invited all those who wanted to... take a look at the models!
Reactive aircraft manufacturers host the width of the seat when large orders are on the line
An overwhelmed dispute about the width of the tourist class seats in remote flights has been initiated among leading aircraft producers, setting a ton for a severe confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Exhibition this month.
The dispute turns around the width of the seats available on remote flights to passengers in the class-case, whose interests are not always in the centre of the attention of airlines, while the amount of the space for them plays a key role in allegations of the effectiveness of the recent airbus SAS and Boeing Co aircraft offered.
The Airbus called on this week to introduce a sectoral standard that would provide a width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the class-case salons, but its main American competitor Boeing said that this should be decided by airlines.
The argues are at the time when aircraft producers compete in the sales of increasingly larger versions of their two-way remote aircraft, and the event from 17 to 21 November is expected to have a potential record order.
The back of the plane, especially whether 9 or 10 are sitting in a series, is central in the statements on the economic efficiency of new mini-aerobus projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X would include 406 persons, based on the seats in the economic class more than 17 inches in a width of 10 in each row.
Airbus said that the competitive version of its A350 would transport 350 persons in the width of 18 inches per seat.
The giants of the aircraft are often exchanged with technical impacts by advertising in professional press.
The Airbus is now referring directly to the public in front of the Dubai Airbus show, where 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated the start of a new advertising war, showing to the financialists the slide that represents three people in a restaurant, pressed to each other, entitled “We would you agree on this?”
"Boeing offers farway flights in the seats more narrow than in regional turbine aircraft," said Airbus manager John Lihi.
With the change in nutrition, people are getting weight, but the seats of the aircraft have not changed dramaticly.
Between the early 1970s, when the broadcast Boeing 747 set standards for modern distant travels, the average American man aged 40 to 49 has increased by 10 per cent, according to the United States Department of Health.
The scope of the average American man in the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to the statistics of the United States Health Service.
The Airbus claims that its competitiveness has observed the concept of the 1950s, when the average scope of the talia of those recently referred to as “reactive public” has already been observed.
Airbus says it ordered a study that additional inch in the width of the seat improves the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing disputes Airbus' seat size numbers and says that producers should not interfere with the decisions of how airlines find balance between tariffs and comforts.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the salon depends not only on the width of the seat.
“All is in fact aimed at providing airlines for elections and possibilities to do what they think they should do to achieve”, said Kent Craver, specialist in Boeing's salons.
They don't want us to decide for them, what will make them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
The question for passengers is to increase the sidespace, but for suppliers this is increasingly a factor that can affect profits.
The racing behind this dispute is a race for planes estimated at least $700 billion on catalytic prices in the next decades is enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As the Reuters Agency first reported in July, the location of seats is exactly what warms competitiveness in the battle between the new reactive aircraft.
Boeing, both Airbus and Boeing, claim 20 per cent increases in profit for one place in their last two-way remote models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing characteristics are partially based on the 10-local lines of 777X with the original 9-local set of lines of constructive decision 777.
The victory of a single supplier is reduced compared to the 10-local composition currently used.
“The reason Boeing does this is to impress more places and make his plane more competitive than our developments," said Kevin Kenniston, head of the Airbus Comfort Division in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that the salons with a full 10-long line for the 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a thick displacement that can go hand-hand with lower tariffs.
"The seats at the width of eighteen inches would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, in commercial terms, the Airbus proposal was threatened by the 777th model," said Mary Kirby, the founder and Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing don't provide chairs, but they offer a directory of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-wide sellers of reactive aircraft are even carrying roulets with them to verify competitive planning.
Conveniently, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very thick salon for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 series, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for additional modifications of the salons, offering wider spaces in some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other producer of major modern aircraft, the experts say, her call for a new sectoral standard would hardly “risk” but may distract the wave of the model 777X.
A new antinikin vaccine may reduce the smoking of satisfaction
Scientists have developed an antinikin vaccine that could deprive the smoking process of enjoyment cigarettes.
One dose of vaccine has been able to protect the mouse from a nikotine dependency for life.
Further tests are needed before the start of human trials, which would take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the College of Health, Waille Cornell, New York, said that the first results were encouraging.
“We hoped that such a vaccine strategy could finally help millions of smokers who tried to quit by testing all the methods available on the market today, but found that their nikotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was developed to provide genetic information for the production of antinikine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
The antithels are tracked by any blood-neutralized nicotine molecules before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nikotine hit.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, which were subsequently given by nikotine, continued their normal activity.
The mice that did not give vaccine were “relaxed”, and that is the sign that Nikotin came to their brains, say researchers.
These experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine magazine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they had antibodies.
In order to maintain high levels of antibodies, injections had to be done so often that they were expensive and unpractical.
But the value of the new vaccine will probably be much lower, because it turns liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Cristal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they would have the desire to try a cigarette by preventing a nikotine addiction.
But it's more likely to be used by smokers to stop smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not be satisfied with this because of a nikotine vaccine, and that can help them get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that additional studies were needed.
Olejnikov: Third of the rural settlements of Podmoskovia
Deputy Governor of Podmoskova Jurij Olejnikov stated that nearly a third of the villages of the Moscow region were entirely subsidiary
Total funds from the regional budget are 187 settlements from 288.
In 2013, 187 villages from 288 received funds from the area budget.
A separate amount of grants in the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent subsidiary.
A total of 25 billion rubles are directed under the budgetary budget," said Olejnikov.
The Vice-Guverner also noted that only three urban settlements - Mitisk, Edincevo and Puskino - budget income amounts to more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, "that is not enough."
The costs of the local administrative equipment in 88 submoskova settlements are over 70 per cent, “a reduction in service quality”, stated Olejnik.
He had previously instructed the heads of municipalities of Podmoskov by the end of November to consider what settlements need to be consolidated, united in urban districts or to change the administrative system.
These proposals will be reproduced by the end of January.
Before that, the Governor of the Moscow area stated that in the framework of the administrative reform in Podmoskovje, it was planned to reduce the number of subsidiary rural settlements.
Also, there is a request for municipalization in Možaisk, Cashirski, Solarnyar, Colomenian regions, Luberzah and Kotelniks.
The discussion of this issue in the cities and regions will begin in November.
The President of Mossoldum, Igor Bryncalov, also stated that the upcoming administration plans around 30 rural settlements in 12 areas of Podmoskovia.
This is linked to the fact that less than three of the 178 rural settlements in Podmoskovje have a " acceptable" financial base and 100 subsidiary.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide the great pleasure of her children being raised.
Despite the fact that Arbenina has given particularly much time to creativity and public activities, she still finds the opportunity to hang out with Martha and Artem, not only wasting time for their training, but also enjoys the best she can.
In the last week, Diana reported twice to her worshippers about her educational talents.
First, she presented a photograph on Facebook that shows how she taught children to read.
And yesterday she had a fan, showed me how Artem and Marta dressed up at Halloween.
Our first halloween race is ready! - so called Diana the photo of her children dressed in holiday suits.
Which is unwise, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, have regarded this celebration as they were born in America.
Germany introduces “indetermined sex” in the registration of children in Europe
Germany will be the first country in Europe where children born hermaphrodites will be authorised in registration instead of male or female sex to indicate "indetermined".
The parents of the child will have the right to leave the count "pole" in the birth certificate incomplete.
Instead of "F" (woman sex) or "M" (man) parents may write "X" (indetermined).
This decision is aimed at not pushing parents to a hurry on gender acceleration operation.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborn in the world is born by hermaphrodite.
Tripodi denies the influence of the Obide
The former Minister of Labour in New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, will be a character of the investigation of the anti-corruption supervisory body of the state.
Former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, opposes the modification of the order of the sea rent, at the request of his political teacher, Eddie Obide, who has secretly owned the shares of three property facilities in the public land.
The Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) extended its investigation on Friday, whether Mr. Obyd had lobbyed the extension of the rental contracts for Sercular Ki, where the Obied family belonged to two restaurants and cafeteria, without the tender after the expiry of their term in August 2005.
She was now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi knew of the secret participation of Mr. Obide in real estate facilities, after the statements made by the former Deputy of the Administration of Mr. Tripodi Linn Ashpoul on Thursday.
During a few years of discussions in 2005, the Government insisted that rent be made available for an open competition.
The renters were against this, and they wanted longer rent.
In 2009, the rental contracts for Sercular Ki, which brought the Obejd family around $2.5 million a year, were extended without exhibition for an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister for infrastructure and transport from February 2006 to November 2009, originally spoke for open competitions.
However, he rejected that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obide, who, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, urged the Government ' s rental policy to change.
The ICAC decryption of telecommunications included discussions in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obide, Mr. Tripody and Steve Dunn, the senior official, who came to the Ministry of Ports after work under the leadership of Mr. Obide in the fishing department.
“Was the issue discussed during these telephone talks on the development of a commercial rent policy?” asked Mr. Tripodi, assistant Commissioner Anthony Willi.
"No," Mr. Tripodi replied. “
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not that.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obide.
According to the High Officer, Israeli military aircraft attacked targets within Syria
The High Administration Officer in the Fox News interview confirmed that Israeli military aircraft hit the target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night.
The official didn't tell me that it was a goal, but he said at least one.
Associated Press reports that the target was the Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least two times earlier this year, Israel had air crashes with rockets inside Syria.
Foreign vism workers of sub-class 457 can be tested for “trueness”
The “reliability test” for foreign wizmal workers of class 457 is being considered by the Government, as it envisages the expansion of repressive measures.
This test, in the event of its adoption, will be applied by criteria aimed at preventing the use of visas of class 457 to fill unqualified posts or as a chamber for family and friends to Australia.
The paper submitted by the Government was published today, while the former Laborist Deputy Maxin McKue criticised the government's rhetoric on foreign workers, saying that this could offend the neighbours of Australia.
The "Grome statements of "foreigners are at the end of the turn" and "free of work to the Australians" are a very unpleasant removal until the trade unions demanded a protected labour market," she said to the Institute of Australia - India today.
This historically meant that white work was needed to be protected — and if some in the region saw the sounds of this historical artefact, I would not be surprised.
The paper presented 12 measures that had previously been considered by the former Minister for Immigration, Chris Bowen.
The Minister for Immigration, Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka, where he met with officials on trafficking in people, has already made five of the recommended changes and the rest are under review.
If the criteria of authenticity are accepted, the applicant will be able to examine whether “a candidate is true in conditions where the candidate is a relative or closely familiar owner or the person involved in the financing of the undertaking”.
Business may also be required by the number of visa holders of sub-class 457, since companies who had before intended to sponsor a small number of workers were then taken to work hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankian, who was looking for asylum, died allegedly from a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The nine - year - old son of this man was accompanying him on his way to Australia, and since his father died on Wednesday, he was supported by a cousin who was also on the ship.
The Australian authorities urgently sent a man to a Christmas island hospital where he died.
A friend of Semen Warlamov stated that a hockeyist suffered from alcoholism
A hockeyist Semen Warlam Eugenius Vavrinuk said that he suffered from alcoholism, transmitted by the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," said, inter alia, a woman.
Recall that Vavrinuk was also a member of the Colorado Club.
She said that the hockeyist pulled her out of her hair and beat her arms, breasts, stomach and neck after her attack.
Warlamov himself came to Denver's police and confessed to beating, describeing what happened.
He was arrested, but he was later bailed at $5,000.
The court did not restrict the sportsman in the country's movements, but prohibited approaching Vavrinuk.
He was also threatened to be imprisoned by up to 6 years for domestic violence.
The Government of Great Britain announced a study aimed at improving the economic impact for Scotland from the project HS2.
Draft HS2 envisages the opening of a high-speed communication with Scotland and Northern England, beginning of the First phase in 2026
The Minister for Transport, Barones Kramer, noted that the project would “unite the United Kingdom”.
Scotland's Minister for Transport, Keith Brown, said he was “adorned” of the prospect of working on the plan with the Government of Great Britain.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When the Second Stage is completed, lines will be placed in Manchester and Lids.
In June, the Government revised the estimated value of high speed line building between London and Northern England from £32.7 to £42.6 billion.
The United Kingdom Government, which has negotiated with Transport Scotland, instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in the railway skills and the reduction of travel duration for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility to overcome the way from Glasgo and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baronessa Kramer said: “Our purpose for HS2 is to create a real national network that will bring Britain and its cities closer to each other.”
We're developing HS2 because the benefits she's bringing are huge.
Without it, we will face the crisis of skills in our rail network.
But it is also about the transport of cities to each other; 18 cities across Britain, including Glasgo and Edinburgh, will receive a better message by HS2.
The Scottish Secretary Alister Carmichael added: “The announcement today is a good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed railway has every chance to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland to a common argument for high-speed railway railway throughout Britain.”
We are therefore happy to work in partnership with the British Government to consider the construction of high-speed railway options in Scotland, the creation of benefits for all and the continuation of the Glazgo railway, Edinburgh, which the Scotland Government is already planning.
I look forward to considering the results of the research with the British ministers next year and the joint decision on the following steps.
Torius is a new hope for nuclear energy?
Governments in the world continue to think about how to ensure energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they are) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Nuclear energy is worth none but leaves a mass of cost-effective waste.
The scientists have recently drawn attention to the torium -- another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It meets around the world, and, as the experts say, it does not leave waste to be kept for centuries.
Rules of use of electronic aircraft in Australia so far remain in force
The travellers of Australian airlines will need to continue to disable their planchets and smartphones during the flight and landing, despite the measures in the United States to mitigate the rules on device data.
The United States Federal Aviation Management allowed US carriers to change their procedures in such a way that passengers could read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during the flight and landing provided they will remain in the Airline.
Passengers may already do this during the majority of the flight, but many are irritated that they have no access to their electronic books during the rising and landing.
Australian carriers consider that decision that requires US airlines to take a huge amount of work to meet new requirements, but indicated that they did not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
Civil Aviation Safety Office also noted that they were considering this statement, but stressed that the limitations to the use of electronic devices in critical fly phases were still in Australia.
“The Office of the Security of Civil Aviation flights is currently not having specific rules governing the use of electronic aircraft”, it stated.
This issue is regulated by rules that require air carriers to maintain security at any time, and from passengers to comply with the security rules reported to them by members of the crew.
The Virgin company, which has already discussed with the Office of the Security of Civil Aviation Flights to expand the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system, was not against the changes, but stated that it would follow the instructions of the regulator.
“We would welcome the consideration of the Security of Civil Aviation Air Force on the authorization of the use of electronic devices, because we really think that this would improve the quality of customers' services now when it is on our planes,” said the press Secretary.
Qantas stated that the rules would be adhered to.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during the flight and landing, and we are not planning to change it soon," she said.
The FAU regulation is extended to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly be carefully examining the decision of the FAU and the reasons that caused it.
For US carriers, the impact of the order will be variety from airline to airline and depend on their age of aviation park.
Transporters will have to prove that their planes have sustainability to radio interferences from mobile devices, as well as to review the benefits, training materials, manual standards and instructions for passengers.
“If the airline checks and confirms the intervention of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as planchets, electronic books and smartphones at any height,” FAU said.
In rare cases, the crew will give guidance to passengers to disable their devices during landing.
Furthermore, according to the group ' s recommendation, more difficult devices must be placed under seats or in the upper baggage sections during the flight and landing.
The heads of Daguestan are heard in the Cuban Hymne of Extremism
The football match between Angi and Cubany has come into a political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar country and Daguestan after the warmers burned the Dagestan flag, and Cubani's hymn sounded different.
The head of Daguestan Ramazan Abdulatipov invited the Republican parliamentarians on Thursday to appeal to the court, because the Hymn of the Rednodarian country seemed to call for international differences, in particular, to war with "basurmans " .
Take the Hymn of the Krasnodar County, which was approved in 1995.
It's embarrassing, and no one's doing it.
"With you here, as a mother, for the enemy, for the Basurman, we go to a death fight," said the words to write to the hymn, to consume one of those who believe in other believers," said the President of the House of Hezri Shihsaids.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
Now, the news from the ocean, namely, from Syria, where, as we know today, Israel has been hit by Russian production missiles, which have reportedly been named Hezbolle.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition to destroy its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was made within the framework of the agreement reached by the mediation of Russia and allowed the United States to avoid the military operation to which they had taken place this summer.
Detailed about the weapons and what all this means to the Syrian President will tell our major international correspondent Richard Angel.
Washington stated that the Assad regime would be punished for this.
Over 1400 peaceful residents, including hundreds of children, were killed by poisoning gas in August.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of an agreement made by the friend of Asada Vladimir Putin.
Syria will reject its chemical weapons by mid-year-old.
And today, it's important.
The Group of International Experts reported that Syria had removed alleged chemical production factories from the building.
The longer-term and difficult task is the destruction of the tons of chemical weapons and components to it.
As we understand, it's about a thousand tons.
Earlier Washington said Assad's days were counted.
I think Assad should leave.
It's not the question whether this will happen, it's about when it's happening.
He's no longer legitimate and he has to leave.
But Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are disconnected and badly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many are hungry.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The chemical weapons agreement was called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors were sentenced to the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself impressed a person prepared for cooperation.
Today, in Washington, US Ambassador in Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies from hunger, his mother is hardly easier than being killed by chemical weapons.
Assad's still holding up.
And turns weapons into power.
The President of the RF established a separate Ministry of Building and CCC
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, created a new Ministry of Coursing Building Affairs and CCC, and invited his former Governor of the Ivanov region to head Michael Manny in the process of personal meeting.
The President met with Michael Men, in the residence of New Ogarevo, and I refused to head the new office.
The Press Secretary of Russia, Dmitri Peskov, explained that all functions relating to construction and ZCKH were to the new Ministry of Minregion.
Michael Man, the son of the famous Orthodox Priest of Alexander Me, completed the Moscow Institute of Oil, named Gubkin.
Since 1995, his political career began -- he was elected to the Moscow area's thoughts from the Sergei-Posad district, as a deputy of the State Doma, the first Vice-Prime Minister of the Government of the Moscow, Vice-Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Michael Manj was the Governor of the Ivanov area.
The owners of lombards in Singapore do well, while the middle class has difficulties.
In a lombard in the Bendemir Trade Centre in Singapore, Janani Amrthalinga, the golden bracelet, ring and sewels to pay for his daughter's school training.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is in it," said Mrs. Amarthalinga.
Although she earns S$3000 ($2400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, the demand in different parts of South-Eastern Asia, where the debt of households grows, is that ValueMax, where it deals this week, became the third lombard registered on the Singapore Fund.
It is not just a quick way to get money (S$100 in case of Ms. Amrthaling), but almost as cheap as unsustained bank loans.
The Singapur Lombards are typically at an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, a little higher than 15.4 per cent proposed in the United Overseas Bank, local creditor in the same trade centre.
However, the lombards have the advantage that they do not require verifications of the lending or the evidence of the wage and can issue loans faster than the banks.
Therefore, millions of people throughout the region are turning into lombards because families feel pressure because of the increase in the value of life and rapid increase in debts of households and consumer debts.
After five years of sustainable growth followed by the global financial crisis, and cheap credits undercutting free money-credit policy in developed economies, low and medium-income families are called for loomers to compensate for reducing incomes to slow their economies.
This week, Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, indicated the increase in the family credit shoulder, mainly due to the increase of mortgage, as a risk to the creditability of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to the gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led this list from 80 per cent of GDP compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely left the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing reduction in exports and consumer demand.
“It is that with the increase of prices, people in the middle and lower [income scale] will look for ways to fill their income wherever they can”, said Song Seng Woon, a CIMB economist of the Malaysia Bank.
The recorded high prices for gold in the past two years have increased the rush of people to put their personal things, as they use the opportunity to obtain money for their family decorations.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the things laid down in 200 lombard cities are golden products.
People say, “The price of gold looks good, let's put the gold chain of the grandmother and get it back next month.”
In Thailand, the largest EasyMoney lambar operator observed the increase in the number of clients using its offices in recent months, up to 20 per cent.
The growth in the lombard business is that ValueMax, Bendemire's office operator and 15 other in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where he has four shops but also outside Asia, said Yeah Li Ching, executive Director of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion by using 60 per cent of S$66 million that have been drawn up this week as a result of the distribution of shares in Singapore's fund market.
While some creditors have criticized the fire of high interest rates, Ms. Yeah said that Lombard did not only offer cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it also did not increase debt directly.
“Clients establish the items they have already owned and the monetization of personal assets does not increase household debt”, she said.
The Facility acquires increasing public recognition as a means to obtain short-term, secured funding.
In addition, the lombards are not only used by the categories of people who are in a severe financial situation.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use the ValueMax offices by setting up gold or Rolex clocks, which can provide up to 60 per cent of their purchase value in cash.
We see customers from all layers of society.
“They include rich persons who need to take money for a short time for commercial projects or investments or small businesses to overcome temporary cash difficulties”, said Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very fast.
It is not important for the population today, but for the quality of medical assistance.
The implementation of the Tulian Health Modernization Programme for 2011-2013, the reorganization of our city's healthcare will enable the optimal structure for the provision of health assistance to the population, including gynekological sick, pregnant and relatives.
Thus, after mergering with the garlic, there was still a great opportunity to attract narrow experts from the NGCB to consult pregnant persons with various pathologies, to conduct additional surveys on the basis of hospitals.
During the modernization programme, the logistics and logistics of the home has been significantly improved, modern equipment corresponding to world standards.
Over these years, approximately 8 million rubles were made for capital renovations, 112 units of equipment were acquired by 42 million rubles.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive post for the newborn.
The Caesar's cutting operation is used by the Sell-Saver, which allows the blood to be collected from the operational wound and after special processing to return its relatives, avoiding transfusion of foreign blood.
The modern equipment is also equipped with a clinical-laboratory diagnostic office.
Women ' s consultation has an electronic registration, the introduction of electronic maps and the history of patients' disease is planned soon.
The development of telemedicine provided an opportunity to consult gynekological patients, pregnancies, births and newly born with regional experts.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechnians are arrested by the French police under suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been conducted since March of the current year.
About 60 women were complained of the Cawcascians.
The bandits reportedly ordered prostitutes to one of the Strasbourg hotels and then beat and robbed them.
The head of the gang was the 27-year-old Chechnian juvenile.

In this dispute, he had preceded the representatives of winter sports, which traditionally became best in the country.
The second place took Marcel Hirscher's miner, and the third was the ski ski skier from Gregor Shlirenzower's tramp.
In the last season, the 21-year-old Philippino-Nigerian Austrian helped his team to win the League of Champions, Champions and Cubes of Germany, as well as Supercube of UEFA.
The former wife of Arshavina rests with an actress Andrea Chadov
The former civilian wife of Peter Zenith, Andre Arshavin, Julia Baranovska, spent a vacation with her actress Andrey Chadov.
Julia rests in Italy in an actress of Anastasia, her fiancé, Sergei Slanov, and her actress Andrea Chadova.
Photos of joint pair walks are published in Instagram of the Travel Anastasia.
This is not the first joint photo of Andrea and Julia.
On 5 October, the Travel published a picture on which a couple were hugging at the coast of the Finnish Gulf in Comarovo.
In mid-October, Zenita, Andrej Arshavin confessed that he lived separately from his civilian wife, Julia.
Recall, Julia Baranovska and Andrej Arshavin have been together since 2003, with three children.
It has recently been known that Arshavin is meeting with Alice Casmina's ex-model.
A new friend of Arshavina was married to the top manager of the corporation.
Saving package of $325 million for Tasmania's health
The Federal Government insists that a rescue package of $325 million for Tasmania's weakened health system will be supplemented by strict conditions that guarantee that the Government will not spend the waste funds.
The Federal Minister for Health, Tanya Plibersek, announced that the Association has taken " urgent measures " to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the island state, the higher levels of chronic diseases and system limitations.
The decision to finance for four years was adopted after the Government's consultations with the independent deputy of Tasmania, Andrew Wilke.
“The Government has proposed a package of urgent rescue measures that, we believe, will address specific problems faced by the state”, stated today Ms. Plibersek.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for a plan-up campaign.
Another 2600 operations, including ortopedic and cataractic removal operations, will help to overcome the retirement.
There are also money for hospitals taking patients without preliminary records in Hobart and Lonsestone to improve the quality of care after the stationary, medical training, mental health care services and the introduction of personal medical cards in local hospitals.
“Those investments will go to the ideas of better helping Tasmania's health system”, said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania would work in a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will need to support the current level of funding in order to obtain the funds of the Commonwealth and report on where it spends the additional funds per month.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the state provides services as effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilke said today that $325 million would not decide anything if “a true reform would follow them, which would put Tasmania's health system on a more sustainable basis”.
Nevertheless, he commended the Government for his response to his request for emergency assistance, which he first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the Federal Assistance Package will significantly contribute to the withdrawal of the state's health system from critical state," said Mr. Wilky.
According to the Government, these additional electoral procedures have significantly compensated recent reductions.
However, the Federal Opposition Representative for Health, Peter Datton, believes that today's statement is a “decision, a similar layout”.
“The reason why we are here is that the Lyborist Government has taken out $430 million from the health system”, he said to the ABC TV television.
When the government takes out almost a half billion dollars and the Company invests 300 million, it is not possible to pretend that it is good news.
Mr. Datton asked Ms. Plibersek to guarantee that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on an additional bureaucracy.
Ecranization of the Guyom Nickle romance, Denny Didro, can be commended with exclusive and historical details, but it is also more difficult to take into account than it should.
The film in France in 1760s tells the dark history of Susan, a young aristocrat, sent to the monastery of her family.
When it starts to rebel, it experiences extreme cruelty from the hands of the sadist and becomes an object of erotic fantasy for others.
The film never falls down to the past or sensation — and that's the problem.
Due to its serious celebration, the report risks to be a test like a whiskey and for the audience.
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons production, said the observer group
Syria destroyed the basic equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poisoning gas, the international observer group said on Thursday, while the severe collisions stored in the north of the country, not far from one of the facilities where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also, on Thursday, the Syrian Group of Activists stated that more than 120,000 people were killed since the start of civil war in the country almost three years ago.
The statement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The extreme period of 1 November established in the Hague by the organization in order to destroy or “incomplete” all chemical weapons and mechanisms to mix chemicals with gas poisoning and fill ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important scale in the ambitious graph, which aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria cannot produce new chemical weapons anymore.
However, Damascu is yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stocks.
The country is believed to have approximately 1000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including monster gas and nervous paralytic gas.
This statement was made during a cruel fight on Thursday in Safira, in which the Syrian Centre for Human Rights, according to experts, was considered to be a chemical weapon production facility and its storage site, reported in Britain.
The Group of Activists, who tracked losses through the Syrian network, stated on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Of that number, as said, 61 067 are civilians, including 6365 children.
The Government said that 29,954 people were members of the armed forces of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were progovernmental warriors and 187 Lebanese warriors of Hezbolla.
Also, as stated in the statement, there were 2202 army escapers and about 5375 opposition warriors, many of them aliens.
According to UN estimates of 25 July, 100,000 have died in conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's army fought in Safira for several weeks with rebels, many of which are related to Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that there were victims on both sides on Thursday, but did not bring specific data.
The battles emphasized the danger of chemical weapons inspectors facing the compressed time limits of their Syria to the toxic arsenal in the context of civil war.
The WHO statement, which worked closely with the United Nations, states that its team was " now satisfied with the verification and seeing the destruction of all Syria's crucial means of production and mixing/fuel equipment " .
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently being planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification by visiting 21 of the 23 objects stated by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two security seats, said the inspectors.
On Thursday, WHO stated that both places were, according to Syria's statements, “affected and... subjects of the chemical weapons programme contained in them, transferred to other stated places that have been verified”.
It was unable to find out whether the object in Safir was one of the two places that WHO Inspectors could not visit.
Syria presented a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which should be approved by the WHO Executive Committee next month.
"I welcome the courage and courage you have all shown in the implementation of the most complicated mission ever taken by this organization," said the Director-General of the Observer Unit, Ahmet Uzimju, in the commentary published by the WHO.
For the third year, civil war has faced rebels, mainly muslims, the Government of Asada and its security forces, which consist of members of its sect of alabits, the responsibilities of the Shiit Islam.
With regard to other developments, the head of the Ramy Abdurahman Centre said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at the PVO in the coastal province of Syria Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger for the objection to organizers of the terrorist in Bali
The remaining in the alive and relatives of 202 victims of the bomb explosion in Bali in 2002 responded angerly to the sentence issued by the last perpetrators before the court and claimed that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years in refugees, as one of the most searched people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years of detention for his role in the establishment of explosive devices used during the terror.
It may be released for 15 years if he receives a preconditional release.
The 45-year-old accused was recognized as guilty of mass murders as a result of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, during which 202 were killed, including 88 Australians, and there were still dozens injured.
It was also acknowledged by a number of other terrorist accusations, including the wave of the explosions of churches throughout Indonesia in the Christmas Canon in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a lifetime period, although they could insist that a person called the "power" for his reputation of the master for the manufacture of explosive devices should be sentenced to a death penalty.
This decision has aggravated the painful memory of the mother from Perth Jun Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old daughters Jane and Jenny in the terror of the Patek and his companions nearly ten years ago.
She barely kept her tears, saying that Patek was to be sentenced to death.
"I really believe that he should follow the steps of other guys.
He must stand in front of the shooting team," said Mrs. Cortin AAP.
“I must live every day, knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I will not see my daughters.”
The Sarah Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was launched in a parked van, immediately after 11 october 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where the death terrorist exploded a bag caused by a explosive just 20 seconds earlier.
After that terror, he fell into a coma for a month and died three times by being connected to the lifesustainment system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the participation of the three other members of the terrorist cell “Jehama Islamia”, responsible for the bloody fight, — Amrozi, Muchlas and Mamah Samuda, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves a death punishment most of all.
To save his life, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and wounded hundreds, it's not so much.
Patek is the last part of the Bali terrorist participants before the court.
It was hiding for almost ten years, but at the end of the time he was detained in January 2011 in the Pakistan city of Abbottabad, where US troops killed former Al-Qaida head of Usam Ben Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent showed that the intelligence testified: Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in an attempt to restore links between the terrorist groups of South-Eastern Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He did not give up," said Mrs. Cortin.
Until recently, he did not regret how much pain he caused to others.
The sentence was issued at the 10th anniversary of the terror, which would be marked later this year in Bali and Australia.
"This year there will be many tears," said Mrs. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal to his sentence.
FAU: “The air passengers can now use aircraft gadgets (but not to call from the mobile phone)”
The passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not speak on mobile phones, according to the long-expected new guidelines published in the Federal Aviation Management Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect the changes to take place immediately.
As such changes are realized quickly, it will variety depending on the airline, said the FAU administrator Michael Werth at the press conference.
The airlines will have to show FAU how their planes meet the new guidelines and that they update their training benefits for the summer crew members and the regulations on device laying down to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among airlines that have already introduced plans.
“Depending on the status of the plan, we could endorse the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” FAU said.
The passengers are currently obliged to disable their smartphones, plots and other devices as soon as the door of the plane is closed.
They should not restart them until the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the captain gives "good".
The passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane falls down for landing and not include them until the plane gets on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic disturbances may allow passengers to use these devices during the flight, landing and ruling, FAU announced.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft modified in such a way that passengers could use Wi-Fi at large heights are expected to meet those criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Guides, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy will be well implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier in order to achieve this), this would be an unequivocable option," Glading said.
We are frankly tired of feeling “school offices ” when the matter comes to.
However, the Internet connection for surfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages or downloading of data will still be prohibited at less than 10,000 feet, the Agency reported.
The passengers will be invited to switch their smartphones, planchets and other aircraft into a plane.
Thus, no word with friends is an intellectual online game in which Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when a player was removed from the American Airlines Airlines aircraft for refusing to shut down the device when the plane was landing.
The harder devices, such as laptops, will still have to be placed in the luggage office, because they can trauma someone if they fly all over the salon.
Mobile phone calls will also continue to be prohibited.
Regulatory powers on telephone calls belong to the Federal Communications Commission, not FAU.
FAU may remove the ban on certain electronic devices during the flight and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Transport Safety Council, National Transport Security Expert CBS News, said that mobile phones were still considered risky.
"The mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create distortions for navigation devices, but we know through the FSC that they can create interferences for mobile communications above when the plane is in the air," said Rosenker.
The Industrial Advisory Committee established by FAU for the examination of the issue recommended last month that the Government authorize the broader use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on FAU has increased to reduce its use.
Critics, such as Missouri Clare McCaskill, claim that there are no strong security causes for bans.
Conservation of restrictions is also increasingly difficult to ensure, since the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that until the third passengers forget or ignore the instructions to disable their devices.
FAU began to limit the use of electronic devices passengers in 1966 in response to navigation and communication equipment reports when the passengers began carrying FM radio receivers — high-tech gadgets at the time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and endorsed by FAU as sustained to electronic interferences.
Airlines are offered to passengers using Wi-Fi at creator's height for years.
The aircraft modified for the Wi-Fi system are also more sustained to interferences.
Most airlines are adapted to broader use of electronic devices according to new guidelines, Werta said.
Today's electronic devices usually transmit radio signals far lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book reading devices, for example, only minimal signals are transmitted in page reviews.
But signals become stronger when the devices load or send data.
Among those who seek to mitigate restrictions on electronic device passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company's representatives loaded a whole airline with their Kindle electronic books and flyed on it to verify the problems, but did not find them.
Members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of devices is a risk.
Douglas Kidd, from the National Air Traffic Association, stated that distortions from devices were real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the Committee said that there were only individual communications of pilots that confirmed that the devices could create disturbances for aircraft, and most of these communications were very old.
Nevertheless, the Committee recommended that FAU allow pilots to require passengers to disable devices during equipment landing under limited visibility.
The group of representatives of the tourist industry welcomed these changes, calling them a healthy step to meet passengers currently using many technological devices.
"We are glad that FAU recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with security and protection," said Roger Dou, Director-General of the United States Tourist Association.
Auto-schools will be able to conduct exams for driver rights
The driver's examinations will be able to take private companies with their own computerised drone.
The Commersant refers to the draft decision of the Government on the authorisation of vehicles.
According to the newspaper, in Russia, there are only 30 such drones.
Students of such " privileged" schools are expected to be charged with internal test results.
The Gosavto Inspection will monitor the delivery of examinations every six months.
If more than 30 per cent of the theoretical exams and more than 20 per cent of the area do not give up since the first time, such school will be deprived of the privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for the drones contained in the draft decision of the Government shall enter into force from 5 November 2014.
The project also requires two-carriage training.
Since 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners for category A rights shall be subject to an examination in urban movement.
Furthermore, since 5 May 2014, companies would not be able to take foreign drivers to work with foreign rights.
Such workers will have to receive Russian rights after the examination.
A bird transferred by air to a safe place with a storm installation in the North Sea is released back to wild nature
The bird transferred by air to the shore after being found in an exhausted state on the oil height in the North Sea, was released back into wild nature.
This water trap was placed in the helicopter to Aberdin last month, and then was released by the Scotland Society for the Prevention of Cruel Treatment of Animals (SPCA) in the rescue center in Haloa.
The Chief of Colin Saddon Centre said: “This water sheep is probably a winter migrant from Northern Europe, who has gotten in the Northern Sea of strong winds.”
Apparently, the bird was hanging out and able to find a shelter on the oil height.
He added: “She was unable to fly again, so they asked for help.”
The water sheep was healthy and in good condition until he was released.
Are Europe's elite ready to business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with an obligation to gather business representatives and to determine what changes the prosperity and workplaces of Great Britain want to see in relations with the EU.
To this end, we ordered the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov has examined over 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of business in Britain by size, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be unexpected for many.
We have learned that the overwhelming majority of enterprises are currently looking for export opportunities outside Europe, paying particular attention to countries that have been modernizing and growing, while the EU countries are stuck.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than waste time for a long and difficult process of reforming confused EU institutions.
When they were asked about their views on specific political issues, from anti-monopolitic regulation to production laws, most business leaders felt that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
The general dissatisfaction was presented by a single market, and business representatives claimed that the costs of regulation from Brussels were now overcome the benefits of being in the european trade area, and even 40 per cent of the large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European companies.
Lastly, our business managers' survey revealed that the obvious majority wants Britain to take a course to change the treaty and to the relationship with the EU based on trade rather than policy.
This result, which was observed among the enterprises of all sizes and largest business groups, shows that business insisted on a " significant change" that would bring the powers back to Britain.
High rates: a change in the treaty and more favourable conditions for Great Britain will provide a 16 per cent voting for staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not be doubted: this survey shows that the British business supports its plan to revise the conditions of membership of Britain in the EU.
It also suggests that the business expects that the revision will lead to a significant move in the current balance of forces back to Britain.
The best conditions for the British business are possible and are increasingly necessary as the eurozone approaches a closer economic and financial unity.
The priority should be given to workplaces and economic growth in Great Britain, and, as the results of our survey showed, business is a strong focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels's regulatory activities.
United States Special Services listen to the Papa's personal phone
The activity of the Vatican is under a watchful control of American specialities.
The new documents from the collection of Edward Snowden indicate that the U.S. intelligence had been accompanied by all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and now he has a thorough care for Pope Francisco.
His phone started listening before he became head of the Vatican.
The new papa's election was also monitored.
What was particularly important in the United States.
The special service has connected to the mobile phones of the cardinals who gathered in Rome to choose another Pope.
The residence telephones were also interrogated.
The American spys were listening to all the main claimants for the Pope's throne to prevent the appearance of a non-willing figure for Washington.
The Panorama magazine states that the "great ear" continued to overcome the talks of the prelates before the conclusion of the Conclave on 12 March.
It is argued that the Argentine Archbishop Bergolio has been appointed as the future Pope of Rome since 2005.
The American Intelligence also observed negotiations related to the elections of the new President of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine states that the United States Embassy continues to work in a secret group of ClA and NSA operatives receiving information on policies and financial flows.
Instead, the Vatican reconciliatedly announced that it was not concerned with the American fog, even if it was happening.
The U.S. leadership of holy fathers has no secrets.
Snowboarder for the Olympic Monetary has been specially photographed
The Russian Bank issued a memorial banknote devoted to the city of Sochi on Wednesday, where the Olympic Games will be passed by this winter.
Nominal monetary is 100 rubles.
But bloggers are already actively ironizing on the memory banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic Monetary, on 30 October, they noted that the picture of a snowboarder from the banknote was found in the photo banks.
In particular, in a free stockExchange stock, where this photograph is dated by 2005.
The same photo is used in the photoshop lesson published on the Russian Magaoview website on 18 January 2011.
Furthermore, it has already been used to advertise RugGear's smartphones.
The Olympic banknote is carried out in the blue-blue gamma.
On the one hand, the snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other, is the type of Olympic Stadium and the Phar-Bird.
The author of the drafting of the banknote, Paul Bushuev, who won the contest among the students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts, named Repina.
The presentation noted that several types of sports were considered -- mining, fristal and jumping from the tramplin, but the snowboard was eventually chosen because it was relatively young sport.
According to the source of " Notifications" near the CB, the regulator is concerned with the public ' s view of the widespread spread of the image of the snowboarder with the Olympic Banknote and is currently studying the situation.
But in Goznak, they are not too concerned about the noise around the olympic banknote.
The press manager, Mr. Natalia Nikiforova, stated " Notifications " that all the reasons for the plagiat were funny.
The snowboarder of the banknotes turned right, on the photos on the grid - left, accurated Nikiforova.
A man on a photo session for the creation of a monetary was removed from different points, then a final picture was selected, a snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws were not extended to the olympic banknote, since the artist received a job wage.
Experts believe that the discussion about the image on the Olympic Monetary is positive.
The recognition of the portfolio - plus for its promotion - considers the executive director of the NP "RusBrand " Alex Popovicev.
Proving the 100 per cent similarity of the pictures in the coupon and in the photo banks is quite difficult, so the intellectual property claims for this image are unlikely to come.
The first Olympic Banknote appeared in China to the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008, a monument was released in 10 Juanas.
Russia decided to support this tradition.
Legislative prohibitions forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian beers have a bad mood.
Their pretends that the consumption of beer in the country in the future year will remain at the preliminary level, and that is best.
Although businessmen were initially counting on growth.
The current year is unsuccessful for them: sales have fallen by 7 per cent.
The chairman of one of the country's largest beer companies, the President of the Council of the Russian Beerware Council, Isaac Sheps, at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute of Daily Request in Russia, which had just ended in Moscow.
It was discussed with the public market regulation.
Since 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already decreased by 18 per cent since there has been a significant increase in the management of the beer industry in the production and trafficking of drinks with a small alcohol content,” said Sheps listeners.
In no country of the world there is such a strict restriction on the market of beer, unpredictable introduction of all new and new non-logical prohibitions that are justified to combat alcohol abuse.
The beer visited that many legislative prohibitions to reduce alcohol abuse have no particular influence, however all new initiatives have been constantly presented.
More than all of the beer producers have been hit by the ban on sale of alcohol in the kiosk since this year.
"We lost 35,000 consumers immediately," Isaac Sheps said.
Two predictions for the next year.
The optimist is the one said by Sheps, the sale of pen drinks remains at the preceding level.
The pessimist will fall by 2-3 per cent more.
In order to preserve their profits, businessmen are forced to leave the mass users' sorts to the "premium" class; the beer will be less, but it will cost more expensive.
In the meantime, the radical consequences of the sale of a small amount of spirt are not yet seen.
"In my observations, the level of alcoholism remains approximately at the same level," said the doctor Alexi Sotnik.
True, the proportion of sick people who are using strong drinks, as well as those who have “posed” on spirts containing toneous drinks such as Jaguar, while ten years ago prevailed with“ drinking ” alcoholism.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford Vehicle Factory.
As the trade unions say, all fired persons received compensation.
However, much more strict than workers' problems arise on the reduction of producing in the region.
At the meeting, the Deputy of the District ZackSa Alexei Ethmanov stated that about 600 people were reduced in the Ford company factory in Univolozsk.
He said that this had happened in September: then some 600 people left the factory on a voluntary release programme, which was developed together with the organization's trade union.
A number of salaries were proposed by the workers who decided to quit on their own will.
This has caused the overwhelming majority to leave jobs on their own will.
However, according to Etmanov, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's the case.
However, in the next two years, the authorities do not plan to adopt any programme of support for areas of difficult enterprises," he explained, adding that the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and a large reduction in jobs.
In Ford, the information is not condemned or confirmed.
We're waiting for an answer from the company, and once it comes up, we'll have to publish it.
Discussions on the reduction of workers in the Ford Factory in the Universal.
For example, 600 people had been known about the company's plans for dismissal in September.
Previously, the factory claimed the suspension of car production.
As a reason, the factory called the fall of demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, after the end of nine months 2013, industrial production in Lenoblasti decreased by 5.4 per cent.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, mobile cells will be used during the flight and landing of the plane
New rules for safe use of mobile devices during the flight and landing of the airline have been approved in the United States, reports the BBC television.
The US airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and planchets throughout the entire flight, and new rules will begin to work by the end of 2013.
Nevertheless, contact with the Internet for e-mail receipt and sending will be prohibited during flights below 3 miles.
Because of the danger of the disturbance of aircraft's radio equipment, the vote will continue to be under ban.
Thus, passengers of aircraft will be allowed to read electronic books, play games on planchets and other gadgets and watch videos during internal and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be obliged to verify the safety of the use of electronic devices during the flight.
Furthermore, airlines will have to convince the Federal Civil Aviation Management of the United States that they are able to deal with the alleged impact of mobile mobiles on the aircraft and aircraft management tools.
According to the source, such as the United States, the current use of electronic devices in flights may also be revised in Britain.
For the Russian Mafia in the United States, the new name is "Brate Circle"
The black list of Russian mafia in America was filled with new names and four companies this week.
The Ministry of Finance has introduced three Russian representatives, two Uzbekistan citizens and the Israelis into the Brat Circle.
One of the Russians was a famous singer, Gregory Leps, who was suspected by the transfer of money for members of the group.
However, 22 people involved in the “Brate Circle” and six related organizations are in the black list of United States.
Nevertheless, many experts have expressed doubts that such an organization exists.
"The statement of the Brother Circle is more of an attempt to combine different criminal groups," said previously expert on organized crime and professor of the University of New York, Mark Galleotti.
In his opinion, the Brother Circle reflects the popular perception of the Russian Mafia.
"I have not met anyone in the Russian law enforcement bodies or any other person to confirm the existence of such a criminal organization," the American Centre for Corruption and Organized Crime quoted Mr. Galeotti.
Mr. Galleotti also agreed with Professor of the University of George Mason Liz Shelly.
"If they act together, it is more like a criminal network but not an organization," the Centre for Corruption and Organized Crime said.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the Brother Circle combined more nearly the Russian thief in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Santa Hasan.
Criminal authority was killed in January this year.
Thus, Lasha Schushanashvili and Zechariah Kalashov, who filled the list in 2012, were closely linked to Santa Hasan, and another part of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was a nephew of Santa Hasan.
However, Mr. Galeotti noted that some individuals had no connection with Usoyan.
He believed that they were more combined by general financial and criminal interests, such as drug supply from Afghanistan.
In the meantime, the scandal about the inclusion in the Brother Circle, Gregory Leps, the favorite singer of Russia, Vladimir Putin, drew the attention of Kreml.
Of course, we expect from our American colleagues to get more detailed information, and why such a decision was made, why it was made into such lists," said the press secretary of the head of the State of Dmitri Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of RF.
Just as the interests of all RF citizens will be protected.
Head of Gazprom Alexei Miller said that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sphere
The beginning of the Southern Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria is the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said Chairman of Gazprom.
“The present has been a marked event: the construction of the Bulgarian South Stream gas station, the largest and important project in Europe,” said Chairman of Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream is designed to diversify Russian export routes across Europe.
The Contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which is mostly aimed at the European gas of Russia, increases the risk of ordinary routes, the officials say.
Miller stated that the direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that geopolitical risks related to transit countries were eliminated "every time".
Bulgarian consumers will gas from the Southern Stream on a lower price as soon as the entire project starts to work in 2015.
Gazprom stated that the construction should begin in other countries, which were further located on the gas-trail by the end of the year.
The annual projecting capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA staff have been accused of sexual offences before the charges against Jonathan Lord, as known by the Royal Commission
Two YMCA NSW officers were accused of sexual crimes against children before they were charged with childcare officers in 2011 in Caringbah Jonathan Lord, informed the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
However, the Commission ' s introductory statement stated that “he had never dealt with cases of sexual violence against children within his organization”.
The Chief Executive Director Philip Hayre was asked about one case when YMCA worker was accused of crimes related to child pornography, and other cases when the instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted for sexual crimes against children under control in 1991.
Mr. Hair told Gail Fernes, a lawyer who assisted the Commission, that he knew about the first case, but didn't know about the second.
He recognized that YMCA was also incorrect in the introductory speech for the Commission, claiming that “external YMCA checks were recognized that YMCA was in the first series of security of children”.
The testimony submitted by the Commission indicated that YMCA was notified that it received the second from the end of the four possible evaluations on the results of the quality audit carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Heir, who entered YMCA when he was 21, recognized that he and the lower leadership had failed by hiring the Lord and could not ensure clear understanding by his staff of his obligations relating to the violations of child security policies.
Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted for sexual crimes against 12 boys during two years of his work in YMCA.
He was in jail for at least six years.
However, Mr. Heir rejected the presumption that the corporate ethics of YMCA prevented staff from reporting to the Lord's violations in the field of child safety.
The staff indicated that they had seen violations, including that the Lord was alone with children, cared for them personally, planted them on his knees, said that he loved one of them and allowed them to play their mobile phones.
Daniel Oquell, who was under the leadership of the Lord and asked to teach her protection of children because she was concerned about his behavior, witnessed that Jackie Barnath, the Chief of the Child of YMCA in Caringbach, was “very intimidating and often difficult”.
The Executive Director said that he did not accept the explanation of staff that they had been embarrassed to report the situation to their superior leaders.
Rather, he said that their friendship with the Lord led them to the thought of the need to report about him.
Mr. Heir said that he presented his opinion to the YMCA New South Wales Council that the lesson for the organization of “Abortion with Jonathan Lord” was not “intimate” to provide information” by staff and the Council agreed with it.
Mr. Heir stated that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the appearance of charges was adopted by the Director-General of YMCA on the Child Child of Liam Whitley.
He said that it was intended to prevent a bunch of evidence, but it was “against rebuilt” and the decision was badly implemented.
YMCA New South Wales was not safe for children during Jonathan Lord's work during the period 2009-2011, the Commission informed the expert on children's planting issues, Professor Steven Smallbone from the University of Griffith.
He said there were "serious problems" in the collection, selection, instructions, training and monitoring of staff.
The hearings are delayed until 20 December.
A week of fashion in Sao Paulo.
It's not just a model, it's a real star.
Despite the fact that Giselle Bündschen for a while left her job distracted from maternity, she arrived specially in these days and this week.
A multimonth absence did not prevent her from retaining her place on the floor and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the highest supermodel of the world.
This time she was participating in the colchci mark.
Fashion week's final is usually the most interesting show.
It's kind of like Lino Villaventura's style.
Marke over 30 years, parallel with the pre-a port of the Lux class, the modeler actively works in the theatre and in the movies, shaping spectacles and designing suits for many famous pictures.
In general, more than 30,000 companies and companies participated in the final fashion week in São Paul, which were related to the textile industry and the fashion world.
It is one of the most dynamicly developing areas of production, more than two million Brazilians, and the annual traffic is at $50 billion.
Tony Blair said he would use the chance to return as Prime Minister of Great Britain, but admits that return is unlikely.
The 59-year-old politician presented his views on various aspects of internal policy in the interview on the fifth anniversary of care.
Since resignation in June 2007, after ten years as a leader, Blair significantly avoided the discussion of the British policy, limiting the majority of its comments by foreign affairs and its role as Ambassador in the four Middle East Peacekeepers.
Answering whether he would have returned to the Prime Minister, Blair, on the report of the London Evening Standard, said: “Yes, of course, but it would hardly happen, so...”
The Chief Coach of Milana Massimiliano Allegri regretted no outcome at the 10th tour of the Italian Championship of Lacio.
The specialist also noted that the failures at the start were caused by a series of injuries of leading players.
I'm very sorry that we didn't win, the Tmw says Allegry.
The team played a nice match by creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first time, we didn't let Lacio do anything.
The second Romans added, but I can't generally say we lost our concentration.
I had to win.
In the past season, we met the championship in the League.
We are now restrained from the schedule, but this is caused by a series of key footballers' injuries.
Rammy and Honda?
They're very good players, with nature.
But our composition is still good.
Take a look at Cocoa, who held a high-level meeting.
The experts of consolidating activities moved to Cardiff to fight for the Year's Lodge Prize knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was prepared to appear a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schooler, just a few months before he made his first steps, this little boy with his shatland pony Toffy risia walked through three rounds to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adults far behind.
This unseparated couple, the same growth, received high assessments for the appearance, behaviour and style of the annual contest, which is conducted by the Centre of Sannibank’s horse sports center in Radri near Cardiff.
With a general perception in the background of men and women in fine hats of cats, he moved his hat back and was proud to spend the circle of a two-year Toffy.
The judges praised Fenton for his inherent ability to treat horses for years.
And Toffy received a higher assessment for the appearance and nature.
Fenton was presented to Toffy on his third birthday in March last year, and since then he was working with the Shetland Pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffy are making a great duet."
They had a lot of rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a rose.
It was just his second talk with Toffy, and we were all excited when he won.
Exactly unknown people in the arena considered it so phenomenonly that they wanted to photograph it.
This village boy Nantiglo, near Abbe Vale in South Wales, follows his aunt Sharon Howles, who has been exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howels said: “All the audiences were amazed and all cried approving and screaming.”
He ran through the sand all the length of the arena and, although he looked so small, he did his work greatly.
Fenton is insane of animals -- he loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
According to how he started, he will soon participate in the Loshady of the Year, and I am sure he will be doing good.
The representative of this annual horse exhibition said: “Fenton only three years, but he knows how to treat his pony.”
They're a great team together.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and the way they represented themselves at the show ring.
They appreciate the compatibility of the pony and factory - Fenton and Toffy were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton helped his attractive dress, he really looked well in his role.
The publication of the Chinese newspaper “Reorganization”
The Chinese newspaper, published on the first page, calls for the release of a reporter ' s accused injury, should be reorganized, reports the press regulator.
The New Express issued in Guangjou has made an unexpected public statement with a request for the release of a journalist Chen Yungjou.
However, Mr. Chen later confessed on the television that he was taking bribes for writing false articles on a public property company.
The New Express should now take place “the complete correction process”, as the regulator reports.
The order for "correction of errors" came from the Guandun Office in the field of press and publications, radio, movies and television.
The preliminary investigation showed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group published several false reports on the Zoomlion market from September 2012 to August 2013.
“The New Express Manual was dezoriented”, states the regulator's statement.
He states that it was decided to “invest administrative request to Chen Yungjou in the form of revocation of his reporting licence”.
He also “instructed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a full correction of errors in the New Express and recommended that she investigate the situation of the responsible persons of the newspaper and immediately make changes to the leadership of the New Express”.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express, in which he claimed financial violations in the construction equipment of a company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two calls on his release on the first page, claiming that it supports his journalist activities.
However, Mr. Chen then appeared on public television with recognition that he published false articles for money.
“In that case, I have damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire media industry and its ability to earn public confidence”, he said to the CCTV public branch company.
I did it mostly because I wanted money and glory.
I realized my guilt.
After the confession of Mr. Chen, the New Express issued apologies on the first line, saying that the newspaper was not able to verify his reporting properly.
Several high suspects have recently made accords on television.
Experts say that the practice of recognition in China remains widespread, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities from forceing anyone to reservation.
Detected U.S. Tunnel — Mexico for Drug Transport, equipped by its own railway
One of the most complicated drug traffic tunnels between the United States and Mexico has been found, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical railway system.
The U.S. authorities described this tunnel at four feet wide as one of the most complicated secret movements ever discovered.
This zigzag tunnel, which is nearly six football fields, ties storages near the city of Tihuana (Mexico) and San Diego (U.S.
This area is filled with unacceptable storages, which facilitates the concealed load of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs had been transmitted without notice, as authorities stated.
According to judicial documents, the law enforcement officers confiscated eight and a half tonnes of marihuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men who, according to lawguards, were charged with marijuana and cocaine for dissemination.
In the case of conviction, imprisonment is threatened from 10 years to life's imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use large underground drenaging channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage found in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were found in Central Mexico after the harvest of marijuana in October, which had put the narcotics into the difficult task of fast delivery of their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of approximately 700 yards, equipped by railways, from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tihuana to two San Diego warehouses.

The British Police shall give Assanjou an extradition notification
Today the British police informed the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who hid in the embassy of Ecuador in London and asked asylum.
In Scotland Yard, they stated that they had given the 40-year-old Australian “official requirement to surrender” to appear at the police station, adding that if he did not meet this requirement, he would continue to be arrested.
Assanju is threatened to extradite Sweden for sexual offences after he exhausted his possibilities in accordance with the British law when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal to extradition earlier this month.
Feeling that Stockholm will deliver it to the United States, he hid in the embassy of Ecuador in London on 19 June, asked that South American country of political asylum.
Scotland Yard “applied a 40-year-old man an official requirement to surrender, which obligates him to arrive at the police station at the day and time of our election,” said the press secretary.
It continues to violate the conditions of exemption.
The Embassy refused to comment on the notification of the police.
Assange fears that it will be extraded from Sweden to the United States to make possible charges for spying after the publication of more than 250,000 US diplomatic deposits on WikiLeaks' website against the secrecy.
Driver driven with speed of 130 miles per hour with hot drink between feet damaged at £1000
The car was damaged at 1,000 pounds for driving up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between the feet.
The 35-year-old Andrew Hoey from Tiptry, Essex, was observed by his Mercedes Benz on the A120 Road at Braintry on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink between his feet.
In the world court of Colchester Hoey, he acknowledged the charge of driving without due consideration and attention.
Appendix to its driver's seven fines resulted in a six-month ban on driving.
Houi also pledged to pay the costs of $90 and an additional fee for the assistance of victims of crime of $1100.
The tax for foreign real estate owners will lead to the londonian bubble to smash
The penalty had carried out a preliminary assessment of capital tax measures, but awaits the final decision of Mr. Osborn, who in the 2012 budget introduced a public decree rate of 7 per cent for houses worth more than 2 million £2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own homes in society rather than as physical persons.
At this point, the household's real estate in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, comprising 708 million pounds in the year 2012/13, has already exceeded the total amount in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, North-West, Yorkshire and Hamber together.
Mr. Cook stated: “After the increase in the households and the introduction of the related legislation against removal, it is very difficult to claim that the taxation of expensive real estate is degraded, regardless of the influence of the aged municipal tax system.”
"But this step may lead to some foreign investors who will not be willing to buy real estate in London or its current owners will not want to sell it," he added.
The value of first-class real estate, the upper 5-10% of the price market, in the rich south-western zone of London, which is extended from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by 11.8 per cent in the past year.
According to the research of Savils, prices in London continued to demonstrate sustainable growth of 5.6% in the annual calculation, but they were temporarily undermined by the active “real market” inflammation of prices in southern west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%).
Scientists made light on how dog's tail movements are related to her mood.
Earlier studies showed that the satisfied dogs were swing on the right side (the dog’s perspective), while the alarmed dogs waving the tail primarily to the left.
But now scientists say that other dog family representatives can observe these thin differences in tailing and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, neurobiologist from Trent University, said: “It is well known that people have the left and right sides of the brain differently involved in the formation of stimulators that cause positive or negative emotions.”
This is where we have tried to look at this in other types.
He added that like humans, dogs on the right part of their brain controls the left side of the body and the opposite, and two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to different tails of other dogs, researchers observed animals when they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the frequency of the heartbeat of animals and analysed their behaviour.
Perhaps we will soon understand why their tails sometimes go to one direction and sometimes to another.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed dogs videos with dogs — either naturalistic versions, or forcet to get rid of any other destructive factors, and we could manipulate tail movements and tails more to the left or to the right.”
When animals saw that in the rest of the dog was moving his tail to the right (willing the tail of the dog), they remained totally relaxed.
But when they noticed that their tail was on the left of the tail, their heartbeat was incorporated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think the dogs were intentionally communicated with each other by means of these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dogs have learned from their experiences about what movements they should be concerned and what are not.
He notes: “If there are several meetings with other dogs and their tails are often linked to more friendly behaviour, and the right side gives less friendly behaviour, the dog responds on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give to owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of their animal's emotions.
An expert in the field of dog behaviour, John Bradshaw, an invitated scientific officer at the University of Bristol veterinary school, said that this was not the first study to verify whether the left and right dogs were relevant.
Last year, a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left if they look at a aggressive dog, and to the right if they look at a good dog.
In another scientific work of the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “The dogs were more frequently approaching the dog of robot when the tail execution was directed to the left, not to the right, rather than to become alarmed, the opposite behaviour in relation to Italian research.”
He said that differences could be because dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in movies or robots as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
“Whenas there are sufficient evidence that two brain hemispheres are used for various purposes, many details are still to be clarified and dogs are not exceptional”, he said.
However, taking into account the easyness that can be registered, we may soon understand why their tails sometimes go to one direction and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone the Glasgo concert because of Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys Rock group postponed the Glasgo concert after her vocalist had diagnosed laringitis.

Pope Francis will call the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will bring new cardinals of the Catholic Church to sleep for the first time in his service on 22 February, as said the Vatican on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are the ones who are choosing the popes, so that France will appoint their first group of people who will eventually participate in the choice of his successor.
There is now 201 cardinal.
However, after reaching the 80-year-old cardinal, he could no longer participate in the papal elections, which is the prerogative of the 120 “Cardinal Electioners” group.
In the announcement of this news, the Vatican press secretary, Father Federico Lombardi, said that before the san ceremony, a meeting of all the current cardinals known as Constable will be held.
"Papa Francisk decided to report earlier its decision to convene a conspiry in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from different corners of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero, from the Catholic Voices Organization, said that the number of the election cardinals will probably fall down by February.
He said that the father usually calls as many cardinals as it is necessary to re-establish the number of cardinals up to 120 and as many cardinals aged 80 years old as he wishes.
The conspiry will be of great importance in the next year, because it will be the first time since France was elected in March this year, according to Valero.
At this point there is a kind of prediction for Europe and especially for Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope of Cardinals from other regions of the world will be appointed to restore balance”, he noted.
In South America there are 40 per cent of Catholics, but they are represented by a low number of cardinals.
These will also be the first selected cardinals since the formation of the Council of Cardinals, the eight cardinal groups from all over the world, which are assigned to search for ways of reforming the church.
In the past, Dad made his own decision.
"Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that Francis would “automaticly” that he would call for the council to the cardinals.
But we weren't in this situation before, it's all for us for the first time.

GM revokes a number of new trucks in the United States to improve the back of the seats
General Motors Co calls for nearly 19,000 new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra models in 2014 to address the problems with manual control of the backs of the seats, in accordance with the notification from the U.S. regulatory authorities in the field of safety of the vehicle.
On some of the trucks the front seats may have a defect in the backshooting mechanism.
As a result, the seat backs do not meet the federal standards for auto-trafficking.
“When the car hits behind, the headmaster may not properly protect the driver and passengers by increasing the risk of injury,” states the National Administration for Road Safety website.
Revoked models have been produced from 1 August to 10 September.
The GM execution began in June and was the most important launch of the car in serial production for the leading American autoproducer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the trucks about the defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration could not consider the notification of the owners on the 16-day cease of the Government's work that reduced the sales of vehicles in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were modernized for the 2014 model series, increased by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, as GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado picks and 16,503 Sierra.
The GM shares on the New York Foundation Bureau on Friday daily increased by 1.4 per cent prior to $37.47.
The desperation of the Obama voter
I voted for President Obama twice, with the hope of change
He said that Obama allowed the obstructionism of the Republicans to make no commendable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot be justified by the problem with the website reformed by the Obama health system, drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memories are a sad reminder of what could be
Nathaniel P. Morris, student of the second course of the Harvard University Medical Faculty.
I read a terrible sad book these days.
I thought that this book would excite me at the second course of the Medical Faculty, and it would restore my hope.
It is called "Dust for victory" and it is the memoare of Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.
When I end up writing reports on my patients tonight and laying in bed, this book brings me back when politics inspired millions of people, and the speeches could have taken the spirit.
The election victory was impressive, and the leading news programmes paused to reflect this historical moment.
My classmates cried out of joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could only find.
A young team of strategies had to come to the White House, and the people were ready to change.
During the entry into Obama ' s post in 2008, its support rate was 82 per cent.
Then I'm closing the book.
Return to this is a rough awakening as an exhaustion of dreams.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism — they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of the missing opportunities.
In the years that have passed since I dropped my first electoral bulletin, changes have really happened.
That was what I couldn't imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and diversity achievements, from the adoption of the law of accessible medical assistance before the conclusion of our military in Iraq, the cancellation of the rule “Don't ask, don't say”, the murder of Usama Ben Laden.
Furthermore, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to advance our country: immigration reform, public health ability and the closure of the base in Guantanamo among others.
But after a countless number of times I was on the side of Obama's administration, protecting her from my colleagues and peers, I have ended my explanations that I can provide.
I have reached the point of political desperation.
The obstructionism of the Republicans cannot explain the authorization of the audience of foreign leaders or the impact of drones on innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the private life of the Americans by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of exploitants who disclose the wrongdoing actions of the Government.
It cannot explain the killing of an American citizen, Anvar Al-Avlaki, without court or investigation or non-compliance with the limits of public financing and expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of the report in which it states that the efforts made by the White House to silence the media are “the most aggressive... since the administration of Nikson”.
And recently, he could not justify the fact that it was not able to develop a simple web site for more than three years after the signing of the Law on Available Medical Assistance.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I, when I was 18 years old, understand that the leadership could contradict political campaigns that precedes him?
Obviously, the electoral post is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be formed by the opposition political party and accidental events such as the Battle of Newtown.
Nevertheless, all the examples that I have listed above show that they have been a large extent of their own choice of administration.
And that's what bothers me most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm about his candidacy.
The Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and rude alternative, and it seemed to be unable to decide on its own policy or views.
I believed that, within my second time, Obama would relieve the hopes that we have heard for such a long time.
However, when Obama's rating dropped below 45% this week, returning back in 2008 was much more difficult.
This makes me miss many promises that have gone away.
This week, I read the part of the book that described how Clinton caused Obama a deaf defeat in the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At the analytical meeting of the causes of failure, he told his staff that they had to go back to a normal course and remain faithful to their goals.
“ I want us to regain our attraction, ” he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I'm totally agreeing with you.

Clive Palmer claims that the deputy Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the childcare vacation.
The Deputy Miliarder Clive Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest in care for the child ' s vacation, because his daughters could be pregnant and benefited from this.
This mining-producing magnet, which has an unresolved carbon emission tax dispute, made this statement while he tried to discontinue whether he had a conflict.
The Joint Party of Palmer can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial in the decision to withdraw taxes for carbon emissions and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could be only with ministers, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters would be personally victorious from political measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to a payable baby care leave, because if any of these daughters are pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they will receive their leave or not," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the elections, the electoral commission officially announced Mr. Palmer as a winner in the fight against the Sanshain Cost Election District of Ferfax, with 53 votes over votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a revision of the procedure for the summary of votes at elections to accelerate the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott Francis and Bridget.
Should a decision on these elections be taken two months after we voted?
“We must have a more perfect system,” he said.
Why should we not have such a system that we can come, enter our data into the computer, vote immediately and get the results at 18:30 the same night?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of pencils for labels in bulletins.
Is that because they can delete the result if someone doesn't like it?
Using a pencil today seems strange.
The electoral Commission has examined the possibilities for electronic votes and has recently published a joint discussion document with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his programme included an international airport for Sanshain-Cost and would " be very serious" to take into account his new work.
The State post provides the service to society.
"We have no rewards but the gratitude of history for being able to serve this district at a critical moment," he said.
RBS removes two monetary traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily removed two traders from the work of its Monetary Operations, according to the information of two people familiar with the situation, which is another confirmation that the global checking of the regulations of alleged monetary manipulation in the currency market is rapidly acquiring trafficking.
Some of the largest world banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in investigations related to the largest financial market in the world, the daily traffic of which is $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS officers to be removed during the deployment investigation, which is confronted with a scandal related to the interbank rate of LIBOR.
By refusing to comment on the withdrawal, the Bank confirmed that this month it received requests for information by regulating authorities.
“Our current investigation is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators”, said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the informed persons said that RBS had transmitted e-mail records and immediate communications received and sent by its former trader governing the British Authority, the Financial Control Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and, as far as it is known, has been given leave to his current post of the European Monetary Trade Manager in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trades in Citi, left on holiday this week, while Matt Gardiner, former senior monetary trader in Barclays and UBS, was removed from the work of the Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any violations.
Mr. Asher's immediate communications group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to aware persons.
The UBS Bank reported this week that it had taken measures against some of its staff after the Swiss Finma regulator said that it was investigating alleged manipulation on the currency market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six governing bodies in the world -- the European Commission, Finma, the Switzerland Anti-Monopolity Authority of Veko, FCA, the United States Ministry of Justice and the Monetary Management of Hong Kong -- are considering allegations that bankers have entered into a treaty for the impact of the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal checks or received requests for information by regulators, said the persons familiar with the situation.
Banks are looking for immediate communications and e-mails for several years in search of cases of offences.
The news of verifications had been broken by traders in activities that had been one of the largest sources of revenues of investment banks in recent years, which, however, faced difficulties because the low volatility of the currency had reduced the favourable opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers were trying to reduce the seriousness of the situation, saying that the broad and high currency market is practically impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the extensive daily trade in the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the broader use of their internal platforms means “you can begin to influence the market at a very small price”.
This news came on the same day when the Bank of Credit Suisse announced that one of the traders of its London Trust Division had dismissed on the end of the last year, after it had caused losses of almost $6 million.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperates with its regulators.
“We are sure that the traider has acted alone and that the issue has been localized," said the credit Suisse.
The Supreme Court supported the Obama Health Act
The United States Supreme Court today decided that Barack Obama's sign law on health is a constitutional, which is the great victory of Obama's administration.
Following votes 5 to 4, the judges decided that individual orders on the protection of patients and accessible health, which require citizens to acquire medical insurance before 2014 or pay fines, were constitutional in accordance with the powers of the Government on taxation.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined four more liberal members of the court, while judges of Scully, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The Court also left the remaining sections of this 2700-party law in force, and further decided that the requirement of the health law to increase the requirements of the Medicaid programme, otherwise they would lose all the federal funding of the Medicaid programme, is not unconstitutionally forced.
The application for the blocking of the draft law was lodged by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
Each of the substantive Republican candidates for presidents during the 2012 season of primary elections, including the alleged candidate of Mit Romney.
Football is the cause of a difference?
In the framework of the Open Tribunal, policies and experts discussed how to maintain national peace in Russia.
There was also a suggestion to ban football in the Northern Caucase, because this game is scandals and differences.
Spiker Sergey Naryskin reminded of recent events in Burulevo and said that policies and media should be correct in expressions to reduce the level of voltage in society.
He must have meant a recent scandal with Vladimir Girinovski, who in one of the televisions threatened to surround Caucas with a thickness, unless they wanted to limit the birthability...
All speakers also spoke of measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries and measures to harmonize relations between the peoples in Russia, which gave discussions a cluster.
Maxim Gregoryev stated that the events in Burulevo were a "model conflict that could have been predicted", but "we have too many people and instances" and seven nannies have an eyeless child.
The concept of multiculture, which Europe has long practiced with regard to migrants, according to the public, has failed and must be searched for its way.
Historian Yuri Petrov gave great hopes on a new single book of history.
"It is still necessary to create a country's history help so that schools in Tatarstan know what people live in Daguestan, and on the contrary," he said.
Gennadius Zuganov invited you to introduce criminal responsibility for the “restriction calls to Russia”: “If in the U.S. say radio that you should be given to Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and sentenced to 20 years of prison!”
Vladimir Girinovski was very hard to "do not burn".
As usual, he accused journalists who have had the sick and acute national problems to the public debate, "Is there little to say in the dust of dispute? "
The leader of the Fraction of the only Russia, Vladimir Vasilev, immediately advised journalists to conclude the paper and to agree on the subject carefully, and then the same commitments could be taken into account.
We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and a whole order has been established, said Mr. Vasiliev.
As an example, he set out a law which lies to regional and municipal authorities with responsibility for international peace in their territory.
But Ludmila Andrichicko did not share the admiration of the law: it had no " clear idea what migrant adaptation was, its mechanisms and limits.
So the subjects will deal differently with the amount of these powers.
Furthermore, municipalities have no personnel necessary to address so complex issues, no funds, and methodical recommendations that they could use, the centre does not give them...
The head of the National Committee for National Affairs, Hadżymet Safaraliev, proposed that a special office, called “the Ministry of National Security”, should be dealt with national policies.
However, Valerius Tishkov, who was headed by a similar office in the 1990s, had subsequently been opposed.
It's enough to have a special person at the federal level, "Minister without a wallet", to whom you could contact if anything.
"We go around the edge, the missiles rip together, and it is very important for the representatives of various ethnos and religions to speak together against provocations, and this work should receive valuable information support," said the representative of the RPC on connections with the society of Svevolod Chaplin.
No neutrality of the State against dangerous ideologies, including religious, should be, in his view, not.
Here, Oleg Neilov introduced a discussion in an unexpected way, " Better talented people than in Chechnah or Daguestan, still need to be searched, but they are pushed in the wrong way, in the wrong way," he said.
"The wrong road" is football development, "The football player beats all the crowds, the flags are burning, the companions stones screw each other...
Maybe we don't need that football?
There's another kind of sport -- it's called...
"They will not be equal in the world in such a sport!"
No one's going to play the ragbi on Kavkaza!
You're going to offer them kerling!
We need to know the national characteristics, it's like the Zaporogue truck to offer...
In Yaroslava, the moscow club's representatives were divorced by wild behaviour in the tribunal during the local club game.
Football will have to be banned all over the country...
The Chief of the RFS Disciplinary Committee, Arthur Gregorianz, reported that Kuban was damaged by 500,000 rubles, transmitted by the S.E. correspondent Philipp PAPENKOV from the Football House.
Such sanctions on the Red Club are applied for the flag of Daguestan by the cheerleader at the tribunal during the 14th tour home.
At the meeting were representatives of both clubs, a person from RFPL.
We've studied all the materials available.
For the inadequate behaviour of the Cuban's viewers, it's punishable by 500,000 rubles.
Against Google, Samsung, Huawei claims on Nortel Patents
The group owned by thousands of former Nortel patents on Thursday has filed a whole series of patent claims against mobile phone manufacturers, including the Google company, which it had broken over at the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
Consortium Rockstar, purchased for $4.5 billion of Nortel, filed a claim to breach patent rights in the U.S. District Court of Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is shared in Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of a violation of seven patents.
These patents include technologies that help compare the key words of search on the Internet with their advertising, according to the case, the foundation of Google's search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones working on the Android operating system from Google, which compete violently with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered a initial price of $900 million for patents Nortel.
Google has raised the proposed price several times, eventually offering a total of $4.4 billion.
Having lost the case of Nortel Consortium Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12,5 billion, which partially acquired the Motorola Patent Library.
“Despite the failure to acquire auction patents that are subject to the investigation, Google has violated and continues to violate them”, states the judicial court.
Rockstar requires a higher reimbursement of losses from Google, as he claims that the violation of the patent rights by Google is deliberate, according to the claim.
In Egypt, the first freely elected President shall take a oath
Muhammad Mursey takes an oath, but the day of his festivities would hardly mean the end of the political fight in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Mursey promised “new Egypt” when he sweared to be the first freely elected president of the country, changing Hosney Mubarak, who was thrown away 16 months ago.
At its inauguration to the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursay also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab Peace and the fifth head of the State in Egypt after the monarchy erupted about 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges in black coats in a court building on the Neil shore of the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for a better future, new Egypt and the second Republic," Mursay said during the feast ceremony showed in the public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have established the foundations of a new life — absolute freedom, true democracy and stability”, stated Murcy, 60-year-old American education engineer from the “Braty Muslimman”, a fundamentalist group, which was most of the 84 years of its existence, forbidden by a organization that served as a target for strict action to replace each other by Governments.
The building was protected by hundreds of soldiers and policemen when Murcey arrived with a small cortex shortly after 11 a.m. in local time.
Only a few hundred members gathered at the court building to welcome the new president, and, unlike the presidential pump of Mubarak's time, the movement was stopped for a short time to pass its colon on a normally live road, which links the city to the southern frontiers.
Although Mursey was laughed as a non-harismic “reserve wheel” of the Brothers, his personal prestige has grown sharply since his victory and the Friday statement, in which he tried to represent himself as a candidate not only of Islamic but also of all those who wanted to bring the rebellion to the end of 2011 against the authoritar Mubarac.
"Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and contemporary State," Mursey said, dressed in a blue business suit with a red necklace, judges in a surrounded wooden panel of the hall where he took his oath.
Later, Murcy went to Cairo University, where he was to speak his innauguration speech.
He was given an official reception with the Army Orchestra who fulfilled the state hymne during which he stood at the standing “smirely”.
Feldmarchal Hussein Tantawi was present.
His arrival was met by the Army and the people, one hand, which was scanded by hundreds of people gathered at the university's main Learning Hall.
In 1908, the University of Cairo was founded as a world educational facility, and in the 1970s, the Islamist Student Groups had become a sailing of the Islamist Groups.
Mursay took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where the rebellion that completed the Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year was born and promised to return the powers of the President whose position was deprived of the military council who took the case from the leader.
But consenting to accept an official oath before the court, not before the parliament as adopted, he fulfilled the will of the military, and it is a sign that the fight for power will continue.
Mursey’s speech on the Tahrir Square was filled with theatreal populist gestures.
The next meeting of the Tumenian Machine Association was held on the basis of the Yalutorov road factory.
The event presented a new line on the production of electrical pipes from the steel.
According to the commercial director Dennis Gribanov, a marketing study on the market was conducted in 2011 with the appearance of a new owner.
It was clear that the region consumed more than 50,000 tonnes of electric pipes per month.
The change in the factory profile and installation of equipment for their production was then decided.
More than 7,000 tons of production have already been reloaded this year.
Investments in the factory amounted to more than 120 million rublays,” said Dennis Gribanov.
A new state is launched in October, which allows to increase the assortiment.
The factory is produced both a small profile of the pipe that is used for the current personal household, small forms of construction and in furniture and large for the construction industry.
We are planning to go to the production level of 50,000 tonnes a year, which would be about 10 per cent of the consumption in the Tumen area.
Despite the transition to another kind of activity, the number of business staff has not been reduced -- now it is 157 people, plans for new equipment -- increased staff by more than 50 employees.
The company is re-training, and the necessary experts are collected from the already available.
The next year is planned to introduce a new aggregate of long-range shafts has become a thickness of up to five millimeters, which will reduce product sustainability as well as another state, with the speed of production of the pipe to 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, businesses are about to educate pipes used in housing and housing.
The company ' s management tasks to close up to 70 per cent of the Tumen needs in this product.
The Deputy Director of Investment Policy Department, Leonid Ostroumov, in turn to managing managers, advised us to give greater attention to modernization of machinery enterprises.
This is also aimed at the form of public support for industry, which includes the reimbursement of the interest rates of credit for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of the leasing.
The current year, 150 million rubbers are allocated for these purposes, two thirds of that amount have already been spent.
The last commission to consider subsidiary treaties shall adopt documents from enterprises until 15 November.
Furthermore, the budget is compensated for the participation of local producers in international shops.
The next year, the budget provides for the funds of 150 million rubbers that can be used to compensate lising payments and credits for acquisition of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to shops, 3 million for energy programmes.
To 72 million rubbers, the reimbursement of the procurement and payable equipment in the southern Tumen area for the oil complex is reduced.
According to Leonid Ostroumum, this form of support would be ceased, as the motivation of its introduction was to compensate the tax on the gaining of useful digestives, which oil companies paid in the area budget.
They do not do so now, and subsidies become direct commitments of the region.
In view of this, the Government of the area considers the direct support of industrial enterprises, not the financing of the oil industry through them.
Budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many business managers expressed concern about the situation in relation to oil.
The purchased equipment is a competitive advantage of the Southern Tumen industry, and it will be difficult to compete at the price of the average Russian lane, where the workforce is cheaper.
Furthermore, there is no question of the advantage of the new TNC-VR owner, the Rosneft company, which has not yet placed its orders in the tumen businesses.
The Uwath Project Agreement expired in 2013 and no extension was made.
Southern areas that are specialized for oil sector equipment are currently unable to form a procurement portfolio for the next year.
The issue remains whether taxes from the oil gathered in the Uwath region will be made in the region's budget or will be paid at the location of the registration of a new landlord.
Tomic will work 240 hours for the extremist role in the social network
The Lenin District Court of Tomska sentenced to 240 hours of compulsory work of the city who placed videos of extremist direction on the social network, the RIA News reported on Friday by a press service representative of the district court.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man placed a video on his page in the popular social network, which was made into the federal list of extremistic materials.
A criminal case on the UKF article " Actions aimed at hatred and enmity, as well as the degradation of human dignity committed publicly."
"The Leniian District Court considered this case in particular and recognized the man guilty of committing the above crime by appointing a penalty of 240 hours of compulsory work," said the agency's interviewer.
She added that a man fully confessed his guilt.
Azarov promised the Ukrainians to cover the prices of goods after the signature of the Association with the European Union
The Prime Minister of Ukraine Nikolai Azarov is convinced that the prices in the country will be significantly reduced after the country signed the Association Agreement with the European Union.
He stated this during the communication with the readers of his page on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are defined by a large number of factors, including the taxes.
Thus, after the signing of the agreement and entry into force of the Free Trade Zone, the customs import rate of goods from the EU will significantly reduce.
And that would mean that prices should also be lowered.
"It is about goods that come from the EU countries," Azarov wrote.
With regard to other goods, the impact of the price agreement will not be so direct, it will be focused.
However, there should be no increase in prices.
Therefore, reports on billboards, which have recently occurred in our country, that the EU association is a price growth, it is not exactly that, or, if more specifically, not at all," Azarov summarized.
Investigators are checking the information on the ill-treatment of the child in Bisk
On 29 October, the media published a report that one of the children's gardens of Biska had locked the child in the basement.
Investigators now find out all the circumstances and legal assessment of the action of the child garden staff.
After the accusation of Eugenia Vasiljeva spoke
Eugenia Vasiljeva, who has been attached to a person nearly a year of close attention to the media, has not yet commented on numerous publications in the press both of the kidnappings in the Minobones and its personal relations with the former Minister of Defence, Anatolia Serdukov, its poetry and its addiction to valuable things.
However, on 1 November, the Obronoservice case was violated by the silence.
In the interview of Life News Vasiljeva, she said, "Ormally, it was one of the challenges: to extract any negative information from me about the former Defence Minister."
There was a blackmail that I had to testify, otherwise I was put in jail.
For today, these threats have stopped.
We're going to court further, proving our innocence.
We are 100 per cent sure in victory.
The interview can conclude that most of the facts of Vasilie’s insights have been given to her that she has no interest in the taste.
The statement of the CCP official, Vladimir Markin, was likely to be made to the statement that the collection of pictures collected by the Oboronservis case was false.
Among the arrested property, there are a number of pictures that the master, being confident of her deep knowledge of art, has gained as works of world painting.
However, the art expertise appointed by investigators after the arrest of these images found that they have no artistic value and, simply speaking, are cheap counterfeits," Markin noted at the beginning of October.
Some paintings stolen from the Defense Department...
Then they admitted that they were not stolen from the Minobones, and they said I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
I think it's just an inconsistency," said Basiljeva.
However, whether she recognized her guilt in one of its 12th criminal episodes, Vasiljeva said, "Of course, no.
There's nothing to admit.
Furthermore, there is no damage to the Russian Federation.
They just mislead the people, that's all.
Furthermore, in response to today's RF statement that Vasiljeva is being removed from the study of criminal proceedings, the figure lawyer stated that he and his client “not allowed to know the matter.”
What caused the exhibition of Vasille's home arrest, not yet communicated with the press?
How could the woman not answer the accusation of bad taste?
Or are the rights of the Comsomolki journalists, who claimed a few days ago that she had "invaded into a more large trans under domestic arrest" because of the reconciliation reports of Anatolia Serdukov with his wife and his return to the lono of the family?
A famous military observer, Victor Baranez, in his "Serdukov" article, wrote: "The followers do not exclude that after such a shock, she could be more interviewable in interrogations."
Previously, Basiljeva had taken some charges for the illegal sale of the real estate of Mino defense.

Do you think the tourists have gone back through the Internet?
The Flight Centre seems to have a reverse trend.
The company has updated its profit forecast for a full year and expects record income from resting in Australia and Britain.
This tourist company is now expecting its main full annual income before taxation to $325 to $340 million, compared to the previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If current orientations are achieved, 12 to 17 per cent increases will be compared to the record profit of $290.4 million received in 2011/2012.
Director Graham Turner said that the Flight Centre received 8 per cent of its profits in the first half of the year and started the second half-year with good indicators, especially on the weekly trips to Australia and Britain.
“In the beginning of the year, we have been working with profits in our 10 countries, and some of them are expected for a full year to make a record of high profits before the calculation of interests and tax contributions,” he said.
“Australia and Great Britain are here, which usually bring us the greatest profits.”
In Australia, the second half-year business recovered, compensating a few weaker internal markets of corporate travels.
Similarly, in Britain, the Flight Centre's business went well, while corporate clients spent less.
Her business in the United States compensated the losses suffered during the seasonally weak first half anniversary, and the profit was expected for the third full year in a series of years.
Yesterday Flight Centre shares grew 3 cents to $38.20.

In Ekaterinburg, the criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Ekateringburg, the police are searching for a criminal who had a violent dispute with two sisters.
They burned their bodies after the murder.

The school courses of English literature will require students to study at least one play of Shakespeare, novel of the 19th century, romantic poetry and modern British art literature since 1914.
The examination will also be presented by “external texts” to promote more widespread reading.
The common course of English literature and language will be cancelled.
Since 2015, the students will be obliged to issue a separate examination in the language, with urgency recommendations for the selection of English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education should issue tomorrow new training programmes on English and mathematics, the first subjects subjected to a radical review.
It will make changes to other main items next year.
A separately regulatory body in the field of ALQUAL examinations will present the revised structure of high-school graduation examinations, with a new evaluation system and a smaller course.
Speaking in the summer, the Minister of Education, Michael Gove, said that “the broad consensus was reached in the fact that we should reform our examination system to restore public confidence”, insisting that school examinations would be “more complex, more ambitious and strict”.
Studies show that English schools give less time to mathematics (116 hours per year, or three hours a week), than in most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools are given about 143 hours a year, and in Singapore, students are at about 138 hours.
While no formal requirement would be given more time in the mathematics schedule, the sources in the coalition said that large school graduation mathematical examinations, combined with an increased mathematical factor in the rating table, would probably serve as an incentive to provide additional education schools on this subject.
Training will give more attention to “real life challenges”, including financial mathematics.

Dmitri Medvedev: GDP growth rates are insufficient for State development
The Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev considers that the GDP growth rate is insufficient for the RF and is sure that the situation can be improved by simplifying business loans and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, reports Reuters.
We planned GDP growth this year in the area of 3 per cent, perhaps even a little more.
It's going to be less than 2% real.
In the background of the recession in a number of countries of Europe, it seems not very bad, but it's not very small for us, because the economic base is not as powerful as a whole of the countries, and in order to develop, there must be a higher rate.
It is now very important that Russian companies, Russian business, receive normal credits at a normal price, are the first thing that must be done," the head of the Government stressed.

Travel on dirt, rivers and jungles to provide free medical assistance
Dr. George Bwelle provides free medical assistance in agriculture in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team have been conducting almost every weekend, taking hundreds of patients
In this Western-African country, not so many doctors -- only one per 5000 people
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. George Bwelle is one of the 10 main heroes of CNN 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of the other 10 main heroes to become the hero of CNN.
This man will receive $250,000 to continue his excellent work.
During 21 years, George Bwelle saw his father returning to life and reappearing into unconscious states, traveling through hospitals that were not adequately equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaunde, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken hand, but the infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that reminded of himself for the rest of his life.
“ There were no neuro surgeons in Cameroon, ” George Bwelle said.
If we had the money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle had been accompanied by his father in over-filled clinics and hospitals for years, receiving any treatment they could receive.
“ It's not easy, ” said Bwelle.
- You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m., run to the hospital to be first, but you're not the first.
A lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Father Bwelle ended in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, in Cameroon only one doctor per 5000 people.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor of 413 people.
And even if the camonuans were able to contact a doctor, many of them would not have been in the pocket.
Two of the five people in this country live under poverty, and nearly three quarters of the health costs in it are private.
“ Their only problem is poverty, ” said Bwell.
“And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy their life.”
Seeing his father’s suffering and many of his companions, Bwelle has been determined to do so.
Last year, Dr. George Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and worked as a surgeon in the Central Hospital of Yaunde.
He also established a non-commercial organization of ASCOVIME, which organizes travel to the rural area on weekends to provide free medical assistance.
Since 2008, he and his volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, and up to 30 people are loaded into vans, bound to roofs and traveling across the cross-border area to visit the villages.
They don't always have luck.
Many times they had to push cars through rivers and dirt.
But when they arrived, they are met as real heroes: it is a holiday with songs and dances and best rooms that local people can offer.
The free health care in these villages is indeed a cause for the celebration, and Bwell with its wide smile and infrequency energy is more than happy to join joy.
The next morning, the brigade will start taking hundreds of patients.
"We take 500 people in each trip," said Bwell.
They come from the entire district within 60 miles from the village, and they come walking.
Each of these clinic on the weekend provides variety of medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can receive bones, donated glasses or free birth certificates — documents necessary for schools that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the brigade conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are generally conducted in school, municipality or house; patients are rising and going to the after-operation zone to free the place for the next person.
Using a generator to light the operational and sanitation equipment, Bwell and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
This is an undue pace, but the aim of the brigade is usually helping to support rural musicians.
"They're hitting the drums all night so we can stay and continue to work," said Bwelle.
On Sunday, members of the brigade return to the city, tired but proud of their work.
The group, composed of Cameroon Doctors and Foreign Medical Students, conducted 700 free operations last year, and they know that their assistance could be of great importance to those to whom they are assisting.
One person explained that a free mushroom treatment operation would allow him to work again.
“ This will change the future for me and my family, ” said the man.
In addition to these clinical receptions on weekends and work in the hospital, surgeon Bwell is also working at private medical clinics around Yaunda at night.
This second work, he said, provides 60 per cent of the financing of his non-commercial organization; the other funds are covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's asleep," said Katie O'Malley, a second course student of Drexel University in Philadelphia, volunteer in Bwell Group.
He's always either in the hospital, or he's trying to earn money for the organization so that the campaigns can continue.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, who arrived from the United States and Europe, to join Bwell in carrying out his tasks, it is an opportunity to practice that they would never receive at home.
"We have been able to assist in operations where we have helped to remove blood points or to keep tools for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley said.
As a second-course student, you would never have received that opportunity in America.
Students volunteers usually pay their own trip to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicinal products.
But when they arrived in Yaunda, their food, transport and training pays Bwelle.
"He is a hero, no doubt," O'Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon indefinitely.
For Bulle, almost constant loading is not a difficult test.
Helping to live a happy life with others, fulfilling the promise given to his father is what brings him great joy.
“ I am so happy to do this job, ” said Bwell.
- And I think about my father.
I hope he can see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME site and see what you can do to help.
Snowden agreed to testify on the audience of Merkel
The bundestago deputy Hans-Christian Strebelle met Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the discussion, the question was whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the FRG prosecutor on the possibility of a phone hearing by the Chancellor of Germany by United States Special Services.
Snowden expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could be held either in Moscow or Germany.
He made it clear," said Hans-Christian Strebelle, that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Keith Alexander has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, first, we must clearly determine all the conditions of his arrival.
Meanwhile, American legislators have begun to take action in response to the scandal around the United States spy programmes.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved yesterday a bill imposed additional restrictions on the activities of the American Electronic Intelligence Department.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all areas and areas.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Mackey, told the journalists at the press conference on the outcome of the meeting with the Foreign Minister of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoglu, was informed by the correspondent of BELTA.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarus and Turkish relations in all areas and areas.
Belarus is also interested in this, so we agreed that the public administration bodies of the two countries would provide widespread assistance and support to entrepreneurs who have established direct trade and economic contacts," said Vladimir Mackey.
He emphasized that the Government of Belarus would create all the necessary conditions for this and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also reported that the next eighth meeting of the Belarus-Turkey Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission was signed by the Ankara.
The Parties have developed a road map of the Belarus and Turkish interaction, which, according to the head of the Belarus Foreign Political Office, aims at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade and investment areas, in industrial co-operation, transport, agriculture, energy, as well as in search for new forms and directions of interaction.

Turkey's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, said that the negotiations of the Heads of the Foreign Political Departments of the two countries had decided to continue to develop mutual collaboration and implement various projects in the negotiations.
The commodity between Belarus and Turkey, according to the Minister, it is necessary to increase and bring it to a $ billion indicator.
Turkey is also an important partner in the field of investment cooperation that needs to be developed further, since there is unused potential in this area, he believes.
We always have a very warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that they will further be strengthened and expanded.
As well as all the necessary conditions for trade and economic links and for the successful work of Turkish companies in the Territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey," said Ahmet Davutoglu.
Obama denied its words on health
Among the storms of criticism, President Obama went to the peak yesterday on his often repeated, clear promise that “if you like your medical insurance plan, you can save it”.
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people have received notifications of the cessation of services from their providers, the Republicans have criticised the President in recent days for misleading the American society.
Yesterday, Obama made a few repairs of his original public promise.
“The majority of people with medical insurance that works can save it”, he said in his statement in Boston.
With regard to what he referred to as "renewal in news" on the cessation of services, Obama called on the Americans to look for other options on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain the best, integrated health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than they were predicted.
"You will receive more favourable conditions," he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the people who buy insurance themselves could be forced to change their plans because their coverage was not in line with the new standards necessary in accordance with the law on accessible medical assistance.
“Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve better”, said Sibellius in the statement to the Energy Committee and Trade of the Chamber of Representatives in Washington.
Sibellius, who is ruling the law on accessible medical assistance, said that the launch of the Internet sales was “awfully bad” since October.
“ I'm upset and upset as much as everyone else, ” she said.
“I really want to regain your trust."
The irritated Sibellius contradicted the phrase caught by the inclusive microphone sitting behind her associate at yesterday's hearings in the Chamber after hot debate with a member of the House of representatives of Billy Long, a republican from the state of Missouri, whether she is obliged to join Obama's health programme.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long reiterated Sibellius to say, why the “architect” of the law on accessible medical assistance has not voluntarily refused the insurance provided by the Government for acquisition of a plan through HealthCare.gov, which it has now imposed to millions of Americans.
The Rosbalt Agency has deprived the status of the media for non-censorous defense
On 31 October, Mosgorsud decided to acknowledge an invalid license on the registration of the Rosbalt Agency, -- says Lenta.
At the deprivation of the media status agency, the Roscomnaverer was insisted on systematic and gross violations of the media law.
During the process, an unpleasant precedent was established: the Court considered it possible to close the media, in fact deniing the publication in the right to contrarument.
What's "Rosbalt"
The Information Agency of Rosbalt was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the Agency opened the second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The Agency has also worked by representatives in the countries of the former SSSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analytical agency.
By mid-2000, the agency included the list of the most familiar private media in Russia.
Rosbalt had always been a very specific depth: the exclusive publications of the agency had (and still composed) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement bodies.
Discussions on the approximation of the publication of force structures continued throughout the existence of the Agency.
Furthermore, Rosbalt had a wide range of sources in various offices, it also suggested that Natalia Chaplin, the wife of Victor Churches, was headed by the project.
The role of Chaplina in the Rosbalt leadership is not clear until the end: it is often referred to as “the project manager”.
The Director-General of the Agency is Lariss Athonina, chief editor Nikolay Ulianov.
Recently, Rosbalt has not been in the federal media ratings, neither by quotation nor by the audience.
In October, the agency took the 25th place in the rating of the Russian media website on LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average audience of the Rosbalt.ru site is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 views), a monthly monthly number of three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the past five months -- notes of Kremlin's helplessness in relation to Ukraine, the death of the King and Shooty team, the stone bureau.
The Rosbalt conflict with Roscomnadsor began in July 2013 when the media law was amended, prohibiting journalists from non-censorous defenses.
The message discovered a prohibited text in two published videos on the website ("Gigit from Rednodar" and "Pussy Riot distorted petroleums").
The following parties are described differently.
On the basis of the discovered video materials, the Rosbalt accused of a gross and systematic violation of the media law and requested a licence from the Agency.
The Rosbalt stated that the claims of the agency were unlawful: first, the rolls were not editing materials, secondly, the mother's words were masked, and, thirdly, immediately after the warning of the roll were removed from the site.
The representatives of the Agency appealed to the claims of the Roscomnazor in the world court, and on 22 October 2013, when Mosgourud adopted the Roscomnazor suit, the complaints continued to be reviewed.
However, the 25 numbers of the world's judges have not decided for “Rosbalt”: the chief editor Nikolay Ulianov has been recognized guilty of violations of the code on administrative offences and has been punished by 20,000 rubles - 10,000 for each film.
It is obvious that this has also prescribed the outcome of the hearing in Mosgorsud, if you reject the thought that the outcome could be overcome before.
The Court decided on 31 October to recognise the incorrect registration certificate “Rosbalt”, actually denied the media status agency.
You can't say that Rosbalt remained alone during this opposition.
The Agency supported the deputies of the State (the statement on behalf of the head of Roscomnazor Alexander Žarov signed on 10 October 26 delegates; the document itself was submitted under the Initiative of the PRF).
The unlawfulness of the closure of the publication was stated by the head of the Union of Russian journalists, Svevolod Bogdans, President of the Moscow Union of journalists Paul Gusev, and the Chairman of the Presidential Human Rights Council, Michael Fedotes.
Furthermore, Goddanov said that the leadership of the Roscomnadzor even provided him with some guarantees that the revocation of the licence would not come.
The Court of Justice of Rosbalt showed that there is a great issue under whose jurisdiction to be more secured by the media in Russia today.
Syria destroyed Hymorrhea equipment
Syria has destroyed all the powers reported for chemical weapons, recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament, Damascus, has completed the day before the deadline.
By 1 November, Syria had to destroy the production and other subsidiary facilities intended for the preparation of combat poisoning substances for use, B-B-S.
The destruction of poisoning substances themselves or their chemical components must be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of WHO, poisoning substances are currently in printed storages.
International inspectors were sent to Syria after more than 1,400 people died in Damascus on 21 August during the chemical attack, according to the United States.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste their time - to prevent Syrian authorities from making more chemicals - and to destroy the infrastructure to mix chemicals and ammunition equipment.
These production powers will now be monitored carefully in order to prevent them from repairing them.
The following weighs in the middle of November: by this time, the WHO and Syrians should agree with the detailed plan for the destruction of already existing poisoning substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where are they going to be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by Western intelligence.
They will be willing to advise the inspectors of new facilities to verify if they have reasons to suspect that Damascus is not fully open.
The United States believed that the shooting was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the matter of the hands of Syrian rebels.
The world community required Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached in Russia ' s mediation, to destroy or bring all the powers in the unemployment for the production of gas and liquids and to fill the nucleus with these substances.
Now that this stage is over, the next step should be the destruction of the already existing Syrian army of chemicals.
It is expected that there may be more than 1,000 tonnes of neuro-paralytic poisoning substances, every rigid monster gas and other prohibited chemicals stored in several dozens of different places.
Its destruction requires that the WHO and Syrian authorities initiate a schedule of action, which takes two weeks.
The WHO Field Operations Manager Jerry Smith stated that his inspectors “personally observed the destruction of equipment”.
"They do not have the possibility of further production or mixing chemical weapons," he said.
The WHO declaration states that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and made sure that the power plants and poisoning substances were either destroyed or depleted.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to conduct inspections there, stated in the document, but the equipment was transported and verified by the WHO experts.
According to Smith, the destruction of the Hymorrhagic Infrastructure was " particularly difficult" because it had to work under the ongoing conflict.
At the beginning of October, the WHO received the Nobel Peace Prize, but, according to Smith, the time for the celebration of this inspectors was not yet available -- they were too busy at work.
John Kerry, in his unprecedented recognition, said that the United States spy “is gone unlikely far”
John Kerry demonstrated the mitigation of the protection of United States follow-up programmes by making an unprecedented recognition that in some cases the United States spying has “as far gone unlikely”.
The Secretary-General also recognized that it was guilty, along with Barack Obama, that he was on the autopilot during the outbreak of Edward Snowden's loud disclosure of the UNB spying activities.
These information leaks have put the United States Government into the centre of the diplomatic scandal with its allies.
While speaking at the open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other Government members, have actually taken into account some of the things that were happening on the autopilot, because such a possibility has already existed — both during the Second World War and in the very difficult years of the cold war, and, of course, on 11 September”.
He then became the first high-level member of the United States Government, who recognized that the US spy was too far, but stressed that none of the rights had been violated.
He said: “In some cases it went unlikely far.
And the President is determined to put light on the issue and explain it to the people, and now conducts a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there are no abuses against innocent people in this process."
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted from good motives and that his monitoring operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We work in a new world where people are willing to explode themselves.
There is a radical extremism in the world, unreasonable and determined to kill people, explode people and attack Governments.
What if you were able to overcome this, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented aircraft crashes, explosions of buildings and human murders, because we have been able to learn about these plans earlier."
In the meantime, American legislators will be made in Europe to help address the alleged United States spying on abroad and to convince the Europeans to continue joint anti-terrorism activities with the United States, said the Chairman of the Sub-Committee of the Senate on European Affairs on Thursday.
The Senator of the Connecticut, Chris Murphy, said that he had interviewed with members of the European Parliament and other persons this week and concerned about their threats to cease participation in anti-terrorism organizations because of the disappointment in the monitoring of the National Security Agency.
"For the interests of US national security, it is really important that the Europeans remain our participants with regard to our common anti-terrorism efforts," said the Democrat Murphy, who is the first term of office and is chairman of the subcommittee of the International Relations of the Senate on European Affairs, in a interview from Washington.
“I am going to Europe to allow them to understand that we should continue to cooperate in the field of counter-terrorism, despite their rage on these NSA programmes.”
The news that the NSA gathered millions of telephone records in Europe has deteriorated relations with some United States allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were incorrect and reflected the misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the United States.
Other disclosures were found by Snowden's documents that indicated that the NSA monitored the German Chancellor's mobile phone, Angela Merkel, as well as the phones of about 34 other world leaders.
The National Intelligence Director James Clapper protected spy activities against allies as necessary and said that it was a common case on both sides.
In the background of this noise, Murphy said that his office would organize a visit of members of the Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and he hoped that the delegation would be members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be recorded in the coming days.
He said that the journey programme was still on the stage of development.
Although Murphy stated that the goal of the journey was to promote the relationship, he said that some of the “greatness of the best motives” would also be shown.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in what spy programmes they used for many years.
"While we can change our monitoring programmes to better protect the rights of the Europeans, they should also agree that we are not the only intelligence," Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry should go to the Middle East and Poland on this weekend to address the problems of hostility against the United States Strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the United States Intelligence.
The new commissions of public observation commissions will increase the impact of prisoners
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve new compositions of public monitoring commissions (UNC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If a voted option is adopted, rape lobbists will increase their impact.
UNC is public structures controlling the conditions of deprivation.
The cases of Sergei of Magnetic and Leonid Roadżeva, the worries in the colony in Colonie of Colonel, are being advertising by the UNC by most resonant incidents behind the retirement.
For control of UNC, the struggle between human rights defenders and rape lobbists is in place.
At the meeting of the ODP working group on the formation of UNC, I proposed to make a criterion for selecting human rights experience.
"It was not accepted and formed by lists without making the criteria," said Valerius Borchev.
Borschev, the current President of the Moscow Observer Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, the universal Russian human rights defenders of prison problems.
In the presence of the Deputy of the State of Apple, he developed a law governing the activities of UNC.
The OP Council should vote for the composition of UNC in 43 regions of the country.
In 1800 vacant places there are less than thousands of wishes, and in Ingushetia and Cabarino-Balcaria, competitions were unable to organize because of the absence of candidates.
The OP promises to organize a doning at vacancies.
UNC of Moscow is one of the few commissions with a competition, despite the fact that the new composition instead of 20 would be 40 participants.
According to Borsztew, the current commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 forces, and the option at the OP vote, the ratio is changed by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to go to the capital commission.
However, a new composition could be reinstated by the representative of the Battle Brotherhood, Viceslav Kalinin.
He was a member of UNC for three years, but never visited prisoners.
Borschev believes that forces by appointing its Chairman of UNC can make the work of human rights defenders untolerable, so the human rights defenders do not exclude a collective exit from the Commission.
They believe that the promotion of rapes is coordinated by a member of UNC Anton Cvetkov, headed by the “Russian officers”, an organization that is in favour of the interests of forced agencies.
"I am not eating infants on a tape," said the RBK daily Anton Cvetkov.
He denied that he lobbed the promotion of any lists and said that it would not prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested opponents.
According to Cvetkov, he was not even interested in the list of votes in the OP.
The dissemination of the Bourchow information is considered to be a form of pressure.
Possible success of human rights defenders is a planned change in the headmanship of the UNC.
Her former leaders will be removed because of last year's troops.
The Court of Justice concluded that the leadership of the local commission had ignored the problems of prisoners.
However, UNC Rostova-Don can move from human rights defenders to rape.
From the new lists " missing" a human rights chairman of the local commission, but one of his opponents was found, despite the fact that in May 2013, the Federal Public Chamber excluded him for the non-ethical behaviour.
The lists of the Moscow and Raising Commissions of Borschev considers "the place for Kopesk".
The explanations of the Tolokonnic Hope did not affect the UNC Mordovia ' s ' force ' s ' ; only one human rights defender wanted to come into the new composition and had not even accepted competitive documents.
A member of the OP Board, Nikolay Swanidie, told RBK daily, voted against the proposed list, as it was disturbed by the situation in Moscow and Rostovo na Don.
He sent his position to other members of the Council.
His colleague on OP Paul Gusev said he voted for, as he liked the proposed moscow list.
The compilation of UNC lists was coordinated by the Deputy Secretary of OP Vladislav Grib, also a Scientific Research Institute of FSIN.
The mushroom told RBK daily that it was not appropriate to share candidates into human rights defenders and rapes and agrees that the chairmen of the commissions had sufficient powers to prevent the work of its members.
The mushroom did not predict the outcome of the vote of the OP.
If the proposed list is rejected today, the revised option will be made in the next days.
Australian woman appeals against the prison term in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days of prison on the island of Phucket for false claim that she was attacked by a taxiist, appealed to a sentence and was released under jail.
Steve Rochelle Bamford was initially recognized on 15 June by the Phucket Provincial Court as guilty of false investigation after the Tailand police report that the local taxiist had attacked on Sunday 10 June, while two other men kept her.
However, the video cameras later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after the break-up of relations with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed that she fabricated this story.
She was held in local police cells before the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-hour prison in the centre of the general regime in the area of Phucketa, not in a female prison for adults.
She is the daughter of the former player of the Australian League of Peter Tanx, who has turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “a great concern ” for her daughter's welfare and was waiting for her return to Australia.
"It was obviously an anxious time, but we hope that it will be safely home as soon as possible," said Tanks.
Bamford filed an appeal to her sentence and was released in a bail of 50,000 bats.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently on vacation in the Krabi district area in southern Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford is now a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in her sentence for up to two years and would force her to stay in prison for adults.
However, after the recent murder of the Australian tournament Michel Smith in Phuket Thailand, he could also seek to restore his ruined tourism image, which would lead to an excuse.
Roman Senchin is now in Paris at the presentation of his novel Eltisheva, translated in French.
Recall, this is his romance, which became the finalist of four prizes: "Jasna Polena", "Russian Bucker", "National Bestseler" and "Bigger Book".
Last year, the writer was given the prize of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is an undoubted leader in the generation of current thirty-year-old and 40-year-old prozaics.
Almost every publication of its strict, constructed on the modern life material of stories and reports causes hot disputes among criticists of the various directions.
It can be claimed that the articles collected together on the prose and publicity of Senchina, the reviews on its books and journal publications create an interesting and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the end of the 1990s before the beginning of 2010.
