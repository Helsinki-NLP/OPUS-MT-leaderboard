The Valian extra deputies are concerned about what they look like.
Some deputies do not understand why their deputation status should be changed to the status of "member of Parliament of Wales".
The deputies were disturbed because of the plans to rename a local meeting named "Wels' parliament".
The deputies of all political views suggest that it's some kind of gratitude.
A deputy Leibarist said his colleagues are concerned that this is rhymmed with the words "bullshit" and "fuzzy".
For readers outside of Wales: In the Wallish twp, it means "bullshit" and pwp means "fuzzy".
The deputy said that her group was completely unsatisfied and offered alternatives.
The Valian conservators said their group was ready to discuss the name of the congregation, but they noted that it was a short prompt transition from a member of the Valian Parliament to the "marianes".
In this context, the Valian letter w is saying the same thing as the yorkshire English phrase u.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently developing a draft law on the introduction of changes to the name, made a statement: "The final decision on any description of what the deputies call the meeting will, of course, be the question of the members themselves."
The Wales government law since 2017 gives the Wallis East the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the national consultation on proposals, which showed wide support for calling the meeting a Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of the additional deputy, the Commission preferred members of the Parliament of Wales or the CHP, but the CHUP option received the greatest support during public consultations.
Additional deputies are apparently offering alternative options, but the way to achieve consensus can become a major pain for the presidency, Ellen Jones, who is supposed to introduce the change law for several weeks.
Reforms will include other changes in the work of the individuals, such as the rules for disqualification of additional deputies and changes in the structure of the Bureau.
Additional deputies will vote finally on what they should be called when they're doing their final work.
Macedonians vote on a referendum on country's name change
On Sunday, the voters vote for changing their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia or against that.
National vote was organized to resolve a long-term issue with neighbouring Greece, which has its own area called Macedonia.
In Athens, they have long insisted that their northern neighbor's name is a claim to their territory, which prevented the involvement and friendship of Macedonia in the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, the opposer of the referendum on the name change, said that he would not vote.
But the headquarters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name is just a cost to pay for joining the EU and the North Atlantic Alliance.
St. Martin's temple's calls are silent, the churches in Harleme fight for existence
"Rather, as the old people I spoke to, there were bars and church at each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"The day here is neither one nor the other."
He said that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"The people have different communications and relations at present," he said.
"The bars are no longer comfortable local holidays where people walk constantly."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of activated was not enough for such a long period as this wait for leaders, and sooner or later they will return to where they began.
The churches, he added, can be replaced by housing houses with condoms filled with people who won't help the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
"The largest majority of the inhabitants who buy condomiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that will accelerate the day if these churches close together, because it is unlikely that the majority of people who move into these candominios will become the attendance of these churches."
Both churches were built by a group of whites before Harlem became a black district – the Church of the Stale Citizen in 1870, the Church of St. Martin -- in a decade.
The original white methodistic community left in the 1930s.
The black communities, who prayed around, had received the right of property to the building.
The Church of St. Martin was captured by a black-core public under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who was headed by a bird of traders at the main trade in Harleme 125th Street, where they refused to hire or promote black skins.
The fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but the believers under the leadership of the Ice Johnson planned a reconstruction: they introduced a coral.
Similar David Johnson, son of father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the colonel "as called poor people."
The expert who played on the carlion in July called it "Cultural Treasure" and "the unreplaced historical tool."
The expert of Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also pointed out that this was the first carilion in the world on which a black skin musician, Dianisia A. Lind, who had moved to the bigger coralion in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merivezer said he was not replaced in St. Martin's Church.
What happened in St. Martin's Church in the past few months was a complex story between the architects and the deceptors, some of whom were attracted by the wrong leaders of the church, others by the Eparchian.
The earliest of the believers, which managed the arrival body consisting of the chaplain assistants, said in July, with a warning that the erosion “treats to translate expenses” to the meeting of the believers, although the meeting did not participate in the renting of architects and adolescents sent by the erophia.
Some arrival complained of the absence of transparency by the part of the Epriea.
The shark wounded a 13-year-old boy during a divorce to catch lobsters in California.
Saturday the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who hunted lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the season of the catch of lobsters.
The attack took place about 7 a.m. next to the Beach Beach in Encinites.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that Saturday morning he had been dealing with his friends for half an hour when he heard the boy screaming, asking for help, and then swiming with the rest to help get him out of the water.
At first, Hamel thought that it was just an excitement from the catch of lobsters, but then he realized that something wrong happened, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
"All of his key was broken," said Hamel, adding that he noticed it when he approached the boy.
I cried out of the water, "The water is near the shark!", said Hamel.
The boy was transported into the air to Raidy's child hospital in San Diego, where he's critical.
The diversity of the shark that attacked is unknown.
The saving Captain Larry Giles said to the media's briefing that the shark was noticed in this place a few weeks earlier, but it was decided that this was a safe diversity.
Giles added that the victims had been injured by the upper part of the tul's.
The reasons have closed the beach approaches from Ponta Beach in Cassablad to Swama in Esinitas for 48 hours to investigate and for security.
Giles said that more than 135 sharks live in this area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to advance on the British beauty market
Sainsbury's going to work with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams, opening up departments with beauty goods in universities where specialists will be trained.
In a considerable promotion of the British beauty market with a removal of 2.8 billion pounds of stellings, which continues to grow, while volumes of sale of fashion clothing and households are declined, more major ladies of beauty will be presented in 11 salons throughout the country and also in other new salons in the next year that demonstrate success.
Beautiful investments come because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill a place on the police that were previously busy with television, microwave caves and house stores.
Sainsbury's said that it would double the volume of beauty goods, offering up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, that will appear for the first time.
The existing alternate of L'Oreal, Mogelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more room in firm departments like that that can be found in stores like boots.
Big shops also restart their Boutique cosmetics line, so most of the products will be suitable for vegans, and this trend is getting more demanded among young buyers.
Besides, the Fragrance Shop shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Cryden in southern London, and the second will be opened in Sali Oak (Birmingham) at the end of this year.
Shopping on the Internet and moving to buy small foods every day in local stores near the house leads to a better job to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Coope, executing Sainsbury's director, said that trade points would be more like university, because the network of supermarkets is trying to compete with Aldi's discriminators, Lidl, using a large number of services and retail goods.
Sainsbury's placed the Argos trade points in hundreds of shops, and placed several Habitats since two years ago acquired both networks which, he said, contributed to the growth of sales of food and made acquiring more profitable.
The previous attempt of supermarkets to reconstruct their beauty and applet departments has failed successfully.
Sainsbury's protested a combined company from Boots in early 2000s, but attempting to divide the revenues from the shops ended after a series of processing in supermarkets.
The new strategy appeared after three years ago Sainsbury's sold her pharmaceutical business together with 281 shop Celesio owner of Lloyds Pharmacy for 125 million pounds of sterning.
It was declared that Lloyds played his role in this plan, expanding the luxurious brands for the care of the skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, a commercial director of Sainsbury's, said, "We have changed the appearance of our beauty salons to improve the conditions for our clients.
We also invested in training our employees who can offer their recommendations.
Our brands are developed with any need, and the attractive environment and the comfortable position make us a better beauty house that resists the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones broke up after Holly Willowbi quit the deal for 11 million pounds of steerlings.
The star of Dragons Den Peters Jones broke up after Holly's television Halli Willowby gave up a deal for 11 million pounds of stellings from his brand, which specializes in the image of life to concentrate on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
There's no time for a brand of goods for the house and accessors True.
Business couples became like a brand of Guinea Peters Goop.
This morning, the 37-year-old leader announced in Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willovbi left the star of Dragon's Dan Peter Jones, who is now breaking up with his profit business on the creation of brand clothes to concentrate on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources report that Jones was excited when the golden girl's television confessed during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow (Bakingemshire), that her new transactions were up to 1,5 million pounds of steerlings mean that she would no longer have enough time to deal with household goods and accessors of the Truely brand.
Business was like a brand of Guinea Peters Goop and was doubled to double the prosperity of Willovbi in 11 million pounds of steerlings.
When the 37-year-old Willowbi announced in Instagram that she was leaving True, Jones left Britain and left one of her homes.
The source reported: True was the main priority of Holly.
It appeared to her long-term future, which she saw in a few decades.
Her decision to refuse left all the participants absolutely shocked.
Nobody wanted to believe what happened Tuesday, and it had to start dinner very soon.
The headquarters of Marlow have a warehouse full of goods ready to sell.
Experts suspect that the care of the leading this Morning, which belongs to the number of most significant British stars, could cost millions of companies because of the huge investments in different goods -- from pillows and candles to clothes and households, as well as for possible further delays with their implementation.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of Trich Willovbi and husband Dan Boldwin were close to Jones and his wife Tara Cape for ten years.
Willovbi founded True & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the president's position in March.
The couple rests together, and Jones owns a 40-percent part in the Baldwin TV.
Willowbi will be a representative of the M&S Brand and replace Aunt McPartlin as the leading ITV "I am famous."
Last night, the source near Jones said, "We won't comment on his case."
Honest conversation: "We fell in love"
He was joking about the criticism that he received from the media for his comment, which is considered "non-President" because he was positive about the North Korean leader.
Why does President Tramp deny a lot of things?
Tramp said in his familiar "dictional" voice.
"I don't deny anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore was declared Tramp as a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on the denuclearization came to a trap.
Three months after the June Summit in Singapore, leading North Korea Lee En Ho declared a world leader at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North was not expected by the “reasonable Wests” of the United States in response to the previous steps of North Korea in the field of disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues to apply the sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Tramp took a much more optimistic position in his speech.
"We are very successful in building relationships with North Korea," he said.
"All could end with the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have good bonds."
He said that his efforts to improve their relationships with Kim had brought positive results: completion of missile trials, helping to release hostages and returning the remains of American soldiers home.
And he defended his unusual approach in the conversation with Kim.
"Being on the side of the president's very easy, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this overloaded orain, we'll already have about 200 people there," said Tramp, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia have destroyed the islands, hundreds of people died.
For example, after the earthquake in the U. Lambock, foreign non-governmental organizations said they were unnecessary.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lamboc population were moved, no national disaster was announced, which is an essential condition to provide international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were understanding that they were not approaching international assistance, so it was a little hard," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although the Children Save the Children's Rescue Fund and collects a team to travel to Palo until it understands whether foreign workers can work in place.
Mr. Sutopa, a representative of the National Agency for Combating Stuffs, said that Indian officials evaluate the situation in Palo to find out whether the international agency would be allowed to assist.
Despite the earthquakes that always survives Indonesia, the country is still well prepared for the surprises of nature.
While in the Ashes were built shelters, in other coast settlements they were almost gone.
The apparent lack of siren to warn about tsunami in Paul led to a larger number of victims, although warning was.
Even in the best times, the movement between Indonesia's many islands was a difficult challenge.
And the stiff disasters complicated the movement logistics.
The hospital ship, which was located on W. Lambock to treat the victims of the earthquake, is approaching Palo, but the way to the new place of disaster will take at least three days.
President Jocca Videod focused on his preferred company to improve the Indonesian destructive infrastructure and spent the money on car roads and railways.
But the lack of finance has been persecuted by the Jocques administration because next year there will be new choices.
Mr. Jocca is also facing the pressure of continuous inter-conference tension in Indonesia, where Muslims are taking more conservative Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes when Christian and muslim gangs were fighting on the streets, using machetes, ports and shootings and other cold weapons.

The parliamentary statue of Cromwell has become the last vegetable strike in the case of history overwriting.
His removal would be a poetical justice for his similar to the Taliban destruction of many cultural and religious artifacts of England, made by his fanatic puritanian followers.
"But the Cromwell Company described Mr. Krick's proposal as "bullshit" and "a try to overwrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Company, said: In the course of the present debate on the demant of the statue was inevitable that the monument of Oliver Cromwell near the Westminster Palace will be the object of these actions.
The Iconship of English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the poor Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The bright representation of Mr. William Ham Thornicroft about Cromwell is a testimony of the 19th century's thought and part of the history of the act, which many believe should be respected before.
Mr. Goldsmith stated the Sunday Telegraph: "Mnogi people know Cromwell from the end of the 19th century better than today as a parliamentist against external pressure, in his case it was monarchy.
Is this an exact presentation, the subject of the long-term historical debate?
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is a individually recognised figure representing one of the sides of this conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to mark and respect them."
The pig-slayer defeated a Chinese farmer's death.
According to the local media, the farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in the Southwest China market.
"The man known only by his name -- Yuan, was found dead with a broken arteries and bleeding blood, next to the berth in the market of Lupania in Guyjjjov," said the South China Post newspaper on Sunday.
The pencil was prepared to introduce a pig vaccine into the pig on 30 May 2005 in Sinin in the Chinese Province of Cinghai.
As he reported, he and his cousin in Wednesday came from the neighbouring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw the door to the neighbouring pen open.
He said that in the pig there was a big bowl with a blood on the tissue.
According to the report, the medical and judicial expertise confirmed that a farmer's 550-kilo-kilogramatic knife was denied.
"My cousin's legs were discovered and damaged," said the cousin of the name Woo (under the quote of Guiyang Evening News).
The video from the camera showed that Yuan went to the market on Thursday at 04:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal who killed a man was not belonging to Juan or his cousin.
The market manager reported the Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent an attack on anyone else, while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
According to the messages, the Yuan family and the market administration are talking about compensation for his death.
Although when pigs attack people, they are rare, but they have been before.
Yes, in 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, which resulted in serious trauma.
Ten years earlier, a pound of 650 pounds before a pig was weighted, the Valian farmer pressed to her tractor and kept it so long as his wife scared the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoby said CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but the taste of blood can act like a desert.
"They're just playing.
They're curious and very questionable... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You should just give them the right amount of respect," he said.
The remains of the enemy, Rose, will bring strong rains to the southwest of the United States.
According to forecasts, the rose hurricane is weaker because it's moving over more cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the next days, Rose will bring floods in northern Mexico and southwest of the United States.
The rose speed, the hurricane of 1 category, was 85 miles/hour at 5 o'clock in the east of Sunday, and it was fixed in 385 miles southwest of Punta Euchenia in Mexico.
"Rose," expected to go north Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific, there is a low pressure area that moves east to the west coast of the United States. If on Monday Rosa approaches the Single California halfway, as a tropical storm, it will start pushing the deep tropical moisture to the north, southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rose will bring in some parts of Mexico up to 10 inches of fall.
Then the tropical moisture, which interactions with a low pressure area, in the nearest days, will cause strong lions in the southern west.
Places between 1 and 4 inches of fall will cause dangerous sudden floods, seaflows, and possible breaks in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to the number of falls of places to reach two or three inches an hour, especially in some areas of South Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the northwest, especially in the largest part of Arizona, it is expected from 2 to 4 inches of fall.
Because of the disgrouped tropical rain parts, there's possible sudden flood if the conditions are rapidly worsening.
It would be very unwanted to go to the desert walk because of the possibility of a threat of tropical falls.
Strong rain can lead to the converting of horses into rainfalling rivers, and rain will be followed by a drilled wind and dust.
The low pressure area will bring a strong rain in the South California coast.
Possible dull falls more than half inch can lead to a slight flow of garbage and make slippery roads.
That'll be the first flood in the rain season.
Some dissolved tropical rains will start getting closer to Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday before the rain goes everywhere at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The strong rain will be spreading in the neighborhood of four corners on Tuesday and going to go to Wednesday.
In October, there can be strong temperature eradications in the United States because the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropicals remain pretty warm.
Sometimes this leads to a rare temperature change soon.
There's a good example of sharp temperature in the U.S. central part in Sunday.
Between Kansas-Siti, Missouri, and Amahai, Nebraska, St. Louis and De Moinem (Ayowa), the temperature difference is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days the summer warmth will try to increase and expand again.
It is expected that many central and eastern states of America will start a warm October with the temperature of 80 degrees -- from the Southern Levels to the part of the North East.
The temperature in New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern part of the United States until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people were watching Brett Kawana's hearing.
More than 20 million people on six television networks looked at interesting witness statements on Thursday in the Supreme Court on the case between Brett Caven and Christine Blacey Ford, who accused him of sexual violence, which was supposedly happening in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political opposition continues, the lecturers interrupted their regular programs for emergency news on Friday: the agreement developed by the Arizonan Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI: it was to conduct a weekly prosecution investigation.
Ford told the Senatic Court Bureau that she was 100% confident that the drunken Kavanah grabbed her and tried to get her out of her clothes at the high school party.
In his hot testimony, Cavanaugh said that 100% was sure that it wasn't.
More than 20.4 million people who were reported by Nelsen on Friday were looking at him.
The company calculated the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data were not immediately available for other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nelsen's company usually has a problem with the assessment of people looking at TV in offices.
For comparison: The size of the public is the same as when playing a playoff or the Oscar prize.
"The Fox News Canal, whose experts firmly supported the appointment of Cavanaugh, managed all networks in the average of 5,69 million viewers throughout the day," said Nelsen.
ABC took a second place with 3.26 million viewers.
“CBS had 3.1 million, NBC - 2.94 million, MSNBC - 2.89 million, and CNN - 2.2 million," Nelsen said.
The interest remained high and after hearing.
Flake was the main figure of the drama on Friday.
After the office of the deceased republican published a statement that he would vote in support of Cavan, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning when the protesters screamed at his address and when he was trying to lift up on the elevator at the hearing in the Court Bureau.
He stood with his eyes scratched for a few minutes when he was beaten, and it was transmitted in the direct air on the CNN channel.
"I'm standing right here before you," said one woman.
'Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?'
He was told, "You have power, but many women are free of it."
Flake said that his office published a statement, and told him before the elevator closed that he had something else to say at the hearing in the Bureau.
All cable and satellite networks had a broadcast for a few hours when the Court Committee had to vote on the issue of the selection of Kwana's candidature at the Senate Quarter.
But Flake said that he would only know that the FBI would consider the prosecution against the candidate next week, which the democrats call on a number of minorities.
Flake was convinced partly by talking to his friend, Senator Chris Kunso.
After talking to Kuns and several Senators, Flake made a decision.
The choice of Flake was strong, because it was obvious that the Republicans would have no votes to confirm Cavanaugh without investigation.
President Tramp started an investigation of charges against Kawana at the FBI.
Prime Minister of Britain Mae accuses criticism in the game of politics because of the Brexcite
During the survey of the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Teresa May accused the criticism that she planned to leave the European Union, that they were playing politics with the future of Britain and undermine national interferences.
The Prime Minister of Britain, Teresa May, arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in British Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In one of the interviews next to her on the first page of the newspaper was her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, who spoke against her so-called "shully" plan on Brexity, saying that the suggestion was that Britain and the EC had the only tariffs, was "seven absurd".
The police arrested the suspect of the death of the LSU Daytaon Simpson.
The police arrested the suspect of a fatal shot at Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketballist from the Louisian University team.
"The 20-year-old Daytaon Simpson was arrested and placed in prison for a second-scale murder," said the Baton Rouge Police Guide.
The facts showed a video about the shooting between Simms and Simpson, and the police said that Simms lost his glasses during the shooting.
"The police took the glasses from the scene and said they found the DNA of Simpson," WAFB, CBS branch.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police said that he confessed to a deadly shot at Wade.
"The bet cost is set at $350 000 level," said Advocate.
The next office of Eastern Botton-Rose published the previous report on Friday, which was said that the cause of death was a firewound in the head and neck.
The Department of the Operational Police Department of Louisiana, the Criminal Police Lab, the Southern University police are asking for help from the inhabitants of the district in the investigation that would contribute to arrest.
The sports director of the Louisian University, Joe Alev, thanked the law enforcement authorities of the district for “authority and pursuit of justice”.
Sims was only 20 years old.
As he grew up six feet, he grew up in Baton Rose, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the Louisian University team.
In the middle of the last season, he collected 5.6 points, 2.6 game packagings.
On Friday morning, a basketball team trainer at the Louisian University, Will Wade, said that the team was "destroyed" and "in shock" from Wade's death.
"This is what I'm always worried about," said Wade.
Vulcan explodes ashes in Mexico
Ashes, erupted by the Papacathepetle volcano, reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Stuff Disaster Warning Saturday suggested the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed the activity and for 24 hours, 183 cases of gas and ashes were registered.
The center had a hearing knocking and felt a push.
The pictures in social networks showed that in the circles of Mexico, such as the Sachille, there are thin layers of populous covering on a car wind glass.
Geophysics noticed the increase in volcano activity, which is 45 miles (72 miles) from the south-east capital after the earthquake of 7.1 in Mexico's central part in September 2017.
The Vulcan, known as Dongoya, has been active since 1994.
Confrontation of police with catalonic separatists on the preceding voting anniversary for independence
On Saturday in Barcelona, six people were arrested after the advocates of independence encountered the police in public order, and thousands of others joined the demonstration in noteing the first anniversary of the polyrisical vote in Catalonia.
The group of separatists in masks, keeping the police from protecting the public order, cast them with eggs and blossed with powder painting, creating dark dust clouds on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Later that day, the fights exploded when the police used their dabs to keep the demonstrators.
During a few hours of fighting for independence that scanned "Don't forget, don't forgive", they encountered present trade union acts shouting, "Live Spain."
According to local press messages, fourteen people have been treated with a slight trauma that has been received during the protest action.
The tension in the region that strikes to independence remains high a year after October 1's referendum, which Madrid recognised as illegal, but noted by the Catalonic Separatists.
The voters in the largest majority preferred independence, although the eye of the voters was low, which was largely explained by the voting balls.
According to the Catholic authorities, nearly 1,000 people were wounded in summer after the police tried to stop voting at the election stations around the region as a result of the acts of angry demonstrators.
The independence groups spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations from supporting the national police of Spain.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to go the other way.
68-year-old Narciss Termes, an electricist who is present at a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer trusts in the prospects of acquiring Catalonia's independence.
"We've been through one of the best moments this summer.
I saw my parents crying for joy when they could vote, but now we're tired," he said.
Despite the vital, but slightly victory in regional elections in December last year, the catalon parties who act for independence tried to keep the impulse this year with many of their most famous leaders and turned out either in a voluntary exile, or in prison, waiting for a court for a referendum and the next announcement of independence.
42-year-old Jean Pooch, who recorded a protest in support of the police on the phone, said that the conflict was caused by politics on both sides.
"It's getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Junkeras, one of the nine Catholic leaders who have been in SISA since the end of the last year, announced that they would participate in elections in the European Parliament next year.
"The selection as a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic preciousness and repressions that we have seen by the Government of Spain," he said.
Londoners: Men are arrested after they smashed the house on the car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39 years, were arrested after their car repeatedly cut into a house in London.
The incident happened on Thursday around 19:30 by British.
Detective inspector Bob Blammings said that the gate was damaged and the building itself.
Perhaps at some point a bullet was released in the car.
As a result of the Mang Levingston hit, he wins Rangers with 1:0
The first goal of Deli Manghi for Levingstan provided them with victory
Success of Levingstone shocked Rangers, and it was enough to appoint Steven Gerard after him a few losses in 18 games at the position of the manager of the Ibrox Club.
The blow of Dolly Mangy was great because Gary Holt risen for one level with Hibernian in the second division.
Gerard's team in this season won't win on the premier lie and next Sunday meet the leaders, the Harts team, which stands at eight points.
By this time, the Reigers in the League of Europe takes the Rapid Vienna on Thursday.
Levingstan, meanwhile, continued his playless series in the division to six games, and the chief coach Holt still defeated after Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Levingstan misss the chances because of rude visitors
Holt's team was supposed to be in front of a long time before they killed, but that's the direction of the Rangers calls.
Scott Robinson broke down, but he lost his chance to kill at the gate, and then Alan Litg could only direct his efforts wider to meet Craig Halkett's hit.
The hosts were happy to allow Rangers to play before them, knowing that they could disturb the guests at some point.
And that's how the main goal was achieved.
The Rangers was allowed to hit, and Levingstone sent a debate, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to overcome Menga, who had posted and killed from the center of the field.
Until that moment Rangers was dominated, but it turned out that the protection of the team was inappropriate, and Liam Caley's locker was almost not activated
The same was going on in the afternoon, although Alfred Marrelas really saved Kelly.
The ball was shot by Scott Pittman by the Rangers locker Alan McGregor, and the Lithuanian was far away from the second Livingstone network.
The balls were constantly hit by the gate of Levingston and were stabbed, while two tools demands, after Halket was called to replace Glenn Midlton, and the penalty for the game was rejected.
The phenomenon of Levingstan – Analysis
BBC journalist Scotland Alesdale Lamont at Arena Tony Macaroni
Fenomenal productivity and results for Levingstan.
For men they were wonderful, continuing the excellent expectations on this outward trajectory.
Their style of the game and the storage were practically not changed since they returned to the highest eshalon, but it was worth giving the proper Holt for how he encouraged the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
The captain Halket was great, exploding well-organized protection, while Mengo kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warrall everywhere in the field.
Rangers didn't get an inspiration.
No matter what good they were at Gerard, they did not comply with that standard.
In the last match they didn't own, only once killed in the gate, which was something like an alarming call for Rangers, which was found in the middle of the list.
Mixed Behavior to Erdan in Kölne
Saturday, on September 29, there were smiles, and there were irregular floods when Turkish leaders and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdagan to Germany, directed to renew the relationship between NATO allies.
They argued with human rights, press freedom and accession of Turkey to the EC.
Erdagan went to Köln to open a new giant ball.
This city has the largest number of Turkish populations outside Turkey.
The police were rescued to a security persuasion so as to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the ball, but there were a lot of followers around here to see their president.
A hundreds of protesting against Erdagan, many of whom were the Kurds, also expressed their opinion, condemning both the politics of Erdagan and the decision of the Government of Germany to welcome him to the country.
Protests for and against reflect the distinctions of the guest, one of the German Turks was pronounced as a hero, and others were convicted as a autocrat.

Long-Lartin prison: Six employees were wounded during a mess
"Six prison officials have been wounded as a result of a strict regime in prison for men," said the Penitencian administration.
The disturbances exploded in the Long Lartin prison in Wostershire around 9:30 by British time on Sunday and continues before.
In order to combat the disorders in which they participate in the same wing of eight prisoners, a group of Tornado was attracted.
At the scene, workers were treated with tiny traumas.
The representative of the Penitentiary Service said: "The specially trained prison personnel was directed to combat those who had committed a mess in Long Lartin prison.
Six employees have been treated after getting a trauma.
We will not endure violence in our prisons, and it is understandable that the guilty will be transferred to the police and can spend more time outside the retards."
The Royal Long Lartin prison contains more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison chief was treated in the hospital after the prisoner was attacked.
And in October last year, police officers were called to prison to deal with serious rumors, during which the workers were attacked with balls for the waterpool.
Rosa's hurricane threatens the city of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with strong floods (which may be useful for dry regions)
Trapical enemy rarely happens in Arizona, but that's exactly what can happen at the beginning of the next week, because there are traces of the Roose enemy in the south-west part of the desert that creates the risk of sudden floods.
On Monday and Tuesday, the National Meteorological Service published information about sudden floods in West Arizona and south and eastern Nevada, South Eastern California and Ute, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Los Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go through Phoenix on Tuesday, near the rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that “the only ten tropical cyclones brought a tropical storm or a pressure fall within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
"Catrina" (1967) was an enemy in 40 miles from the border with the state of Arizona."
The latest model of the National Centre of enemy projects a drop of two to four inches, and the level in different places can reach six inches in the area of Magalon in Arizona.
In other neighborhoods of the southwest of the desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basey, it is likely to fall from 1 to 2 inch, with individual values can reach 4 inches.
For those outside the risk of sudden flood, the hurricane of Rose could be long-expected because their region suffers from drought.
While the flood is a very serious problem, some of these falls are likely to be useful, for in the southwest is now observed droughts.
According to the American Drought Monitoring Agency, at least a little more than 40 percent of the Arizona territory experiences an extreme drought of another category," said the weather.com.
First of all, the hurricane of Rosa leads to full-ups in the Mexican half-shore, Lower California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind at 85 miles per hour in 385 miles south of Punta Euchenia in Mexico, moving north with a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm faces colder waters in the Pacific, so it's quiet.
So it is expected that in Mexico, when a tropical storm comes, a river's exit from the coasts on Monday or evening.
The falls in different parts of Mexico may be strong, which will create a significant risk of diving.
"The total amount of falls from 3 to 6 inches from Low California to northwest Sallara, where possible falls up to 10 inches," reports weather.com.
Then the rose will move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the borders of the Arizona early in Tuesday in a tropical event of pressure, which will then continue through the Arizona and the southern part of the Utah state to the Tuesday night.
"The main danger is expected from the "Rose" or its remains, it is very strong rain in Low California and northwest of Sanora and Southwestern Desert of the United States," said the National Centre of Urban.
These rains are expected to lead to dangerous lives and sudden floods and rural streams and crawls in the mountains.
Attack to Midsamer Norton: four attempts to arrest killers
Three teenager boys and 20-year-old boys were arrested under suspicion of attempting to kill after finding a 16-year-old body with a bunch of injuries to Summerset.
Three teenager boys were found injured in the area of Terrace Excelsier at Midsamer Norton about 4 o'clock Saturday.
He was delivered to a hospital where he remains in a stable state.
"The 17-year-old boy and both others, 18 and 20, were arrested at night in the area of Redstock, Avon and Summerset," said the police.
The police contacted anyone who could have any evidence on the mobile phone of what happened to move forward in their search.
"The café is accumulated by the democratic Party's ruth and anger," said Tramp.
"The voting for Judge Cavano is a vote for the abolition of the vulnerable and disagreeable tactics of the Democratic Party," said Tramp on the Viling rail, East Virginia.
Tramp stated that Cavano was "patient from anger and anger" of the Democratic Party in the process of his selection to post.
Cavanno gave evidence to the Congress on Thursday, intense and emotional denying the accusations of Christine Blacey Ford that he sexually violated her for decades when they were still teenagers.
Ford also gave evidence during the hearing of her accusations.
On Saturday, the President stated that "the Americans saw a brilliant, quality and courageous nature this day" Cavano.
"The voice in support of Judge Cavano is a voice for one of the most perfect experts in the field of the right of our time, a lawyer with a great story of state service," he said, "the crowd of Western Virginia's followers.
The president was referring to Cavano's choice, talking about the importance of the Republicans during the period of interim elections.
"Five weeks left to one of the most main choices of our time.
I'm not just late, but I'm really late," he answered.
"That's why I'm fighting for big candidates everywhere."
The tramp is disagreeable that the Democrats are intending to "confront and prevent".
"The first key voting at the senate level of selecting Kavano is expected to happen not later than Friday," said the senior parliamentary assistant CNN.
Thousands of people were killed as a result of earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number of victims grows
"A least 384 people were killed, many have disappeared as a result of the influx of giant waves on the beaches when the Indian island of Sulavesa began a major earthquake and tsunami," stated the Saturday authorities.
A hundred people gathered to the beach festival in Palo on Friday, when the waves were six feet high, 18 feet, fighting about the shore in the darkness, killing many to death and destroying everything on their way.
Following the earthquake of 7.5 happened to tsunami.
"When a tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not escape immediately, and they became victims," said the briefing in Jacarda, a press secretary of the Indonesian Agency for the Elimination of Disasters, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
"The tsunami dragged cars, beeded, houses, hitting everything about the ground," said Nugroho, adding that tsunami went through the open sea at 800 km/h (up to 497 miles/h) before the beach line hit.
He said that some people survived only because they climbed trees to escape from tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in the 24 Palo center.
The airports published by the Stuff Disaster Agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, the bridges were rotating and falling and the ball was surrounded by water.
The next strikes continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes took place in the area with 2,4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy generated on Friday as a result of a strong earthquake is about 200 times higher than the power of the nuclear bomb deployed in Hirasim in World War II.
According to his data, the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow cove, could increase the tsunami size.
Nugrocha called the damage "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, trade centres and hotels were destroyed.
He said the bodies of some victims were found under fractures of destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were wounded, and 29 were lost without news.
"The barriers and pity can be larger along the coast line of 300 miles (190 miles) north of Palo, the area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake," said Nugroha.
The communication in Dongal was "what was completely damaged," said Nugroch.
"There are more than 300,000 people," says the Red Cross statement, adding that his employees and volunteers were sent to suffered territories.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting tsunamis in Paul, but the officials stated that the waves were coming when the warning was made.
In amateur photos published in social networks, you can hear a man on the top of the building crying desperately to people on the street of warning about the coming tsunami.
In a few minutes the wall of water fell to the shore, dragging buildings and cars behind it.
Reuters couldn't immediately confirm the validity of the material taken away.
The earthquakes and tsunamis have caused a serious shutdown of electricity that violated communications around Paul, so the government was hard to mention rescue.
According to the authorities, the soldiers began to direct cargo planes by using Jacarda and other cities, but the evacuated still very needed food and other items of the first need.
The city's airport was only opened to help and would be closed until October.
On Sunday, President Jocques Video planned to visit the evacuation centres in Palo.
As a result of tsunami in Indonesia, more than 800 people lost
It's very bad.
"While World Vision staff from Dungala successfully reached the city of Paul, where the workers hide in brizent hiding placed in their office courts, on the road they saw the scene of desolation," said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me that they saw a lot of ruined houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when the help groups started the darkness of the execution mechanisms in disasters, some complained that foreign employees who have deep notices prevented them from traveling to Palo.
According to the Indonesian rule, financing, delivery, and personnel outside the borders can start to come only if the scene of disaster is announced by a national disaster zone.
That's not what happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, a press secretary of the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we will be able to open for international assistance, but this status is not yet.
On the other night in Palo, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family disappeared without news hoped that their close miracles would be among those who would leave the unhappy story lines of stiff disasters.
On Saturday the little boy was released from the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescue officers released a woman who was under ruins two days, and she was next to her body of her child.
Hendon Subandon, an Indonesian national team trainer for paraplanerism, prepared two of the missing paraplants for the Asian games that were completed early this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including others who were trapped in Roa Roa Roa, were his disciples.
"As older in paraplanerism I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told him as a few hours after the news of the destruction of Roa Roa Roa Roa's hotel, he desperately sent messages to the WhatsApp participants of the Palu, who were at the beach festival.
His messages were, however, marked with one grey scrap instead of two blue.
"That means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while the banks were filled in Newport on Levi
"The thief stolen 26,750 dollars on Friday morning from Brink's employee, who was investing banknotes in Newport in Libya," reports the Newport Police Department press release.
"The car driver dropped a bankmat in a fun complex and was prepared to deliver more money," wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the relief.
As long as he was busy, another man'd run away from Brink's employee, and stole the fur with money intended for delivery.
According to the message, the witnesses noticed a number of suspects who left the scene, but the police did not correct the number of incidents.
Anyone who has information about them should contact the Newport police on the phone 859-292-3680.
Kaney West: Reper changes its name to Ye ("y").
Reper Kaney West changes its name to Ye.
When he announced a name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, I'm officially known as Kaney West.
West, 41, namely Ye, used this alias as a name for his eighth album, which came out in June.
Changes take place at the time of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he expected to run his new Yandhi album.
He replaces Ariana Grande's singing with a show that has changed for "emotional reasons," said the author of the show.
The rate of reducing his current professional name West used to say that this word has a religious significance for him.
I believe that "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it's you," West said early this year, discussing the name of the album with the Big Boy Radio.
So, I'm you, I'm - it's us, all this is - we
This came from Kaney, which means "one" to just Ye" -- the reflection of our good, our bad, our destruction, all.
Album is more reflective of who we are.
He's one of the most famous rapers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was differently known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he was headed to love and Brother Love.
Former West's employee, Jay-Ze, was also doing no connections or in the main letters.
MALLO in Mexico promises not to use the army against peaceful residents
The electoral president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Abrador never uses military force against civilian population because the country is approaching 50 years from the day of bloody reprises against students.
On Saturday, at the Square of Tlatelolco Plaza Lopez, Abrador "will never use the military to bring back the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot a peaceful demonstration on the Square, resulting from about 300 deaths, while the left student movements were punished throughout Latin America.
Lopez Abrador was both supporting young Mexicans, issueing monthly subsidies to the students, opening more free places at state universities.
"Young people are attracted to criminal groups, and the absence of educational opportunities," he said.
U.S. must double funding for machine intelligence
"As China becomes increasingly active in the area of the machine intellect, the United States should double the amount they're expensing for research in this area," said the investor and a machine intelligence specialist in Kai-Fu Lee who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments showed up after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about us, even if there is no U.S.M.'s official strategy.
Meanwhile, last year, China presented its plan: by 2030, he's trying to be the first innovation in the M.I.
"Dibling the budget for research in the area would be a good start, given that all the other countries are standing away from the United States, and we are expecting another breakthrough in the MI area," said Lee.
"The double of funding may double the probability that the next major achievement of the MI will be achieved in the United States," stated Lee at the CNBC in this week's interview.
Lee, whose book "Overcome Machine Intellect: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published in this month by Hawton Mifflin Harkurt, is the chief executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most famous MS companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s, he was working on a machine intellectual system that defeated the most highly equipped American Athelo player, and later he was the head of Microsoft Research and the President of the Chinese Department of Google in China.
Lee acknowledged the previous U.S. government technological competitives, such as the Agency's Professional Research Project in the field of defence, and asked if the next thing would be to help identify the next transparency.
"U.S. researchers often have a lot to work to get government grants," said Lee.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders; it's corporate," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have recently hired lights from the Universitys to work on ME.
Lee said that the change in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of machine intelligence (MI).
"In my opinion, green cards should be offered automatically by the candidate in the MI branch," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China launched an engine intellectual development plan for the next generation.
"The National Fund of Natural Sciences of China offers funding to people in educational institutions, just as the National Science Fund and other state organizations allocate money to US researchers, but the quality of the academic work in China below," said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence created the United Centre of Machine Intellect, where partners from industrial and scientific wheels should be involved, and the White House announced the creation of the Special Intelligence Bureau on Machine Intellect.
And this month, the Agency for Final Research Project, in the field of defence, announced investments of $2 billion called AI Next.
As to the National Scientific Organization (NSF), it is currently investing in more than 100 million dollars a year.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation, which was trying to create the National Security Commission on Machine Intelligence, has not observed action for months.
Macedonians vote on a referendum about the country's name change
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum to change their name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, allowing us to resolve a ten-year dispute with Greece, which blocked applications for participation in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has Macedonian province, claims that the name of her northern neighbour is an claim to its territory, and put a vet on joining NATO and EC.
In June, both governments made a deal with the proposed new title, but nationalists claim that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian population of Macedonia.
President Georgie Ivanov said that he would not vote in a referendum, and the bajkot company questioned whether the voters would match a minimum of 50 percent necessary to conduct a referendum.
The voting question at the referendum suggests: "You are for membership in NATA and the EC with a agreement with Greece."
A change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claims that this is a cost worth paying for the acceptance of such bodies as the EC and NATA of Macedonia, one of the countries that appeared after Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they could live freely under the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgievski, 79 years old, Skopje.
Although this is not an obligatory legal force, enough members of the parliament stated that they would consider the results of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change requires more than two thirds of the parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations were received until 1 hour of the day.
However, the eye was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the recent parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters were voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said a 62-year-old voter in the capital of Skopje Jose Tanewski.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zariza and his son Dush voted for a referendum in Macedonia, dedicated to the change of the name of the country that opens the way for her accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Cavardarkov, 54 years old, he prepared a small scene and layed chairs in front of the tents installed by those who would play a referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to merge with the heads raised rather than through the official door," said the Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have the honour."
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can contact others, like China and Russia, and become part of the European integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATA's friendship would bring necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment level was more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the largest amount will be "for" because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and NATA," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the result of yes would be "the confirmation of our future."
The study published by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research last Monday says that the referendum will take part from 30 to 43 percent of the voters, which is below the necessary egg.
Another survey conducted by Macedonia's Telephone showed 57 percent of the inquiries that planned to vote Sunday.
70 percent of them said they voted yes.
For a successful referendum, the eye must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure in the referendum will be the first serious hit on the cross-border government policy since its arrival last May.
See: Sergio Aguera from Manchester City goes to the gate through all the protection of Brayton
On Saturday, Sergio Aguera and Rahim Sterling solved the problem with the protection of Brian by the Manchester City victory, number 2:0 at the Etihad stage in Manchester, England.
And at the 65th minute, Aguera easily did it.
The Argentine attacker got a post in the center of the field.
He raced between the three brayton defenders before hitting the open field.
Then Aguera turned out to be among the four green shirts.
He went around one defender and pipped a few more on the edge of the British field.
Then he pushed the trap on the left flag by finding Sterling.
The English attacking the first touch in the fine ball of Aguera, who used his right struck to cross the brayton barrier by hitting Matthew Ryan on the right side of the net.
"Aguera has some problems with legs," said the journalist's head of Pep Guardiolo.
"We talked about how he was playing 55, 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were lucky he killed goal at the same moment."
But it's Sky Blue's Shirling gave the initial advantage of fighting in the Prime League.
This goal took place for 29 minutes.
Aguera got this ball deep in the Bryton territory.
He sent the beauty ball through the left flang to Lerois Sane.
Sean made a few touches before Sterling could reach the farer stamp.
The Sky Blues attacked the ball before he jumped outside.

Shercer wants to play the role of "separating points" against Rocky
After the Nationals were excluded from competitions in the playoff, there was no special reason to paint a new start.
But constantly competitive Sherther hopes to take a hit on Sunday against the Colorade of Rocky, but only when there will still be the consequences of the playoff for Rocky, who remain in the leaders after one game with Los Angeles Dodgers in the Northwest.
The years conquered at least a single place with 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to get their first title in the division.
"If we play just so, at least we can deal with the situation, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, will be composed of it that the game will probably be at the highest level of all I've encountered this year.
Why wouldn't I compete in this?
The Nationals have not announced the start for Sunday, but reportedly they are inclined to give Shercer the ball in such a situation.
Sherther, who was going to do his 34th start, held a session on Thursday and will be on Sunday at normal rest.

Tramp speaks in Western Virginia
The president directed the situation around his choice of the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano, saying the importance of the phenomenon of the Republicans at the interim elections.
"All we have done is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It's one of the great, big-- I'm not late, but really late, so I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Tramp went on, "You see this horrible, horrible Democratic radical group, you see what's going on right now.
And they are determined to restore power, using any necessary means, you see, is sulphur, irritation.
They don't care who they're offending, whom they have to kill to get power and control, that's what they want, the power and control that we don't want to give them."
He said that the democrats intend to "confront and prevent."
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "wicked, rude, contrary and liar."
He resurrected to the Senate Court Bureau on the still recognition of the Senator of the Democratic Group, Diana Fainstein, who received a loud assessment from the public.
"Do you remember her answer?
Do you really want to pass the document?
Uh-uh, what.
No, I don't expect it -- it was a very bad non-verbal language -- the worst language I've ever seen."
The work is no longer the basic church.
It's anxiety to those who express their opinion
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted for hurting me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I'm the last one in a number of members of the Parliament from the Leuborist Party who is told that we are not welcomed -- everything to express our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar reversal because she was decisively opposed to antisemitism.
In my case, censorship criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, is ironic about fate, such as questions that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The meeting, which was held on Friday of the Nottingham East Leiborist Party, says that "we want these meetings to be composable and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local member of parliament from the Leburist Party, just such meetings were on Friday
Unfortunately, today, most of the meetings are not the tone of the promise of a "good, more soft" policy forgotten for a long time when it was ever.
It's getting more obvious that in the Leburist party, different views are not accepted, and every opinion is estimated from that perspective, it is pleasant for the party leadership or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, because my colleagues, with whom I used to think I've shared the same political views, began to expect me to take a step back, and they took positions that I wouldn't agree with -- on the issues of national security or on the EU's only market.
Every time I speak publicly -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- in social networks, there's a tide of images in which they call to cancel the elections, condemn the center policy, saying that I'm no longer in the Leiborist Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Really, I know I'm lucky more than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed to me are generally political.
I'm admired by the professionalism and the determination of those colleagues who daily face a stream of sexual or racist work, but they never avoid.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is normalization of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Leibarist Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer an organization that has different views, and with every movement of "sufficiency" or changing the rules of selection of the party, it's getting more narrow.
For the past two years, I was given a lot of advice that called me not to fall in spirit, not to be so loud, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I joined Laborists 32 years ago as a school student caused by preserving the government of Tatcher, which caused my school student to fail at school, I tried to resist the best public services for those who need more than anything -- let it be a local resident or government minister.
I never hid my political views, including the past choices.
No one in Eastern Notingham could get involved in my political positions and disagreement areas with the current leadership.
For those who struggled for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the country is headed to Brexit, which brings damage to the household, business and our state service, I don't understand the desire to waste time and strength to my loyalty to the Leidor Leiborist Party.
But in fact the only message I have is not Nottingham Momentum, it's my voters, whether they'll be members of the Leeberists, or not: I'm proud of serving you, and I promise that no threat to the cancellation of elections will be, and political consent will prevent me from acting in the interests of all of you.

Ir-Melrows 38-17: Invincible IR at the top
Two later attempts may have made some of the final result, but, without doubt, Air earned a triumph in this strangely interesting game of the premier League of Tenant.
Now they're starting a tournament table, one side of ten.
After all, it was their highest protection, just as their best chances that made their masters, coach Peter Murch had the right to be satisfied.
"We have still tried our games so far, and we are still invincible; so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christy from Melrows said, Give the proper Ayra; he dared more than we did.
The 14-minute attempt of Grant Anderson, converted by Fraiser Clime, put Ira in front, but the yellow card for the Scotland cap Rory Hughes, which was received for the Warriors game, allowed Melrowz to jungle with numbers, and Jason Baggott caught up for an unrealized attempt.
The climate stretched Ayra's leadership by using the toolbar before, right at the break, he killed, and then made a soli attempt by making 17-5 Ayra break.
But Melrows well started the second half, and the attempt of Patrick Anderson, converted by the Bogott, reduced resistance to five points.
Then there was a long delay because of a serious trauma of Roorid Nott, which was stretched up, and after the restart Ire made progress on through the attempt of Stafford McDowell, realized by Climates.
Air, performing Captain Blair McFerson's duties, got a yellow card, and again Melrows forced another man to pay through a non-realized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of February.
However, the householders returned, and when Struan Hatchinson got a yellow card for the fact that he slaughtered Climates without a ball from the fine line, McFerson landed behind Ayra.
The climate implemented its attempt that had done again almost after the restart, after Kyle Row got hit by David Armstrong in the fine and sent Gregory's flanger to the fifth attempt of the masters of the field.
Star Still Game seems to be ready for a new career in a restaurant business
However, the star of the Ford Kieran game is going to enter the guest business industry after it turns out he was designed as a director of the licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show, which he writes, and is shooting with a long comedy partner Greg Hamfield.
Duet announced that the next ninth series would be the last in a series of show, and it seems that Kernan plans to act after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kernan was hoping to participate in the blooming trade in Glasgo.
"The sea of ours": Bolivia, who has no exit to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The seamen patrol military headquarters in La Pas.
Civil buildings are under the blue flag.
In the military-sea bases from the lake of Titicac to Amazon, there is a depict of the "The Sea of Our Right."
Realty is our duty.
In all Bolivia, who has no way out to the sea, the memory of the coastal line lost Chile in a bloody conflict because of the resources of the 19th century, is still alive -- as is the attempt to swim again across the Pacific.
These hopes may have reached the maximum top in the past decades, because Bolivia is expecting the international court to be decided for October 1, after five years of discussion.
"Balivia has the impulse, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course she awaits a positive outcome," said the Bolivian diplomat Robert Calsadillia.
Many Bolivians will be watching the MS decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in Gaaza after decades of tense movements will support Bolivia's statement that Chile is obliged to negotiate on the provision of a sovereign exit from the Sea.
Eva Morales is a charismatic President of Bolivia, who faces the opposite struggle for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he crushed at the end of August.
But some analysts think the court will hardly decide for the benefit of Bolivia, and it's little to change, even if it does.
The U.N., based in the Netherlands, has no right to decide on Chile's territory and has stated that it would not determine the origin of possible negotiations.
The opinion of the International Court only exits six months after the final arguments have been considered, indicates that the matter was not "complicated", said Chilean expert in the field of international law, Poz Zarate.
And far away without promoting the case of Bolivia, the last four years may have threw it back.
"The problem of access to the sea was monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Sarat said.
She said that the warrior of Morales lost the remainder of the Chile's goodness.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but then the discussion will be very difficult.
Since 1962, the two countries have not been exchanged by the messengers.
Former President Edward Radrigues Welte, a representative of Bolivia in Haaz, rejected the idea that the decision of the court was unusually quick.
Monday, Bolivia will bring the "exclusive opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "closing the end of 139 years of differences with mutual guess," he said.
Calsadillia also denyed that Marales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the marine problem as a political opposition.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access to the Pacific," he added.
"The establishment is the opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea states that nuclear weapons will not come until they can trust the U.S.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Rie Yong Ho says that his country will never stop using his nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to carry out the promises reached during the summit in Singapore between leaders.
His comments come like the United States, and the Secretary-General Mike Pampea appears to be at the border of the renewal of nuclear tup diplomaty with North Korean Kim Chen Yen more than three months after Singapur.
Ri says it's a "invisible dream" to extend the sanctions and the opposition of the United States against the declaration of the end of war in Korea once put North on their knees.
Washington is afraid to agree with the declaration when Phenyan begins with significant disarmament steps.
And Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Tramp, they need to take the second summit.
But there's a great skepticism about Phenyan being seriously rejected by an arsenal, which is likely to be seen as the only way to guarantee their security.
Pampea plans to visit Phenyan next month to prepare for the second Kim-Tump Summit.
In the Paris fashion show we saw the most new line in the massive main clothes on the way to shops in your cities
If you want to increase your collection of hats or close the sun completely, you can avoid searching again.
Valentino and Thom Brown designers presented a number of unusual main clothings for their SS19 collection, which exceeded the expectation of Paris Fashion Week.
This summer in Instagram, the popularity of non-practical hats, designers sent their creatures to the floor.
The famous curtain of Valentino was a luxurious beach hat, decorated by broad fields like feathers that filled the heads of the models.
Other accelerators unusually large size included decorationed with precious stones of café, a hat of a wizard, and even an ananas, but they were not intended to keep their head warm.
Tom Brown also showed the pattering of blue masks -- just to Halloween.
Many of the variety of colored masks were with lips sewed and more reminded of Hannibal Lecter than a high fashion.
One of them looked like a cream for the submarine swimming with a pipe and protective glasses, and the other looked like a flooded cone of ice cream.
And if you continue to follow the huge fashion attributes, you're lucky.
Those watching the style predicts that the huge hats can break into our everyday life.
The huge hats go fifth to "La Bomba", a slammed hat with a field wide of two feet, which can be seen in all, from Ryan to Emily Ratakovski.
A cultivate label on a very uncomfortable hat, which was released in social networks, contributed to another great creature on the floor -- a slammed beach bag, almost as large as a model with this bag dressed in a buyer.
The dark orange bag of the rafia, decorated by a rafia according and covered with a white skin hand, became an excellent part of Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris on the week of fashion.
The famous artist Luke Armitage said to the F.J.A.: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets the next summer, since the designer had a great influence, and it would be hard to ignore demand for non-gone accessories."
John Edward: Tongue learning is a necessary skill for all citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain the achievements in the academic success, which continues since 2018 with another excellent outcome of the examinations that are strengthened by individual and collective success in the transport, art, music and other communities.
Over 30,000 students across Scotland, schools presented by the Scottish Council of independent schools (SCIS) are trying to ensure the best level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their students for the higher education they have chosen their careers and their places as civilians of the world.
As a educational sector that can develop and eradicate a individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to remain popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandella said, "If you talk to a man in the language he understands, it remains in his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it comes to his heart."
It's a bright reminder that we can't rely on English only if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of the recent tests this year, we see languages take first place in the League tables with the highest rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who were studying foreign languages received a higher score of A.
The data collected in 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students had reached a higher grade A in the study of Chinese language, while 72 percent were those who study German, 69 per cent French, and 63 per cent Spanish also reached the level of A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that will certainly need children and youth in the future.
Now the languages as the subject are chosen as well as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
A study conducted by the Commission on Employment and British skills in 2014 showed that among the reasons that employers had been connected to vacancies, 17 percent were associated with lack of language skills.
So more and more language skills are being needed to prepare young people for their future career.
In view of more perspective jobs that require knowledge of languages, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter who you choose, when you learn another language, it will be real advantage in the future if you have such skills for life.
The ability to contact people from other countries automatically put a multilingual person first among competitions.
According to a YouGov survey, in which more than 4,000 adult British participated in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language enough to speak, and the French was the only language in which a bi-value percentage was 15 percent.
That's why investments in language learning are now important for modern children.
A few languages, especially in developing countries, will give children more chances to find a good job.
In Scotland, every school will be different from the languages it teaches.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important to Britain in view of the future by 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever was your child's interest, in independent schools, there will always be a choice of several languages with a teaching warehouse, which is specialists in this area.
Scotland's independent schools are trying to provide a educational environment that will cook children and arm them with skills necessary to achieve success, regardless of what's going to happen.
Now you can't deny that in the global business environment, languages still have vital importance for the future of the country, so it should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as "international communities".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, variety and preference for youth of Scotland.
It must be done
John Edward – Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron debuts on Sunday in San Diego
The beginning of the waiting for followers who want to see Lebron James make his first start in Los Angeles Lakers.
The Lekers Trainer Luke Walton announced that James would play a pre-season opening Sunday against Denver Nagates in San Diego.
But the number of minutes he'll play, but we still have to determine.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Correspondent Leakers Mike Trudell wrote that James would probably play in limited minutes.
According to this week's practice, James asked about his plans on the six pre-season graphs.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of career to prepare," he said.
Tramp's time in Western Virginia, YouTube channel
This evening in Wiling, West Virginia, President Donald Tramp starts a lot of shares of the company.
This is the first one of the five planned Trampo's next week, including the stops in friendly places, Tennessee and Mississippi.
On confirmation of the arrival in order to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Tramp is trying to strengthen the support of the future interim elections, since the Republicans are at risk of losing control over Congress when the votes are given in November.
When is Tramp's speech starting tonight in West Virginia and how do you see it on the Internet?
Tramp's performance in Wiling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 hours at evening. ET tonight, on Saturday, on September 29, 2018.
You can see Tramp's speech in Western Virginia on the Internet below in the direct air on YouTube.
Tramp is probably this week to consider hearing on the basis of the candidature to the Supreme Court of Breta Cavanaugh, who has a problem with the accusations of sexual harassment with the expected confirmation in the Senate of voting during a week during the FBI investigation.
But the main goal of these speakers is to assist the Republicans, who stand before the election in November.
So President Tramp's company announced that these five were speaking next week to "activate volunteers and followers, since the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," reports Reuters.
"Control for Congress is so important for his order of day that the president will go to the maximum possible number of states, as we enter a tense season of the pre-election company," said the Reuters Agency, a representative of Tramp's company.
Planned at Wesbanco Arena's Arena Arena at Wiling, today's action can attract the followers from Agajo and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the media Pitzburg," reports The West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Tramp visited West Virginia, a state in which he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Tramp is trying to help the candidate from the Western Virginia Patrick Morris, who is the leader in the surveys.
"It's not a very good sign for Morris that the president must come to try to give him a trigger in the surveys," said Simon Hedar, a colleague from the West Virginia University, reports Reuters.
Rider's cup 2018: United States team moves forward to fighting to keep hopes for life on Sunday
After the three one-sided sessions of the four Saturday day, maybe it was just what it needed for the Rider Cube.
The pulse-whispering pulse is a totally invented sports concept that the players truly believe, and nothing more than competitive competitions.
So where would they say the pulse now?
"They had the advantage of six points and now four, so I think we're going through it with a little impulse," said Jordan sleeping, walking for a day.
Europe's advantage was, of course, four points ahead and in the game another twelve.
The Americans, as the Speech says, feel that they have a little wind raised, and they have nothing to trust, not at all, because of the form of Spith and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and everyone can praise three points of four.
Spith was mortal from shirts to green and is an example.
These throat screams of celebration were growing louder as long as his round had lasted, and he had struck a decisive stroke to play in a match on four fields when they and Thomas went down two by two.
His strike, which let them win the 15th match, was met with a similar scream, like the one that tells you he thinks the American team is not off.
"We just need to deepen and worry about your own match," said Spita.
Every of these players are already gone.
18 holes to make a score.
In the last two days, the only players who have acquired more points than Spith and Thomas are Francesco Malinari and Tommy Flitwood, the ruthless story of the Rider Cube.
Awesome but charming couples in Europe are four of four and they can't do anything wrong.
"Maliwood" were the only pair that did not make a godgy on Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped the godgies on Saturday morning, Friday and Friday afternoon Friday.
This happens, and as their energy seems to flow to this burdenful crowd and from it, and it confirms that they are players that win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to close the potential victory in Europe when the sun comes in Le Golf National than Flitwood or Malinars.
You want both on different holes at the same time.
The talk about European glory remains preranked.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short job on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's coach, when he was coupled with Alex Norren.
Godgy and two doubles in the front of the nine dug the Spanish and swing him with which they were never able to get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your hole.
Four matches and fours are so interesting to watch closely because of the interaction between couples, the parade they give, the parade they don't do, and how the strategy can change in one moment.
Europe has become a better team before and has taken a significant role in the last day, but this fourth meeting also indicated that the US team is trying to fight, in which some doubted, especially in the States.
Europe comes to the final Cube Rider with number 10-6
Europe will get a good advantage on the last day of the Rider Cube after the Saturday matches of four balls and fours over 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Malinari fought two victories over Tiger Woods to bring the Le Golf National to four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, trying to save the trophy that they lost in Hazeltin two years ago, was ruled in the US dissatisfaction agency in the morning by getting a series of 3-1.
The United States offered greater resistance in the match of four balls by winning two matches, but they couldn't do more.
To save the trophy, Jim Furic's side takes eight points from 12 single matches Sunday.
Flitwood is the first European beginner who won four points in a row, and he and Malinari, who got the name Mollywood after the sensational weekends, is only the second pair that won four points for his first four matches in the history of the Rider Cube.
By breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they were greatly forced to conquer the dropped Woods and the American bracelet, Bryson Decomb, another five and four.
Woods, who spent two matches Saturday, showed a random flash of glow, but now he lost 19 and 29 times in the matches of four balls and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rows, resting at the x matches of four balls, returned to Henry Stanson's partner in four ball matches before defeat 2 & 1 Dustina Johnson and Brooks Copkey, takes the same place in the world.
Europe had no way, though it was a pleasant, fresh day south of the west of Paris.
On Saturday, the three-fold Jordan Spith winner and Justin Thomas set the control point for the Americans in two points.
They earned 2 and 1 over John Ram and Ian Pulter from Spain in four balls and returned later to defeat Puller and Rory Macilroy 4 and 3 in fours by losing two holes.
Only twice in history, the Rider Cube team came back from a deficit of four points, which goes alone, although the owners of Furiq need to paint only to save the trophy.
But after the next two days, which were the best, the opposite on Sunday looks like they're gonna make it.
North Korea says "no way" will be armed in one side without trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated that on Saturday, the United Nations organization continues to sanctions that increase the lack of confidence in the United States, and in such conditions, the country can't give up nuclear weapons in a uniform way.
Rie Yoon Ho stated at the annual General Assembly of the World that last year North Korea has taken “significant measures of goodwill”, such as the cease trials at nuclear and missile stations, the demonstration of the nuclear test zone and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see the corresponding answer by the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way first to disarma itself.'
Despite the fact that Ri was renewed by the usual North Korean complaints against Washington's resistance to the "potato" approach to dinucleorisation, in which North Korea was rewarded, since she took progressive steps, his statement turned out to be significant that he did not deny a unilateral deuclearisation announcement that was made by Phenyan in the past.
Ri rescued a combined statement Kim Yenne and Donald Tramp at the first in history of the President of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim took care of working on the way to the Korean Semi-Self-Denuclearization, while Tramp promised to provide security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea is trying to officially end the war in Korea from 1950 to 53 years, but the United States stated that Phenyan should first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed the invitation to revoke cruel international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States of America insist first on "denuclearisation" and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their goal in a forced way, and even oppose the "communication of the end of war," said Ri.
"The perceiving that sanctions can put us on the knees, the unexpected dream of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ri didn't mention plans on the second summit between Kim and Tramp, which the U.S. chief noted earlier this week in the United Nations organization.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korea Leader Moon Jayne in the past five months and added: "If this question was a matter of denuclearization, it would not be South Korea, rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be such a fool."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was sharply different from the last year when he spoke at the United Nations General Assembly claimed that targeting the United States Continent using North Korea's missiles was inevitable after Mr. Zlo's President Tramp called Kim "the Suicide of Suicide".
This year in the U.N. Tramp, who threatened last year to "destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his liberty in taking the measures of disarmament, but said that there would be much more to do, and sanctions must remain in force until that pair until North Korea is denucleased.
In Wednesday, Tramp reported that he had no time frame for this, saying, "If this takes two years, three or five months, it doesn't matter."
The Security Council said it was worth rewarding Phenyan for the measures taken.
However, the Secretary of the United States. Mike Pampea told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that "The execution of the Security Council sanctions must be active and necessarily continued until we are sure that the full, final and validity of the Dynuclearization is complete."
The Security Council strengthened sanctions against North Korea in 2006, trying to stop financing the Phenyan nuclear and balistic missile programmes.
Pampea met with Ri in the Security Council colours, and the General Assembly then stated that next month he would visit Phenyan again to prepare for the next summit.
Pompea visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he left Phenyan, saying that progress made with North Korea for a few hours of talks, ended with a visa statement that he offers the demands "like gangsters".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has been scattering the missile installation and the nuclear complex when the United States takes the "suitable measures".
Tramp said that by Kim's words "suitable measures" he's expecting is a safe guarantee and aim to normalize the relationship with Washington, which Tramp promised in Singapore.
Harvard's students are taking the right rest course.
The new course of the Harvard University this year has to teach students more to sleep, and it has a goal to fight the culture to learn coffee at night in his hand.
Scientist concluded that students at one of the best universities in the world often don't know how to look after themselves and their health.
Charles Chaseler, a medicinal professor for sleep of the Harvard Medical School and a hospital specialist named Brigam and a woman's hospital, developed a course that he believed to be the first in his family in the United States.
An inspired speech about the impact of sleeping on teaching, he began course.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, "Why did they tell me this just now, at the last class of school?"
"She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep -- it surprised me," said the Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course given by the student explains why good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports achievements and improve the general mood.
Paul Barryra, a psychiatrist at the Harvard Medical School and a director for health care, told me that the university decided to take a course after he found that students were often free of sleep for a week.
The course, which lasts an hour, includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of room in the internet where students press on cups with coffee, baits and books that tell about the influence of cafeteria and light and how lack of sleep affects sports indicators, and the importance of the habits before sleep.
In the next stage, participants tell us how long-term deprivation of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive images, encourages participants to think about their everyday life.
"We know that this right now will not change the behavior of the students.
But we believe that they must know that as well as everyone knows about the consequences of smoking for health," said Professor Chaseller.
According to him, the culture of nightfalls still exists, adding that modern technologies and constantly growing pressure on students leads to a deprivation of sleep, which is a growing problem.
"A sufficient sleep of good quality must be a "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety," he said, " even to avoid excessive weight, as the deprivation of sleep makes the brain constantly hungry."
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physical biology, helped professor Chasler to develop a course.
He said that course opened his eyes and inspired to teach everyone at the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask the asisrants to complete a similar learning program before getting to the university.
Professor Chassler recommended the opportunity for students to set an hour to know if they go to sleep and when they wake up, aware of the harmful effects of the blue light, which radiates from screens of monitors and light lightlights, which can change the daily mode, which lead to problems with sleeping.
"Levingston" 1:0 Rangers: Mengo is killing Gerard's gol.
The Rangers had another defeat when Golley Mangy assured Steven Gerard not to lose 1:0 at the Levingstone stadium.
Ibrax wants to write his first victory on the way to triumph with the number 4-1 in February in St. Johnton, but Gary Holton's team is already in the second defeat of Gerard as a manager of 18 games to leave on his side eight points, standing away from the leaders of the Ladbrokes Hearts Prime Minister.
Mengo hit seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers team, inspired by the naked, didn't seem to be losing.
At the same time, when Reigers dropped to the sixth place, Levingston risen to the third place, behind Hiberniani with a sword difference.
For Rangers, there may be additional problems after the Forward Colum Spence has to be treated with a head trauma after he got a subject thrown out of the tribune.
Gerard made eight different players, so Ira didn't play at the Betfred Battle.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levi under the 11th room, which allowed to pick up the point from Hearts last week, and was delighted by how well they walked at each step of their opponents.
Rangers were more owned by the ball, but Livigstan did more attempts to kill the ball.
They should have been killed in two minutes when the first time Mengie directed the ball through Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's gate, and then the semi-guarder used this chance.
Successful punishment of Jacobs Caygan sang a suddenly Craig Halkett, but his partner for the protection of Alan Litgs was able to hit a strong struggle behind.
The Rangers have taken control, but the last third of the game was more hopeful of killing than showing a good game.
Alfreda Marellas was certainly to be punished by a fine for a quarter of an hour until the end when he and Steven Loves encountered in the field, but Judge Stephen Thompson had not accepted the complaints of Colombia.
The Rangers managed to hit the gate only in the first half of the game, but the former Ibrox Liam Cali barrier almost gave the gol to Lassan Coolibali and the effective attack of this Echaria.
While killing the first goal at the 34th minute of Levi, it may have been against the next active game, but no one denies that they must demonstrate a good game.
Reigers weren't able to hit Jacobs' gate again.
Scott Arfield didn't answer when Declan Galacher passed Scott Robinson, who blocked Menga to get the opportunity to kill at the gate.
Gerard replaced the Culibali break with Ryan Kent, and it turned out to be an effective effect when attacking hit by Marellas, but the impressive Cali arrived and locked the strike.
But Levingstan continued to satisfy the visitors, playing that game that was them who liked, while Lithuans and Halket continued to share the ball after a long resistance.
The side of Holt was able to overcome only for the last minute, but McGregor played well to resist Jacobs before the Lithuanian went to the reservation clip.
The replacement of Rangers Glennam Midlton happened next time after his punishment, when he encountered Jacobs, but Tomson managed to escape.
Almanach: Geiger Counter Inventor
The page from our almanach ' Sunday morning': September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and the day of the future physicist, Yohan Wilhelm, Hanz, Geiger, born in Germany.
Gaiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactiveness, which resulted in a device known as Geiger's number.
Geiger's accountant became part of the science and appeared in pop culture, like in the 1950 film called Koronad, which seemed to be a familiar scholar Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Who is he on the ground?
Rogers: "This is the Geiger number used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put your ears, you really have the power to hear the sounds of atoms that are dedicated to radioactivities in minerals."
Evans: "Say, is it really creepy now?"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before the 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to use.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system to "see" cancer cells.
A new anti-derivative vaccine can help the immune system to "see" the bad cells and destroy them.
The vaccine is like to teach the immune system to recognize the bad cells, which will be part of the treatment.
The method provides for getting immune cells from the patient and changing them into the lab.
Then cells can see a protein spreaded in many cancer cells and then re-enter the help cells.
The test vaccine shows successful results for patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who was introduced in the vaccine that helped the immune system to recognise cancer cells saw that the cancer of liquors disappeared for 18 months.
The method includes the receipt of immune cells in the patient, changing them in the lab so that they can "see" the HER2 protein, common for many cancer cells, and then be reintroduced.
That's what Professor Jay Berzofski of the National Institute of River in the United States of Maryland said about this, and our results show that there is a very perspective vaccine.
"HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of antiracic cells fighting with the river of milk iron, crustaceans, light and fat pockets," said Professor Berozofski.
Similar approach to the detection of immune cells in patients and teaching them to achieve cancer cells worked well in treating lecose.
The Canye West started a discussion in support of Tramp, wearing the MAG title, after it appeared to the CNL.
That didn't turn out good.
In the studio during the Saturday Saturday evening, Kanie West was sentenced after the talk where he praised the United States. President Donald Tramp said that the second time in 2020 would be spoken.
After performing his third song in the evening called the City of Privid, when he was in the America hat again large, he spoke against the democrats and confirmed his support to Trampo.
"How many times am I talking to the white people, and they said, "How can you support Tramp, he's racist?"
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time," he said.
The SNL started the show with the main role of Matt Damon, where the Hollywood Star prayed for the statements of Brett Cavano before the Senate's court office during the trial of sexual violence by Christine Blacey Ford.
Despite the fact that the speech was not translated, West's words fell into a frame and were loaded into social media by Chris Year.
It's not understandable whether Rock tried to give up West.
Furthermore, West complained to the audience that he had a difficult time behind the bullets.
They looked forward to me behind the bullets.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat.
They looked forward to me.
"And then say I'm in a fatal place," he said, as reports the Washington Examiner.
West continued: Do you want to see the fatal place? "Saying that he'll wear my Scoperman's hat, which meant that he couldn't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
Try loving.
Because of his statements, at least twice the hearing was withdrawn, and SNS representatives were confused by the Veroiti message.
West was taken as a replacement of Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, Reper McMiller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many of the execution of the song I love It, dressed in a bottle of water Perrier.
West received support from the TPUS Conservative Party manager, Kendes Turner, who wrote on the Twitter: "Thank you for your support."
But the leading show Karen Hunter wrote that West is just who he is, and it's always wonderful.
"But I've decided not to reward anyone, buying his music or clothes, or supporting his art, which I believe, covers and distorts ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
Just like us," she added.
Before showing the reper announced on Twitter that changed his name, saying that his name was "Caney West."
He's not the first artist who changed his name, and went after the follows of the Didi, also known as Puff Didi.
His colleague of reper Snoop Dogg called the collaboration of Snoop Lion and of course, the legend of music, who changed his name into the symbol, and then he and artist known earlier as Prince.
Trying to kill at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempting to kill after a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast attacked a second man on Friday.
The incident happened in Bolihacamore, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast's court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the State Prosecutor.
Kit Harrington's Shooty thrones star has captured idealized brutality.
Kit Harrington is famous with his sword and the role of John Snow in the series "Guy Snow" in the warrior of the Middle-Eternal Suriel HBO
But 31-year-old actor got a stereotype of a maco hero, which means that young boys often feel harder to respect.
Speaking at the Sunday Times Cultural Division, Keith said that he thought "things happened" and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the era #MeToo.
The Whale, who recently married his neighbor on the Goal Throne, Rows Lesley, who was also 31 years old, admitted that he felt the power to solve this problem.
"I feel personally a strong guy when we were wrong about courage?" he said.
"Why do we learn men when they grow up from the point of view that we see now?"
The whale believes that television must be responsible for the appearance of brutality because of very male personnel.
He said, "What's in the beginning and why do they teach it?
Why do they teach on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they must be so sure to be a real man?
I think it's really one of the greatest questions in our day -- how do we change it?
Because obviously something happens to young people.
In an interview, he also confessed that the next summer series will end, and he will come out of the battle field and will not do docwells or sikwells to the "The Shore thrones".
From November the Whale will start renewing the true West Sam Shepherd, who is a historic director with his brother, who is a robber.
Recently, the actor said that he considered the meeting with his wife, Rows, the best note to finish the game of thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so I got my future family, and my life here," he said.
The rose played Igritte, a person who loved the hero of Keith John Snow in this fantastic series, awarded by Amy.
A couple was promised in June 2018 in Leslie's Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports to increase new cases by 14%
China announced that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
According to healthcare workers, more than 820 000 people have been infected in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were registered.
Most of the new cases were passed through sex, as it was in the past.
The traditional HIV infection is spread in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
"But the number of people who have been infected by HIV through blood transfusions has decreased almost to zero," said Chinese officials at the Yunnan Province Conference.
However, each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China grows by 100,000 people.
Transfering HIV infection through sex is a sharp problem of the Chinese LGBT group.
Homosexuality has been decriminated in China in 1997, but discrimination against LHBT people has already existed.
Because of the conservative value in the country, about 70 or 90 percent of men who have sex with men, they are finally marrying women.
Many diseases are spreading from insufficient knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the government of China has had universal access to HIV medicines in efforts to solve this global problem.
Maxine Watters denies the injury of the data, danger and theory of conversions by her parliamentary staff
The U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters was accused on Saturday that her colleague had posted private information on three Republican Senators on Wikipedia pages.
Democrat Los Angeles claimed that there were claims to the participants on the right wing and their sites.
"False, false, and a lot of disgusting lies," says Watters' statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly includes household addresses and phone numbers in the United States. Sense: Lindsay Graham from South Caroline and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both of Utah.
Information placed by an unknown man on the Capital Hill during the hearing of the Senate Commission on Sexual Disabilities on behalf of a member of the Supreme Court, Bret Kavano, appeared on the Internet on Thursday.
The escape took place a while after three Senators questioned Cavano.
"The conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the IP sources were linked to the Watters office and provided information from a team worker," said Hill.
"This unreasonable claim is completely false and absolutely liar," continued Woothers.
"Article of my team, whose data, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraud and false accusations, never answered for the escape of this information.
This unreasonable claim is completely false and absolutely false."
The Watters' statement quickly criticized the Internet, including from the former secretary of the White House of Ari Flasher.
"It causes anger," wrote Flasher.
It's evidence that she has no courage to be a member of the Congress.
If anyone's accused of what they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They shouldn't behave themselves disgusting.
They shouldn't put the question of the motive of their accusations.
They must be calm and kind.
Flasher compared Waters' response to the criticism of democrats before Judge Cavano, when they were accused of being too angry during hearing on Thursday.
Amar Navara, a candidate from the Republican Party, who talks and participates in interim election meetings, also spoke to the Twitter.
"It's a resarance when it turns out to be true," he wrote.
In his statement, Watters said that her office warned the competent authorities and the law enforcement authorities of these false statements.
"We guarantee that the guilty will be found," she continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are disstructive and dangerous to any of my team's staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again's review has been hit by an invented spy of Rowen Atkinsan.
Now it's become a tradition to look for the meaning of BREXIT in any new British film, and it appears to be in the comedy and the Exchn-Franchess Johnny England, which started in 2003 with Johnny Inglish and extended in 2011, called Johnny England.
Can a satyr be good about how obviously stupid we look when we're talking about the new export opportunities?
In any case, the second time he appeared in print, an incompetent Johnny English got the opportunity to laugh over things-- his name was more loud than all comic creatures that he did for not English watchers in the movies.
Of course, he's a secret agent, who, despite his fake claims to glamour, has become a little similar to Clouseau with Mr. Bino's rices and a little such a guy who brought the only note to the Chor of Fire at the ceremony of the opening of the Alimpics in London in 2012.
His personality was originally based on the traveller and international secrets of Atkinson, who once played in the forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos on his way.
There are some nice moments that haven't been there before.
I loved Johnny English, approaching the helicopter, dressed in medium-term supplies, and the screwing of the rotor a little knocking on his helmet.
Dar Atkinsana for theatreal comedy is brightly demonstrated, but humor feels weak, and that's why it's especially strange when serious movies such as "Agent 007: Mission of Non-Scientific" offer the comedy as a major part.
Humor feels like it's not only for adults, but also for children, and even the stupid unfortunate accidents of Johnny England are not as inventory as silent as Atkinsona's silent movies in the bine's face.
The many years of current business are the serious problems of Britain.
Cyber hacker broke into the super-secret community of British spy in Britain, opening the names of all British agents in the places, to disappointing a government agent, it's, unfortunately, a small role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, which is a proud and mixed act that is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible with this Tereza-May kwas, but there's nothing like that in the script.
Her intelligence advisors report that since every real spy is being discovered, she'll have to engage one of those who are already retired.
And that means that for Johnny England himself, everything is complicated: now he works as a sixth teacher in several elevated institutions, and he teaches how to be an uncovered operator: some good examples here, as English offers the Academy of Music Lesson of Spying.
Inglish returned to Whitehall for an extra briefing and joined his ex-year-old friend Bo, who is playing Ben Miller again.
At present for my marriage, bound to the commander of the submarine boat, whose role Vicki Pepperdin performed a little vain.
So Batman and Robin are getting terrible wrong things in the Queen's secret agency, where they work again, meeting a beautiful woman of the Wilga Smoking.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister gets a dangerous order of a charismatic technical billioner who claims that he can solve the problem with the British hackers, with a creepy Jason Volt played by Jake Lacey.
Inglish and Bow are starting their execution from immediate things: masking under the officer, burning a French restaurant; creating a rush, fighting with the tradings on the boat of the luxury yacht of Volta; England is making a clean anarchy, because he's trying to use virtual reality's houses to get into contact with the Wallta's home interior.
All the moments were pulled out for the last event, but as pleasant and noisy, which had quite a lot of children on TV.
Pretty good stuff.
And how about other movies about Johnny English, I couldn't think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinsan the role that really represents his talent?
The Leiborist Party denies that there is a plan to pay the British for a four-day working week with a payment in five days.
The work party, Jeremy Corbina, has to consider a radical plan when the British work for only four days a week, but they are paid for five.
The party reportedly wants business managers to transfer the work results of the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an extra weekend.
It was obvious that employees would enjoy the three-day weekends, but they would still get the same earnings.
The source notes that the idea is consistent with the economic program of the party and plans to direct the country to support workers.
The trade unions' consolidation has acquired a four-day week as a good way to use a change in the economy.
The oldest source in the Lebarian Party told for the Sunday Times: "The planned review of action will be announced by the end of the year.
This is not going to happen now, but the four-day working week is the idea that meets the view of the party and the overall industrial strategy for economic governance for the benefit of workers.
The Leiborist Party is not the first one who approves this idea, the Green Party promises to hold a four-day working week during the general election company in 2017.
However, the Leiborist Party's efforts are not entirely supported.
The Leiborist Party's representative said, Four Work Week is not a party policy goal, and it's not partial.
The Chancellor John McDonalle used a working conference last week to express his vision of the social revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonalle said he decided to revert power from "unmissal directors" and "managers" to communal companies.
The plans of a shady cancer also assume that the current water resources shareholder can not get the whole package of stocks back, because the government of Laborists can make a "recover" on the basis of alleged violations.
He also confirmed that it was planned to bring employees into a company's council and create a united property fund to transfer 10 per cent of their own funds to private employees, which would contain annual divisions to 500 pounds of steerlings.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy, told the 60-minute, that the FBI investigator, who works with Cavano, must change his opinion.
The FBI's investigation in charge of judge Breta Cavanaugh's final vote on his derogation to the Supreme Court at least a week.
In an interview on Sunday's "60 minutes" correspondent Scott Pally asked the Republicans Johnny Kennedy and Lindsay Graham about Sens: can the FBI find out anything that can lead to change?
Kennedy turned out to be more open than his colleague from South Caroline.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
'I said, going to the court meeting,' I spoke to judge Cavano.
And I called him after it happened, and I asked why it was accused, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive and unanimous."
The vote of Graham, however, seemed final.
"I think Brett Cavano decided that it would be a scandalous accusation," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this, Brett denies it firmly," said Graham, referring to Christine Blazey Ford.
"And everyone she calls couldn't believe it.
She's only 36 years old.
I can't see anything new."
What is the International Civil Festival, and what is done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, there is an International Festival in New York: annual musical event, which has a very impressive composition of speakers and performers and has a world's mission to stop poverty.
Now, for seven years, the World Civil Festival will take place at a large barn of Central Park, where tens of thousands will come to enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, and to learn about the real purpose of the event -- the cease of poverty and goal by 2030.
The International Civil Festival, which appeared in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Project against the branch of the international propaganda group that hopes to stop poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket on events (if you don't want to pay VIP-believe) visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "going" as a volunteer, to write e-mail to the leader of the country, call any other actors and raise awareness of the purpose of the cessation of poverty.
But how successful was the Civil Festival for 12 years and was he able to achieve his goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a worthless concert a real way to convince people that they need active action, or is it just a different case of so-calclingism -- people feel like they're doing a good job by signing online petition or sending tweets?
Since 2011, Festival organizers have stated that more than 19 million "actions" have been fixed from their followers trying to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to push influence leaders to carry out obligations for more than 37 billion dollars that could affect life by 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group brought 390 comments about obligations and claimed at least 10 billion dollars that have already been allocated or collected.
A group estimated that the funds still have been directly affected by nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key obligations include food delivery, partnerships with investors and executors based in Britain, "help children to develop in full volume", promised to secure Rwanda 35 million dollars to help avoid malnutrition in the country after getting more than 4700 tweets from citizens.
"With the support of the Government of Britain, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can eradicate social injustice in history," said Ambassador Tracy Ulman in London in April 2018.
Furthermore, the group announced that after more than 5000 shares were carried out in Britain to improve food for moms and children, the government announced the financing of the project “food aid”, which reaches five million women and children with food problems.
In answer to one of the common questions on the website, "What makes you think we can end poverty?"
The global festival replied, "It's gonna be a long and difficult way; sometimes we're going to fail and fail."
But like the great civil rights and the movements against the apartheid, we're going to be successful, because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Wickend, Sean Mendez, Cardie B, Janel Monoe, are one of the series of Persons that are speaking this year in New York, which will lead Debra-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use the MS for "clock" to prevent the export of Russian oil and gas
"Washington may, if necessary, contact the Navy to prevent the exit of Russian energy in the EZ and the Middle East," said US Secretary Ryan Zink, Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that the actions of Russia in Serbia, especially where it acts on the invitation of legal government, are a reason for studying new energy markets.
"I believe that the cause of their stay in the Middle East is that they want to gain energy just as in Eastern Europe and south of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"United States are able to ensure the opening of the seaways through the military fleet, and when necessary, organize the block, so that their energy must not have reached the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the parties to the event organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumptors by a non-profit group who is positioned as the “Voice of Energy Consumers” in the US.
He compared Washington's approaches to the relationship with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic alternate for Iran and Russia is more or less equivalent and replaces fuel," he said, named Russia "one-sided country" with a economy depending on cope fuels.
These statements appeared when the Tramp Administration wants to increase the export of its educated natural gas to Europe, replaceing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this, the workers of the Administration of Trampo, including the US President himself, Donald Tramp, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the “wrong” project of the Northern Stream 2, which, according to Trampo, converted Berlin to“spool” of Moscow.
The Mask repeatedly emphasized that the Northern Flood 2 gasway cost 11 billion dollars, which is created to double the power of existing gasway to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusive economic project.
Kreml claims that Washington's harsh opposition takes a start in the economy and is an example of an unfair competition.
"I believe that we have the only view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers must be able to select suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting the US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The Americans got a hit in response from Germany, which reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
The major German organisation representing industry, the Federal Federation of German Industry (BDI) urged the United States not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third state is interfering with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after the recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to discuss its participation in the 2020 presidential elections, stated Senator from the state of Massachusetts.
The Senator of the state of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that it would be serious to consider its participation in the president's elections after the interim elections.
During the talk in Mayor Hallioki, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her participation.
"There's time for women to go to Washington and order our wrong government, and I'm also talking about women in the highest positions," she said, according to the Hill.
"After 6 November, I'll take very serious consideration of the possibility of speaking to the president."
During the talk in Mayor Warren, she turned to President Donald Tramp, saying that the country is going to lead the country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely worried about what Tramp does to our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticised Tramp and his candidate to the Supreme Court of Breta Cavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren wrote in her Tweet, "It is obviously necessary for the FBI to investigate before the vote."
However, the results of the survey published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters don't think it should be speaking to the president in 2020.
According to the Centre for Political Research of the University of Safolk/Bostan Globe, eight per cent of the "potential" voters of Massachusetts said that the senator should not be talking.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The survey showed greater support for the former Governor of Deval Patrick, where 38 percent were for and 48 percent against.
Other famous names among democrats that were discussed in 2020 in connection with the potential chatting, including the former Vice-President Joe Byden and the Senator of the State of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press Bayden, he would officially take a decision until January.
When Donald Trampo supported, Sarah Pauline mentioned the post-traumatic syndrome of Traco Polyno
The 26-year-old Track Paulin spent a year in Iraq after a call for a September service.
Monday night he was arrested and he was accused of domestic violence
"What my son is going through after return, I can compare with the results of the postroumatical syndrome and injuries that our soldiers are returning, in other families," she said, "to the gathered on the occasion in support of Donald Tramp in Talse, Oclahoma.
Pauline called this arrest "was a sick question" and said that her son and other veterans of war "will return to a little bit of other, harvested, returning to question whether there is the respect for which soldiers, pilots, other wars, giving themselves to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Osil, Alaska and he was accused of domestic violence against a woman, an obstacle of attempting to report domestic violence, finding weapons in a drunk, according to Dan Bennett's information, a press secretary of the Police Department of Wessil.
18 states and district Colombia support the condemnation of a new harbor policy
The 18 states and the Colombian district support the condemnation of the new U.S. policy, which denies the victims of intimidation by gangs or domestic violence.
The representatives of 18 states and district Colombia filed analytical note on Friday in Washington to support the condemnation of the harbor policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the judge in the case of Grace against Seshance, which was opened in August by the American Union on Civil Rights against Federal Policy, was not discovered.
She stated that her partner "and his friends from a hard gang" raped her, but the US authorities of 20 July refused at the harbor.
She was detained in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are coming from the largest number of requests for a port in the U.S. as countries with serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new American harbor policy has changed the decision of the 2014 Appeal Commission on Immigration, which allows immigrants without documents who are victims of domestic violence to address the port.
Colombia's Attorney General Carl Reysin said on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of legal experience of states, countries and world."
"Federal legislation requires that applications at the port be based on specific facts and circumstances of the case, and that change breaks this principle," said the analytical note.
The lawyers also noted that politics that denies immigrants is degrading the US economy, saying that immigrants can often become entrepreneurs and "create necessary jobs".
The Attorney General Jeff Seshance commanded the judges in June about immigration no longer to accommodate victims of domestic violence and violence by gangs.
"It is given to the one who leaves his country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or social group or political views," said Seshance on 11 June, announced by this policy.
The scene never meant a solution to problems, even all the serious problems that people face around the world every day.
The desperate saving work in Palo. During the attempt to find survivors, the number of survivors has doubled.
The survivors are in a very difficult situation.
"It's all very tense," said the 35-year-old mother of Ris Kusom, calming her little son with temperature in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palo.
"Each minute, the fast car brings bodies.
Clean water very little."
The lodgers began to go back to their ruined houses, collecting the weak things, trying to save everything you can find.
A hundred people were wounded and hospitals damaged by the earthquake by 7.5 points were filled.
Some of the wounded, including Two Harris, who broke the spinning and the shoulder, are outside the army hospital of Paul, where patients are treated on the streets because of strong pressures that repeat.
In his eyes the tears appeared when he seemed to feel a strong underground push in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to be saved.
I was stuck under the ruins of the walls," said Harris Associated Press, and added that his family had arrived in the city to marry.
"I heard her wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to his wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe."
American Ambassador accuses China of threats using the Propaganda advertising
A week after the official Chinese newspaper printed a four-sided advertisement in the American daily, commending the mutual benefits of the American and Chinese trade, the US Ambassador in China accused Peking of the use of the US press to spread propaganda.
The American President Donald Tramp mentioned the payment supplement in China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most selling newspaper of the state of Ayowa, after he accused China of attempting to interfere in the American Congress on November 6th.
Tramp's accusation that China was trying to interfere with American elections indicated that American officials in the conversation with Reuters were called a new phase in Washington's company on pressure in China.
Although advertising by foreign governments is a normal practice for trade promotion, now Beijing and Washington have solved a trade war resulting from mutual importation of tariffs.
Repressive tariffs, stated by American and Chinese experts, have been introduced to harm such exporters as businesses from the Ayau State that support the Republican Party of Tramp.
Terry Bransted, US Ambassador in China, and former Governor of Iowa, the chief exporter of agricultural goods in China, said that Beijing damaged American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, wrote Branstad in a copy article of the Sunday issue of Des Moines Register, "now doubles its efforts, printing a propaganda advertising in our free press."
"With spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a good American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, printing a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," wrote Brensted.
"And if you look at the newspaper kits in Beijing, there you will find not so much votes against and you will not see the real reflection of other suggestions that Chinese may have about the dangerous trajectory in the economy, considering the fact that the press is under the iron-fifth communist party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers quit the proposal" to print his article, although he didn't even call that newspaper.
The Republicans push the women's electorals at the front of the interim elections from Cavano Fiasco warn the analysts
While many well-known Republicans defend the candidate for the position of Supreme Judge Brett Cavano to face several sexual violence accusations, the analysts warned that they would get a hit in response, especially from women, during future interim elections.
The emotions around this were very strong, and most of the Republicans are already pointing out that they are willing to vote.
"Those things can't be returned," said Grant Rihar, a professor of the Political Sciences of the School of Maxwell of the Syracuse University of the The Hill for the article.
Richar said that he wasn't sure that the statements of Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona) about the investigation by the FBI would be enough to calm down the angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow and November," said Corrine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national press secretary of the MoveOn Progressive Group in Washington, Columbia County.
On Friday morning, the protestants scanned the November Quickly! while demonstrating at the Senate Hall, when the Republicans who control the judicial committee decided to make the Kavano candidature, despite the statement of Dr. Christine Blacey Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of democrats will be extremely great," said Stu Rotenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say they're tall now, and it's true.
But they may be even higher, especially among women-schoolers in the mountains and young voters from 18 to 29 years old, who don't even love the president, but often don't vote."
Even before the open statement of Ford, in which she detailed her accusations of the candidate in the High Court of Sexual Violence, the analysts suggest that if the Republicans insiste on confirmations, they may have a strong stroke in return.
"For the Republican Party it has made some kind of mixture," said Michael Style, former head of the National Bureau of the Republican Party at the beginning of the past week, according to NBC News.
"The talk is not about the voting of the Bureau or the final vote, or whether Cavano will get to the post. It's a talk about how the Republicans managed and how they made it," noted the Gai Cecil, director of Priorities of the United States, a group that helps choosing democrats.
But it seems like the Americans split up on the question of Ford or Cavano, and it's a little bit more speaking for the last one.
The new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of the respondents are probably or not very trusted with Ford's statement, and 35 percent said that they're probably trusting Cavano or not.
Furthermore, 38 percent said that they believe that Cavan was probably or probably lying in his statement, and 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After a trigger by Flake's FBI is investigating the charges by Ford and at least another person, Deborah Ramirez, reports the Guardian.
Last week, Ford made an oath before the Senatu Legal Bureau, that Cavano, when he was drunk, had a 17-year-old motion.
Ramirez claims that the candidate at the Supreme Court presented her genitals at the party when they were studying in Eil in the 1980s.
The World Network Inventor plans to start New Internet to compile Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Li, the inventor of the world's network, starts a startup that will be a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built on the open platform of Berners-Li Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store the data and who has access to this information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that, creating Inrupt, he meant "wing over the world."
"We must do it now," he said about startup.
"It's a historical moment."
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own data storage on the Internet or the Pod.
This may contain contact lists, work lists, calendar, fanexa and other personal and professional tools.
This is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time.
The uniqueness of the Internet's personal storage is that only the user defines who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal reinforcement of the potential using data."
According to John Bruce's executive director, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the opportunity to collect resources, processes and the necessary skills to make Solid available to each one.
The company is now composed of Berners Lee, Bruce, security platforms bought by IBM, several developers working on the contract and volunteers' coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized programs using tools available on the Inrupt web site.
Brners-Lee said he and his team weren't talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to make complete changes if all their business models are immediately revised.
"We don't ask for their permission."
The Saturday publication on Medium Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission "is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect integrity and quality of the new network created on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Li transformed the Internet by creating the Consortion of the World Network at the Massachusetts Institute for Technology.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee has been very influenced by the network's neutrality.
Even running Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consorcium, the Web Fund and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Reverend of the priest born by the Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only priest of the Church of England, awarded by the Victoria Cross during the First World War, was marked in his city 100 years later.
Reverend Bernard Van was awarded on September 29, 1918 for his involvement in the Belanglise and Leakur attack.
But four days later he died from a sniper bullet and never learned that he had received the highest military reward.
On Saturday in Rashden, County Northgamptanshire, two of his grandsons at the parade opened a memorial stone.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that it was "very symbolic" that the stone was opened 100 years after his grandfather was awarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Wan's submanent battalion was battalioned through the San Quentin channel "with a thick fog and under a strong rosy and bullet fire of the robbery."
Then he ran to the line of fire and "with great courage" led the soldiers forward, captured by himself the gun and slammed three divisions.
The Duke of Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and a little more than a month later the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Van said his grandfather's actions were "this thing I would never have been able to do and also worth some respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also set up a vein after a parade, which was headed by the Imperial Youth Arkester of Brentwood.
Michael Van said that "to him a great honour to take part in the paradise," and added that "the marriage of the real hero was demonstrated by the support that many have done."
The MMA fans waited all night to see Bellator 206, they instead got Pep's pig
Imagine you've been standing all night to see a packed transfer from Bellator 206, and then you're denying the main event.
In the program with San Hasse, there was 13 fights, including six on the main map, and they showed up in the airline all night on the British Channel 5.
And on 6 a.m., when Gerar Mussasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, looking at Britain just freaked out when the program changed to Pep's pig.
Some were disappointed after they spent the nightless, especially waiting for this fight.
One of the Twitter clusters called switching to a child's painting as "something stupid joke."
In response to Dave Schwartz's broadcast, the senior Vice-President Bellator on marketing and communications, he said, "With the state order and 6 a.m., this content was inappropriate and it had to be switched into a child program."
"Yes, Pig Pep."
The President of the Bellator Scott Coker said they'd be working on the future program to consider British viewers.
"I think we're discussing the possibility of repeating, I think we can solve this matter," said Coker.
"But now the sixth morning on Sunday, and we can't solve it until Sunday by our time, and this is Monday in their time.
But we're doing everything we can.
Trust me, if the programs were changing, we got a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to solve the question, considering it a technical error.
But it turned out to be a state order.
I can make sure that this doesn't happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of perceptions from six to five, as we usually do, this time we're going to curb the fans, but we've been over.
This is an awkward situation."
"Desks of the Inhuman Island": Tom Daily felt "insignificant" because of sexuality
The Alimpian prize on the water jumping Tom Daily said that he was growing with a sense of insignificance to others because of his sexuality -- but that gave him motivation in his way to success.
24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand that "not all like me" until he went to high school.
Speaking at the Disk of the Inhuman Island, Radio 4 in the leading Lauren Lavern, he said he supports the rights of gays to give another hope.
He also stated that if he had a child, he began to think less about winning on the olimpics.
The traditional leading this pretty old program of Kirstie Yang, took a rest for a few months because of the disease.
As a man who found himself on an unpublic island, on the first program of Lavern, Daily said that when he was a child, he felt "being smaller than all others, because "the public didn't take those who liked both boys and girls."
He said, "I think now it's a feeling that you're not like everyone and that you're insignificant, that gave me strength and inspiration to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was someone, he said not to disappoint those who learned of his sexuality.
The two-fold bronze acquisition of the alimpians became a significant activist of the LGBT movement and in Australian Association Games this year called on countries not to criminalize homosexualists.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was lucky to live open, without persecution, and he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-fold world champion said that when he fell in love with a man -- an American scriptist, directors and procurators of Dustine Lance Blacke, who met in 2013 -- "that was unexpected for me."
Daily married Oscar owner, who was 20 years older than him last year, but he said that the difference at age doesn't matter.
"If you walk through this in such a young age," at the first olympics he was 14 years old, and three years later his father died of cancer -- he said it was hard to find a peasant who would have survived such flights and falls.
In June, they became parents, their son's name is Robert Ray Black Daily, and Daily said that his "perspectives are completely changed."
"If you asked me last year, I would tell you that I should win the gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are things in the world that are more important than a golden olympics medal.
Robbie is my golden olympics medal."
His son is also called Robert's father, and his father died in 2011 when he was 40 years old from brain cancer.
Daily said that his father didn't accept the fact that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if they bought tickets to the London Allipe 2012 -- he wanted to sit in the first series.
"I couldn't tell him," you wouldn't sit in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I kept his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not immortal," he said.
Next year, Daily competited on an alliment 2012 and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that this was what I dreamed about my whole life -- jumping into the water in front of my balloons in the Allimp games, that's the best sense," he said.
This also affected the choice of a song -- the Proud from Heather Smoll -- who found in it a reaction to the allipiade training and from which the ants are running from.
"Desks of the Inhuman Island" can be listened to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 in British summer time.
Michelson, who is not in shape, remains on the reservation clip in the Rider's cup on Saturday
The American Phil Michelson puts the record on Sunday, playing his 47 matches in the Rider's cup, but he needs to return his shape so that this event doesn't make it unhappy.
Michaelson, who will play in this competition, which is held once two years, the recorded 12th time, the command captain Jim Fürrick planted on a reservation club on Saturday football.
Instead of being in the center of the events, and he was there often for the United States team, the five-time winner of the cup divided his days between the employee's work and the training, hoping to return to form.
Even at the peak of his career he wasn't the best player, and now the 48-year-old golfist is not the perfect choice for a simple field of Le Golf National, where he was cruelly reproached by incorrect hits.
And if the field is not enough dark enough, Michaelson will fight the exact British Open Francesco Malinari, who won all four matches this week with Tommy Flitwood.
When the Americans, who are four points at the beginning of the 12 single matches, start with success, the Michaelson's match might turn out to be extremely important.
Fürick expressed confidence in this player, but couldn't say anything else.
"He fully understood his present role, flattered me at my back, appendix, and said that tomorrow would be ready," said Fürick.
"He's very sure of himself.
He was taken to the glory Hall and gave a lot of teams last week.
Maybe I didn't plan it for two matches.
I planned more, but it worked just so we thought to play.
He wants to be in the field, as well as everyone else."
Michelson will defeat Nick Fald's records on the number of matches in the Rider's cup played Sunday.
This could be the end of the career in the Rider's cup, which was never the same as achievements in individual games.
Michaelson's 18 won, 20 losses and seven fields, although Fürick said that his presence was useful to the command.
"He's a funny, sarcastic, with humor, loves to eat over people and just a very good man who is good to have in the team," he explained.
"I believe that the more young players were happy to pair his jokes, too, this week, and it was good to see.
He gives the command much more than a simple game."
The captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that a big break could disappear soon
Thomas Bjorn, a captain of the European team, knows with experience that a significant break before the individual games the last day on the Rider's cup can easily disappear.
The Danish player debuted in Walderham in 1997, where the European team under the leadership of Seva Balesteros had the advantage of five points above the Americans, but it ended with the minimum advantage of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that in Walderham we had great advantages and victories, but hardly we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we were lost," said Bjorn after watching how the class of 2018 won 5-3 and Friday and yesterday, and had a number of 10-6 on Le Golf National.
"The history shows me and everyone else in the team that this isn't the end.
Tomorrow we have to play at all a hundred.
Go to the field and do everything right.
Until the scores appeared in the table, nothing is finished.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, that's what we'll focus on.
I keep saying this, I'm focusing on 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that the opposite side is the best players in the world."
And I'm pleased with how the players played it in a heavy golf field, and Bjorn added, "I'll never oversight myself in this.
There's going to be a different game tomorrow.
The games will be individually played tomorrow, and this will be different.
It's just great when you're on the field with a partner and everything goes well, but when you're playing alone, your real talents of the golfist are valid here.
That's what you need to bring to the players that they should show the best tomorrow.
Now we have to leave a partner; the holes must go, and also show everything best to the individual player."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Fürick hopes for a better individual game of their sports than the one they showed in partnership, except for Jordan Speath and Justin Thomas, who took three scores from four.
Fürick himself was on both sides of these matches last day, playing a victory team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had "The Wonder in Medina."
"I remember every word of this," he said, answering the question how Ben Cranshaw, the captain in 1999 set up his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we always want to have a quick start you've seen in Brooklyn and Medina.
When speed grows, the largest pressure turns on those who play matches in the middle.
We made the right layout and put the players down as we liked, and you know, tomorrow we're trying to get some magic."
Thomas got the task of starting playing and speaking against Rory Macilroe in the main game, and Paul Casey, Justin Rows, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ian Paulter will play against top golfists.
"I put my players in this order, because I think I'll shut it all up," said Bjorn about his choice for individual matches.
The launch of a new German warship relocated
The new WMF fregate of Germany had to enter the building in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold Wartime, but it would appear not earlier in the next year because of unreasonable systems and constantly increasing costs, according to local media messages.
The launch of Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the absolutely new class of Baden-Wuerttemberg fregates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, as Die Zeit wrote quoting a military representative.
The ship was supposed to be in 2014, but the problems that occurred after construction prevented this ambitious project.
Four military ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg class, ordered in 2007, should replace the old Bremen class fregates.
They will be armed with strong arms, various anti-ship missiles and some Stels technology, such as a reduced vision for radars, infrared and acust signs.
Among other important characteristics, the longer periods between service, the new fregates may not go into their ports for up to two years.
However, constant deficiencies mean that modern battleships -- which can allow Germany to demonstrate its power outside the country -- are aged until they finally enter the building, Die Zeit notes.
The unhappy F125 fregate got in the heads last year when the German WMF officially refused to take the ship and returned it back to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
For the first time the Navy returned the ship to the port after the delivery.
The reasons for return, of course, are little, but the German media wrote about numerous "defects in software and hardware" that make the ship vain in the war mission.
Software shortages were particularly important, because the ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg have only 120 sailors -- half the crew of Bremen's old fregates.
It also turned out that the ship has a very large weight, which reduces its productivity and limits the possibility of further updates.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" weighs 7,000 tons, which doubles more than the weight of ships of this class that Germany used in World War II.
Besides the missing cost equipment of the project, including the training of the crew, is also a problem.
The price reached the incredible 3,1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), although at first it was 2.2 billion euros.
Problems that are gathered with new fregates are particularly important in light of recent warnings that the sea powers of Germany are declined.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartells, head of the German parliament bureau, stated that the WMF "mays less ships capable of military missions."
He said that the problem with time is growing, because the old ships are listing, and ships are not replaced.
He complained that none of the fregates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the WMF.
The National Company on the Secret Life of Speakers
A new study conducted in the Scotland Mountain is directed to identify how the fountains use landscapes in hunting for food.
Scientists hope to find something new in the behavior of the unique flying milk-free and help in future actions to save these animals.
Study of scholars of the National Company of Scotland's monuments is dealing with small creeps and also with the stormed long-eyed fosters of Dabanton in the gardens of Invere in Western Ross.
The special recording devices will be placed in the main places of this location in order to watch the actions of the speakers during the season.
Company workers and volunteers will conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
Expert analysis of sounds of all records to determine the frequency of speakers' calls, as well as what they do.
The residence map and the report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behaviour of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Duar, the National Company Adviser for Nature, hopes that the results will show which areas are the most important to the Springs and how each species uses them.
This information will help you to determine the preferences of creating a place of residence such as lions, and how to maintain forests to live with fountains and other animals associated with them.
In Scotland and Britain, the number of witches has decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects and destroys them.
The wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, as well as the sticky trails for fly and some chemicals for construction materials, threatened by cats.
Beaten is not at all blind.
But because of their nightlife, the ears are more hearable than the eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use a complex escalation technique to identify bugs and obstacles on their flight.
The national society, which is responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, is very serious to the speakers.
It works by ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, check the places of residence, and sometimes rescue events.
The organization even created the first and the only Scott Commander of Speakers in the Truth of the Dumphries and Hollyway, where eight of the ten species live in Scotland.
David Thompson's owner says it's a perfect territorial for speakers.
"Here, in the Thrive, we have just a great place for speakers," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a very good place to live."
But we don't know much more about speakers, so our work here and in other property will help to understand more what they need to do for better life."
It emphasizes the importance of verifying the presence of speakers before carrying out the removal of property, as it can unintendedly destroy one seat by killing up to 400 males and young snowmen, which will lead to a total destruction of local populations.
The said is under protection, and they are forbidden to be killed, frightened, cared or destroyed by their seats.
Elizabeth Ferrall, worker of the Scotland Scotch Protection Organization, encourages the public to help in this case.
She says, "We still need to learn a lot about our speakers, and many of the species we don't even know how their population lives."
Suddenly condemns accusations of rape, while his lawyers are going to sue to the German log
Cristian Ranaldu called him to blame him for rape "fake news," saying that people want to advertise themselves, using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German log of Der Spiegel, who published these accusations.
The Forward of Portuguese and Juventus was accused of rape by American Katherine Mayorga in the hotel room in Los Vegas in 2009.
Then he, like he paid her $755,000 for silence, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
In the Instagram Live 33-year-old Ranaldu, 142 million of his subscribers turned to a few hours after the publication of the accusations, calling that the message "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's messages are fake news," said the five-time owner of the Gold Ball in front of the camera.
"They want to make a advertisement on my name.
It's okay.
They want to become famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of my work.
I'm a happy and kind man," he added with a smile.
Ranaldo's lawyers are preparing the case against Der Speegel's log on the charges that called "incorrect suspicion report in private," reports the Reuters agency.
The Advocate Christian Shertz said that the player would require compensation for the "moral damage in the sum that corresponds to the difficulty of violations of rights, and in recent years it may be the most serious violation of personal rights."
As if there was a incident in June 2009 at Palms Houtel and Casinov's hotel room in Los Vegas.
Meeting at Ranald and Mayorgo's night club as if they were back in the football room, where he was as if he raped her analytically, as it was written in the documents of the District Court of Clark in Nevada.
Myorga claims that after that, Ranald's turning up and saying that on "99 percent" he's a "good boy" who suffers from a "one per cent".
The documents claim that Ranald admitted that they had sex, but on the other hand.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took a picture of damages in the hospital, but then agreed to a condemnation settlement, because she was very afraid of revenge and she was worried that she was "publically brought."
A 34-year-old woman says she wants to rebuild the accusation because she feels morally injured for that case.
In time, if this case had been placed, Ranald was going to go to the Modern Real with the Manchester United, and this summer he moved to the Italian Yuventus, closing a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexcit: Britain will always relieve the loss of car builders
Britain "forever regrets" when losing its status of the world's car leader after Brexcit, said the Minister for Business Greg Clark.
He added that it was "restrained" the statement of Toyota UK for BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, the company would temporarily reduce production in a factory in Bernastone, near Derby half.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the effect of delaying on the boundary resulting from Brexcit without an agreement could lead to reducing jobs.
The Bernastone Facility, where Toyota Auris and Avensis were being performed last year, released almost 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"I think when Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, the production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernastone.
Other car manufacturers in Britain raised the question of how transboundary trade will be done when Britain gets out of the EU without an agreement, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says he'll close his Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexcit.
The main concern is that the car builders are talking about the risk of supply chains as a result of Brexcit without agreement.
The Toyota's production line is working on the basis of "exactly in time" when the spare parts arrived every 37 minutes from the suppliers both in Britain and in the EU for cars that are ordered.
If Britain leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there may be breakdowns on the boundaries that will lead to delay and lack of parts.
For Toyota, it will not be possible to keep in a factory in Derby more than a daily stock of parts, said the company, so the production will stop.
Mr. Clark stated that the "Plan Checkers" Teresa May's future relations with the EU were "successfully done to avoid these border checks".
"We need an agreement, and we want to get the best agreement that will not only allow the success of today but also allow us to use this opportunity," he said in today's BBC Radio 4.
"The information that we receive not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers suggests that we should be able to continue working successful supply chains."
The Toyota company couldn't tell how long it would not work, but for the future, it warned that it was added to the cost of reducing the competitiveness of the factory and would reduce jobs.
Peter Tülaris, who has been working in Bernastone for 24 years and is a co-ordinator of the trade union, said that the members of the Union are very concerned, "In my experience, when jobs are reduced, they are no longer renewable.
The press secretary of the government said, "We offered a precise plan of our future relations with the EU, which deserves confidence."
The White House states that the Trampo meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again
The very important meeting of Donald Tramp with the Assistant General Prosecutor Rhode Rosenstein could be "deferred for another week", while fighting around the candidate to the Supreme Court of Breta Cavano, said a representative of the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is supervising the work of a special advisor Robert Muller, who is studying the involvement of Russia's elections, the tramp association with Russia and the potential obstacle to justice by the President.
Release Tramp's assistant of the general prosecutor or not, and thus put Muller's independence in danger, for months the butter in the fire of the Washington loops.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record talks with Tramp, and the possibility to remove the president from the mission by using 25 amendments.
Rosenstein has denied it.
But last Monday he went to the White House among the rumors about that he was going to fall retired.
Instead, it was announced that Thursday would be a meeting with Tramp, who was at the time at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York.
Tramp said that he wouldn't want to leave Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflicts at the senate court office where Cavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blacey Ford.
On Friday, Tramp ordered to conduct a weekly FBI investigation a statement against Cavano, which has slowed the voting at the Senatu.
The press briefcase Tramp Sara Sanders appeared in the Sunday Fox News Program.
When she was asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date is not yet intended, perhaps this week, maybe next, and I think, rather a week later, taking into account all the other things that have happened in the case of the Supreme Court.
But everything will happen, and I always give press the most new information."
Some journalists are willing to condemn her claim: Sanders did not take briffs for pressing in the White House of September 10th.
The leading programs of Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the rare briffing is not a disregard to teleporters who work for the public, although she added, "I agree with the fact that they work for the public."
Then she said that the trampo's direct contact and press would increase.
"The President is meeting more with the press issues than any president before him," she said, adding no specific facts, "We've studied these numbers."
Briefings are happening, said Sanders, but "if the press has a chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than doing it through me.
We're trying to do this often, you've seen us doing this in the last few weeks, and the meetings that you can ask the president's questions are to replace the briefings."
Tramp regularly answers questions whether he leaves the White House or participates in meetings on the streets, or on press conferences with high foreign visitors.
The press conference of the president himself is rarely happening.
This week, the president in New York showed why, if he was free and sometimes extravagant in front of the reporters.
Health Minister wrote to workers from EU countries in Scotland's health system against Brexit
The Minister for Health wrote to EU workers working in the Scotland health system to express his gratitude on behalf of the country and wish them to remain after Brexit.
Jan Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain got out of the EU.
The Scottish government is already willing to cover the cost of residence claims from EU citizens who work in state services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "In summer, talks between Britain and the EU have continued to go out of our country, and they lead to the expected solutions to this fall.
But the British government also accelerated training to a script without an agreement.
I know that for all of you it's a very troubled time.
So I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of his nationality.
My colleagues from all EU countries, and not only give valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services, also benefit patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us."
Cristion Abercrombi carried out an emergency operation after a head trauma
Linnbacker Team Tennessee State Tigers Christian Abercrombi carried out an emergency operation after he got a head trauma in the Sunday match, which his team played 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ from Tennessean.
The chief trainer Tennessee State Rod Reed told the reporter that the trauma of the player had received shortly before the break.
"He moved to the sideline and suddenly fell," said Reed.
Trainers and medicinaries gave Abercombi acid still in the field before putting it into violence and moving to diagnosis.
The Tennessee State Professor told Chris Harris from the WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombi was operated in the Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that there was no "detail about what it was" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when the player got a trauma.
Abercombi, second-sportsman, takes the first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five full captures, which gives only 18 catches in the season.
Foreign buyers of British immunity will pay for a bigger messenger
According to the new conservatory plan foreign British buyers of immunity will pay more high mail and extra money will go to help homeless
This action neutralizes the success of Corbin's initiative on the involvement of young voters
The elevation of the state mail will turn on those who don't pay taxes in Britain
The Ministry of Finance plans to get up to 120 million pounds a year for helping homeless
Today, Teresa May announces that foreign buyers of British immunity will pay a higher state mail and extra money will go to help the homeless.
This is how to neutralize Jeremy Corbin's success in attracting young voters, as well as offer an accommodation. It is directed to people with high income.
The elevation of a state mail is directed to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain will go to the government's homeless housing program.
The elevation of the current state shelter, including the higher levels taken two years ago, for the purchase of other houses and housing for rent can be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13 percent of the new constructions in London are purchased by British non-governmentals, which leads to raised prices and new buyers are hard to buy their first housing.
Many rich regions of the country, especially the capital, have become "grads-priests", because a large number of buyers are outside the borders, most of the time they live not in Britain.
The new policy appeared literally a few weeks after the invitation of Boris Johnson to reduce the state mail for young buyers to facilitate the acquisition of the first housing.
He accused major construction firms of contenting high prices to immunity by the capture of land and utilization of it, and called upon Mrs. May to cancel quotas to the available housing to manage the "human position with housing" in Britain.
Mr Corbin announced a voting series of housing reforms, including the control of rents and the cessation of "unsensitive" expulsion.
He also wants to give the local council more powers in housing building.
"Mistress May said last year, "I said that I would devote my job at the post of the Prime Minister to the resuming of the British dream -- life for each new generation should be better.
This means improving our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always be open for those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it is unfair that persons who don't live in Britain and foreign companies can buy immunity as well as easy as British employees.
For too many people, the dream of having their own house is getting more inaccessible, and the problem of homeless remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My main ambition is to manage Scotlandic assembly."
Trainer Sanderland, Jack Ross, said that his main ambition would be once become a Scotland coach.
The 42-year-old Scotch is renewing from the northeastern club, which is now in the third place of the First League, in three points from the first.
He moved to this job in summer after he returned St. Meren to the Scot Prime League last season.
"I wanted to speak for my country as a player."
But it failed," said Ross in the transfer of BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"I grew up, frequently sick of Scotland at the Hampden stadium with my father, and something always made me come back.
However, this is the opportunity to appear when I'm a successful club trainer."
Between Ross' precedents at the Sanderland Trainer, Dick Lawyer, David Moys, Sam Alardays, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kin, Gus Poye, and Paula Di Kanya.
The former Aloa Atletic trainer says that I didn't feel fear of such famous names in such a big club, previously rejecting the proposals from Barnsley and Ipswick Tawn.
"I will now be able to answer the question: "Can I be able to return this club to the Premier League?"
Due to the structure and material database of the club, his place must be in the Prime Minister Lisa," he said.
"It's not just returning it there, but I'll consider my job successful only if I can return there's a club."
Ross has only been a trainer for three years before he was a trainer in Dumbarton, and he worked 15 months in the Harts Coach.
Then he helped Aloa return with the third League and turned St. Meren from a loser who almost got into the Championship in the winner of the next season.
Ross says it's more comfortable now than during his career in Clayd, Hartlpool, Falkirk, St. Meren, and Hamilton Academycal.
Speaking of the work at Hello, he said, "It was a really important choice."
"I really believed that training was what I needed, even more than a game.
It sounds unbelievable because I worked well, earned well and made some heights.
But the game can be difficult.
There's a lot of things to do every week.
I'm going through this now when we talk about stress and pressure, but the training work is what we need.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing this, and for me it's the best time of my grown life."
The full interview can be heard in the Sports sound program on Saturday, 30 September at Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 by British summer time

The hot summer increased the revenue of British pabs fighting for survival, but it brought pressure on the restaurants networks.
According to the statistics of the group of pabs and bars, the sales increase was 2.7 per cent in July, but the sales volume decreased by 4.8 per cent in restaurants.
Peter Martin, from the CGA Consultative Business Group, who collected this statistics, said: "The long-term solar weather and longer than it was expected, participated in English assembly at the World Championship in the World's final, means that in July, there was what happened in June, when sales increased by 2.8 per cent, and here the restaurants suffered even more.
Sales reduction in restaurants by 1.8 per cent in June, just deteriorated in July.
The bars and bars, which mostly sell drinks until they showed the best result than the restaurants.
The stones that sell more food also got hot on the sun, although not as much as the restaurant.
Looks like people just wanted to drink.
In the bars and bars, the drinks grew by 6,6 per cent, and the sales of food decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, a RSM analyst on rest and place, said, "This is the trend that we see at the end of April.
The weather and impact of important social and sports events remain the most important factors when it comes to the volumes of sale on the public food market.
It's not surprising that the restaurants continue to fight, because the sales decreased by 4.8 per cent a year, and it's very unpleasant when the costs are continuously growing.
The long and hot summer came in the worst time for operators who focused on food, and time will show whether low temperatures in August will bring such expected relief."
The total sales growth in puppies and restaurants, including recently open, was in July 2,7 per cent, reflecting the slowness in the exploitation of brands.
The British sales tool, bars and restaurants Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyses data about the productivity of 47 acting groups that have a shared removal of 9 billion pounds and is an important orienter of this branch.
Every fifth child has a secret account in social networks which it hides from parents
Study showed that each fifth child — some were filled only 11 — has secret accounts in social networks that hide from parents and teachers
Studying 20,000 secondary students showed the growth of the Fake Insta pages
That news warmed the fear that there's a sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a basic account showing to their parents
Every fifth child -- some only filled with 11 -- creates accounts in social networks that keep in secret from parents.
Study of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in the Fake Insta accounts, which are like leading to the Instagram Photos Exchange website.
The news warmed fears that there are sexual contents.
Twenty percent of students said they were running "pure" "basic" accounts to show to their parents, and also conduct private accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found a secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, found out that she encouraged others to rape me.
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the conference of independent school directors (HMC) found that 40 percent of adolescents between 11 and 18 were two profiles, and half of them admitted that they had secret accounts.
The head of HMC Mike Buchanan said, "It's very worried that so many teenagers want to create places on the Internet where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Ailid Doyle will be the Sports Voice in the Scott Council of Light Athletics.
Alyd Doyle was elected to the Scottish Council of Light Athletics as a observer of the Council at the annual general meeting of this body.
Doyle, the most titled Scotland architecture and President Yan Beathi, described this event as a great opportunity for those who have sports, to gain a lot of benefits from its experience at different levels, including internationally in the past decade.
"Aylid enjoys great respect in Scotland, Britain and the world's sports community, and we're sure that a light athlete in Scotland will get a lot of useful work in the Council," said Bittie.

The American who won the gold at 200 and 400 metres away at the Allimpiade 1996 in Atlanta, and another two gold medales on other alimpics, and who now works as an expert at BBC, can't walk after he survived the microiverse.
He wrote on Twitter, "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will show if I'm going to go to what extent.
It was a hard job, but I'm completely fixed, I'm learning to walk again, and now I'm doing practices on a rhythm!
Thank you for the message with support!"
The milk pump advertisement, where mothers compared to cows, divided the opinions on the Internet
The company on the production of milk pumps divided the presumptions by releaseing a advertising compared to feeding women with cows that are breast-feeding.
To note what they call the first milk pump in the world, the Elvie consumer company released an ironical musical advertisement on the basis of a video to show the freedom that this device gives mother feeding.
Four real mothers dance in a store with cows under a song, where there are these words: "Yes, I give myself, but I don't have my tail," and "If you didn't notice, it's not my chest, it's my chest."
And he said, "Day, give, I feed children, give, give, I give my women."
However, the advertising that was located on Facebook's website has caused a hot discussion on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and the video reactions were misunderstanding, many said that it was a horror of milk production.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this production.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and be born to give milk, so here's only their children pick up in a few days," said one watcher.
Elvie's milk pump is hidden in a boustgaltary for feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "Aye, it's a traumatic trauma for both the mother and the child.
But why don't we use them for milk pumps for mothers who don't take their children?"
Someone added, "That's such an unprofound advertisement."
Others were defending the advertisement, and one woman wrote that she thought the song was a funny.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd like to have one if she was feeding her chest.
The smoking of milk makes me feel like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I liked it.
It's a brilliant product," she wrote.
Another comment: "A very fun advertisement directed to the mothers who suck milk pumpy, often at work or toilet, and they hear themselves "cows."
This advertisement does not excite or condemns the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they were all dancing with invisible milk pumps hidden in the boustgalters.
The concept of the advertising company is that many women who use milk pumps feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump pump is totally soundless, has no strings, no pipes, and is hiding unseemly in a bowl for feeding women, gives women freedom of movement, allows children to be kept and even leave the house while the tool is working.
Anna Balarin, a partner and creative director of Mother, noticed: "Elvie Pump is so revolutionary that deserves a clear and provocative launch.
The proper parallel between feeding women and milk cows, we wanted to pay attention to the smoking of milk and its difficulties, while demonstrating a fun and good way, as a new milk pump would bring an extraordinary freedom of movement.
Already not the first time the Elvie milk pump falls into the center of attention.
During the London week of fashion, two children appeared on a dining floor from Martha Jacobski, using this product.
Thousands of migrants without noise to the tent camp on the Texas Limit
While the number of borders has almost changed, the number of detained migrant children rapidly increased, partly the cause of this is a cruel rhythm and politics conducted by the Trampo administration, which has obsessed the placement of children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors are illegal immigrants who are afraid to threaten their own stay in the country, taking responsibility for the child.
The risks have grown significantly in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential sponsor and other adolescent members of households would need to pass their fingerprints and the data will be transferred to the immigration body.
Last week, Matthew Olbans, a high-level Immigration and Customs Officer, spoke to the Congress with a report on arrests by the agency of dozens of people who requested to finance minors without accompanying.
Later, the agency reported that 70% of the arrested had no trials before.
"At about 80 percent of those who are sponsors or members of their households are illegal in the country, and a significant part of them are foreigners with criminal past.
So we continue to persecute such people," said Mr. Olbens.
For a faster processing of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court for a month after the date of detention, and, according to the shelter employees, the standard term was 60 days earlier.
A large number of people will have to use video links, not personally in court to make a statement of their own immigration status.
Those who don't think there's any reason to help are quickly deported.
According to the shelter workers and the message from the sources in the system that have appeared in the past months, the longer the children remain in prison, the higher the probability of depression or an increase in anxiety, which may lead to explosions of violence or attempts of escape.
Advocates claim that in more major institutions, such as Tarnillah, these problems are much stronger, since the signs of the child being in a hot condition are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the establishment.
They add that moving children into the tent clock without giving time for emotional training or for good-bye to friends could make a worse trauma that many have already encountered.
Serbia requires an immediate withdrawal of the US, France and Turkey
In turn to the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Valid al-Mual, also called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the war that continues in the country eighth year.
Mualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegal in Syrian land, on the basis of counter-terrorism, and "will be treated accordingly."
"They must leave immediately and without making any conditions," he said at the meeting of the Assembly.
Mualem insisted that in Serbia, where more than 360 000 people had died since 2011, and millions had to drop their houses, “the war against terrorism was practically over.”
He reported that Damascus intends to continue "to lead this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence".
In Serbia, about 2,000 US soldiers, who mainly play the role of instructors and advisors of the forces of Kurds and Syrian Arabs, who are opposed to President Bashar Asad.
The land contingent of France in this ruined war country is over 1,000 soldiers.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem stated that the conditions for returning were favourable and accused "some Western countries" in the "distribution of irrational fears", which contain refugees to foreign refugees.
"We urge the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to their return," he said.
"They are politicizing a very humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warn that Serbia will not be renewed until the political agreement will be reached between the Assad and the opposition.
The U.N. diplomats reported that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last major scope of the Idlibe Rebels has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented the widespread attack of Syrian forces, supported by the Russian to the province where three million people live.
However, Mualm emphasized that the agreement had the "precise terms" and hoped that military action would be directed against dżihadists, including fighters associated with the Al-Qaida Front of Nusra, which would be "destroyed".
The UN Ambassador Stafan de Missoura hopes to summon the first sessions of the new Bureau, which will be accompanied by representatives of government and opposition to develop a consensus for Syria and make a way to elections.
Mualem expressed the terms of the participation of the Syrian Government in the Bureau, saying that the Commission's work should be limited by "preview of articles of the Constitution", and a warning against interference.
Why Tramp will go for the second term
According to this logic, Mr. Tramp won the elections of 2020, where many liberal viewers, impeachment and scandal hopefully do not complete his presidency.
And that will be, of course, "The very dramatic final of the presidency in all history!"
There are no signs of tiredness of the viewers at the moment.
Since 2014 the Prime Time ratings have grown more than twice to 1.05 million per CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million per MSNBC.
According to Nelsen, the Fox News in the average of 2,4 million viewers in the Prime Time compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the transfer of the Rachel Maddow Show of the MSNBC channel gathered at the screen with 3,5 million viewers and overcasted TV ratings at the evening when the main news was transferred.
"This is the fire to which people go because we don't understand it," says Neil Barr, director of the ABC Drama "Reminder" about a member of the Cabinet of Ministers who becomes president after the attack that the Capitol destroyed.
In Nelly Scowell, a mastitised scriptistic comedie and authors of the books "Pair of Funny Details and a few hard truths about the invasion into the Hollywood Boys Club," there is another theory.
She mentioned a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Tramp.
- Why? - she asked.
He replied, "Because he's having me fun," said Miss Scowell.
The chaos is valuable yet and what can entertain.
Of course, unlike all the other television, the historical lines that come out of Washington may become the same definitive future as the Wade Row case, depends on whether the families of immigrants will be able to bring together and the health of the world's economy.
Ignoring is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, when you watch a six-hour group of experts discuss the use of Bob Woodward's "information not for printing" in the book "Strach", the jacket of Paul Manofort for 15,000 dollars with a strussy skin (references with vulnerability, as wrote in the Washington Post), and the consequences of the strict descriptions of Storm Daniels, Mr. Tramp's anatomy, it comes beyond a simple framework of wishing to be in the course of things.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario as I used to.
"The part of what he's doing makes you feel like you're looking at a reality show that he shows every evening," says Brent Montgomery, executive director Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the author of "Pawn Stars" (Pawn Stars as walks) about the changing actress of the Tramp show and the constant turning of the story, "Sparing" of NFL, the approval of Kim Chen Yena).
You can't afford to miss even one episode, or you'll be off the trend.
When I talked to Mr. Flace this week, behind his house's windows on the northern coast of Kawai stood hot sunny day and 30 degrees warm, but he was sitting in and watching MSNBC while writing CNN.
He couldn't blow off, not when Brett Cavanaugh rebelled in front of the Senate Court Bureau, discussing the future of the Supreme Court, which was hanging on hair.
"I remember the days when we were making these crazy shows, and people said, "It's the beginning of the west civilization," Mr. Flace told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be right."

External currency streams fit into a severe pre-selection race of intermediate elections into the representation room
It's not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania Election District has covered the cash hall thanks to the change in the borders of the districts enrolled in the Congress, which makes two candidates engage in elections at one place.
The recently remarked Pitzburg area is surrounded by a democrat, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of Conar Lamb, who won his place in another district at the spring electoral electoral electorals.
Lambu opposes another acting deputy, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who presents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is much in line with the new 17th.
The maps were remashed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the voices of the old districts were non-constitutionally considered for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has caused a decline in financing by the financial groups of major parties, the Committee of the Congress of the Democratic Company (CCDC) and the National Bureau of the Republican Company (NRC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a complex victory at widely dedicated electoral elections in the 18th district of Pennsylvania in March.
This place has been taken by the Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Tramp won the county with 20 points.
Political experts have a little preference for democrats.
The United States appreciated the possibility of execution of El Salvador for the support of China and then retreated
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already supported the position of Beijing, despite the slight opposition by Washington.
Mr. Tramp held a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Warrell in June 2017 and settled in a hotel in Panama until the partners moved the Trampo team.
The representatives of the State Department decided to revoke US diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with the "new decisions on the failure of Taiwan," said the press Secretary of the State Department of Heather Nauert at the beginning of this month.
However, the sanctions were considered only in relation to El Salvador, who received about 140 million dollars of US aid in 2017, including drug remedies, development and economic support.
Suggested sanctions, including reducing financial assistance and target restrictions on granting visas, would be painful for the Central America country with its high level of unemployment and murders.
As the completion of internal meetings, representatives of the North and Central America postponed a conference at a high level, dedicated security and economic prosperity, which would be a continuation of a similar meeting last year, which was considered as a step in the efforts to prevent immigration in the United States.
But by the middle of September, the high-level representatives of the administration continued to realize that they wanted the conference to take place and actually to stop considering Salvador's punishment.
According to the diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pension will now be presented at a conference designed in the middle of October, in a sign that the administration serves as an event.
And three American ambassadors, without noise, returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new cruel messengers or punishments from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debates that were described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues in terms of preserving anonymity.
Their messages are confirmed by other analysts close to their administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
Learn History
The next step can be the report of a special prosecutor Robert Mueller about possible obstacle to the justice of Mr. Tramp, which is now a very difficult evidence in public nature documents.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller pointed out in an investigation on the conspiracy of Trampo and Russia in the electoral attack.
When Congress will change the master, Mr. Tramp will turn to the face of responsibility to this body, just as he is preparing to speak again to the voters, and perhaps at the end, to the jury with the number of his colleagues.
There's a lot of "if" and I don't want to say that Mr. Tramp's fall is inevitable, just like that in Europe.
We all, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make a choice that determines how long the fight will take.
In 1938, the German officers were ready for a state turn against Hitler, if only the West had given him the collaboration and support of Czechoslovakia in München.
We failed and missed the possibility of avoiding the next years of bloodshed.
The story is turning around these fractures, and the unpleasant democracy march will be accelerated or delayed.
Right now, the Americans have encountered several of these fractures.
What happens when Mr. Tramp fires the Deputy General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the paper was written that he suggested that the president's words were secretly written and thought about his prophysiciality last year.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the transfer of the Times is incorrect.
"How will we react if the recent FBI investigation in the case of Brett Cavanaugh is not comprehensive or fair, or if he is confirmed in the Supreme Court, despite trusted accusations in sexual violence and unfair indications?
And first of all, will we vote in elections for the Congress, which will bring Mr. Tramp to responsibility?
If we don't get through these trials, the democracy will come for a long winter.
But I believe we won't fail because of the lesson I've taken in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew who deployed the same Nazi mode in Asvencim that once bought my Ambassador's house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and after 60 years, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on this table with a swastik.
With such inheritance, how can I not be a optimist in relation to our future?"

Graham Dorance from Raigers optimistically set up a game from Rapid Vienna
The Raigers are taking Villeall on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians after the impressive night in Spain over this month will allow them to leave the G League of Europe.
The triumf of the knee prevented Graham Dorans' season for the first time to speak to anyone 2-2 with Villeagueal, but he believes that Rangers will be able to use this as a tramplin.
"It was an important match for us, because "Villareal" is a strong competitor," he thinks a 31-year-old footballist.
"We started the game, thinking we could get something, and we earned the score.
Maybe at the end, we could have killed the ball, but the whole ball also became a good result.
They looked better in the first time, but in the second we took ourselves together, and we had the best half of the field.
On Thursday, there will be another important night for European football.
I hope we can earn three scores, but it'll be a hard game, since they showed a good result in the last game, but given the crowd of triggers, I'm sure we can handle them and show a good game.
Last year was definitely hard, both because of my trauma and changes in the club, but now we have a factor of confidence.
The team is good, and the boys are really enjoying the game; training is productive.
I hope we can move forward, overcome the outcome of the past season and make success."
Women lose their sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants had the exact idea of who they wanted to care for themselves, some of them had talked about it with their family.
About half of the people who participated in a national study reported that they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking about this with their children.
"People want family members to take care of them, but do not make steps to discuss it," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationalwide on life insurance.
That's where we're going to start.
Rather with your husband and children: Your family will not be ready to help you, if you fail to sound your wishes.
Work with your consultant and your family and discuss where and how to get medical assistance, because this choice can become an important factor in determining the cost.
Drag for a financial consultant. It can also help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include a traditional insurance policy of long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy that can help cover these expenses or you can provide your own life -- provided you have money.
So let's deal with legal documents: let's see the court batteries.
Please be confident of the medical service to appoint a trusted person to control your medical services and to provide specialists with your wishes in case you can't talk.
Besides, consider the possibility of exercising trust in finances.
Appoint a trusted person to make financial decisions and provide payments for your accounts if you're inadequate.
Remember details: Imagine your older father needs immediate medical assistance, and he's on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about forbidden drugs and allergies?
Dock this type of writing details to be ready.
"It's not just financial matters, but also professionalism of doctors," added Martin.
"What are the meds required?
Who'll take care of the dog?
We have to plan everything."

The Federal Prosecutor requires a rare death sentence for the suspect in the terror in New York
The Federal Prosecutor in New York is in charge of a death penalty for Cyful Sayipup, suspected of a terror in New York, who was killed by eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipol, 30 years ago, in October, was like using a busy truck by the Home Depot company to hit a highway along the West Side Highway in the lower Manhattan, beating pedestrians and velosipedists on his way.
To afford a death sentence, by a notice of the intention of a death penalty imposed in the Southern County of New York, the prosecutors must prove that Sayip "intentionally" beat eight people and "intentionally" caused serious body damage.
According to the matter of the court, for both violations, there is a possible measure of punishment as a mortal punishment.
Several weeks after the attack, the large federal jury's investigation shocked out of a 22-point prosecution, which included eight murder charges to support the racket; this item is usually used by federal prosecutors in the case of organized crime, as well as the accusation of violence and the destruction of transport.
According to the prosecutors, the attack was required by "authorized and deliberate planning" and described the crimes committed by the Sovip, used the phrases such as "aggressive, cruel and disgusted".
"Saifula Habibuyevicz Saipol caused trauma, caused damage, and brought losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrike Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Anne-Lore Decadt, Daren Drake, Arriel Erlio, Ernon Feruch, Ernon Diego Mendos and Alejandro Damien Pagnuk, is told in his intentions.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
Since the last start of a criminal case with the penalty measure as a mortal core in the Southern County of New York has been over ten years.
Detective Halid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but at the end, he was sentenced to consumption in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty in New York for a federal case was applied in 1953 before Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage couple, sentenced after they two years earlier were convicted for covenant for spying on the benefit of the Soviet Union during the cold war.
A couple of Rosenbergs were punished on the electric chair on June 1953.
Sayipup, a walker from Uzbekistan, according to the judicial documents, demonstrated the absence of the doctrine of conscience in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he said he was following that he felt satisfied with his actions.
According to the prosecution, Sayippew informed the authorities that he was inspired to see the Islamic State video on the phone when he attacked him.
He also asked for permission to hang the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital palace, said the police.
He doesn't recognise himself as guilty of the accused conclusion, which consists of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the Federal Public Protectors representing Saipov, said that they were "usually disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision of applying the death penalty rather than on the consumption prison without the exemption, only extend the pain from these events for all the participants," said Paton.
The Saipava Protection Command has previously asked the prosecutors not to be punished.
The parliamentary member of Tora says that Nigel Farage has to run the Brexcit negotiations.
Today, during the protest at the Tora Nigel Farage Party party, he swore to mobilize the People's Army.
The former leader Ukip said that politicians should "responsive discomfort" from eurosceptics, because one of the members of the Parliament of Tereza May offered its candidature for negotiations with the EU.
The parliamentary member of the Conservatorial Party, Peter Bone, said during the Birmingham march that Britain would have already "exited" if Mr. Faraz had taken the position of a secretary on Brexcit.
But the problem with which Mrs. May encountered, trying to reconcile her distinct followers, was still worsening when the Torres who served for the EU's preservation of membership took a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain a compromise Checker's agreement under constant pressure by his followers and exit servants, as well as the EU itself.
Allies insist on trying to make a deal with Brussels despite the negative response, and they want to make eurosceptics and leuborists choose between its package and the noncondition.
Mr. Bone said at the miting in Salihale "Leave Means Leave" that he wants to "free Checker off the board."
He suggested that Mr. Farage made equal and set up obligations for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we'd have already gone," he said.
The parliamentary member of Wellingbourg added, "I am for Brexit, but we need to get away from the Checker Plan."
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We didn't lead world wars to be dependent.
We want to exercise our own laws in our country."
Mr Bone refused to assume that the public thought changed after the vote of 2016: "The idea that the British had changed their minds and wanted to remain is completely incompatible with the reality."
Brexit's advocate and Tora's member, Andrea Jenkins was also on the march, and she said, "I just want to say, "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Checker's plan is unpopular among the broad audiences, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and activists who actually come out and pick us.
Please give up your plan and start listening."
In a sudden turn to Mrs. May, she added, "The Prime Ministers are staying at the mission when they carry out their promises."
Mr. Farage said that politicians should be forced to "reach discomfort" if they're going to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of confidence between the people and the politics," he said.
"They're trying to betray Braxcita, and we're here today to tell them, "It won't come out of your hands."
In turn to the excited crowd, he added, "I want you to make our policies that are ready to betray Braxcita feel discomfort.
"We mobilize the national army of this country that gave us victory in Brexite, and we never calm down until we become an independent, self-directed, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the exit enemy went through Birmingham before conducting a two-hour miting in the center of the city.
Several activists were waving the Tories Against Brexit banners after starting a group on this weekend.
The Leiborist Pear Lord Adanis thanked the conservators for the security problems they encountered from the party program at the opening of the conference.
"Those are people who tell us that they can be ready to use the IT system and all technology for Canada plus, for the boundaries without shaking, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a full farce.
Such a thing as good Brexit. there is no," he added.
Warren plans to pay close attention to the president's chat process.
The U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the elections in November, she will "will pay close attention to the president's chatting process."
The Boston Globe reports that a democrat from the state of Massachusetts told about her future on Saturday during a common meeting in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, the frequent criticism of President Donald Tramp, is going to go to a re-election, opposes her a member of the Republican Party Jeff Dill, who was a meeting of the Trampo company in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was in the center of the discussion as a possible competitor of Tramp in 2020.
Since Tramp's entry into position, this was the 36th meeting with the general meeting voters, which went on Saturday afternoon in Halioke.
One of the participants asked if she planned to speak to the President's position.
Warren replied that it was time for "wife to go to Washington to repair the broken government, and for that it should be a woman."
The arrest took place after the death of a basketballist Simms from the University of Louisiana
The Baton Rouge Police, Louisiana, announced Saturday that a suspect in killing a basketballist was arrested on Friday.
The Police Control of Baton Rouge announced an arrest of 20-year-old Ditan Simpson during the press conference that went at 11 a.m. at east time.
Friday they published a shooting video with a request to help identify the man who was on it.
The 20-year-old Simms was shot Friday morning at the South University campus.
"Wade Simms got a fire wound in his head as a result of his death," said on Saturday to the journalists of the 247sports police chief Murphy J. Paul.
Wade took a friend and was shot by Simpsan.
During the interrogation, Simpson confessed what was at the crime scene, was armed and shot at Wade Simms.
The Simpson did not resist the arrest and was taken under custody in the police office of the East Baton Rose County.
Sportsman-junior growing 6 feet, 6 inches (20 inch) grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games last season, from which 10 was on the edge from the beginning, spent 17.4 minutes in the middle, pumping 5.6 points and 2.9 games.
Gran Pri Russia: Louis Hamilton approached the title of the world champion after the internal agreement won the victory of Sebastian Fetel
Since Valtery Bothos was on Saturday at Louis Hamilton's qualifications, it became clear that the indications from the Mercedes team would play a significant role in the race.
The booth pulled a good place on the rack and almost left Hamilton on the loose of destiny, until he defended his place in the first two chains and invited Fetel to attack his friend on the team.
The fetchelle first went to the pit stop and left Hamilton screaming at the end of the total mass of the racers, and this maneuver was to be a decisive maneuver.
The Mercedes pilot went on a circle later and came behind Fetel, but Hamilton went forward after a few round-in-colled maneuvers that forced the Ferrari to leave the inside space free, risking to stay behind after a double maneuver to deploy on the third turn.
Max Ferstopen, on his 21st birthday, started from the back of the grid and to the end of the first circle, was in the seventh place.
Then he lied most of the race as they kept the tyres, for he wanted to finish quickly, to override Kimmy Reycana and take the fourth seat.
As a result, he went on a pit stop on the 44th circle, but he couldn't increase speed on the rest of the eight circles, so Ryan took the fourth seat.
It was a tough day, because Walter's all weekend spoke fantasticly and expressed himself to the true gentleman when I was allowed to say so.
"Command has done an outstanding job to take the first and second place," said Hamilton.
It was really a bad body language
President Donald Tramp laughed at Senator Diana Fainstein's miting on Saturday because she insisted that she was not the source of the evasion of a letter from Christine Blacey Ford, which accused the candidate at the Supreme Court of Breta Kawana in sexual violence.
Speaking of mything in Western Virginia, the president did not address the evidence that Ford was in front of the Senate Court Bureau, instead of commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed how people could be "substantial, disgusting and untrusted."
"The only thing that may happen, and the beautiful thing that happens in the past few days in the Senatu, is if you see anger, if you see the wicked, nasty and liar people," he said.
"When you read about press releases and escapes, and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diana Finnstein, is this your escape?
Remember her answer... you lost the document -- "Oh, oh, what?"
No, no.
I didn't have anything."
Wait a minute.
We allowed a escape -- no, we didn't," he added, paradigming the Senator.
In July, Fainstein sent a letter with a detailed interpretation of the Ford's accusations against Cavan, and he fled at the beginning of September -- but Phinestein refused to escape from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't let her history escape," said the Fainstein Bureau, reports the Hill.
"She asked the story to remain confidential and I satisfied her request."
But her denial probably didn't like the president who commented so at the Saturday miting, "I'm telling you, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but this is the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing the protection of the candidate to the Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president assumed that democrats were using accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to restore their power by any means.
You can see the faintness, the merrence, and they don't care who they're hurting, who they're going to have to cross to get power and control," the words of the President's "Mediaite".
Ellite League: Dandie Stars – Belfast Jayants 5-3
Patrick Duyer killed two balls for Jayants in a game against Dundee
Dandi Stars played a Friday defeat that Belfast Jayants in the Ellite League, wining a back game with 5-3 in a home game on Saturday.
Thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boville Jayants were leading for two bays at the beginning.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney have equated the number before Dwight restored Jayants' leadership.
François Bushar of Dundy equated the number, and then Lucas Lundwald Nilsen made two heads a victory team.
It was the third defeat in the Ellite League in the season for Adam Kiff's team, who defeated Dundy with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The commands met fourth time in the season; in the last three matches, Jayants won.
The first goal at the fourth minute of the match (03:35) killed Duyer from Kendall McFoll's fall, and four minutes later, Bavilla doubled the number after David Rutherford's fall.
In the emergency first period (13:10) Sullivan opened the number from the masters of the field, and then the Kaun equated the number after the transfer of Matt Markward (15:16).
The Duyer provided Jayants leadership at the first break, killing his second bat for meeting at the end of the first period.
By regrouping the side, Bouchar re-equalised the account by killing the score when the command was numbered (27:37).
Caun and Charles Carcoran helped Nilsen to lead Dundee to the first time for the match at the end of the second period, and he provided victory with the fifth team in the middle of the last period.
The Jayants, who have lost four of the last five meetings, have played the last game on the housefield against Milton Caines on Friday.
The air carrier is dead, saving hundreds of passengers from the earthquake
Aviation controller in Indonesia died heroically by providing a successful flight of a plane with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared without news after a big earthquake on Sulaves Island on Friday, which caused tsunami.
Strong underground strikes are still on, and many people are buried under the fractions in the city of Paul.
While his colleagues were rescued by escapes, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his position in the dispatch elevation, which was wild at the airport of Palo Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
He remained as long as the ship was 6321 of the Batik Air, which was at that moment on the airline, was deployed from the ground.
Then he jumped out of the dispatch, when he decided it was ruining.
Later he died in the hospital.
According to the Australian ABC News program, the representative of the Air Navigation of Indonesia of Yohanes Syryte, the decision of the dispatcher may have saved hundreds of lives.
We've prepared a helicopter from Ballipopan to Collimantone, who had to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he died this morning before the helicopter flew to Paul.
"Our hearts are broken," he added.
Meanwhile, the governments of the country are afraid that the number of victims can reach a few thousand, and the agency's agency for reducing the danger of stiff disasters argues that access to the towns of Dongala, Sigi and Booton is limited.
The Professor of the Agency of Sutop Purva Nugroch said: "Maybe the number of victims will still increase, since many bodies still have failed to dig out under the fractions."
The waves reached six meters have devastated Paul, where mass burying will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes will double humanitarian assistance.
A figure of Kusom, a 35-year-old mother, said Sky News, "Each minute, the machine brings bodies.
Clear water is missing.
The stores are everywhere being made."
Ian Helfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said CNN: "Indonesia Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we don't know what they are waiting for.
It's a tragedy now, but everything can become much worse."
President of the Indonesia Jock Video arrived in Palo on Sunday and said to the soldiers, "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
Are you ready?" reports CNN.
Earlier this year in Indonesia, more than 550 people died from earthquakes in Lamboc.
Aviation accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini message one man passed out without news after the crash of a plane in the logo
Avian company, which carried out a flight, which has made an emergency landing in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, once claimed that all 47 passengers and the team were successfully evacuated from the drowning plane and now declared disappearance without the news of one passenger.
The Air Niugini company stated in the press release that as a state on Saturday, it couldn't report the location of one man's passenger.
The airline reported that she was working with local authorities, hospitals, and the following to find a man.
The airline didn't immediately report details about the passenger; for example, his age and nationality.
The local boats helped save the rest of the passengers and the team after landing the plane on the water when trying to land at the airport of the island of Chuk.
On Friday, the officials reported that seven people were in the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were staying in the hospital on Saturday; they were all stable.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unexplicit.
By the statements of both airlines and the U.S.MS, the plane landed in the lagoon without coming to the landing bar.
According to some of the witnesses, the plane jumped through the passage.
According to the American passenger, Bill Janes said that the plane was very low.
"It's very far," said Jaine.
He said he and others were able to climb the belt in the water to the emergency exits of the plane, which had already drowned.
He said that the boardroads panicked and began to scream, as well that he had received a small head trauma.
The United States states that the seafarers who were romanticized near the harbor also helped to save, using a hooked boat to transport people to the shore until the plane drowned at a depth of about 100 feet (30 meters).
According to the Air Safety Network, 111 people were killed in the crash of aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea for the past twenty years, but none of them belonged to the Air Niugini.
The analyst restores the course of events in the night when the woman was burned by a living man
On Saturday, the accusation completed the presentation of evidence in the revision of the case of a man who was accused of burning the residents of Mississippi in 2014.
Analyst of the U.S. Justice Ministry, Paul Rowlet, for a few hours, has shown as an attracted expert in the information analysis.
He described the jury as using cell phone records to reconsider the movement of 29-year-old Queenton Telis and the 19-year-old victim of Jessica Chambers at the night of her death.
As the Clarion Ledger reports, according to Rowlet, he received information about a place from several mobile phones that showed that Telis was with Chambers at the evening of her death, which contradicts his past claim.
When the data that his mobile phone was near Chambers' phone while, according to his claim, he was with his friend Michael Sanford confirmed, the police were directed to ask Senford.
Senford gave a statement on Saturday and confirmed that that day he was not in the city.
When the defendant asked whether Telis was telling the truth that Sanford was in the van that night, he said that he was lying, as my van was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was Telis' claim that he was familiar with Chambers about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone records showed that they knew each other for a week.
According to Rowlet, some time after Chambers Tellis died, he deleted her messages, calls and contacts from his phone.
"He erased it from his life," said Haley.
The side of the defense must begin the dispute of sides on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be submitted to the jury later the same day.

Persons like Akala and Lowkey returned a collective, such as Fugees and Common, popularity in Britain.
Another black?!
Nanny from New York is going to court at a marriage couple for a "racist" message after the release
The sister from New York is suing for discriminating exemption after receiving an accidentally sent message from her mother complaining that she is "other blackcore."
The couple denys that they are racists, comparing the position to the "expulsion".
In 2016, Lyncy Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment by discovering that a new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black - skinny when she arrived on her first day of work.
“NEEEEEE, JUST A CHORNAKY," said Mrs. Plasco Flaxman in her husband's message.
However, instead of sending him to his husband, she twice sent Miss Morris' message.
As the New York Post reports, when the error was understood, Plasco-Flaxman released Miss Morris, claiming that the former nanny, who was also an African, had worked badly, and that she was waiting for her instead of the Philippine.
Miss Morris paid the day of work and sent home to Uber.
Now Morris goes to court and wants to get compensation for exemption in accordance with the conditions where she was initially hired, although without a contract: $350 a day for six months with residence.
"I want to show them that you can't do this," she said "Post" on Friday. "I know this is discrimination."
A couple dismissed racism accusations, claiming that Maurice's dismissal was a reasonable decision, given that they couldn't trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent her something she shouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said the Post husband, Joel Plasco.
"And would you trust your children back to whom did you act rude, even accidentally?
Your baby?
Is it?'
Plasma compares the invitation to "restraint" and reports that his wife was born just two months ago and was in a very complex situation.
"And will you persecute a man in this position?
It's pretty hard," he added an expert on investment and banking activities.
While judicial proceedings are still on, the public thought quickly condemned a couple in social networks, criticizing their behavior and logic.
The publishers of the Paddington feared that readers would not supernationalize the bear that talks, said in a new sheet
The daughter of Bondo Karen Yankel, who was born soon after the book was accepted, wrote about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself on the place of the first reader before it was published.
So it's curious to read, already knowing about the great success of the Paddington."
She said that her father, who worked by the BBC Operator before he dared to write a book for children about a little toy bear, was optimistic, even though his work was not accepted and added that the 60th year of publication of the books was "hore-sweet" after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his final success, speaking of Poddington, who she described as a "very important member of our family."
"He was quite a quiet man, and not at all praiseful," she said.
"But as Paddington was so real to him, it was almost parental pride for the child who had something to do: you are proud of them, though it is not really your credit.
I think he was considering the success of the Paddington is exactly in such keys.
While it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave the right to the Paddington himself."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After landing her daughter was delivered to the hospital of Nice Louis Paster 2, where doctors fought for her life for nothing.
"Our regularly called to tell me that everything is really bad that she can't stand," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuza.
"Then I called over to say that she would die for the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medicines, which the doctors gave to beat her heart, slowly left her body.
She died a while ago, and it was the most ending.
I just had to sit there, knowing that it was all about it.
I couldn't scream or scream, because there were families and people around me.
I had to stay."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapperus, who survived her daughter's loss, sat on a plane with other passengers -- and they didn't know what she had to do.
"No one knew," she said.
"I slong my head and my face kept flowing tears.
It's hard to explain, but I was caught by the feeling of Ned's sympathy in the flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he liked her."
Womans who grieve cards to warn suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their dear people who have committed suicide are doing everything they can to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are hanging cards on warm words and phone numbers that people can get help on the Wales Bridge.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he had depression, and at 18, he was killed by suicide.
"I don't want the other parents to feel as I feel," she said.
45-year-old Mistress Davis, who lives in Lynne, said that her son was a talented boss cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him smile.
People said his smile to light any room."
But before death he quit his job, for it was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11, found his brother's body when he was suicide.
Mademoiselle Davis says, "I'm constantly worried that there may be awkward consequences."
Mademoiselle Davis created cards, "to make people know that there are people in the world to whom you can contact and talk, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay silent; you need to talk."
Mademoiselle Hasfreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for a long time, lost Mark, her partner, who was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
"He did not say that he was boring, or that he was in depression, or something like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude changed.
On the holiday he was very depressed: when the children opened gifts, he did not even look at them."
She said that his death was for them a great injury, but it had to live with it, "In the family there was a huge hole.
It's just killing us.
But we need to continue living and fight."

Being Breta Cavano is uncertain because the fbi begins the investigation
"I thought we could have what he wanted -- limited in time and in the scope of the investigation -- we could get a little merge," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, added that he was worried that the bureau was "depleted" because it actually got into the traffic.
Why does Mr. Cavano and his republican followers not want the FBI to investigate?
Their undesirableness is sometimes explained.
The interim choices are only five weeks later, 6 November, when the Republicans are expected to lose, then they will be weakened in their attempts to choose the candidate they need.
George Bush called the Senator to develop Mr. Cavano's support, who worked at the White House during the Bush Presidency, and through him introduced his wife Ashley, who worked in a personal secretary of Bush.
What happens after the FBI releases his report?
There's a vote in the Senate where the Republicans and 49 democrats are now meeting.
As long as it doesn't understand whether Mr. Cavano will get at least 50 votes during the voting in the Senate that will allow Vice-President Mike Pens to solve the problem of the equality of votes and to approve him to the Supreme Court.
The number of triggers from North Korea dropped in Kim's direction
The number of runners from North Korea to South has fallen since Kim Chen Yin came to power seven years ago, said the South Korean official.
Park Bo Sun, leading to the United States of South Korea, stated that last year there were 1127 runners, and in 2011, 2706.
Mr. Park stated that the main reasons are the strengthened border control between Northern Korea and China and the higher costs set by transmitting traffickers.
Phen'an never commented on it.
Most of the northern triggers have been receiving South Korea's citizens.
Seul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally after the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run through China, which is the longest limit in North Korea, which is more easy to cross than a demilitarized zone between two Koreans, which are very strongly protected.
China considers the escapers as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forces them to repatriate.
Relationships between North and South, which are technically still in war, have improved much in the past months.
At the beginning of the month, two country leaders met in Phenyen for talks about denuclearization.
This happened after the historical meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trampo and Kim Chen Yena, in June, in Singapore, when they agreed to work in general with the purpose of fully freeing the Korean peninsula from the nuclear weapon.
But on Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Ian Ho, accused the American sanctions of the absence of progress since.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such conditions we are not going to disarma the first," said Mr. Rie in the speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelozi called Breta Cavano "the historian," she said he shouldn't work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the palace of representatives, Nancy Pelozi, named the candidate at the Supreme Court of Justice Breta Kavano, "the historian," and said that according to his temperament, he was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosie said this on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival, Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't get rid of the thought that if a woman had acted like that, she would be called "history," Pelosi said about their response to Cavano's speech in front of the Senatu Legal Bureau on Thursday.
Cavano's emotional opposition to sexual harassment to Dr. Christine Blazey Ford, when they were teenagers.
During his initial speech, Cavano was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and couldn't speak when his family and older school class were discussed.
He also clearly accused the democrats in the Bureau, calling the charges against his "gratesque and organized killing", organized by the liberals who were angry because Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi stated that he believed that Cavano's speech showed that he couldn't work in the Supreme Court, because he clearly indicated that he had a prediction against democrats.
"I believe that he disqualified himself by his statements and the way he spoke of Clinton and democrats," she said.
Pelosie denyed when she was asked whether she would try the Kavano impeachment when it was chosen, and when the Democrats were given most of the representatives in the House.
"I will say that -- if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress or in the FBI, he should not only work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," Pelosi said.
At the moment, Cavano is the judge of the Colombian District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a member of the Democratic Party, Cavano's potential solutions against the law of available medicine or the case of Row against Wade because Cavano is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing on the court of Cavano, he did not answer the question whether he would cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now isn't the time for hysterical, undependent persons to work in court and expect us to say "how wonderful," said Pelosi.
And a woman must have skipped this.
This justified accusation speech, months and years of wrath is simply transmitted, and she can't remember it without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," 45 years ago, Mrs. Stann told me.
"I don't think it's so rare."
She continued: "I was very helped by a woman who used to work as a director somewhere, and who said that when she was mad, she was crying, but she was working on a technique of behaviour.
But I am angry."
And I just kept talking.
I believe it was great."
The tears are partially allowed as summary, because they are absolutely misrecognizable.
One of my most brightest memories of the first work I used to cry from an unexpressive anger, and then an old woman caught me behind the collar -- a restrained chief who always scared me a little bit -- and pulled me up at the stairs.
"Never let you be seen in tears," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think that you're sad and will be glad that they led you."
Patricia Schrodar, a congress Democrat from the state of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at the presidential company.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt fell on a marriage trait on a yacht called Monkey Business and went out with the presidential race, very angry Mrs. Schrodar figured that she could participate in the presidential company.
"It wasn't a very good thoughtful decision," laughing she told me 30 years later.
"They had seven other candidates, and they didn't need me at all.
Someone called this "Snowfree and Seven Patuls".
Since the company went a long time, she had no means, so she said she wouldn't participate in the elections if she didn't collect two million dollars.
It was a losing situation.
Turns out that some of her followers, who sacrificed $1,000 to a man, gave her only $ 250.
"They think I'm going with a smack?" she thought.
When she stated that she would not be participating in the selection company, she was so emotional - thanks to people who supported her, anger to the system that so complicated the gathering of money and directed to voters rather than to candidates and anger to sexism -- that she had a breath.
"You might think I've had a nervous breakthrough," recalled Mrs. Schroeder reacted press to her condition.
"You might have thought my corporate sponsor was the manufacturer of the Kleenex paper service.
I thought once what would they write on my supergrave stones?
"She cried?"
Why the trade war between China and the United States can be good for Beijing
The first bands of trade war between China and the United States were absorbing, and since the war is far from the end, in a farer perspective of disagreement between countries may be for the benefit of Beijing, the experts say.
The President of the United States, Donald Tramp, fired the first warning at the beginning of this year, covering the taxes of the main export goods of China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week when new tariffs touched a total of 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), actually covering half of the goods in the United States of China.
Every time Beijing answered this way, he recently raised five to ten per cent of the US stock costs of $60 billion.
China is a symmetrical answer to the United States, and the second in the size of economics is hardly going to lead.
To force Washington to retreat, we have to deepen the demand, but public decline in front of the United States is practically unacceptable for the Chinese leader of Si Zingpin.
However, experts say that if Beijing uses the situation correctly, the U.S. trade war pressure in a far way can support China by reducing the mutual dependence of these two countries.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that will start a rare economic failure is much more dangerous than observers have thought before," said Abigail Grace, a researcher specialized in Asia, in the research and analytical centre of the new American security.

However, he emphasized that the country would not take assistance in exchange for certain conditions or assistance from countries who were sponsored by rebels.

American Captain Jim Fury said after a disappointmental game to protect his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they're tales.
This morning we sometimes showed Europe what we could do.
We fought.
Let's take off the hats to Thomas's honour.
He's a big captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the Association of Golf of America and our Bureau of Ridar's cup, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud I'm their captain.
Take off the hat in front of them.
