At an emergency call, Professor admitted he shot his girlfriend.
During the call for an emergency line with a shaking voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he shot his girlfriend and they needed to come home.
Lamb assumed that his "sweet dog" was alive and likely upset, and that contacts with the dead woman's family could be found on her phone.
Inside the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a manually written message on a white office paper, "I am so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," said in a letter signed by the authorities of Lamb.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to the school campus, where the police thinks he shot the favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at his office door.
Chief of the police at Delta State University Lynn Buford said that the university employees heard shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb said he made a fate call on an emergency line shortly afterwards.
After all, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the shooting at school, students and college forced them to hide behind the locked doors, the authorized authority is still trying to look at Lamb's motivation.
Details published by investigators on the side of the State and the students and employees who knew him together created a picture of a talented but most likely troubled teacher.
Students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
The Gautier police, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no records in the criminal record or a violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in the book he wrote, in thanking "great people" with whom he shared academic life.
Both taught at the Social Science Faculty and History Faculty, along with the other 17th members, and many students attended courses at both at the same time.
At the same time, inclinations were inclined with regard to problems.
A student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaken, "as anything would have been wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, said that Lamb told him that he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb has already asked Delta State University for free for health reasons that he has a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes on the recruitment of university employees meant that the doctorate on which Lamb worked hard would not guarantee him an automatic functional period to become a assistant of a professor.
The President of the University William LaForge said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamba and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamba must have suffered something."
The Lamb will no longer answer these questions.
After he left campus, the police caught his track when he crossed the border of the state of Arkansas back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself by the only gun in the courtyard about a mile from his parents in Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed the coroner of the state of Washington, Methel Johnson.
He left the car launched on the street.
It wasn't clear why Lamb went to this house, even though Johnson said he probably knew people who lived here.
The Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb started working at a university, which has 3500 students in a city reading about 12,000 people in 2009 and taught geographical and educational classes.
On spring, he got a doctorate in education.
One of the long-term friends Lamba described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston told her she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through common friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was the great older boy who taught her a few years playing guitar.
He was a pretty heartbreaker then.
The heart of all girls appeared as soon as he appeared," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson's suburb.
Lamb and Prentiss allegedly walked together for a while.
During the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house, which was next to the shoulder of the Gautier river.
The police said the dog was okay.
Former husband Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter, which is now 19 years old.
"It was totally collapsed," said O'Steen about her daughter.
She was the best friend with her mother.
O'Steen said he didn't meet Lambe, but through his daughter, Abigail knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Abigail and I graduated at the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter was writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator in The Julep Room, slowly lighted bar near Gautier, said that he last saw Lamba and Prentiss in the night of September 5th, the sweat that Lamb won on the guitar and harmonic for an innumerable crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We flattered and recorded each other for a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, led a seminar in the first year and specialized in the original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married, and he had three little children.
He studied at the State University Emporia in Kansas and was president of the boys' student club and the government of students.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including members of the faculty, employees, students, and members of the community, attended a reminder with candles.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended a vigilia, during which the university congregation sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Wednesday school started again.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge says.
There's a crisis behind us.
This is the day of treatment.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story was adjusted to reflect the fact that the police now claims that Lamb made a call on an emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that even though Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually settled.
Toys R Us plans to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us declared that they would not take as many seasonal workers as last year, but the manufacturer of children's toys and products claims that they will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also stated that it plans to hire about 40,000 employees in shops and distribution centres throughout the country, which is a decline against 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be partially worked.
The company declares that it will start with the seizure of applicants this month, and the employees will be collected during October until December.
While holidays are far from months, the buying vacation seasons are approaching, and companies are preparing to temporaryly accept employees for assistance in trade and sale, for shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his date with Princess Diana
The Prime Minister "Return to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Foxe.
She was incredible for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the arrival of the royal family when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said at the trailer for the coming document, "Well in time."
The movie begins, and I realize I'm at the reach of something that could be called a false date with the Princess of Wales.
"Return in time," is the document on "Return to the Future", which introduces conversations with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and the executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The Prime Minister "Return for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's really the best travel document for me that has ever been filmed."
"Return in Time" will be to get to VOD, DVD and in the selected movies in October.
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russian accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict of almost five years of conflict and more weapons only will make the violence and suffering of millions of people worse.
The head of the United Nations again urgently called upon all parties, including the UN Security Council divided, to unify and support the inclusive negotiation on the finding of a political solution.
Ban said at the Mediterranean press conference that he planned to meet foreign ministers of five permanent councils - USA, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the edge of the Ministerial Meeting at the end of this month for the discussion of the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret that the Divisions in the Council and between Syrian people and regional powers "produced this situation unresolved."
Ban called for five permanent members to demonstrate solidarity and unity shown in the achievement of the Iranian nuclear agreement in the solution to the crisis in Syria.
8 electoral numbers that show that Donald Trump in real light
Some tried to mark him as a person who often changed their views.
Others over the wave of their hands like over the irregular joke.
And some are preparing for an implosion.
But whatever some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the elections, they're not doing it (so).
10 of the last 11 national research shows that Donald Trump is in the lead of a two-digit number, and some people are starting to ask seriously what it means for the nomination chances of this magnate from the real estate area.
Of course, it's only the beginning of the electoral cycle.
Nothing of this says that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
The experts point out that in this period of 2011 the leadership of Rick Perry made the way to raise Herman Cain, none of them eventually won the only position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he could hit in general elections.
But external groups such as Super PAC Jeba Bush and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are aware of Trump's will to endure and start exposing their dollars to stand on the stand to throw it down.
Here are some recent vote numbers that suggest that realistic magnate is not just a limited phase:
Trump's benefit assessment turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in the middle of June, the vote of Monmouth University showed that only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of this reality magnate.
In the middle of July, it was 40 percent already.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six of the 10 Republicans have a favourable view of Donald Trump.
Approximately three of the 10 say they have a negative opinion on him.
And these numbers are kept in the starting stages.
After Quinnipiac's vote last week, 60 percent of the republicans had a positive view on Trump.
Two-third of the GOP voters would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the Republicans stated that either they would be "natched" or "happy" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two of the 10 said they would be "burious" from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates an approximately the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "natched" against 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
Another closest at the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republican voters claim that they would be "unsatisfied" or "busied" if Jeb Bush's favorite would become a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticised for his nausea and insults, 52 percent of the Republican voters are generally aimed at the idea that the reality is to magnify the right temperament for the post of the president, according to the Monday vote of ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is held in the Senator Club of Iowa, which is the first in the country in which 52 percent of the Republicans think they have the leader's personality, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think that he has no personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 of the 10 independents say that his temperament does not belong to the White House, according to ABC/Post.
The Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When they put on their scientific hats, the Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
On the question who wins the nomination of GOP, four of the 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to CNN/ORC research last week.
That's a change from the late July, when four of the 10 placed their money on Jeba Bush.
Full publication: The GOP voters had no clearest crystal ball in the past.
This time in the past cycle, 4 of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as a winner of a candidate against 28 percent for the eventual nomination of Mitt Romney.
However, it appears that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as a reliable.
Although the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still defeats almost everyone.
Some scientists emphasize that the broken field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump's support is difusionally widen between more than a dozen other candidates.
But the Monmouth University research in early September shows that in the hypothetical direct struggle between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always receive majority support.
He leads over Carly Fiorina on 13 points, Marc Rubi on 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush for 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie, 33 points in each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who defeats him?
Ben Carson would lead over a trader with a wide 19 points in a hypothetical fight against one.
The naked majority of Donald Trump's degrees claim that they've already made their opinion.
The new Tuesday Survey of CBS/NYT shows that only more than half of the Trump supporting voters claim that they will no longer change their views.
It is obvious that a lot of things can change, and no one really can say that he would never change his view.
46% states that they keep open back doors to change between candidates.
However, Trump's current strongest opponent of his external colleague neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but the voters who consider their opinion as final would go twice as likely for Trump.
6 of the 10 Republicans are allegedly agreeing with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called mexican immigrants "violents" in his campaign's announcement speech, the immigration remains the main and central theme of the 2016 conversation.
Some are afraid that Trump's abubreliness is pulling out the key Spanish voters from the Republican party and the damage will force rebranding.
But according to a new Monday public opinion research ABC/Post, six of the 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump in immigration issues.
As long as the theme of immigration remains in the light of the reflectors, Donald Trump will also remain.
The frustration from the government reaches new maxims.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson receive about half of the support from the Republican voters today, especially with regard to their state of outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new Monday vote of ABC/Post claim that they prefer political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
The voting of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa several weeks ago revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "desperately angry".
The Parliament supported a larger share of coal taxes of the State.
Czech Republic gets more than 400 million.
The Ambassador in its first reading supported the government's novel of the upper law, which adjusts the amount of fees from the surface of brown coal from the weighted companies.
Minister Jan Mladek (CSSD) promised the Members that they would make extra money as a state treasury, as well as the municipal budgets.
The proposal was criticised by the opposition Members who feared that the firms would no longer want to sponsor the municipality, as they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The Charter in the first reading supported the government's novel of the Upper Law, which, in addition, means that the State should receive a larger part of the fees from the surface of brown coal from the burden companies.
The share of the State shall increase to 67 per cent, while the share of the municipalities is reduced from 75 per cent to 33 per cent.
The proposal is also changing the way to calculate the refund for the non-environment that the companies are exhausting.
The change in non-root taxes will bring to the state treasure 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
The revenues of the municipalities should have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the fee should be higher.
In the predloń year, the municipalities received approximately 450 million crowns and the state budget of 150 million crowns.
The coal of brown carbon came from about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns.
Novela also calculates the increase of the remuneration from the winning space with the allowance of 1,000 crowns per hectare per year.
Receipt from these penalties shall continue to belong to the communities in full.
Industries Minister Jan Mladek (CSSD) told messengers that the municipalities would acquire a year instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The amount of fees will no longer be fixed by the law, but it is set by the government by its regulations.
The remuneration shall be calculated as the amount of quantity of unencumbered influenza and rates for individual types of non-growth.
According to the government, amendment is the cause of an option of flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, the Member of the OS Marek Benda warned that the establishment of a tax by the government regulation must not be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mladka, it is not a tax in this case, because the state is paying charges for the turmoil that is a state property.
Only citizens whose territories are subject to burdens shall receive fees.
In the case of depth coal, three quarters of money will be received from the community and a quarter of the states.
The same ratio will be in case of radioactive mines.
The amount of the money that he chooses to pay pay is intended to be bound.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair injuries after burden or to ensure the bany rescue service.
The proposal was criticised by the opposition Members who, in particular, claimed to harm the municipalities affected by the burden and regions.
For example, Michal Kuchera (TOP 09 and Starships) warned that the firms will no longer want to sponsor the municipalities, as they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunne one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kadner (Swit) chosen in the Ústec region.
Before the increment of unemployment on Mosteck, KSCHM Hanna Aulica warned.
Kadner and Aulique failed to propose a novel to reject, Kuchera wanted the law to reimburse the government.
The reasonable report states that, according to quantitative companies, tax increases will not be produced into carbon prices, since the prices of more than 90 per cent are long-termly contracted.
Therefore, the main consumers like electricity or temperatures should not feel price growth.
"But, on the other hand, this fact increases the risk of increasing compensation organisations to compensate with the effort to reduce their operating expenditure, which would mainly mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, it considers that the increase in employment fees is profitable.
According to the rapporteur, Milan Urbana (CSSD), it is crucial for the Members to know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and, in particular, the government's decision on carbon carbon boundaries.
If the coal is going to go beyond the limits, then it will have impacts on the profits for the state and the community, he emphasized.
The Urban disagrees with the Youth that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czech Slovak Army should fall until 2020.
The limits at the bottom of the CEA should already be broken for social, national economic reasons and due to the long-term stability of the country's energy.
The cheerful will lead the Czechs as a unit, the weather plantation will affect.
All four Czech tennists will appear at Davis' quarterly lounge of Davis' cup in India on the table and this time each of them will probably hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navratil plans that, due to difficult conditions, the burden will be all over the quarter.
In Dillí, there is a hot and high moisture of the air, so the difficult matches are expected to stretch up to five hundred.
We have to take this into question.
I'd like to spread it by weather.
And according to how it would look, he said he returned at today's Czech electoral training in the centre of Raje Kumar Khanny.
With the one team and the world's forty-three, Jirj Jolly counts to the Friday and Sunday two games.
Luke Rosol and Radek Stjepan are likely to be accompanied by the position of the two.
I'd like almost everyone to join.
I'm slow in my head, but I'm not gonna tell you yet, Captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech composition should be Stefan's participation in Saturday four.
It's just a question who's going to stand next to the experienced deblist, which has the Davis cup in the fourth balance of 18:4.
It won't be happy.
There are other options with Rosol, or Adam Paul.
"I really don't know with who and how it will look," he returned.
It will decide according to the development of two games.
The varianta may be Paulasec, with the Happy Surprised in the first round of winning in the depth over Australians.
"He's decent to the table," he said.
I did it against Australia, and when I play, I would like to show the same performance I showed there since the second set.
"I'm glad for these experiences and I'd like to bring a point," said Paulosek.
The household will be placed in Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP ladder), who won the challenger in Shanghai last week, where he defeated the third and fourth hundred ladders.
Two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
They're both challengers and ours have experience with the ATP Tour, but many times we have convinced that the ladders in Davis' cup are not making a decision.
"He decides the current form, weather," he returned.
Friday's opening two games start at 6:30 SELC and they can drag into the weather.
He's supposed to rain, and he's not under the roof.
However, it may be played for artificial lighting.
They've already burned it, and it's got some 2,000 luxury, which is enough.
"It should be allowed to be played under the light," he returned.
Jeremy Corbyn will debute on Prime Minister's Questions
Since your election, Mr. Corbyna's debut in PMQ is very excitedly expected
New employee Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and will have the first time to cooperate with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will put the first of his six assigned questions shortly afternoon, while his performance is likely to be carefully examined by the media and the messengers.
In the weekly expression, he asked "minor theatre and more facts."
He also stated that he could skip several sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of the leadership of Mr Corby, which comes after his appointment to the shadow office and his Tuc Tuc's Tuc's annual convention.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour Leader to be quiet during the singing of the national hymna in the ministry on Tuesday to the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the battle of Britain met with a criticist of a number of conservative messengers and is the center of the attention of several stories on the title pages of the newspaper.
Mr. Corby's decision not to sing national hymna has drawn attention
Mr. Corbyna's speaker said he'd be "staying in respectable silence" and recognized the "heroship of the Royal Aviation in the battle of Britain."
However, Mr. Corbyn, Owen Smith, member of the Shadow Chamber, told the BBC's Newsnight programme that he recommended the labour leader to sing the national hymna "without regard" of his conviction that the monarchy should be cancelled.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in the top team of Mr Corbyn, quoted the differences in the economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than six parliamentary parties originally supported him as leader.
Political correspondent BBC Robin Brant says that political differences in work are also "concentrated" after appointing Mr Corbyna over his position in the European Union and the government limit of doses.
Mr. Corbyl stated at the TUC conference that the Party presented the modified proposals to remove the whole idea of the limit of doses.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, secretary of shadow work and retirement, said that the party "very clearly" opposed government plans to reduce the limit from $26,000 to $23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Conservative Party, faced by David Cameron in the last decade of his election as the leader of conservatives.
The leader of the worker, who promised a different approach to politics, claims that he has ideas "from the crowd" on questions for Mr. Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
The MP Islington North claims that PMQ is too confrontative and that they will delay both "food responses", and instead, he promises to focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, a shadow trade secret, will represent him at the PMQ when he does not attend — such as when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also dismissed the idea that he would let other colleagues come out from time to time, because he had heard that he had discussed the whole matter with the speaker of the John Berc House.
When Mr. Cameron became the leader in 2005, he said he wanted to depart from the style of "Punch and Judy", which was often connected with the PMQ, but a few years later admitted he failed.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer for the judgement of leaders, their leadership and their position among other MPs, although the criticists argumented that they became a caricature and needed far-extensive reforms.
"Focations in Joburg: Young homeless trained as photographers
Johannesburg Centre is a difficult place for homelessness.
But one group of ex-children found a way to learn and make money for life.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is an unprofit studio that teaches young homeless how to photograph their neighbourhood and make money like that.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates in this project.

The pound increases while the growth of salaries in Great Britain accelerates
The pound came up with the following dates and showed the recovery of the British growth of wages, while FTSE 100 was conducted above by the SABMiller offering target.
Between May and June GB profits, including bonuss, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
That was the fastest since 2009, and it seemed like the estimates were approaching when the rates were raised.
Sterling increased more than 1% against a dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% at the top to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional market share and jumped by 20% after he got an approximate offer from his rival AB InBev.
The agreement would combine two biggest beverages in the world, and closer to marks such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The Burberry Actions were 0.9% higher after encouraging reports from the Richemont Luxury Group.
The latest sales results of Richemont are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, began to rise again.
The Glencore shares rose by 5% after the giant said that they increased by $2.5bn using shared placement as part of the debt reduction strategy.
The actions in the package and paper group Mondi were the biggest failure on the index and dropped by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs reduced his rating to the company to "sell".
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports company announced 83% jump in half a year in profits before taxation £46.6m
Chief JD Sports says that higher wages could hurt the expansion
The executive JD Sports President Peter Cowgill says that the higher minimum remuneration for workers in the United Kingdom could mean "great buying power in pockets of potential consumers".
But it is unlikely that the buying power would overcome higher remuneration costs in his company, he states.
The costs could affect the JD Sports expanding plans, he added, which could mean less new jobs.
The opponents of the Prague's apartment marshmeloun are bright.
The controversial building got a track.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investmenti considers the cancellation of the decision as an illegal decision and will appeal against it.
A contrary to the building that was to come close to the Agnes Monastery in the centre of Prague protested before the Prague’s office of 1,000 people, there was also a petition.
The master stated in the decision that the construction law had been breached, as all the relevant ground decision was not implemented.
"The predefined territorial decision does not contain certain circumstances, for example, the kind of lands, the distance from neighbourhood buildings, sufficiently clear and understandably described form of a building, the definition of the territory affected by the impact of the construction," it says in its decision.
It also considers that some grounds for decisions have been issued to the originally discussed documentation, but has changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of environmental organs.
Part of the building is to come up in the lands of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
According to the record, however, the land owner only agreed with the project documentation for the territorial management, not to agree on the location of the building on its lands, according to the Building Board.
According to Francesca August Razett, the Building Board of Investment firm did not take note of the decision of the supervised authority - the Ministry of Local Development, under which the time limit for the start of the review was already expired.
Anyway, it's a scandal procedure.
"We've been preparing this project for 17 years, respecting all the laws of the Czech Republic and respecting all the authorities and institutions concerned," Rasetto said in the press report.
The project, which is called marshmeloun because of the allegedly proposed color of the fasada, causes strong emotions in Prague.
In the center of the city, hundreds of people have gathered to protest against the construction in the past.
The association and inhabitants of nearby homes disturbed that some permits have been issued many years ago for a house that would look different.
They also criticize the inappropriate construction of the historic center of Prague and the immediate neighbourhood of the Agnes Monastery.
The house designed architect Zednek Franek, the project has changed several times.
The original form of the 2008 project, which counted on a glass fasada, refused on the basis of the opinion of the National Memorial Institute (NPTP), the Ministry of Culture and cancelled the authorisation of Prague monuments in 2010.
The new project of Prague Progetti e Investments with windows in the form of faces but NPTP and magistrate monuments have approved, and on this basis construction authorisation was issued.
The author rejects the elevations of opponents, saying he never counted on the fasada in a pink color that gave the project a nickname after a pink-white sugar.
The Czech politicians brought migrants.
Hungarians put him in a prison with them.
Berg went to Hungary with a view to bringing humanitarian assistance to refugees.
On his way, he took three Syrian refugees along with the crew in the car, who said they wanted to travel about a half mile.
He believed that it was not criminal in Hungary, he claimed to the People's newspapers.
We knew the guards of the law weren't doing this.
But when the police stopped us, we were arrested to our surprise and transferred to the detention in Sheged, he described a letter.
Finally, he spent nine hours in the policy cell.
They said the cops were acting correctly, but they had communications because they didn't know English too well.
But he believed that the prison was triple.
For example, 15 refugees from Syria were in our cell about three times four metres.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
The other day, these people were closed there, and none of them had any idea what was going to happen with them, said Berg.
What can't it take any more?

You can ask her about changes in the law on executions applicable from 1 September 2015 and other matters related to executions or executions.
Metcash starts a village campaign to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA shops from the Aldi effort in southern and Western Australia.
Metcash starts a village campaign to fight Aldi invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 trades in South and Western Australia at the beginning of the next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA mark by marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers are joining with marks such as Dunsborough, the ice creamflyer Simmo's offering tastes in IGA shops and tradeholders sell cheap tickets to the Australian football league to local customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the seller of food, alcohol and hardware celebrates its annual investment strategic day.
It is a lot in the bet, because South and Western Australia represents nearly 30 percent of Metcash IGA trade steps and generates a higher rotation than Metcash IGA network in eastern States.
Customers in Southern and Western Australia are notorically provincial and IGA trades enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland -- more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to about 14 percent in Eastern States.
Anyway, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will locate 5% of the food market in these two countries within 12 months of the opening of the first trades that took markets from all existing players, but mainly independent minors.
This week in his report, analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that the IGA retail could lose 360 million USD at annual sale and Metcash 250 million USD at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 trades in Southern Australia and 30 in West during the next year, and will generate sales of 500 and 600 million USD on individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in a solid price base Metcash could cost him about 13 million USD on the profits before taxation, Mr. Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash loses a share in eastern markets, especially Aldi and Coles, even though the last Rhoy Morgan survey found that the shoppingers in IGA were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks that the food sales of Metcash will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, and its market share will decrease from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the manager of the Hamish Douglass Fund, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, said that the merchant lunch in Melbourne could "be highly likely disappear during the decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Douglass' commentary.
But it's known that a member of the Metcash board contacted Douglass last week.
The market share of IGA decreased from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and the metcash food sales delivered by about 1200 IGA retails have fallen by 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of speculation changes, as sales and profits are under pressure.
However, the large trade went into an anti-actachment and invested more than 150 million USD a year to equip board prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and helps the IGA minorities reinstate trades by adding rapidly growing food and news from private people.
The Executive Director of Metcash, Ian Morrice, claims that the price comparison and equipment programmes will catch the fall and hopes that the generation will return to the primary profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia Steve Heally
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves his behaviour of glory rather than the criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a side loss in the recent loop around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves his behaviour of praise rather than criticism, states President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented dua often called "Special Xs", has drawn unwilling attention to himself by an affair with a disgracefully known Kyrgios and Stan Wawrink at Montreal Masters.
Soon, in a passionate qualification struggle in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison must have been twice separated by the judge, Harrison then said, "Wawrinka had to drag one to Kyrgios and I should have dragged him out."
While he was last seen breaking the rocket after the screwed out the possibility of Richard Gasquet to the US Open, Kokkinakise was intimately defending Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth about the location in the second two games behind Bernard Romic in the Davis Cupu semifinal against Britain.
"I thought quite intensely that Thanasi, in my opinion, was a little embarrassed," said Healy.
He ruined the rocket when he lost his scream in the U.S., but he's not the first player who'd be frustrating himself. I know Thanasi pretty well and I can say he's not gonna be proud of this event.
But he really controlled himself very well because he was exposed to a very provocative circumstances in the U.S. because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves a great recognition.
He's got a fantastic team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated pretty hard with him.
He's a very adult 19-year-old man, working very hard and in the team he's getting great and so on, he's never had a problem with other players, he's very respected in the dressing room, he's hard, he's in an amazing condition, it's a very stable and mature young boy, and I just think he deserves to be judged according to his own credit.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgius for the important fight that begins on Friday, and states that "the mutual decision" is the right solution for all, but supports the cousin from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term stand.
"We first want our team to be completely focused on the fight, not on all the controversies that [Kyrgios] came around him," Healy says.
And I think that Nick's risen very quickly, as Federer, Murray and other people show, in the public's eyes he's growing rapidly, he's also made a few terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time outside the explanation, when he's able to think about it, I think it's the best solution for the team and also for him alone.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes the border and holds migrants
Following the notification of Hungary's state of danger on Tuesday, it closed its Southern border with Serbia and held those who attempted its illegal cross-border in order to stop the flow of migrants.
There was a chaos on the border, while hundreds of migrants gathered no one in the country, and Serbian authorities responded disturbedly.
Those who have been stuck on the earth’s belts for an unknown time between the two states stands for those who flee against violence in their homelands, build apartments and reside.
But there are feelings of frustration.
When the helicopter flys over them, migrants call "Open the Border!" and provide a regular unit of Hungarian police.
Some deny food and water to protest.
Serbian Foreign Minister declares that it was "unappropriate" to send refugees back from Hungary, while they are increasingly arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just an indirect injury.
During the next days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The disturbance at the Hungarian-Serbian border came the day after the 28-country block had not arrived with a united immigration policy for continuing meetings in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who are looking for protection in surprised Italy and Greece and have spoken with the hope of reaching an eventual agreement next month or at the end of the year, which EU nations would accept more than 120 000 other refugees, including Hungary.
The German Federal Officer Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special EU summit on Tuesday next week to discuss a continental refugee crisis.
Hungary, however, did not turn her hope on Brussels or his neighbors.
The Tuesday situation of threats in two Southern regions gave the authorities a greater power to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close roads and speed up the cases of asylum negotiations.
Meanwhile, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Shijarto said that his country also plans to build a fence from the steel along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the fence on the Serbian border is now completed.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata announced that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped drag the wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point to the European Union for refugees, many of whom fled from Syria and other Middle East countries.
However, the President of the Government, Victor Orban, insisted that most of them are economic migrants who follow better life, not war fugitives looking for protection, which is a view that is clearly different from the other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that have entered into force at midnight in Hungary are now criminalizing violations of 4 meters of the fence which the government has allowed to build on the south border with Serbia, and also sets longer prison deadlines for those who translate refugees illegally.
"Thanking the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of danger," the reporters of the government Zoltan Kovacs in the southern town of Szege said.
We have absolutely clear in this: the illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Technically, Parliament must still endorse the establishment of the army that was expected next week, but the reporters of Associated Press have observed a heavy armed army with vehicles and dogs for several days at the border.
Gyorgy Bakondi, advisor of Orban for Home Defense, said that the authorities caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and caught 15 already in the territory of the state.
They have been invaded by the destruction of the fence and are now accused of committing offences under new laws.
The officials quickly let the fence be fixed.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a car covered by the wire.
The main border crossing in Rosk was a chaos, because the Hungarians opened a small office in the metal container for processing and the pressures of people.
About 20 of them came in, but thousands left outside.
Another refugee group blocked the main road connecting Serbia and Hungary when they rejected food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Invasion of Hillary Clinton before Bernie Sanders decreased by half in national vote
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton still holds a two-digit step in the Democratic Nomination Race at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is reaching her acceleration.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of the democratic primary voters (declined from 58 per cent), while Sanders is second with 27 per cent (seventeen per cent growth).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who is currently going to announce whether he will be president, receives support from 15 per cent of the democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competition, no more democratic voters claim that it is too soon to say that there are clear decisions that candidate will support.
But the Clinton sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
From the CBS News survey last month, Clinton lost the ground under her feet in several demographic groups, while Sanders received several.
Clinton keeps a big leak between women and mitigates, but her leadership is consuming.
Her support between men has been significantly reduced, and Sanders loses only five points to her.
The benefit of Clinton with the democratic voters under 50 years has disappeared, and now they're equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has great leadership thanks to the elderly voters.
Last month, Clinton had a two-cifrical scope in front of Sanders between Liberals, but now Sanders loses only five points in this group.
About half of the democratic primary voters across the States say she would be excited to support Clinton if she became a party candidate.
The quarter would support it with certain exceptions, and another 15 percent would only support it for being a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
It's probably not surprising that the current Clinton enthusiasms are particularly inflammated because of it.
The views are mixed between those who are not currently supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would thrilledly support her.
While 48 percent of the democratic primary voters say they would excitedly support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When Clinton's favourites are asked in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 per cent), it follows that it is time to be the president (13 per cent), and that she is the best candidate for this work (10 per cent).
The Clinton fans also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
There is also a great possibility of selecting and conforming problems.
While the Vice-President considers the potential candidacy for the president, 57 percent of the democratic primary voters would wish to have a third believed that he should not be running.
When primary democratic voters were asked, who would be chosen as a second choice for the nomination of the party, the most common choice is Biden.
Between Clinton's fans, more than half Biden as their second choice, far before Sanders.
If Biden decides to nominate the nomination of Democrats, the leadership of Hillary Clinton will expand from 20 points when Biden can run, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win in general elections; but this number fell from 78 percent of last month.
Biden is far second in this measure, but the percentage of people who see him as most likely chosen is increasing.
However, when the issue of greater importance of the candidate was raised, democratic voters prefer the solutions to problems before a greater chance to be elected.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate appears as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics between the primary voters of their parties.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trusting and think they have strong leadership.
Biden of all three leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of the democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and reliable, that is, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion on it.
Primary democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological view.
With regard to all these standards, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As the questions concerning the decision of Hillary Clinton on the use of her personal e-mail and the server as state secrets continue, most of the primary democratic voters are satisfied with its explanation of this matter and they say that their overall view of it has not affected her at all.
But between the American public, it's a totally different story.
Half the Americans are now unsatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third is satisfied.
The views of the public on this subject have been divided in March, shortly after the problem came out.
Most Americans argue that this e-mail controversy has no effect on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent of their views on Clinton have worsened.
It's mainly about the Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claims that their opinion on Clinton has been worsened.
Although Clinton is considered to be honest and trusted among the voters of her party, this question is still a problem between the registered voters of the total: only 32 percent see it as an honest and trustworthy, which is down by eight points of last month and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of the registered voters don't think she's honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of the registered voters around the country also do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But Clinton and Trump have good lead marks.
Of six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush were best managed in honesty.
Sanderse sees more people as honest than unfair, but, as in Carson, many voters did not think of him.
The rate of errors in the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 per cent points.
Ben Carson ended with Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times research
Two candidates are responsible for half the voters in the latest research, and others are letting them seek support.
The voters from a number of republicans around the country continue to support Trump with a thick majority, and they embarked from 23% of support in the last CBS survey carried out before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6 to 23 percent in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson has been running well through demographic groups, and is exposing Trump among universally educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, except Carly Fiorina and Governor of Ohio John Kasiche, is at the back of the wisconsin governor Scott Walker at 10% in support of the current 2%.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florid Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place with 6%.
The rate of errors in the sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest research is plus minus 6% and it took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed that Carson has improved and has reached 19% of the support between the Republicans for Trump 32%.
The latest research from ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly in front of Carson.
During the rising trend of Carson, Trump decided to shoot blindly on the neurosurge in the service, and even Carson apologize for the interrogation on Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump declared last Saturday during the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the brotherhood accused of the death of a student of the first year of Baruch College
Almost two years after the student died during the circulation ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, the charges were charged with murder against five people.
The members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chuna "Michael" Denga during the beginning of the September 2013 ceremony and late took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, announced by the police.
The police stated that he had bound eyes, had a bag full of sand with a total weight of 30 pounds and was repeatedly disturbed when he tried to reach the goal over the frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about the headache and then fell unconscious.
Pi Delta Psi members did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and they reportedly waited an hour before he was taken to the hospital, the police claimed.
However, they have found time to change Deng's dresses, google his symptoms and contact Andy Menga, the whole state president of the brotherhood, and ask him for a council, stated the police chief Chris Vagner at the press conference.
"In this moment, members began to hide equipment and basically prefer the well-being of the brotherhood from Michael Deng's life," said chief Wagner.
He couldn't be recovered and died the other day in the morning.
According to the report, Deng was repeatedly hit by a stupid object in the head, corpse and belly.
"Too many families have been devastateed because of the breast-fellowshipment and at least one student dies every year because of the overcome since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in the statement.
Brotherhood and their members must be responsible and this step is important by the authorities.
The great jury of Monroe County recommended a third-step murder charge for the first five members.
Twenty other two members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Menga, will also be accused of attacks by overcome and criminal association.
"We want to hold not only participants, but in the event that there is a organization that has approved it, whether officially or not, we will also ask them to be responsible," Wagner said at the Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood canceled its relationship with local branch offices.
This is where the Fed increases interest rates
The growth of the rates will come and the bull market will be delayed, the debt profits will rise and the economy will slide into the recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it takes and how long it will take.
For the economy, it offers a history of a small producer of time.
The recession came after 11 months after the first increase in rates and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve System in increasing rates is often, although not always, determining how economic and financial assets will react.
That's why US Central Bank officials emphasized so strongly that investors should not be focused on the time when the rates are being raised, but rather on trajectory, as long as normalisation will take place.
There are really more variables in the game.
However, the members of the market may eventually be assured that all acquisitions may be overcome because of the speed increase.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will be inevitably interpreted by some as the end of the era of 'level money'," said Julian Jessop, head of the global economy Capital Economy.
On the contrary, we do not expect the progressive return of American interest rates to the more common but still low, to create a seizmic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is a view of how some economic areas will react on the basis of historic trends:
Given what the market has recorded in the last month, the expected increase in rates may make air a little steady.
But once the increase comes up, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"It seems to be a trend for re-stop action after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the duration in monetary policy," the analysts of Deutsche Bank reported in a recent study on what happens after the Fed's increase.
More specifically, the market for the last 35 years is often the most - about 14 percent - is going to increase rates in relatively flat in 250 days (average increase of 2.6 per cent), and then returns to normal state after 500 days, with the average profit from the last six cycles 14.4 per cent, according to the recent analysis of Bob Doll, the main share strategy of Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on shares has the tendency to become more significant later in the rate increase cycle and returns start to decrease.
Recession is a real economic life, but the increase in rates often helps it.
The Fed is currently facing certain conditions that have not yet existed and which could speed up the recession.
Most remarkable is that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in history in the increase of fede rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during 118 growth rates since 1950, only two times the nominal inter-year GDP increase was below 4.5 per cent.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 per cent, it was few to expect its maintenance when it was only 1,5 per cent in the third quarter, stated Atlanta Fed.
Increasing rates in this complex economic background could be risky and could occur the question: "Is this time different," Deutsche said.
The market participants were prepared for the growth of the Fed for a year and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee, which took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategs and economies believe that FOMC could approve growth at this meeting, future trade indicates only a 25% probability.
"In our study since 1950, all rising cycles have been in the super pack effect cycle with the GDP covering the top of the beginning of the recession very quickly after the starting recovery," the report states.
On the contrary, this was clearly slowly recovered from the worst recession during sampling period.
The current cycle is far the longest of the Fed's expectations since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we're 74 months and we're still on.
The profit was also strong because the market expects an increase in rates and the model is quite similar to the shares experienced.
The main difference is that the impact is faster seen in debts than in action when the Fed changes the policy direction.
The bonds seem to change the profit direction immediately after the first arrival of the cycle of increase/reduction.
At the end of the rise cycle, debt receivables fall immediately," Deutsche said.
The Strategs of Charles Schwaba believe that the increase of rates will bring closer profits between long- and short-dated bonds, which would compensate the curve.
The debts with high profits often work better in this climate, even though "we are still careful about the elevation of benefits," Kathy Jones, a firmly analyst of fixed retirement in Schwab, stated in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adapted by the expectations of the Fede policy.
"Besides the power of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of more strict currency policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are upwards, the profit curve is flattered, the loan rate has increased and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when the Fed has increased policy.
Generally speaking, companies that carry out most of their business in the US will win interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
The supernational company with many debts will be worse, because the growing dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt will also be greater.
"History shows that the "quality" of action has the tendency to overcome over three months after the starting increase of rates," the Goldman Sachsve analysts reported in the client report.
The firms with strong balances have made a weak balance in each increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
As with low volatile supplies, companies with high capital profits have also overcome their thresholds by 4 (percent points), respectively 3 (percent points).
The debt will become a big problem.
The high-percent company will lose the largest interest rates, Goldman said.
In addition to pure action games, consumers also weigh through a growing dollar.
Those can also see their profits through higher profits, but experts have different views about how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, claims entrancer Andrew Bingham
Conservative Ambassador Andrew Bingham criticised this station for "fucking"
The view is that it is increasingly unrecognizable than its commercial rival
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and said they just cheated the British
The messenger Damien Collins attacked the Voice and said he's not the original idea
BBC Radio 3 is "change" in Classic FM, claims the front messenger and accumulates fresh pressure on the broadcasting to prove that they do something that commercial broadcasts do not do.
Conservative Ambassador Andrew Bingham also told the heads of BBC that the public service radio station seemed to be "cluttered" and is increasingly unrecognizable than its business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I hate to use the word "fuzzy" - but it seems to change to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on BBC Music Awards, started in December last year.
BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- these are two examples that attack me, when you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market," Mr Bingham said.
The Director-General of the BBC rejected the charge with reason that BBC Radio 3 is far before his business rival, as regards live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I wouldn't learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to live by music and to create music is actually at a high level.
"I also think that Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and introducing into new works is also very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year, the BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argumented that it is now necessary to work harder to involve the audience than before, because the British are less educational in terms of classical music.
However, Radio 3 wasn't the only element of the production of BBC that got under fire because of the firing of business competitors during the transmission of Culture, Media and Sports and came to hear the committee.
Conservative Ambassador Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show that BBC bought from the Dutch Producer Talpa Media for estimated £22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as an unoriginal and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars of Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was made "familiar to BBC".
He added that he wanted the Corporation "to find a hit from his own stand" when the next time it starts a fun series.
Nevertheless, he refused to exclude orders for more future series of The Voices or expenses of money from licence taxers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales grow at the lowest rate since August and on guilt can be Black Friday
The first three months of 2015 recorded 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth has been recorded since 2000 the records themselves began
Internet sales have been strengthened three years ago through mobile shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be the cause of braking the spending
For more than decades, virtual shopping at the rise, and it made many British main streets a city of spirits.
However, experts argue that there are signs of online sales stability, and new data show seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure per August represented the lowest increase in growth since the 2000 measuring itself, with only 5 per cent increase in comparison with the past year.
Experts argue that there are signs of online sales stability, and new data show seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the growth level in the past years and go back to 2000, the state has always been rationalized in time," Guardian Andy Mulcahy, the IMRG Market Index editor, states.
It explains that Internet sales were strengthened three years ago, when customers began using their mobile phones for purchases.
It meant that people were able to buy online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as the couch.
But now (raising) is somewhat reinforcing, so it seems to be recognizing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was taken from America, is quoted as one of the reasons for the decline in sale.
Experts believe that customers can delay buying before this event that is going on last Friday of November.
Last year, five times more than the average of buyers turned on their computers to arrange for shopping and coincidence with several seller websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which allows buyers to recontract, can keep customers from other shoppings
Research published by the British Retail Consortium Association found that only £1 of each £5 was spent online.
For some products such as TV and washing machines, more than a third of the sales are being carried out through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.
Muslims buried the victims of the fall of the jarkey in Mecca and the Bin Ladine family was sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were transferred by the streets of Muslims during the first funeral in Mekka
Saudi Arabia is partially guilty of the collapse of the constructive Magnate Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health stated that 394 people were also injured after the jarder crashed.
Thousands of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the fall in Grand Mosque in Mecca.
They dressed somewhat in white, grieving chose their way and gave respect to the victims when the first of the fallen came to his last trip to the cemetery in Al-Moaiss.
The sad message was passing around the holy place, where only a few days earlier the building jar broke the ceiling of the mess and threw himself into the believer.
The bodies were released for the funeral, and the Saudi king sanctioned the construction group of bin Ladine family over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 dead after the fall in Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried by streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram from Bolton, the Greater Machester, who was on his first league when the jarder broke down.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the year's cocktail.
Saudi officials have already promised that the hag in Mekka will take place and thousands of people continue to go down to town.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group should not have left the arm on top when he wasn't in operation.
The Arab version of the declaration, noted by the State operated by the Saudi press agency, states that Binladin Group is partly guilty of falling.
The English Disk Agency has not reported this details, but has indicated that the bosses of the company were prohibited from traveling to abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to disclose what caused the fall of the jar to the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims converged before the Haj’s leak later in this month.
Binladin Group has not issued any statements on the collapse of the jarbar and were not made available to its representatives for the commentary.
The royal statements also charged the group for not using the latest security measures and lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of jaws are surrounded by the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
Binladi's family has been close to the Saudi Arabia ruling family for decades and have been running large construction projects.
Late leader Al-Kaida Osama bin Ladin was the son of a wasteman whose family denied in the 1990s.
Havaria became in the middle of a strong wind and rain just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the Kingdom on a trip, which each customer must graduate at least once in life.
The officials indicate that 158 people remain in the hospital.
The officials decided that one million riyals (EUR 174.000) would be dedicated to relatives of the dead and the same amount for permanent injured.
Other wounds will receive half of this amount.
Boss B&Q claims that Eastern Europe traders working cheaply with trend
The British are increasingly employing employers, says Veronic Laura
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is behind the growth point
The result is opened 200 Screwfix trades aimed at traders
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets all over the country
Processed Rupert Steiner, main correspondent for Daily Mail
They say the British postpone the tickets and the brushes and hand them over to employed east-European employees to work at home.
If you're doing this with a painter or a painting brush, it seems you're in a minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing employers to do boxing work at their home, according to Screwfix B&Q's boss.
Veronique Laury, a new Executive Director of Kingfisher, who owns a chain for domestic needs, claims that a large increase in the number of taught traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
The result is that Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix trades focused on traders and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Laury claims that she wants to hire more women in B&Q shops, because eight of the ten shopping decisions in the store make better halfs.
Currently, most of the men's gender workers.
She said there is a need to address growing demographic trends that show more women's households that make more home adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laury says, "She still works most men in our shops.
We need to get closer to balance.
In fact, half of our customers are women who make 80% decision on purchases of goods.
Women play a great role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laura, one of only five women in the company managers, according to the British FTSE100 index, also restructured her top team to reflect the equality between men and women directors.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having a half-presentation of women among employees, including an executive and financial director.
Mrs. Laury says, "It was a conscious decision - diversion is an important theme here.
So it wasn't hard to find the good women we could take to us.
Kingfisher announced the failure as a profit in half the year and sale after the group took the costs of closing the trade.
The result of the Kingfisher trend owned by Screwfix and B&Q is to open 200 new shops
The December contribution of 600 crowns to pensioners is in danger.
"It is the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Vice-President ToP 09 Miroslav Kalusek, who emphasized the principle of deserve.
The President of the OPS Residue Stanjura noted that one-time contribution sounds good, but for a long time it would be better to be in standard valorization, because it would also be proven for the next years.
"We have space to find the mechanism we're going to do," stated Stanjura.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marks (CHSSD), according to which the bill was to be valorised over the framework of the law next year.
Marks defended the grant by argument that it would improve the social situation of pensioners that it was not pink.
The higher valorization next year would mean the budgetary impact of 5,5 billion crowns and ministers debate about each stambling.
The Prime Minister Boguslav Sobotka (CSSD) rightly reminded that in the past, the rate of valorization has decreased.
The rapporteur Miroslav Opaka (KSCHM) noted that the proposal does not solve the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
Veto's right paying in December makes it significantly complicated and perhaps poor, he said.
The Chairman of Members of ČSSD Roman Clenak therefore proposed a shorter period for the negotiation of the standard in the Committee for ten or 20 days, and it was blocked by the right.
But the Committee will have a month instead of normal two.
Bonus should stand to a total of 1.73 billion crowns.
Money should in particular come from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
In the next year, pensions should increase about a stocoron.
The contribution should be received according to the pension novel by people who will have the right to retire or part of it in December.
He could also be obtained by those who had fallen off the pension in December before it was paid.
However, they would have to request the compensation in writing, at the latest by the end of the next year.
Pensions in Czech Republic are regularly valuated to January, about price growth and a third of real wage growth.
This year corresponds to 41.5 per cent of gross remuneration, which should be 40.5 per cent next year.
He made 314,7 billion crowns on the old retirement last year, which was approximately five billion intermediately.
The cost of old pensions represented 26 per cent of all budget expenditure and 46 per cent of all the expenditure required by the law.
The average full old pension last year increased according to the state final account by 104 to 10.714 crowns.
The Czech Social Security Management provided a payment of 2.4 million full of old pensions and approximately 17.000 relative pensions.
Yakunin left the political career plans, he will devote to science.
The senate chair had a billionaire according to the Russian media.
In the Federation Council, the Western Kaliningrad area, whose Governor Nikolaj Cukanov as a candidate of the Government of the Single Russia was to defend his post in the Sunday elections with review.
According to Russian laws, the Senators do not choose citizens, but they are chosen by the Governor of the three candidates whose names will be announced before the Governor's elections.
After the elections, the senator of three candidates will choose himself.
The complications were for Jakunina the fact that he hadn't lived in the Kaliningrad area for 20 years, as required by the law.
Although the Kremle found an exception for Jacobin, he was an extraordinary and powered ambassador, for whom the legal requirement of long-term stay is not subject to.
The Czech comedy Theory Tiger's finished.
The last drop in the aim of the principal hero is the voluntary death of his owner who has ended his strength and patience.
Grandma - Iva Janjour decided about her grandfather's life, age and funeral.
John understands that he and his wife Olga - Elisha Balzer are on a similar path.
He will remember that he once had his own will and dreams, he wants to live dignity and free.
They want to retrieve the government over their lives -- and as a solution, he chooses to escape from this fabulous, he led to the story of Slavic.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role of Bartosch would be that he had already worked with at the Invisible Series.
Still, he said the actor who appeared before the camera after a longer break associated with reconvalescence after a serious illness was surprised.
We've made a deal three years ago.
I let him read the script and he said he liked how sad he was.
And he surprised me he's probably a busy sportsman.
He was always wondering where he would sit before he was filming.
This time he drove the bike, climbed the rocks and even walked up the hill.
And all of that in the records of the tropical waters, the director was understood.
According to Bartoshka, women are taking tigers to make a rabbit of him in time.
They're gonna get him a little feed, but they'll close the door right away so he can't think of playing outside the rabbit's tiger.
And that's what we're trying to tell our movie, the actor commented.
His wife, who can act mildly negatively on the audiences, created Eliska Balzer.
She's not just a negative character.
She is also pleasant, intelligent, empathy, and she thinks well.
But at the same time, she's a Uzurpator, and she wants to cultivate her husband to death, and Bajgar's understood.
The film is parallelly similar to the fate of John's married daughters Olinka and Alenka - Tanja Vilhelm and Paula Berett - and the wits of Eric and Pepik - Jiří Havelka and Jacob Kohak.
The film producer is Peter Erben from Logline Production, coproducents Czech TV and Expansion and Slovakia TV.
Google promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The US Internet company Google promised to provide up to 5.5 million dollars (132.6 million CZK) to organisations that help thousands of refugees flowing to Europe.
She announced it on Tuesday Google.org, which is a charity of this Internet company.
Azerbaijan canceled Telich's part of the visit for the criticism of human rights violations.
The Czech Ambassador of the European Parliament for the movement of ANO Paul Telička postponed a fourth journey to Baku, because the Azerbaijan authorities had abolished his official visit today.
According to Telica, this is justified by the EP resolution last week, which criticizes the violation of human rights in Azerbaijan and which Telička was a co-autor.
By decision of the Azerbaijan Party, Telička lost the possibility of interviews with official partners and the visit of political prisoners depending on the consent of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in the press statement.
The road, which was planned several months earlier, wanted Telička to use to meet with Parliament's leadership and executive representatives, as well as the representatives of the democratic opposition, disidents and political prisoners, as detailed the text sent to the CRC.
The EP resolution condemns "unseen repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
She called on European representatives to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after the recent judgment of the Azerbaijan opposition journalist Chadjija Ismail, who was in charge of the discovery of corruption in government circles.
Russia does not exclude that it builds its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovski did not exclude the Russian Air Base in Syria in the future when he visited Novosibirska.
We don't have plans like that yet.
But nothing's excluded, he said.
Russia has already a maritime base in Syria in Tartus, which has been used as a service and logistics center so far.
According to Russian press reports, the delivery of Russian arms and military material in Syria has risen since August.
According to Moscow, it is an armed shipment based on valid commercial agreements.
Pentagon claims that the Russians are going to establish a air base in Lataki City, which remains the garden of Syrian President Basar Asada for now.
Washington, however, does not have the specific military intentions of Russia in Syria completely clear, the American commentators agree.
The US Foreign Minister John Kerry talked about the situation in Syria on Tuesday with Russian colleague Sergey Lavrov, which was their third phone conversation in the last ten days.
Next week, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjah will go to Moscow to translate anxiety on the assembly of the Russian arsenal near Israel.
The speaker of the White House Josh Earnest marked Asad's support for losing a bet.
On the objectives of Russia's policy in Syria, he declared that they were rather incorrect.
According to him, Moscow made his satellite from Syria.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is following a rather long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not quite clear.
The war in Syria, according to today's speculation of Russian press, should be the main theme of Putin's speech at the coming meeting of the UN Vale Meeting in New York.
The situation in Ukrainian Donbas said the Russian leader would not speak at all.
According to this report, the New York Times states that the US government may not exclude that President Barack Obama and Russian President could meet during the UN session.
The views between the White House's advisors are still broken up.
The TASS agency today, appealing to the words of the Kremel speaker Dmitri Peskov, wrote that Putin has not met with Obama at its newyor residence program yet.
Sesame oil plant at yellow diet, the conop helps strengthen immunity.
The good way to increase the elevation of unsaturated fat acids of these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
All healthy substances will remain in the oil when licking from seed to cold.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of the health diet, such as yellows.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
They are the most common cause of the Czech death for years, according to the Institute of Health and Statistics.
Limb inflammations are mainly affected by women, helping sezam oil.
If you belong to Asian kitchen lovers, you must not miss sezam oil in your squirrel, which is part of the original recipes for exotic foods.
Unlike most of the other oils, heat adjustments of food can also be used and have a variety of positive health effects.
It is often used in yellow diet.
The essential fat acids that it contains are a good prevention of the creation of yellow stones.
These are 90% of the cause of mutual inflammation and women suffer three times more than men.
In general, the problems with the limb are particularly affected by people with overweight who do not sport and consume many animal fats.
Sezam oil can also be used successfully in the liver diet that is very similar to the juice.
If people want to benefit from all the health benefits of consumption of this oil, they should be careful about the goods of exotic food stores.
Producers from Asia often use to liss seeds that have more delicious taste.
However, oil is losing all the active substances, described by Ladislav Hačeski, the executive director of the Czech company Bogemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovska, which produces bio-door oil lissed for cold.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unpropelled seeds of white season.
In an hour, our fox will be able to clear 8 pounds of sezam.
Mechanical lissing of raw materials warms up to 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for the labelling extra virgin.
In higher temperatures, there would be loss of foodstuffs.
Solar oil is prospering in heart and vessel diseases.
The Czech favorite of oil is sunshine.
The research of Jarmily Hamerski, who led at Masaryk's university, revealed that he prefers him in a warm kitchen of 43% of respondents.
However, roasting is not actually suitable, but it starts to burn at 180 °C.
For example, it is better to use it to taste salads and is especially suitable in diet where it helps to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high share of omega 6 unsaturated fat acids, which reduce cholesterol levels of all fat acids.
In heart problems, you should be careful about the amount of totally accepted fat and calories.
For example, there are 62 calories in one spoon of sunflower oil, 99 calories in a spoon of rape oil.
As regards the energy value of food, it is important to realize that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than so-calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
That's why it's appropriate to touch extra virgin oils.
The sunshine's gonna last like a sesam and a 9-month seasonal.
The storage in the refrigerator continues.
Old oil people recognize in particular by a bitter taste.
On the contrary, there's no inflammation on the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Conop oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of the technique are consistent with so-called superfoods, and therefore the conop oil is considered the healthiest of plant oils.
This label owes the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fat acids.
These essential fat acids can't make the body alone and a person has to take them from food.
Especially important is the income of omega 3 fat acids.
Study of scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Food has shown that the daily receipt of this substance is insufficient.
The men in France and Greece consume her 0.6 grams, but the Icelandic will accept 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Conop oil is suitable to put into the dining room as part of support diet to strengthen immunity and heal injuries.
He has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People don't have to use rope oil to fear, they don't contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that he found this oil path to consumers confirms that in the company of Bohemia Oil belongs to the most selling.
He's sold 500 liters a year.
People often use one spoon in the morning.
The rope oil is not delicious, but will greatly strengthen the immunity, advised Daniel Vilček from the Kraslic company Bogemia Oil.
According to statistics, the Americans are the most prominent nation of barbecues.
One household is 1.4 grilles.
The world’s widespread contests in grilling, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There aren't even Czechs in the back.
Based on consumer research on the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people in life did not grill.
The total majority also grills several times a year.
To be successful, we cannot underestimate preparations - ideal is to adjust the meat by marining a few hours before heat adjustment.
What oil is the most suitable and will keep the health of the beneficial substances while grilling?
In general, the grilling process itself should be saved with fat.
Experts agree that a large number of oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
The healthy extra virgin oils also lose the body of a useful substance, which we otherwise obtain in consumption of oils of food adjusted at lower temperatures.
But it does not mean that extra virgin oils in the barbecue will not find their use.
Terrible oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When a meat is said, the experts from the company Bogemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovska will immediately eradicate a gross oil.
Excellently, it adds the taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen, the unique characteristics of increased natural tastes of food.
It is also suitable for roasting and grilling, because it has a high level of burning up to 216 °C.
Even with such high temperature, as one of the few oils keeps the health of the useful substances, Daniel Vilček, the benefits of the gross oil from the company of Bohemia Oil, which belongs to several Czech producers of this oil from the wine.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains a high quantity of linol acid and is therefore effective in the fight against the abundance of cholesterol.
In the gross oil, our body is also accepted by important unsaturated fat acids, vitamins and minerals.
Because of the positive content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive impact on kidneys.
We also help to increase our external beauty - because it improves the flexibility of the skin, it is used in the treatment of acne and helps to care for dry and broken hair.
The chefs commend the use of a horrible oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for cold food preparations, for example in tasteing salads, but also for heat adjustment of food.
So it can be used in two ways, in marine and grilling itself.
By marineing meat and fish, we can keep their solitacy.
In preparing marinade, three components must be present: oil, acidity and spine.
For example, we give the acid with apple octs and we end the softening of the meat.
Seeds again delivers a mass of taste and oil preserves and supplies the right cut, advised by Daniel Wolf.
At the same time, it adds that grape oil is directly ideal for marineing because as one of the few oils, it can go straight through dark meat.
So the marine meat or fish are ready for grilling, how are you going on?
Extra virgin oils are indicated by only a few drops to prepare food.
The same applies to grilling.
Some oils are total tabu for this method.
In particular, it applies to the lazy, rope and rape oil that should not be warmed at all.
You can trip the roast with oil before you grill yourself, preventing the burning of food.
The necessarily part of the grilling is also the preparation of the Annexes.
Fruit meat and fish are practically suitable - grilled vegetables, baked bread, light vegetable salad and many other.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, hot summer salad.
You need it: • 1 ks of broscue • 1 handcut • 1 cup of cup of cut coats • 1 cup of mixtures of salad sheets • 3 soup spoons of gross oil
Add to the salad bowl to the mixture of salad sheets accumulated handcuff, cut cocktails, and to the large cube cut brosque.
According to the taste of osolte and resist, you can also taste the milk chill and soy sauce.
Finally, dig a few drops of grape oil.
For a special taste, then you can suck the salad with gently cutted handcuffs.
Dissolved sclerosis: it is not only important to medicinal products but also to fight on the will of a patient.
The sclerosis is complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of experts: neurolog, physiotherapeutic, erroterapist, rorolog, oftalmolog, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only the treatment care, for example women with sclerosis need consultations, if they decide to have a child, the care of these sick are also socially legal advice, recommendations for residence, etc.
Nevertheless, this is not enough: the development of disease can significantly affect the patient himself.
The more he will fight with the disease actively, the longer he can work, and he does not have to change its lifestyle essentially.
As doctors warn, the passive of patients releases the area for sickness.
For example, it is demonstrated that regular movement is significantly declined when a sick person needs some compensation aid, such as a stick.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not be subjected to different myths, such as that disease is automatically leading them to end up in a wheelchair.
Even that's why the site came up Take a chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Take a chance.
The most important person in care of a sick with a sclerosis is a neurologist.
The sclerosis is used twice as saying that if the disease begins to be treated early, more likely the doctor may affect something.
It's because we have medication on a broken sclerosis in an inflammatory stadium when the neurodegeneration process is not so strong yet.
The sooner we get in touch, the greater is the hope that we can stop the disease and reduce disability, explains the MUDR. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with disturbed sclerosis of rehabilitation care, which most often solves the weaknesses of lower ends or equivalence disorders.
Patients are working according to their individual needs: to maintain condice, to improve walk, to strengthen the bottom, to reduce swallow disorders or to improve coordination.
"It is really individual, depends on the particular difficulties of the patient," says Mr. Martin Kövari, the primary Clinic of Rehabilitation and Technical Medicine Faculty Hospital in Motole.
People with sclerosis are suffering from the same disease, but it is a little different way in every one.
Rehab cannot stop the disease, but it can always mitigate its symptoms.
However, the movement activity also strengthens the immune state of the organism, which is desirable in the case of a dissolved sclerosis.
Another positive regular exercise is the fact that sick people are checking out what they can do, strengthening their self - certainty.
"In practices, endorphines are also floating and a person feels good after it," states PhDr. Camila Rásová from the Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine Faculty Hospital of the Royal Wine.
By influenceing the physical site, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
This is how we interfere with mental and immune processes and stabilize disease, he adds.
"These patients used to be saved so-called, we know today that they need a targeted burden," said Professor PaedDr. Paul Kolar, preferred Clinic Rehabilitation and Technical Medicine Faculty Hospital in Motole.
The purpose of physiotherapy is that a person can stay as long as possible, including a working classification.
Therefore, physiotherapeutics cooperate with ergotherapeans so that each person receives compensation for a peaceful sewed help.
Many patients also need psychologist or psychiatric care.
They're in a hard life situation.
When a serious disease comes to your life, most people will shake it.
They're in shock, panic, fear.
He must react to a great burden - loss of health.
With such a sick soul, we have to go after someone, not to try to take everything on our own stockings.
"I'm working with them so that they will finally conclude that even with the hard-case can live a full life and that the sclerosis is not the end of my life," says therapist Renata Malinov - Schubert of the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague Latecoere, the airbuses wouldn't fly.
Aviation production is a synonym of precision and advanced technologies.
New planes are full of titanium or light and fixed composite materials that someone can't make and process immediately.
However, next to super-precise, controlling machines, the composite compository machines can be struck into something as usual as the measuring bakes.
In a bubble that resembles the sugar vault, the grains of the bowl parts that have just emerged from the freaking machine are mixed up in a bunch of bakers.
"No one has yet come to know anything better," smiles Ivan Dubski, Director-General of Air Door Producer Latecoere, Czech Republic.
In the Prague Summer Area, the previous Flight is produced by complete doors for Airbus A320.
As the only ones in the world, they add doors to Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors whose part is composed of Prague also enter the first and higher classes on topboards of the largest airbus A380 aircraft world.
There are also a door full of composites for a new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Precision here is the main motto.
Maybe the momentary keys allow the company to operate twice a year.
If there is no control record on the yellow sticker, in the Prague race they should explain what to airbus or Boeing auditors who are driving regularly to verify whether the door is being made under the agreed rules.
But the advanced technique has not completely replaced human senses.
There are 1500 nits on one door to A320.
Those nitters have to knock up manually.
It takes two days.
Even according to the sound of the whiskey, they'll find out if he's already ripped right away.
The tolerance they move is minimal.
Nyte can emerge from zero to 0.13 mm above the surface of the plane.
It's approximately twice the fat of human hair.
When checking, there will be a number of trained mass.
When the controller crosses a row of nails, he will know if someone's out of tolerance.
When he takes the exact defective dimension in his hand.
Flight was flying in the year 1989 for the training of the L-39 military aircraft.
But in 1991, none of them had been produced.
The company had to find new orders quickly.
It was then together with the European Airbus aircraft producer.
She won the selection procedure on the emergency door suppliers for A321 model.
Boeing's talks weren't so happy.
"We were a small company that didn't have enough money for investment for them then and that Boeing could guarantee long-term stable supply," Dubski recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would remain inclined if Aircraft had not participated in the 1999 Prague International Air Industry Association Conference of the French Latecoere Group.
I talked about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day the talks with the French began, Dubsky says.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and new contracts came with a strong company.
Right in 2000, the accommodation of the door parts for A320.
Three years later, the top board doors for A380 arrived.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for shipping for Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoer, we wouldn't get to these big orders ourselves.
Maybe we'd do parts or small parts.
Partners want a supplier for twenty or thirty years, Dubsky explains.
Last year, Czech Latecoere reached a turnover over 2.9 billion and profit after taxation of 147 million crowns.
The exclusive position between aircraft producers is not free.
Latecoere has invested 1,5 billion crowns in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of 170 special production processes and qualification certificates for key employees.
Without them, the company wouldn't produce any doors to the aircraft.
To obtain certificates that the production processes meet the customers' requirements, and in repeated checks they are maintained according to the Dubai million crowns.
Production processes are changing each year.
They're more precise and strict.
We need to train employees, provide equipment and re-certify the whole process, Dubski adds.
The company is now finishing the preparation of the process for coating with zink and nicle that replaces human health harmful cadmium.
Although they received the entry from the manufacturer, they had to adapt technology to the devices or chemicals they used in Prague.
People from Boeing will come, check the concept of the whole line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They'll check our lab, too.
One set of samples they test themselves in their lab and then compare the results with ours, drawing closer to the Dubai way the users control them.
The reward of the Prague company is long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague race today, it stands and the production of embryos falls.
For A320, it produces half of the total volume of doors.
The replacement of Czech Latecoere is either impossible for Brazilian or European producers or very complex.
It does not mean, however, that he could make any price behind the door.
Part of the contract is a price curve.
It indicates how much one door will cost for ten, 50, a set of pieces made.
The price of a piece still falls to a certain limit.
We have to enter this price sample.
If not, we'll work, Dubsky says.
Half the hall where electrical closets are completed for Airbus Airbus A400 M military aircraft are yet empty.
But he is a symbol of the future.
There is a new semi-workotic line for nitting and mounting doors for an innovated model A320 Neo.
Nitation will be accelerated and precise.
"It is the trend that the aircraft's mounting takes place," Dubski added.
Repayment is secured by the future line.
Airbus reports that airlines have yet ordered 3278 pieces of a new model A320.
Just a few meters next to the line for the complete mounting of the doors for the upper deck A380.
It's a strategic decision of our mother's company.
The goal is to reduce production and reduce costs.
The full mount could start in two years, Dubsky says.
However, beforewards, the company must take qualification tests, such as, for the mounting of certain electrical and electronic devices to the door for the largest Airbus.
The company also bets on further development of production from compository materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should also participate in the new Airbus A350 programme, which will compete with the US Dreamliner.
"For the company it is a huge loan when he can process compositions, except metal materials," Dubski says proudly.
However, Latecoere is obtained from the food of production capacity in Czech Republic.
There's no more place in the lotov area where they're sitting.
Before the French mother entered, the company had 180 employees.
Now she's got 800 and in three years, there might be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are ahead of how many hundreds of new airlines order each year, they don't have to worry about work.
Although he had procurements for a few years ahead, the mother company of Prague Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money to pay loans.
Finally, Latecoere was able to talk to the main believers.
At the end of August, part of the loans exchanged them for shares.
Contributors received an increase in capital by 57.4 million euros of 37.4 per cent.
The debt of the company dropped by two thirds, which is 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company wrote between the existing shareholders a new share of 222,9 million euros.
In general, it raised the basic capital by 280 million euros.
The entire group, however, comes from growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which are 85 per cent participating in the market.
The average increase of the procurement is expected by four per cent per year until 2017.
In the book, he has orders for 2.6 billion euros, which corresponds to four-year production.
The French media claims that Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on the pockets.
The Czech Race in Prague Summer is important for groups.
16% contributes to the group’s sales.
According to the number of employees, it is the biggest foreign branch of the group.
The messengers supported a larger share of the coal tax state.
The change in non-root taxes will bring to the state treasure 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
The revenues of the municipalities should have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the fee should be higher.
In the predloń year, the municipalities received approximately 450 million crowns and the state budget of 150 million crowns.
The coal of brown carbon came from about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns.
Novela also counts to increase the remuneration from the winning space with a thousand crowns per hectare per year.
Receipt from these penalties shall continue to belong to the communities in full.
Industries Minister Jan Mladek (CSSD) told messengers that the municipalities would acquire a year instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The amount of fees will no longer be fixed by the law, but it is set by the government by its regulations.
The remuneration shall be calculated as the amount of quantity of unencumbered influenza and rates for individual types of non-growth.
According to the government, amendment is the cause of an option of flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, the Member of the OS Marek Benda warned that the establishment of a tax by the government regulation must not be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mladka, it is not a tax in this case, because the state is paying charges for the turmoil that is a state property.
Only citizens whose territories are subject to burdens shall receive fees.
In the case of depth coal, three quarters of money will be received from the community and a quarter of the states.
The same ratio will be in case of radioactive mines.
The amount of the money that he chooses to pay pay is intended to be bound.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair injuries after burden or to ensure the bany rescue service.
Today, the proposal was criticised by opposition Members who, in particular, claimed to harm the municipalities affected by the burden and regions.
For example, Michal Kuchera (TOP 09 and Starships) warned that the firms will no longer want to sponsor the municipalities, as they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunne one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kadner (Swit) chosen in the Ústec region.
Before the increment of unemployment on Mosteck, KSCHM Hanna Aulica warned.
Kadner and Aulique failed to propose a novel to reject, Kuchera wanted the law to reimburse the government.
The reasonable report states that, according to quantitative companies, tax increases will not be produced into carbon prices, since the prices of more than 90 per cent are long-termly contracted.
Therefore, the main consumers like electricity or temperatures should not feel price growth.
"But, on the other hand, this fact increases the risk of increasing compensation organisations to compensate with the effort to reduce their operating expenditure, which would mainly mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, it considers that the increase in employment fees is profitable.
According to the rapporteur, Milan Urbana (CSSD), it is crucial for the Members to know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and, in particular, the government's decision on carbon carbon boundaries.
If the coal is going to go beyond the limits, then it will have impacts on the profits for the state and the community, he emphasized.
The Urban disagrees with the Youth that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czech Slovak Army should fall until 2020.
The limits at the bottom of the CEA should already be broken for social, national economic reasons and due to the long-term stability of the country's energy.
Time for the decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching the US Federal Reserve meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision whether to increase interest rates for the first time after almost decades.
An examination of 80 economies from the agency Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision, now think they would remain inactive for a while and leave interest rates between 0-0.25 per cent.
It's a historic event, because it's been seated years since the Fed's rates were reduced to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the situation where the main central bank could be able to get out of the zero lap and start the process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The American economy has been doing quite well, recovering in the form of adding trillion dollars to the state account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, Fed cannot ignore less pink global perspective.
They warned the markets to be prepared to increase, but the circumstances indicate that they also see great chances against this step.
Decision should be notified on Thursday 20:00 SEH.
The shooter at the Delta State University left a message.
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday -- and later the same day as his colleague -- wrote a message in which he claimed that he was "summer" of his first murder and wished to take it back, discovered on Tuesday the government authorities.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, stated that Lamb, geographical and social science teacher at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning around ten o'clock
And he said he shot someone.
The Lamb Dispatcher asked him to send a cop to his house.
He said: “I shot my wife last night, ” and he also mentioned that there is a “sweet dog ” in the house that“ will not bother anyone, ” but is upset.
The police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb didn't introduce himself.
Lamb also did not explain why the house was fired.
When the police arrived at the scene, she found the body of 41 - year - old Amy Prentiss and a manually written message from Lamba, which said: “I am so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving a message, Lamb took a 300 miles long trip to Delta University, where he killed the teacher of history of Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
The Dean of the University William LaForge said that he didn’t know about any conflict between Lambe and Schmidt, but that “there was obviously something in the head of Mr. Lamba. ”
Even despite the Monday statement that Lamb believed in the romantic relationship of Amy Prentiss with Schmidt, the government authorities stated that there were no "loving triangle" on the "loving triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married with Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a “great person. ”
The divorce happened 15 years ago, but both of them remained friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was "whispered."
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, said Sun Herald, worked from the Prentiss house through the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lights, was dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," Knowles heard.
The police stated that Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he would not go to jail.
When the cops reached him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
According to the biography published on the school website, Lamb was a doctorate at the University of Delta on spring 2015.
Stars that lost their magic
Herec (left), on the picture with his son Redmond (right) has several stressful years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and in 2009 lost his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett because of cancer.
The actor also reportedly had a problem with drugs, and in 2008 he was detained for drug holding.
All these things certainly choose their taxes.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be out of the game for a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in the League of Masters against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defense left this wound in the tears and expelled him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury caused the unreasonable action of Héctor Moren in 15 minutes when the 20-year-old Shaw broke into PSV space.
Nine minutes he was treated on the field and also needed oxygen mask before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double break of his leg and now he's in the hospital."
He will be transported tomorrow or perhaps after tomorrow and then operated in Manchester.
It's awful - a boy who comes to Manchester when he's 18, it's very hard, but he plays fantastic and then happens this.
When he was in his dress, he also had a oxygen mask.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg break requires six months of treatment and will not be able to play a group phase.
I believe he'll play this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalt cop.
The judge, Nicola Rizzoli, didn't punish Mexican.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian judge was wrong.
You can assess whether it was penalty and red card.
It was a very ugly move to both legs.
Tweet from Shawa's account says, "Thank everyone for their news, words can't express how I'm ruined, my path to recovery begins now and I'll come back even stronger."
Related: Manchaster United recorded injuries of Luke Shawa in defeat against PSV
The English defender will have an added motivation for recovery in the form of Europe's championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said, "It was a very ugly wound."
When any player leaves the field with such injuries, everyone is very sad.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt the opponents.
Moreno suffered a fracture of his leg in the game for Mexico against Van Gaal Netherlands at the world's championship 2014.
"It's very difficult for him, because his intention was not to injure the players, and when you hear about the seriousness of such injuries, it's not good," said Coca.
I couldn't see this moment.
I only saw the ball that was heading in another direction, so it seemed like it was touched by [Moreno], but I didn't see the effect on Luke.
In an interview for SBS6 Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smalling's operation.
David Cameron sure knows the Lorax better?
Every parent knows this thing: when a child loves a book, it doesn't take long until he learns to remember it.
Of course, you can't be David Cameron.
On the question of the children's scheme provider to appoint the favorite child book, he chose the President of the Government of Lorax, a fairy tale of Dr. Seusse of 1971.
It was difficult to choose, Cameron writes in a report published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "A funny, thrilling, creative, and with strong content, that I liked to read to my children because there was always a picture or message that I've never seen before."
Well, until, in the following paragraph, Cameron reportedly described the story of the book according to the elevator from the 2012 film, which added additional figures and details to fill out the short original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville, the walls, where all nature stopped existing, and even the air is a commodity, the boy named Ted hopes that he gets the heart of the girls of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see the real tree," is a brief content of the book that records the familiar object of the unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
It's like it wasn't enough suspicious, the text added by Cameron reads as a summary elevator of the Lorax film, which is located on the web page of the film Database, and starts with the words: "In the city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has stopped existing, and even the air is a commodity, the boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of your dreams, Audrey."
Since he was openly a practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not meet the book event where the unnamed young man will know that the local nature is destroying a county, trees of one-ler industry, who, despite the protests of the title Loraxe, a scratched, whispering creature who "speaks for trees."
With the highest probability of this relatively little PR task was received by an assistant who never read Lorax to the child 20 times in a piece.
The Downing Street speaker said that the text was probably coming from Cameron's office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron employee, but without another comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of the reminder of England, but he still keeps
Competiting with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team that England has chosen for this tour, I think the repetition of the defeat of 3-0, which she suffered last time in the test series, is unlikely.
I wouldn't be excluding the guests' victory either.
The Alastair Cooka side can be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good backplayers in this packaging composition and collective thinking are strong; they will not take scars from 2012, just a youth positive.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is developing spinner and Adil Rashid, even if unknown at the level of test series, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of England's team in experience of the series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to forget Adam Lyth is a hard nut for me to analyze, because his main coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests standed against two good attacks in difficult conditions and simple, but hard reality is that cricket players are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, around the name Joe Root, there were no questionnaires, which led to the announcement, because — and this I have already indicated — the players are their best selectors.
A few more half centuries and Lyth could have extended his series, but he had control over his own fate.
Hopefully, if he can get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The chief coach of England, Trevor Baylis, praised his attitude, even though his performances were not totally 100%, and that doesn't surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how long a test time the patch gets to show is a tough nut.
Lyth got seven hats — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and outside.
The only thing you could remcate is that England gave the first chance of Jonathan Trott in Caribbean — although Lyth was in the best form — but this was already past.
Alex Hales is coming, and that's the patch I appreciate very positively.
It's the x-factor cricket player we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season when he got 236 against us on Trent Bridge playground, which did somehow.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course all this will depend on the total composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea when Moeen starts by Cooka, who would get another extra spinner while keeping four speeds, was brought against it and I have no reservations against it.
I don't understand why the strokemaker can't fire, and this left man has already shown that he's an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them and there's no big difference in it.
My former team colleague Justin Langer played his first 38 tests before his appearance in 2001.
He did it for three centuries, and he didn't even look around.
The team comes to Zafar Ansari as a backup spinner, and when I had the opportunity to watch him, he took me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his gross statistics — average 31 with a basket and 35 with a ball — but there are no many spinners to raise their hands, and the selectors decided for youth.
She's learning a lot about this tournament.
In addition to the team, England seemed to have made several changes and smart completion of their coach staff.
The name of Mahel Jayawardenea, the Sri Lanka collaborator, as a consultant for test matches can be a master move.
He's one of the most beautiful players who bring rich experiences by having experience with all conditions and attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the white-ball tour and brings to the team both energy and miserable spark.
I've always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and as Mahela has an intellect that can be used.
New votes in the closet, even though the voices say consistent things that have been said before, may sometimes relax and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham Ben Stokes got a single day off, just like Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this decision.
Even though many disagree, coaches and selectors do not make a schedule.
And you must remember as players that their work depends on the results.
Such a decision can never be taken to light weight.
The Brexit Campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
The unreasonable strategy of David Cameron's renegotiation to maintain Britain in the EU has been encountered in other problems with every last day and without choosing a brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the Head of the Workers' Party, or there will be a Tuc on Tuc on Thursday, taking the whole situation around Europe.
The aliens also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe drowns in various crisiss -- not all of which are their fault -- some Member States have already had enough British egocentric agendas, dividing concessions and disruptive changes in the contract that they mostly did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, TUC decided that they wouldn't want it even if they had the social protection.
We can even call it a selfie agenda of Dave and George.
Prime Minister and Chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropoliers, make a picture before a famous local monument, with or without local clerks, and then return home with words that they win allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants Britain independently in Europe -- "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin -- suggests that some short-term ministers and officials in some major cities have reached the point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, the German cautiously balanced Chancellor, is an alliance, but she was at the power of 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as it was for too long for the continued Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohla (16).
Frances François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power also falls.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It's difficult to watch them break their legs with the help of Selfia British, who could better invest their energy in preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - which is something they don't want themselves because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan deliberately useless notes of the SNP style during the campaign before referendum 2017 in Great Britain to speed Brexit, says a friend.
"The repeated negotiations solved the problem" and "Britten has nothing valuable from negotiations."
The Europeans know how grave Fleet Street can be and how skeptical about the EU are the pressing oligarch barons, because they were not during a referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 in ratio 2:1.
They can remember the name Boris Johnson, an emerging Euro-oportunist who made his name as a Brussels rapporteur "EU straight bananas" at the beginning of the 1990s.
Despite his embarrassment, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mixtures of dangerless taxes, foreigners hacking phones and the pseudo of the Non-Sea department, which owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in the cage with a freaked gorilla, you have to throw her bananas to keep you out of dinner and then to tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself, when he opposed Cameron's referendum, since Blair accepted the principle of abolished EU constitution, which was flooded by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and obtained a map of dismissal.
The press would never forgive him either.
But the dear Jeremy Corbyn, who made me a friendly cry on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he must no longer waste time on me - it seems to be in danger of re-accepting Murdoch Neil Kinnock's strategy, which was a mistake at the time and now.
It may take a while, but it needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose chair on BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe, I'll say nicely, evolving.
He claims that he wishes to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the freak trends of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little englishism can definitely join it.
The same said Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn in the radio and television this week, when his internal scout couldn't decide to admit that Corbyn's name of an abrasive McDonnell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 70 years when his old father fought on TV for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
The Hillary game was much more attractive.
But fighting for remaining "in all the circumstances" - Benni's phrase -- it wasn't what McDonnell said, or what JC told his colleagues and messengers at their private meeting Monday night,
Whatever the background is, the sensitive image that Corbyn wants to share - remember, he touched me - the discipline of the message remains important in the age of the whole day's television and especially in faith, the paranoia and treasons of social media
It is fair not to provide Cameron's free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to consider the support of the Staff in the referendum's campaign as of course as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic screwing about EU membership - in accordance with their Bennite obsessive economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoterical discussion between the left disidents, for which the narcissism of small differences is the central element of dogmatic hastering.
Just as his screwing about Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end this - foreign diplomats will try to understand the meaning of all of this for their masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - also have suspected voters - because of the concessions of Britain when it seems useless?
The United States are already quite disappointed in the Britain 's weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when reducing the costs of the conservative government at the power, as I was reminded at the Monday beginning of something called the British Security Forum.
Experts criticize reviews on electronics published by the Public Health Agency of England
The announcement by the government funded by the Agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking, came from the meeting of 12 people, some of whom are associated with the tobacco industry, the researchers say.
The experts written in British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet criticism of evidence used in their electronic cigarettes by the Public Health Agency of England (PHE).
The PHE issued the "member" report last month and described it as "complex examination of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the volume of data and noted the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The introductor in Lancet's professional magazine last month attacked the "extremely chamber base", on which the PHE Agency founded its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for BMJ have questioned the claims that were allegedly "built on rocks or sand."
Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of efficiency."
They claim that the public could expect that the claim of the PHE Agency, which sounds "the contemporary best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people called to develop a analysis of the multi-critical decision (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on damages related to various products containing nikotin; the results of the negotiations were summarized in the research report.
McKee and Capewell stated that one sponsor of this meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, whose Director General has reportedly already received funds from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved the public health authorisation of BAT in the sustainability report, he states.
One of the 12 participants of the meeting acknowledged the funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not the funding that he reportedly obtained from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reason for selecting members of the panel is not available, but they contain several known champions of electronic cigarettes, some also declare industrial finances in the newspapers.
Some other attendees are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting in PHE also attended tobacco leadership.
The report formed in this group "explicitly accepts" missing "tight evidence of the harmfulness of most products on most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, no such references or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the PHE claim that "there is no evidence that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoke for children or non-fuelers," was too early.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Prosperity in PHE, said that BMJ claims had been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two life-life smokers will die because of his dependence.
All evidence suggests that the health risks presented by electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but we must continue to explore long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the evidence shows and what they do not show, especially when there was so much public confusion on relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80 000 people die annually on smoking diseases and smoking costs NHS £2 billion per year.
Clearly emphasizing the current evidence - that even though the e-cigarettes are not without risk, they have only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we fill our national competence.
BBC should end with EastEnders, claiming former Director Channel 4
Former Director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders and The Voices, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "to give the right hand" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the license fee should be used only for programs not formed by other British television broadcasting.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programs that will probably be monitored by only a bunch of people in complex radio time against his rivals "the biggest rating show, and on channels like BBC4.
After generally director Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he failed to try to connect with BBC for six years that he worked on Channel 4.
"I fight with the idea that the BBC is introducing and sending programs that would certainly be transmitted by rivals without State contributions," said Johnson in the Upper House Communication Commission, as part of the negotiations on the future of BBC.
If you maintain licence fees that I'm not sure whether in the mid-term or long-term horizon they are a good idea, the creation should at least be reduced as regards programs not produced or not.
They're sending the Voices in the main broadcast time because they want to get as wide as possible support to the future.
The idea that no one else would send him is a ridiculous joke, and apparently nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why regressive tax should support programs that can be financed without contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and obviously produced on homeland.
Honestly, other channels would put their right hand for them.
I can't understand how they are publicly emitted.
I don't think it would even weaken the BBC at least.
Johnson, a serieskeeper who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said BBC that he felt guilty by reaching ratings "for the ambitions of people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to provide long-term support."
His comment on the most popular show of BBC repeats those who the former Executive Director of Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that BBC will sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even more hysterical BBC public service programmes "goes to BBC4, where it is quite often not possible to measure publicity, but they fill their power and can argument when they are going to their hypocrisy mission of justification £4bn from license fees, "But of course, we are doing all these observation programs that no one is looking at."
They're sending them when no one's looking at them.
Regarding the license fees, Johnson said to the Commission: "I invite you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value of it.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a large sum, but for people for whom 150 pounds is much, I'd be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look so much on BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5, the former director David Elstein, who went out on Tuesday before the Commission, said that the BBC should revise its Reith mission in the sense of "information, education and entertainment."
He confirmed that a small volume of BBC production has now been classified earlier as educational - it had been 1% of TV production and 0.1% in the radio - and should take a model of public broadcast in Australia and Canada and change to "informate, explanate and entertain."
On the subject of partnership, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which were only sent on TV, and connected to commercial reporters so that we could all see them online.
‘Sonogenetic’ or brain cell controlling using sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction that the gleams move.
Scientists raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
The tiny clasts change the direction at the moment they are affected by sound impulses that are unacceptable for the human ear.
The pulses work so that they switch cells genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity using light
Scientists stated that these worms are a great display of a new methodology called sonogenetic, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and is activated outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher from the Salk Institute in La Jolla in California, stated for Guardian's journal that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - the invasive procedure involving electrodes that stimulate the brain. The method is used for the treatment of Parkinson's symptoms.
The gleams usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reactions will be delivered when they are placed in the fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found, the bubbles strengthen the ultrasound waves that then pass through the body of the worms.
Intensified ultrasound waves operate in ion channels TRP-4, which are located in the membranes of certain worm cells.
The sound waves open and activate cells with which they are connected are reported in the report of Nature Communications.
In order to control the ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain ion channels TRP-4.
When he then used for such modified ultrasound worms, the sound waves were strengthened by microbubles and moved to worms where modified motor neurons were embedded.
The new method is in many ways like optogenetics, a pioneer tool that allows scientists to switch and switch neurons through light.
Chalasani, however, heard that sonogenetics could have many advantages against this technique.
Unlike the light which must be sent by an optical fibre to the required place in the brain, the ultrasonic waves may prosecute the tissue without restrictions and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasonic signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurologic diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also be found in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin cells.
Illegal torture device - right on your threshold!
Reservations shameing the British arms trade.
Look at a video on the anti-arm market from Amnesty International.
Terrible killer drones!
Eyes on the legs that break the bullets!
Shooting shots!
And electrical clouding earrings that cause insufficient pain, but do not leave any traces!
The joyful voice and criticism of metafors do not leave anyone doubts that this advertisement at the largest world weapon veleters is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International for the emphasis of the willingness of the British government to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the defence and security facilities International Veselice in the ExCeL Centre in the London County of Docklands.

However, a separate campaign is also led by the outbreak of posters at bus stops and metres that require a second view.
"The important notification, Travel to DLR from 15 to 18 September?" reads one, using letters with marks of London metro with DLR lines becomes a tank image.
This year, in September, the roy of arms traders will come down to DLR ... Customers are requested to help stop arms trade.
300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
The Special Patrol Group Collective helped distribute all over London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is 6 £ for a piece of Allen key, which reportedly "contains access to about a third of the advertising bus stops on the planet."
Transport to London is not funny with this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies made by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Greendon, the courier of Cruel Designs and an expert assistant at the Essex University, the artists are increasingly doubting and trying to show political activity to audience outside the gallery.
Many artists go to work with activists within the protest movements and realize that they have to get out in a real world to make their art influence on society.
Another of the posters against the trade in weapons traveling in the metro.
Video Amnesty was seen on Facebook over 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP agency working without permission for a fee and graphical designer and commentator also worked for free.
Creative Director VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by the silent advertising about arms trade -- saw an empty place in the ExCeL calendar -- and thought, "Let's show them a campaign that is trying to avoid."
They played with creating a more realistic risky company advertising, but "in addition of slight colors and animations, we've made it aim for more people."
"They took a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about the sale of torture instruments," said Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we now need is that the United Kingdom government takes measures and ensures that the torture equipment is not illegally traded on our threshold.
Hopefully the most creative art surrounding arms trade comes from within ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantasticly eufemist products.
In the press report, Saab discovered an order from the US Army to "at4CS RS on the shoulder."
This includes "only protected head, which provides amazing effects beyond the armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be nice.
Eight Gold Rules for Life on Student College
11 years ago, I moved to a college as an unrespectable nineteen-year-old boy, still believed in barets and moral relativism, but so far I think of the tense smiles of those I've been interrupting - and many long-term complaints on others.
Everything I've learned can be destilated in eight simple rules.
The move to the rail may move from slightly to nerves that go to totally shocking.
It's attractive to talk: to people from where you're from, if you've taken a year of break, what you're thinking about Corbyn and why "you don't really love Marmite, or you don't really hate Marmite, because people, it's just an extraction from HAHAHAHA quasifies, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others also breathe - ask and express interest.
It runs the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and those with whom you wouldn't have talked to even if your bowls were in one fire and they would have issued firearms.
Leave people space.
The rooms of people often change into a drinking reception, places of movie nights and community public places, but they are also rooms in which people dress and adjust their underwear.
Relationship: Do not even think about going to college and having a relationship
Introverts will just come to college.
Your room should be a shelter, however, a lot of railways turn into a non-miral walking culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifely friendship.
It may be hell for someone who needs to charge.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so that I can get back to the energy I needed to talk to you."
Try to know when a classmate is tired of socialization - and maybe write him a knocking place.
When we're talking about knocking, knock.
One boy in my tracks used to know that if the doors weren't locked, he was invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends thanks to the baking.
Because you started to go to the university at the top of a baking maniac, knocking on a foreign door, and showing with a sack of baked cookies seems less strange than "Welcome in the neighbourhood, I baked you something, now smile while I'm asking personal questions."
Proposing homemade is a good way to find friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and perhaps it will end up by making your face a tasteful surprise.
Of course, that's the subject that you're a decent baker.
Wrongly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and thirst will probably stop others pretending to be sleeping if you try to knock at their door.
Food stealing is a common crime in college.
The robbery of the whole chicken is of course a crime, but is a drop of milk in your tea stealing?
Check it twice with the milk owner.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're angry inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more adult than my roommate who exchanged her milk for a washing meat to punish the thief.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't make sounds that disturb people from sleep or study.
It's not just being a decent human being, but you're also a reputation in glass houses.
The girl from my hall asked her neighbors if they could keep the drum and bass a little quiet, because they were three at night and in the morning she had a letter.
Their answer was the strengthening of music.
When they finally silenced at 5:00 a.m., she left them sleeping at two hours and then released her own music loudly, locked the door and left her three-hour letter.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future house went on the same line as you?
And on the contrary, wouldn't it be awfully embarrassing if you were mistaken your roommates for your future house, slept together, broke up and had to see each other every day, and maybe she would also take control of your common friends?
Of course, you don't recommend your heart - but if your sexy roommate is not your future house, try at least a little to talk to your weaknesses.
At the excellent moment you realize that someone left the keys in his unlocked room, there is only a thin border between funny and screwed.
Good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Learn them a valuable and fun lesson about their safety by hiding something to them - never ruin anyone's toothpaste and champonging room.
Lock the doors and give them the keys to the bottle with water, which you then put in the freezer - but never stick their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins, even though the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva has experienced a violent time since she was pregnant with the seven - year wink today.
His daddy broke up with her and she was alone to prepare and raise her.
I was very excited to see a child and looked for a positive situation.
Not sure, and being alone with the baby, I tried not to bother.
And I certainly had hope that we will not be alone for long, remembering Eve today her first pregnancy.
She met on the Internet in the older Vask chat that they started talking about the favorite movies.
Your Eva and Vietk even brought home from the family, but he didn't play too much into his own dad's role.
"He took off the program for a while," Eva described in the fourth series in that 3.
The third line of the Czech TV series is just looking for happiness for another attempt.
The care of Vitka and the family's financial security was handled by working on partial jobs and great helping her mother and her aunt’s help.
Even the prospects of responsibility for a foreign child finally did not distort Eve’s affection.
They definitely put together around Vitek's other birthdays, and he now understands Vaska as his dad and also calls him that way.
Even though your father has two adult daughters, his fatherhood is enjoying his words in sixty, and he is also more devoted to children.
In addition to the Vietnam, a two - year - old Leontine came to them and eventually a twin.
"Your swimming into our family is somehow natural, even if my mother never talked much about my relationship," she thinks, "Eva.
Not enough room?
At least we're close.
The twins of Emma and Ella were born by an emperor’s cut after Eva was diagnosed by a pregnancy cholestasis.
This is the disorders of the production and activity of jull acids, which then occur in excessive quantities of pregnancies in the blood, especially by snowing.
The illness is dangerous for unborn fetus threatened by pre-born birth and death, mostly inflicted with mother after birth.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Evin and Washington, even though they were only in 36 weeks.
The emotion was placed in an incubator at the intermediate department where Váskova's nephew worked, which was able to take over and accommodate.
Elinka was larger and immediately after I moved from JIP to room, I had her with me, describes the difficult period after Eva was born.
She spent twenty days at her home until the doctors allowed the release of babies that had been able to reach the limits of two kilos.
Waiting for children to be gathered at Eve’s family, it did not make joy.
"I was a mad spot for my husband and children," she remembers a four-fold mother at the six-week section.
She also considered the signing of the reversal with her husband, including because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
In the end, however, the doctors failed and released Eva and the twins to homecare.
Stories of four pregnancy and births sends CT1 on Tuesday night at 9:45 p.m.
Totally a number of families can be humbled.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to suffice with the electrical double and collapsed conditions.
The house did not increase, but Vask made Eve happy to mount a gas cook so that the preparation of food for six people was more comfortable.
If it's the worst, we'll get a cab.
Eva is convinced that children are particularly a family comfort and a pleasant atmosphere, not a size or ominousness of the house.
For now, we've been folding too well, better than we expected.
Although the mess hides worse in a small space and we sometimes cross the baby, at least we're all close, smiling Eva, who can find a positive page on every situation.
The Vásk's work of the lighter in the movie is not a guarantee of regular income.
That's why they sometimes go to the Prague streets as a taxizer.
In his sixty years, according to his words, he can physically handle the finances of the family and children, how long will it be?
"I realize that, given our age difference, I will once be the one who will feed this family," Eva admits to the level of questioning the future.
She would like to go back to work, but she is more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four children, I'm not just for a employer.
And if it's the worst, my husband and I can do a cab, kidding a sympathetic blonde.
Apple got a jo-jo effect.
The screens can be done for everything.
The more executive processor, camera with greater resolution, harder chases or displays that recognise the strength of touch, are shortly the advantages of the recent iPhones of the ninth generation.
The last two then also have a negative impact on the sizes and mass of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
The real trend of Apple was that every new generation of iPhone is easier than the previous.
The exception was only the third and fourth generations whose weight was slightly increased against the previous iPhones.
The two-gram difference in the failure of the news was really negligible.
This, however, does not apply far from the new iPhones.
In addition to the last year iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight has increased in a smaller model by 14 grams, with a larger 20 grams.
On one side, it can't be surprised, the last year's affirmation in Apple's pockets has suffered significantly.
The chassis of the news is so of a resistant aluminium clay 7000, which has also been produced on weight.
But it's much more affected by the displays.
The Apple used 3D Touch technology for the news, which helps displays identify the strength of touch.
The display needed to set up another layer of capacity sensors.
The mass of the new iPhone displays has grown more than twice against previous generations.
In a smaller iPhone of originally 12 grams per 29 grams, in case of larger from 19 to 40 grams.
The iPhone 6s display is the hardest used component.
The mass of only 143 grams is then achieved in this news, even by the core of the core that touched most of the remaining components.
In the larger model, it is then the hardest used element of the battery, but its weight was not changed against the precedent.
Even in this case, the biggest growth is seen at the screen.
Weight 5,5" iPhone 6s Plus reaches 192 grams.
As long as the new display technology will be practical, it will be shown until it is used.
The first users will be able to test it on Friday 25 September when sales 6s and 6s Plus will be started in the chosen countries.
Are they breakfast champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, the archaeologists have managed to find an exciting opportunity.
They found traces of accommodation by a modern man from different times, including wall paintings, remnants of tools, and so on, and so on.
In a layer of 23A, which, according to tools dated until about 30,000 years ago, scientists discovered, but something very resemblance to the rest of the breakfast buffet.
Because there were traces of owing grain that appeared to have passed through the process of production of so popular sheets today.
The grain is wet today, then dry, remove the package, the so-called plug, then spray and dissolve the surface.
In the cave of Paglicci, the grain appeared to be warm or sprayed, and then apparently smashed between two million stones - at least indicated the traces of the use of two stones in the cave.
Accordingly, the scientists did not show in their publication for the PNAS magazine that a complete process of the production of sheets would be conducted in the cave, but the similarity is really very impressive.
We don't have any evidence of how people can eat, but the presumption that it was with some liquid and a lot of heat, of course, is logical.
At the same time, this is a very interesting evidence of how people intensely use the vegetables long before the agricultural development.
For if the fibre interpretation is correct, the oldest sheets have been agricultural for about twenty thousand years.
New report of stations in the Transport Unit of the City of Brna.
So I again listened to the names of the stop in the trolejbus: Ugly, Ghost, Frazova, Spratska.
Of course, the trolejbus was a little more noisy, so the reporting by a male voice was a little less understandable than before when the stops were reported by a woman's voice.
Women's voice is higher, so deeper traffic noise is better recognizable than a deeper male voice.
Although the DPMB arguments that this voter has chosen passengers themselves - I don't know who, no one asked me, but they certainly picked it from the studio recordings taken in absolute silence, which, of course, sounded quite different from the bus engine.
I've been living in Brna for a few nice decades, so the correct names of all these stops I know remember, so I don't need this report, but the strangers who don't recognise themselves in Brna, and for which these reports are primarily designed, can be confused and can be confused to the final where they accidentally went, then claim that the stop that they were to come to was not reported at all.
Perhaps the choice of the voter - but better the voters - to do again, and this time it is colored by normal traffic noise and a motor rachot in which the reproductor's reproduction in the bus is almost lost.
In order that we do not have to continue listening to the names of the water Herspitz stations, Smirova, or then the Ponorna in the scratching scratch that I went into in Komarov.
I suppose my old hearing didn't get so much worse during the only day that the voter changed.
That day ago, I understood that report pretty well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the tray records.
Today, few already know what the biggest and smartest governments of the party were so-called complex checks.
I've been allowed to remember that.
The bus was late.
I hit the dispatch office the moment the radio sounded like it's just seven hours.
"You're lucky that you didn't struck with a companion chief, came a minute before you, and it seems he's not really in the mood," the dispatchman noted, while I logged into the arrival book.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Write to me that I'm going through the district on a tiny mechanical audit.
It's not gonna work. Today's checks.
Everybody's fucked up like a horror.
What's the matter?
"You'll see," the dispatchman said.
You'll be next time too.
I ran into the hallway.
The door of the chief was opened and the chief appeared.
I'm stuck, with a stone face, in the perfectly falling same crown.
"Good morning, Chief," I greeted respectfully and quickly turned two buttons on the same jacket.
"Good morning," said the answer, and I rapidly ran to the second floor, without realizing the cold, cruel tone that the old man answered.
"You're playing," Eva's engineer, the old lady I appreciated very much.
They said she was even the chief before her companions had put her down.
There's checks, and you'll come like that.
How many times I asked what the complex checks are, but no one wants to talk about it.
He says they're staying once for three years, all of them have to go to them, and it's pretty uncomfortable.
At least for some.
I'll see.
I pulled a fascicle with periodic reports and then a phone.
"Here Holcman, come to me right now," the chief voice called.
What's it bothering?
Now we met and nothing," I wandered, but no one answered me, everyone with their thoughts.
"Good afternoon, Comrade Chief, I came to your order," I said, I barely entered the chief's office.
The chief was sitting at the writing table and looking at some leaster.
"Comrade mechanic," he said after a moment, without lifting his head, and he was still carefully looking at the leaster, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw a leaster on the table, restrained himself in his chair and looked at me with a common, unpleasant, bad, pickhead view.
I'm sure.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy commended myself that I worked very well in these months and that he was very happy with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the district.
And now this?
You realize you're a technique of track distance and you have to behave.
Such a greeting you used this morning is just unacceptable.
I felt that I used this kind of greetings since I was a child that I was raised so much and that I didn't see anything wrong with him.
It was like a red coat for the chief.
"You're on the socialist railway and the only acceptable greeting is the honour of work," bowled the chief.
In addition, you're still embarrassing the chiefs.
Once you say "master" and the second one again, "mother."
But I'm not a Mr. Chief for you, but a colleague chief.
The towns are companions, the top tractors are companions of the top tractors!
Remember that kindly!
Excuse me, sir... Comrade chief, but... I greeted you with a regular civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and the honor of work, or a companion... you know... I'm not part of...
"It's not your advantage that you're not on the side," the chief said coldly, who, in the meantime, calmed himself a little.
Well, that's what we're talking about.
Anyway, remember, you don't have the chair up there paid for retirement.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his advantage, it didn't look good with the person concerned.
He stabbed me in a cold, pixel view for a while, and I was looking for words that I would answer.
I was also embarrassed by his excellent ticking.
He was just a few years older and played a lord, actually a colleague.
A giant, twisted, authoritary, as arrogant as he needed it right now.
He was all bumped out.
He's the chief.
In fact, not everyone, the Chairman of the Party's organization as all the strangers, but even the non-party, he was touching him.
But the chief was touching many, especially those who could use his superiority.
He just kicked me out for the whole shit right now.
I thought about the ass, and it cost me enough to hit him in the face.
But I wouldn't even go back to the potato pump, but I would continue to do a rough official.
What would I use for two kids?
And that's what the house is set up!
I was crying, but I controlled myself.
I won't make it to him.
"That's all, you can go," finished the audience chief and started looking carefully again that he had before in his hand.
I was called at the 12th.
Everyone in the office has already been there and on questions what and how, they answered that it would be good.
Only Jojin tastefully said how his custom was that they could not throw us all out, because the companion of the chief would have to do this work with his faithful ones himself, not threatening us.
The word "mate" emphasized, as if he knew what the old man used me for in the morning.
There was a nice meeting in the headquarters.
Comrade chief at his writing table and on a long council table, another colleagues who were to decide on my official being or not.
Cadrirovak, President of the ROH, writer of staff, a special reference, something in the way of looking at the military, and the Deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the Chairman of the Party Organization.
I knew him from the scratch.
The ordinary trail worker, beating the thresholds or the vile throwing a scar.
But also a former guardian.
There was a hearing that there was no fun with him that time, they said a nice beast.
Bad languages claimed that he went out in the seventh grade, he had nothing to learn.
And when they canceled the crime, he ended up at the potato.
But, mate, yes, the cousin was cooked!
The chief told me to sit down.
I had a little baby in my throat, an unswallowed slipper.
Cadrovák read the assessment from the Civil Committee from the place of residence.
I'm from a working family, I'm married, two children, and so on.
It's good for now, I thought, and I've been breathing a little better.
Then an assessment from the street organisation of the party.
He copied a civil committee's assessment, maybe the same person wrote them both.
But then it came!
The parents of the long-term members of the Party refused to deliver before the verification Commission and subsequently withdrawn, reportedly for health reasons.
The chief looked closely at me.
He noticed it and stopped reading.
The chief told me to continue.
It was just worse.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee and I was obtained as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who came out, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and a wedding except for the national committee, I also had a church.
I disappointed the trust of the party in the worst way.
That's why I was excluded from a number of her candidates.
But that's not enough!
I let both children be baptized, and even my mother, when she died, I fixed the church funeral, even though it was a former member of the party.
This shows a negative attitude to the leadership of the party.
When the carrier read, only the chief's knocking of a pencil to the table interrupted the tight silence.
Everybody looked at me, and I wished I could be a long way away.
And I kept saying, "Communist - overhuman, Communist - overhuman." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay with coppers?
I could've fixed the leaks without a fucking check.
But now?
She took her career of a drunk official before she started.
Return to the headquarters?
I don't think that's gonna work. I'm sure the chief's gonna leave me for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you check the colleague here?" interrupted the tense silent chief with the question of the barrel.
Well, according to the precedent of previous employment.
Do you have him here?
Apparently, the cadrowak hadn't been over twice.
On the scratch of the sweat, he was nervously screaming like he was checked himself.
He sneakyly sneezed and gave some paper to the chief.
"Well," said the chief with a sign of violentity, which was often a prediction of the storm.
At first sight, praise, taught with a celebration, studied an industrial workshop, worked as a locker, a standard of 100 percent.
But it's a significant lack.
Where did you get that judgment, comrade?" he turned back to a cluster who felt like it was starting to turn against him and that he might not have to be a cadder soon.
This is where my cousin gave it to me when he came in.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came to us, he went to the district to the county," he bleededed.
And there's no verification, the one was somehow extra, so I put it in his file.
"So when you were involved in the technical function, this car paper was enough for you," stated the chief.
The carriage was nervous, and he had no answer.
"No problem, we'll discuss it later," the chief closed the matter, and the cadrow apparently reliefed.
For now, it's steady.
"So what about you, companion?" the chief turned to me again.
It's all over!
I've been dark in my eyes. I'm getting hot.
It followed the embarrassment and accusations, and I knew that I was the most resistant creature in the world that didn't deserve the least mercy.
That by emphasizing the incomplete judgment, I mistaken the colleague of the cadrical referencer, and I didn't understand why the assessment was incomplete when I received it from a cadric in the factory.
I am also an antisocialist living, which supports the rays of religious darkness during building real socialism, even attending them.
That, that, there was a lot of things I've done, or maybe I'm still doing, and I prayed quietly to end it.
I don't care.
I didn't care if I flew from the mechanic's place.
I didn't care they'd take my potato.
It's work for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people I was in the eyes of the companion of the chief.
"So that would be enough, Comrade chief," the chairman of the party said suddenly and substantially interrupted the chief of Levity.
This is where a cousin made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake he did, right stupidity!
But he's already got his punishment!
Don't forget that, Comrade chief!
What can be worse for a young man than we close the door to his side for time!
In order to reopen it, he will have to prove that he has changed that he is worthy of our trust again.
The unscientific guard spoke as a book.
Where did it come from?
Is it so numerous or pope frazes from party training and meetings?
That's why this young colleague must also get a chance from us!
The chance to prove that he's changed.
And who should give it to him if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young man, the truth, somewhat wrong companion, in his efforts to repair!
It's your party duty that no one can save you!
In fact, it's a party duty to all of us.
There's a cousin here who must see that the side didn't forget him.
That as a kind mother, she punishes not only, but also loves.
When the president's finished, no one even looked at it.
No one was expecting that situation.
At least me.
"I fully agree with you, Comrade President," the chief led the ice to try to re-establish the initiative.
If you let me talk to you, you'd hear that's the way I'd come to.
Everyone sneezed with their heads, but it was evident that he had no faith in a word.
"So I was confirmed for the function of a separate referencer to the care of basic funds," I screamed back to the office and cried again.
Well, besides Eva's engineering engineer, they were all at lunch.
The silences listened to my unrelated treatment of fresh experiences, and I relaxed in the meantime.
When I finished, she asked if I could get some coffee.
Without waiting for the answer, she built water on the cook and made the cans.
Meanwhile, she was talking about cadravical practices.
As one judgment, often full of praise, they give a man in their hand, and the other one in which there is dirty, sends to a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was, but on the potato, so the colleagues from the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our carriage?
It's just an old place where he'd eat or drink, so it finally ended up as it went.
"He'll catch it from the old," she noted viciously.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Take care of him anyway, he's pretty revengeful.
And the party president?
In fact, he's a much worse chief, no human.
Zero from a potato with great power.
The water for coffee began to shine, and the office was filled with the smell of just poured coffee.
I put a cup of sugar in the cupcake, and he mixed the hot pig.
I hope I'm from the worst outside.
Now I'm not fired, and the other checks are up to three years.
Anyway, my colleague chief won't forget that day.
It was published in the antology of LETERATES FOR ARTICLE II in the EPIKA manufacturer
The alien symbol was resurrected.
The wind wheel over Chlum again turns after years.
It is visible from far because it is located at 15 meters high.
People in the wide area call him "the wind on the Chlum."
For the community, 150 people have even become one of the elements of the general sign that the community has gained to the event of the 2010 tribute.
"We asked for a sign at that time, and we, of course, wanted to have the wind on the sign, everyone knows it in the area," stated Mayor Jiri Mašek.
The chlum wind pump is a local technical memorial.
It is as little as a memorial of the present: it reminds the time when people here fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was rare.
Until in 1910, the folks representatives decided to make solutions, which were then satisfied until half the 1980s.
In the municipality near the Chichov branch, they left seven meters deep down the well.
Three years later, the well was completed with a metal structure with a wind pump that was drawing water into the tank at the highest point of the community, near the church.
"The building was carried out by Antonin Kunc from the Boric on Morava with a cargo of 2.400 crowns," states the memorial inscription on the ground restraint of the building of the barracks.
In 1971, after several repairs and wind circle falls, the cream was served.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the fight for water began to be written: that day in Chleb began to serve a new waterwater.
The wind pump remains only a non-functional common symbol and this rarito.
The dominant was carried out at the year's family meeting.
Until in 2008, the Chlums decided to repair the wind bike again and to move again.
They let them make a replica of the original circle, a mid-four-four-four-four-foot-second wheel.
The bicycle was placed on the bar, but the same year it had to be brought down.
Because the replica manufacturer did not choose a suitable material and the wheel was unable to resist the wind strikes.
Then the hair dominant rested under the roof for several years.
However, since June, the bicycle on the high stake is recycled.
At the occasion of a meeting, the community left a replica of the wheel and placed it again on the top of the iron tower.
But the circle draws useful water from the well only to a ravaged blind shoulder.
And in the summer, we completely disconnected him because there was little water in the well.
At least it was in vain.
"Then on the autumn, the wind wheels from the pump in the basket, we will unconnect again," explained Mayor Mashek.
Hlew is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where the wind wheel came into the general sign, but the only one of these species is all around the Height.
Similar elements in the mark are honored by local technical memories, for example, in Chwalkovic and Green Mountain in Wyskovska, Kuželovska in Hodoninska, Partutovice in Revrov, or in the Policia in Stevina.
Nothing wrong, but I don't know Lafata, she confessed Tripolis Goian.
"I remember the fight against Slavia very well, even my goal, like everyone in my career," 34-year-old Goian laughed at the pre-gas press conference.
That's when Georghe Hagi trained us, it was a bad luck we lost.
I hope I'll get a goal now, Sparta.
Just with the difference that we won't lose this time," Goian continued.
This man who took 60 fights for Romania's representation is the key backup of the Greek team.
He's going to face the attacks of the Spartan offense.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, speaking of the Greek fight, Spartan Hybsh.
And partly knows what can wait for him on Thursday night.
I know fataie who played in Romanian Astra with my brother Lucian.
At that time, I saw all their fights.
I know he's a very good attacker, so he went to Sparta, said Goian.
He didn't name another footballist of the Prague Club, so the direct question was whether he knew David Lafata, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and Captain Sparta.
Goian smiled, and with a slightly clear view, he pointed to the Czech journalist.
The faceless expression meant, "Why are you asking me?"
After a moment, he left silent.
We saw some videos, and I noticed that Sparta played a lot of team.
He's got really good players.
What about Lafata?
Nothing wrong, but I don't know anyone else but Fataie.
Spartans know very well about Goian.
"He has experience from larger clubs, it can be said that he's keeping the defense of Asteras, he's such an organizer of the game," Spartian assistant Stanislav Haykal noted.
Goian has had the best years behind him, but he can be praised by a very interesting football biography.
At its time, Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchesters of United and City, but went to the Italian Palerm, played for Glasgow Rangers.
We're waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, says coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly plays European cups, swims about winning in the Czech League.
It's a favorite for me in this game, but we're playing at home and we want the group to start with a good result.
Like Sparta, we'll try to win, he said Goian.
I'm in a room with a Slovak branner Tomasz Kosic, who is very happy to meet the competition from Czech Republic.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say we'll fight hard.
Kofola moves from Poland to Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Bureau.
The new place should have Kofol in Ostrava.
The S.A. Kofola was registered in Poland for trade in stocks of the company at the Warsaw Bureau.
Our primary goal is to have a seat of a group in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken for now under the project are mainly legal and administrative and have no real impact on the events in society, says Daniel Burish, the financial director of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the movement of the group, shareholders consider the location of stocks at the Prague Bureau."
In order to enter the Burza of Pricing Papers Prague, the company concludes a prospect of a valuable paper that will submit the Czech National Bank to approve at the nearest time.
The movement of holding seats and related transfers of shares will be carried out in a form of non-public transaction that only existing shareholders will participate in it.
Therefore, no shares will be offered within this operation to register the public or to new investors.
"The offer of shares to new investors would be made - if so the company and its shareholders decide - later, either on 4th quarter of 2015 or on 1 quarter 2016," said the company.
The company has already stated in the past that the possible stock offer could be composed of the emissions of new shares or sales of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of stock stocks in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the location of stocks even at the Warsaw Bureau.
The Czech Television Objectivity Test for information on the migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of the reporting of the main Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time, the main reporting session of the Czech Television.
How did she survive?
When journalistics learn how media can manipulate reality at the University, they can launch today's Czech TV event.
The migrant crisis was devoted to about 80% of the reporting.
Until the first minute when the CT informed about the disturbances on the Serbian and Hungarian border and the attacks of migrants against policemen, it called eufemistically their patience - they threw stones and attacked metal sticks), the promigrant propaganda has already arrived - judge the names of individual reports.
Criticism of non-governmental organizations - a large space for non-profit organisations which criticize bad treatment with migrants.
Syrian children in Czech School - story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
The fugitives are not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
The travel of refugees - CT consistently uses the expressions of runners or fugitives, not migrants.
It is incredible, mostly, that CT uses in illustrative images consistently only and only videos for young children and women.
She said in the same broadcast that 80% of the men detained in Czech have been detained from migrants.
Summary: Most of the propaganda that has no periods from communist agits.
I have to say, like a former journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I used to get into a panel apartment, I soon stopped being the only inhabitant.
My fishes moved to the toilet.
Fishing home, insects with imperfect transformation, i.e. unproducing the regeneration from a bowl and a young man looks like an adult, just a tiny and gradually growing.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't lazy to lose them.
First manually and later chemically.
Socialist drugs on their elimination provided some blue crystals.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
But they were successfully eliminated.
Later, I was dealing with the Pharaohs like that.
A box with some juvenalizer that the ants brought into their nest and then he did not allow the Queen to generate a new offspring.
But I turned it off.
As the time went, the insect became the subject of my admiration, and I was increasingly attached to the opinion that they had the same right to life as our people.
In addition, I had experience that encountering into the ecosystem does not lead to success, and one can replace another.
I don't think I'd be able to get the truth with the bleaches and pumps to make the karma worse by killing them.
In a new place, we agreed with my partner that if the fishes don't climb behind our neck, let them eat the waste skin, some of those invisible bars, and so on.
Their peaceful existence has violated the spider after time.
It was an ordinary type of cotton who lived on the ceiling for a long time.
We thought he was living from occasional muss and mosquitoes, which just raised our comfort.
Because he's been with us for a few years, we found that he's been eating mainly fish and that he apparently maintained their numbers in the abduction.
Confidential regular contact with every necessary we found that she is a female.
Because we were witnesses of romantic instructions with a partner about a third of the smaller, how he carefully wraps on the spider fibres so that he would not be eaten before he reaches the exhausted copulation.
It took about three days when they kept moving and responded to our controls.
Under the toilet, where the love players played, we later found the remains of a dried female.
Then the spider didn't move for a long week.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of little spiders hanging a variety in her neighborhood.
They're gone soon.
They've been eaten by mom, and they've been screwed out in another way.
Even a female disappeared after a week.
If she's gone elsewhere or she's gone to sleep, we don't know, but after a month, two, she showed up on the ceiling again.
Truth, something smaller, probably the daughter of that toilet.
For a time from the ceiling she carefully observed our behaviour, and by moving under the toilet mine, she evaluated our failure as friendship.
The number of multiplied fisheries has been reduced again, and the spider was still looking for its common activities to ensure food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed all year.
Our daughter has grown up to the age that the use of the nightmare has already been shameful.
We've been tolerating it so far, but the eternal pouring of his contents has already been aware of us.
We encouraged her to use the toilet.
However, the daughter found an excuse in the spider that she saw very well when she was wiping.
Our talk about seeing a spider, the luck in the house never took.
I'm crying and screaming her nightmare.
It wasn't the rest of them.
There was a moment when a spider had to make a recommendation in the interest of the daughter's development movement.
It's all over me.
He was grabbed into the glass and embarrassed over the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I divorced him as a friend, but after so long collaboration, I felt disgusting as if I dismissed my relative.
We assumed that the fishes would begin to appear more frequently and become multiplied by a geometric series.
We've been wondering, week, two, none of us showed up there.
I started speculating about the cause.
I was wondering if the spider had somehow raised them by the pattern of ants, that the toilet environment was not as favourable for their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they've gone back.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found that their collapse to a spider must have had the reason that if he didn't see him, he was hiding in some other place and threatening them anywhere.
Or maybe they had some telepathic connections with their predator and his quick disappearance caused some alarming reaction in them.
I'm not making any illusions about their eyes.
They showed some light of shyness, but that they would react to whispering hands or fast movements, they did not.
The daughter's going to the bathroom regularly.
I think she forgot about the nightmare.
All you have to do is attract a spider again.
I'm already sending my wishes to the eter and I hope they didn't close on me after that execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use the Cyclone B.
Ten words of Albert Einstein, who enriched the world.
The statements of a genius scientist of the past century appear to never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to dive into everything so deep that the fertility was always an impressive finding.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all times.
In the consciousness of humans, he entered his special and general theory of relativeity, which has yet best described the universe in its giant relationship.
It is also not possible to mention its explanation of the photo effect or the idea of quantifying the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the self-decryption and the system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativeity is so confused for many, that it prefers easy examples for a closer meeting.
But it's not easy.
Of course, it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he didn't even find a brilliantly simplified form of explanation: The watch near your loved one seemed a minute; the minute in the hot baking seems to be an hour - and that's a relativeity.
I've afforded from his entire pleyade of famous quotes to choose those ten who literally caught me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, genius trying not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
Space and human nonsense.
I'm not so sure about that first one.
No number of attempts can never prove I was right.
But the only one ever can prove I was wrong.
But it's a sad time when it's easier to break atom than to destroy prejudices.
If the mess on the table is reflecting a mess in mind, what then reflects the empty table?
I don't know what he's going to fight in the third world war, but in that fourth, they'll be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect him.
Knowing is a little dangerous and knowing a lot too.
If I had an hour to deal with the problem that would depend on my life, I would spend 40 minutes with his study, 15 minutes with his analysis and 5 minutes of solution.
The hardest thing in the world to understand taxes from income.
Finally, I cannot forgive not to introduce Einstein's formula on the definition of success: Take-li A for success, the sample applies: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest and Z is to keep the tongue behind teeth.
New and modern.
Patients in Zlinsk County are waiting for a change in $1.5 billion.
"It is a success, considering that all four are kept in black numbers this year," hetman Stanislav Mišak satisfiedly stated.
The total profit of the district devices is about 32 million crowns at this point.
The share of this is primarily higher than insurance, which is equally favourable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In the Circumstance, the Scientific, the Ugher County, and Zlina, they are declined to buildings that will cost nearly 1,5 billion crowns together.
The long time we've been shopping most of the devices, it's over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them, high health can't be done, he justified the plans of the district deputy for the health of Lubomir Neweather.
They're looking forward to changes in all hospitals.
Builders are coming to hospitals next year.
In the temple, they are now choosing suppliers of a new internal pavilion for nearly 300 million crowns.
They've got a planned dialysis port in the Creamers.
The Ugher Cities wish to attach a new interior for approximately 200 million for this year.
And a long-term construction of a new central income and an intern that takes three quarters of billion.
In all cases, it is important and often the biggest changes in the past years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors, this is an extremely important step," for example, director Vera Prousková stated to build the Swamp Internal.
Fifth floor building there should be completed in about two years and offers comfortable equipment for the intern and neurology, dialysis, new ambulance, bed and intensive care unit.
More comfort for patients.
Changes that are significantly recognized by patients will affect all regions.
The new buildings are replaced by those who, for example, lie in many sick rooms, have only one toilet on the floor, beds are unlocated, windows are unnecessary, and health careers do not have adequate conditions for work.
"For example, our interior was built 50 years ago, and now it is at the border of its life," stated the Director of the Zle Hospital, Paul Calabek.
In a few years, it will be replaced by a seven - floor modern building connected with an emergency income.
The doctors and patients will have all acute departments in one place, in addition in new spaces.
The same model already has half the Uher district.
The central income is already standing and the intern will be at it in three years.
"We will pay the building from the loan and partially from our own funds," explained Director Peter Sladek.
This hospital is the one in the area who can afford its own funding.
The profit is still the highest, and it has not been lost two years ago, when the Zlyn hospital may have struggled with almost two hundred million losses.
"We have good insurance contracts, excellent performance, we increase revenues and effectively manage expenses throughout the hospital," said Vlastimil Vajdak, who is responsible for the economy.
Improvements are also expected by patients of exclusive hospitals.
In ten to fifteen years, he's going to repair, new devices and restructuring up to half a billion crowns.
This year will be a complete repair of the captured station, then a dialysis port starts, if possible, building a building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one explained how I should keep accepted refugees in the country when they don't want to live in Czech Republic.
The Minister of Interior Milan Chovanec (CSSD) complains after negotiations with his European colleagues that the other countries of Czech Republic are pushing the quotas for the reseparation of refugees, but they refuse any discussion.
It also suggests that no one has yet explained to him how he should keep assigned refugees in Czech Republic if they don't want to live with us anyway.
"We didn't get the answer, and therefore we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," the Hovanus told the journalists.
Can you more specifically describe the position you have come to at the interior and foreign ministerial meetings of the European Union?
We disagree with obligatory quotas as a system that just can't work.
We can't talk about migrants as salt bags or flours.
They're alive creatures who have visions, they're going somewhere, they're relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we are able to maintain migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were redeployed.
We can't imagine it.
We did not get the answer, so we wanted quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration sites, border protection, camps outside Europe, a trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with this.
We've been talking about it for a year and we're saying this is the way.
But say the quotas will solve everything?
We've been dealing with 40,000 recently, now it's 10,000.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
How do we keep these people in the territory?
Devety-eight percent of all people who cross us want to go to Germany.
We don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamci and others who take the Czech Republic as a target country are ambitious to visit us, but the interest of people from this migration wave, that is from Syria and other countries, is limited to zero.
You mentioned that the fugitives didn't even want to come to us, but 1500 people were already committed to accepting us.
Wouldn't it be possible to take them this way more?
We have committed to accepting 1500 people, but with the condition.
We said functional hotspots, border protection, military operation.
Even in those 1500, there will be 1100 people to deal with the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detention facilities and we'll treat them like those we've caught.
It is a big question, and we will debate with Europe if we can detain people registered in Italy and Greece, if possible, in Hungary.
Because Europe treats it so that if they have registration, they can't be detained.
That means they will come to our territory with registration, and if the agreement is not yet, it may happen that we will not hold those 1100 in the territory of the Czech Republic, and they will leave Germany again after they arrived.
If we can hold them during the asylum procedure, we will arrange a asylum procedure with them.
If these are Syrian citizens, Eritrea, almost 98 percent of the European statistics will gain international protection.
Then they get evidence that will allow them to travel across Europe.
And I think these people will end again in target countries.
Then there are four hundred people here to move.
This is the second project that is currently being underway, and there we have only progressed in debating with the churches about the possibility that they can help them acquire employment, accommodation and so on.
But it's a very long run.
You said that the ministers were not willing to discuss with us.
But isn't it that the Czech Republic just rejects quotas, but does it not offer any solidary step that would unlock the discussion?
And what exactly is it supposed to be a solidary step?
If the Polish Republic of Germany renounces the encouragement that all migrants from Syria can benefit from them, the report is spreading in order for hours after all camps in Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It offers another migration wave that is heading to Germany because they just don't want to come to us.
We think that the road is the protection of external borders -- just the migration waves to discontinue, help the needy, and separate economic migrants.
Clearly show them that they don't have a chance.
Only last year, 50 thousand Kosovoans arrived in Germany.
From safe Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this State, including police, courts, state representation.
If we were able to separate them and not accept them or accept them only by the needs of the economy, 50 percent of what social systems issued today could go to refugees.
In addition to the first day when Germany carried out controls, the number of detainees in Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's 80, the first day was twelve.
Where is it supposed to go, so the border controls can be stronger?
We were afraid of an invasion in the order of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we're dealing with.
We still have a few hundred free places in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we're detaining will be returned to Austria in seven days.
We're doing it standardly.
The suspects are the only people who take us, with Hungary, it's complicated, and the Greeks -- that's a totally useless story.
So where's the breakpoint?
Is it supposed to be a thousand a day?
I think it'll need a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three days after each other exhausting our capacity so much that the crisis plans will come up.
Then I am agreed with Mr. Prime Minister to call for an extraordinary government immediately.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in phone contact several times a day.
If this situation occurred, the government could sit down de facto immediately and one resolution would decide to strengthen the military police, let's give the customs administration, if possible, about the prison service.
The Country Option is an exceptional condition that Hungary has now declared in certain places?
I don't think it can come this far.
Notice that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, the Schengen border only and only in the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen to this happen in the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread alarms.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that the Hungarians will try to dismiss the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct journey to Austria.
The Czech Republic would affect this very borderly, almost at all.
Slavia paid a lot of debts for the last minute.
It's trying to prevent the decline.
Football Slavia paid debts.
The footballists also waited for their money.
Football Slavia stood first in Tuesday for insolvency proceedings before the court.
Almost three months after about 20 million crowns made a proposal for the company Online Services from Pacific Samoy.
Lawyer Slavia Zuzana Mladková tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzl over a few hours that the Slavia would not declare a destruction.
And you have to say, she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that the previous week, the new owner of Slavia, became a large Chinese industrial and investment group of CEFC, as well as the Czech billionaire of Jiří Shimana.
Apparently, money arrived from new owners to the club in the last minute.
This also proves that the statement of Slavia before Tuesday's trial -- the superior club on Monday, just a day before the trial, sent a dozen million crowns.
"Everything has been placed between September 11 and 15," said the legal representative of Slavia Mladk.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
For example, the Slovenian representative of Milan Ivan or the Czech carrier, Maria Ličkovi.
Slavia also paid a fee to Agent Alexander Losenick.
On Friday, the club paid the debt fees of the city part of Prague 10.
The part of the insolvency dispute remains de facto only the claims that Slavia disturbs.
Or, according to the club, the commitments have not been made at all, or the judicial disputes are being led.
However, we are ready to pay the amounts in the event of the loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds on the bank account, which we can report with an account," told Judge Mladková.
"All that has been paid has been retained," said Mladková and added that they are not only inappropriate or distorted obligations.
It is also that the judge will not decide in the coming days and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she really paid those debts.
Then there will be an assessment of all the evidence.
The decision can therefore be expected first in November.
The judge ordered the continuation of the negotiations on 3 November.
However, the decision is not in this meeting, but in writing after it.

The combination of high-quality, hardware and software equipment integrated into the modular structure brings benefits and rapid return to investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a module system, so the final composition is always configured according to customers' requirements.
Anything, from the swallowing of the steel to the swallowing of special slices, as from gross materials after the scraping of thin blades, from apps in workshops to after scratching in boats.
Unbelievable quantities of swarming curves, simplified setting and proliferation of the swimming source allows to respond quickly to the change of requirements, which leads to reducing the voltages, to the need for the transfer of the source and more productive scraping.
FastMig X allows the swimming processes developed by Kemppi, which provide higher productivity and quality of squirrel.
It stops wasting time and does not occur to waste materials or fixing the wrong quarrels.
The flexibility is secured, there are less flexibility, more squirrels and higher profits.
It's this year's news that had a Prime Minister in Nitra, where she also got a gold medal.
We appreciate these honors very much because they confirm the exceptionalness of the product.
World Producers can be administered by similar systems, but due to the differing in the software and the control of the parameters belongs to FastMig X to the world's peak.
Probably favourable for the stakeholders are the additional deadlines that move around three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we have already linked the first contacts that will definitely be expanded after the Burnean vegetation.
We've been in his regular participants for over 20 years and almost always our business results are better than before him, stressing the company ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, head of Kemppi's sales in Plzni.

Blanc was going to build so that she didn't fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says a firm expert who designed a tunnel.
Blanc was even more safe, says the expert.
The Tunel complex Blanka was able to build so that two ruins of the land in Prague Tree, said the Manufacturing Director of Satra, which is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovic.
He said it on Wednesday night at a press survey tunnel.
But he thinks it would be about half a billion more expensive.
The drivers will be opened on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel was going to smash safer, but costs are growing exponentially," said Butovic.
The conditions in the Tree were all the time the same, but the country fell just a few steps away from the place where it began to scatter a safer and more cautious method.
"If the measures were used 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive," said Butovic.
The Blanka Tunnel fell three times during the building.
Two times, in 2008, a shorter in Treewood was created, and in 2010 the soil was fallen by the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the Director of Metrostav Jiri Belohlava, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, said the Euro week.
The construction was based on the original intention of the 17 billion crowns.
When we figure out the VAT that was double-up during the construction, you have 11 billion out of 17 billion.
When technologies, purchases of lands and engineering activities, valorization and similar items are added, it is 29 billion, which is not from those 37 to that far, said Belohead.
Someone ordered it and paid it.
iOS 9: How to get a new iPhone operating system with new updates Apple

FedExu gains mixed, fiscal view reduction for 2016
The company FedEx announced unsatisfactory results in the last quarter and a huge reduction in the forecast of the annual profit due to a low demand for cargo transport and higher costs for the ground division.
The company also stated that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
In this period of last year, the company FedEx announced that it would rent for the holidays of 50,000 seasonal workers.
Company shares decreased by about 2,5 per cent in pre-market trade 45 minutes before the middle opening.
The company FedEx states that it expects a cost between $10.40 and $10.90 for a fiscal year, which ends next May, which means a drop of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
The analysts expected $10.84, according to the research carried out by FactSet.
The lower view comes despite the increase in interest rates in the average by 4,9 per cent, which will be shown in January. 4 and higher supplements for land transport of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company said that it still expects growth of profits against the previous year due to reducing costs, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
The chairman of the branch and Director-General Fred Smith said that the company "made a firm performance despite weakest than expected economic conditions, especially in the processing industry and global trade."
The holiday rental plans were announced a day after the rival company UPS stated that the plan was to hire 90 000 to 95 000 additional employees, which was probably as hired last year.
In August 31, the company FedEx won $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
The share profit was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 for action, which was predicted by 12 analytics asked by Zacks Investment Research.
The markets increased by 5 per cent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts asked by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, the company FedEx has been affected by a decline in the priority of international shipping, which caused the revenues in its Express Unit to be stagnated.
But the boom in online shopping strengthened the results of the FedEx land unit.
In the last quarter, land income increased by 29 per cent, but the operating profit was essentially the same because of higher prices for bigger packages and own insurance.
The expression unit recorded higher income due to higher basic rates, while the profit decreased in the commodity trade due to higher prices for workforce.
About an hour before the opening of the FedEx shares fell by $3.85 or by 2.5 per cent, by $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent under the 11th June record.
At its most expecting session in the years, the federal reserve legislators will spend two days this week at 27 feet of the long Hondura Mahagon table and decide whether it is time to increase the key interest rate after almost ten years.
With regard to them at one end of the central bank's ornament, the two- floor session room will be a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that President Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should give the economic interests of the nation above all.
The central bank has a double charge from the Congress: maximize American employment and maintain the prices stable.
But from the Great Recession, the representatives of the Federation have recognized that there is an unwritten third functional period: financial stability.
And this third functioning period could be an X-factor in too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to launch when derogating from the unprecedented stimulation in the form of almost zero short-term interest rates at the end of 2008.
Although the majority of data shows a solid growth in the economy, recent turbulences on the world financial markets could scare the Fed already carefully to add to continuity by increasing its reference rate of federal funds - even more than just a quarter of the percentage point.
"It is obvious that the market of work and inflation will be the most important thing to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, the main economy of the makler company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that they were just looking for an excuse to not raise the measure, the increased uncertainty of the surrounding global market already gives them sufficient reasons to wait further," she said.
There's no consensus on what Fed does, which is the cause of nervousness on the financial markets itself.
About half of the economies recently asked by Blomberg predicted an increase in the rate this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to delay, with a key indicator, only about 30% chance to increase.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed would increase its rates only if the politicians understood the failure by promised that the further increase is in no view.
During Tuesday, the industrial average of Dow Jones jumped by 228,89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The meeting was launched by expecting the Fed policy to delay rates this week in peace, says John Lonski, the main economy in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Feds now raised rates," he said.
If the Fed politicians did it, they'd have to go to extreme in their program declaration and keep the financial markets behind their hands to avoid panic.
Other experts argued that the increase in rates would calm the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty of how the Fed will proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on a good way to increase the rate by 0.25 per cent of this month, the first small step in slow currency impairment, which would confirm the power of economic recovery in the United States.
Yellen said that over the spring and early years, she expects an increase in the rates this year, despite the complaints of Liberals, that it needs more economic progress.
Although the creation of jobs in August slowed down, the labour market recorded a solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% in the previous month, which is lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level Fed considers full employment.
Remuneration showed signs of lifting.
And even though the inflation continues under 2% of the target of the central bank, the Fed policy claims that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "may be able to deal with higher rates and needs them, given the closestness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, the main economy of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world began to distort the end of the last month after China devalued its currency.
The industrial average of Dow Jones dropped up to 16% below its record value in May, when the investors were afraid that the slow Chinese economy would bring down global growth.
The market has somewhat reflected this month and Dow is losing only nearly 10% of the May maxim.
The disturbing situation on the market to the Fed's political factors gives a complex calculation when it calculates the increase in interest rate.
"With the absence of what happened on the financial markets and the reports of the weaknesses of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, there would be a collapse at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, head of the UCLA researcher Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official of the Fed.
He now predicts that they will wait at least a month to get better control of the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact that it will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data to rely on about the latest development in China," Oliner said.
The health status of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so technically it should not be included in their decisions.
But in fact, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The Central Bank's impact has been enormous in recent years.
Only the sign of the former President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "use" their monetary expansion on the market, has launched crushing around the world.
In the world where markets and economics are still more connected, it can be expected that the representatives of the Federation will monitor development elsewhere, but also advise other central bankers and experts to read better the state of the global economy.
Their decision process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for Envestnet Inc wealth management.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, V., noted this month that "Fed has history overwhelmed with movements on financial markets which seem unrelated to economic funds."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Market Policy Committee for Open Market, who pushed to increase the rates, quoted the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its reference rate by 0.75 per cent during the three sessions "If limited identification impacts on growth in the US," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed's representatives turned these crooks.
The Fed should prefer concerns about financial stability only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam Posen S., former member of the Evaluation Committee in the Bank of England.
The latest screaming doesn't even get closer to this level, he said.
"Certainly you don't want to be in the situation of fear of growth rates because the markets were upset," Posen, President of the International Economy Institute, said.
The Federal Reserve System Act has still two mandates and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they should get on the scope.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/sklad was opened in 1997 and owned by LAX-C Inc.
Frequently referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a large-trade Thai market which also sells for the public.
Yeah, it's Chinatown, not Thai.
The market/sklad is the only contact place that offers an impressive series of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian meals, and kitchen meals, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.

The business is massive and it'll take you over an hour before you get through all the streets.
If you are hungry from all this shopping, go to the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trade station (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various seals.

Parking: LAX-C has its own parking facilities that share with other shops and restaurants.
While the store can be busy, parking usually is not difficult to find.
The speed on the road stays at the old.
The acceleration of 150 km/h refused.
The highest allowed speed until 150 km/h will not be able to be increased in the selected highway sections.
On Tuesday, the Romania decided that when she approached the amendment proposal to the Senate, which refused to increase the speed.
The new law on earthly communications is now going to the president.
President Miloš Zeman said at the end of April that the law allowing a fifty-million-meter rate would vet.
Against the increase was also the Minister for Transport Dan CZK (for ANO), according to which the Czech road network has not yet been built at such speed.
On Tuesday before the messenger he supported the senator version of the law.
The authorized novel will now allow in accordance with the original government proposal to increase speed from 90 to 110 miles per hour on the first-class roads, in particular four streams.
The Chamber first extended this option to the roads where it could be driven in selected speeds up to 150 km/h, but the Senate rejected it.
The messengers now approached his proposal.
The Senators with the consent of the Minister for Transport from the novel also exposed the authorization of the transport police to have the last word to edit local communications that the community cares for.
The Senate version approved by the Romania also considers that sewers, waterways or public lighting cables can be stored long under the surface of the vehicles.
The municipalities would save for the buying of lands.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along the local roads, regardless of the owner of the property concerned.
Novela is also to help improve the protection of roads and facilitate the loading of distracted vehicles to which the owners are not reporting.
The new citizens may sell distracted vehicles for which, within a six-month period of notification of the withdrawal of their owners, shall not be reported.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit cargo transport across their territory after the roads of others and third classes under the threat of penalty for spade companies.
The new is also discontinued by the possibility of introducing electronic roadmarks instead of the original papers that will be used so after 1 January of the next year.
According to the government, it will save money for the establishment of an electronic system.
The restraint exhibitor is going before the court.
He's been in danger for his predicted welcome to the municipalities for 10 years.
The case applies to the allegedly predicted contribution project.
The police wanted to pursue in this case also the Member of Zuzana Kail (CSSD), but the messenger did not issue it.
According to the legal qualification of the case, both to ten years of imprisonment are threatened.
The main calculation is yet scheduled for two October days.
According to the State Deputy Mandík and Macik, they have caused damage to at least one million crowns, resulting from the lawsuit.
The applicant is based on an expert assessment.
The former members of the city's leadership, according to the prosecutor of the title, have incorrectly allowed their function to obtain the property benefit of the company which organised the welcomes of the citizens.
According to the charge of the Chief of the City Services, Education and Cultural Master, the Mandjak was charged to refer to five companies connected in the selection management.
When another company who offered the lowest price entered the competition, the board of competition cancelled.
The procurement was then to give the city to the administrator, and only the company Darothore, which was then assigned to the city's procurement Council.
The city paid at least a million extras.
Both charges led in order to ensure that Darothore awards a public contract for the conduct of a long-term welcome of the Citizens in Oste over Labe, and coordinatedly acted at least in contrast with the requirement for the treatment of the proper economy, state representative wrote.
At the same time, he believed they were aware that the Darothore company would subsequently, after obtaining this procurement, calculate the Aust of Labe for the implementation of the Citizens' action of the price, which would be unduely increased against the real value of the actual services delivered.
In three years, the company incased more than five million crowns under the project record.
The city eventually paid only one part, approximately 1.7 million crowns, then departed from the contract.
The amount paid was, according to the expert assessment, at least by a million crowns.
Mandik has refused any violation of the law before.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this constructed cause, the former prime minister said before that the city under his leadership was just connected to a similar project from the past years.
In 2008 to 2010, the event was provided by the agency Roxy II.
"It was under the same conditions, under the same money," Mandik added.
Criminalists also wanted to accuse the Ambassador Kail, who was also a member of the City Council.
But the messenger didn't bring her to the prosecution.
In her case, the criminals have dismissed the cause, but they count on Kail's accusation after the messenger's mandate ends.
The welcome of the citizens was a social action that took place several times a year.
The mothers received a gift check for 5,000 crowns to buy children’s needs and small gifts.
Hungarian cops reportedly let the dog's refugee.
Then they forced the journalists to delete the record.
Hungarian police said on the border with Serbia shortly detained the AP's cameraman and forced him to delete the record on which the police dog reportedly hit the country of the refugee.
But the Hungarian government questions this accusation.
The alleged incident occurred on Saturday night, when a cameraman of AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants, who across the cornfield near the Hungarian city of Röszke crossed the border with Serbia.
One of them had attacked a dog with a basketball basket on a sirian.
The dog of the man who screamed "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," he screwed up, claiming Muse.
The fact that Muzi was filming everything, he noticed one of the cops and didn't let him leave.
Then the journalist was not allowed to phone his superior or his colleagues in the place anymore.
Policemen took Muzi to a dark place at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he was recorded.
Then they ordered him to delete the record.
This is how the museum lost the result of two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He said he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP sent a protest letter to the speaker of the Hungarian government, Zoltan Kovacs.
The conduct of policemen in it was unacceptable and said that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not to be afraid that the government would destroy the legally obtained material.
The Kovacs with the appeal to the police report of the Muzi's deployment of events questioned.
He said the cops just wanted the journalist to show them if they were on some recordings, which they said they had the right to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to wipe.
"The dogs can knock -- they are trained to frighten and push some fear, but with certainty did not attack," Kovacs said.
Unpredictable Master League.
Victory of City will hit us, believes Juventus
"It's disappointment, I don't think we deserved to lose," manuel Pelegrini, the coach of the home city, shook his head.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was a classic game of the Master League.
No team has created a lot of opportunities, but the ball on the balls has been longer than us.
"The cause of defeat was not in a tactics, Juventus just shot two beautiful goals," he estimated the Pellegrin's struggle, whose team incased in competition after 636 minutes.
That finalist last season Juventus on this was exactly the opposite - after the first three wheels of the Italian League has the defender of the title only point and the score 2:4 is located until on the 16th place of the table.
And that's why the turning to the Etihad Stadium was a great surprise.
"This victory will help us mentally, it will hit us," believes Coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with three resistance losses before the new year - Pirla, Teveza and Vidala.
In Manchester, Pogba, Manjukic and Morata were represented.
"It's true, this victory is very important, it may make us go on a winning wave," hopes Morata.
Because when we're on it, we're separating among the best men in Europe.
In the second halftime, we were better, especially in the attack phase.
This is what my players deserve.
"We could have incassed us at 0:2, but Gianluigi has held us," Allegri's Coach of Golf Buffon commended.
"We've burned a few good chances," Yaya Touro, the booker City.
We have to marry from the League of Experience Masters and try for a better result next time.
Goodbye, Angelo, goodbye, old Germany II.
Before we continue with the question of immigrants, we should realize that all the media cracks around are controlled by professionals.
According to the needs of the media, as well as the peasant.
So let's stop for a second.
Today, the newspapers and the media are full of babies that carry their parents on their hands on dust trails of exode.
And it causes a person -- that is in a European person -- an automatic feeling of guilt and compassion.
Well, they don't just come here, desperate kids, notice on the recordings of landing boats to the Greek islands that the kid doesn't see them so much!
Well, somehow, we have disappeared from the television of ship images on the Lampedus, the fugitives from the French border at Menton, where thousands of young men are a beautiful promotion.
Many of the young black men.
And also the pictures of Callais disappeared, where these are eating, and the black men are waiting for them to go through a tunnel under La Manche.
I guess she doesn't get it anymore.
Even those pictures of the primitive Christian Church of Eritrea did not have a special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
Too much of it was fake.
So when it comes to the quotas for the fugitives, it's kind of secret that it's not just the unfortunate children of Syria, but also the stirred - for elders: fashioned - young men.
Their muscles look like they just got out of some fit center.
It's just one personal experience.
This summer, in Turkish - Muslim - parts of Cyprus, we lay on the private beach of the hotel.
Even though it was private, a large group of cars came to the beach suddenly.
But no chunks.
And the young blacks came out of them.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30.
They walked into the beach, all the clothes in the tags and shoes, in the hands, otherwise, smartphones.
That the private beach was not interested, and the employees -- Turks, the Muslims! - apparently feared them.
They've taken all the beds.
Whoever didn't lay on it and was just in the sea, was unfortunate.
They were dressed like an American rapper movie.
On the heads of a nail hat, white and colored adidas on your feet.
Then they placed a local beach bar and started raising.
They borrowed the tables around, sneaking up next to the seating and white guests of the bar - read the Muslims and the Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children were running out of the dining terrace somewhere calm.
The incoming niggas drinked a beer right from thirds - how in the US series?! - on the beach they threw empty bottles around them.
They kept screaming loudly on each other.
It wasn't English, of course.
Then they went into the drink of wine, also from the bottle.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in marked swimmings, especially those young ladies -, in the water they screamed and screamed, mothers with children and pensioners scaryly fled, and in half an hour he was no longer on the beach or in the pool no black guest.
Everybody's gone.
No matter whether it was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel employees were worried about them and talking about them.
The waiter said, "Have you seen the gold they were wearing?"
"Yes," I said.
"Well, they definitely didn't have it from work," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, they all had a massive gold chain around their necks.
And one had some 20 centimeters of gold cross on his throat.
And women were like gold.
"That's drug smugglers?" I asked.
"Well, you saw them drink," answered the waiter.
The drugs don't fix, they don't use.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I realized what they broke.
Of course, it wasn't so important to me in June 2105.
I had no idea what was going to happen.
But secret services and top politicians were supposed to know it first.
I don't think they know.
At that time, about 1,5 million immigrants went to Europe.
And they go and go and go.
Today, the main problem of the European Union is that totally political-correct policies, as if intellectual and economically related lobby and economically important groups have the greatest strength in Europe.
Germany and its politicians -- today publicly recognised major forces in Europe -- lie, lie and lie -- but not only they, but also the EU and TV summary, including ours.
For example, recent television pictures on the excited welcome of the fugitives in Germany are at the level of Moscow TV images of August 1968.
Of course, there were a few sunflowers in the station, but mostly the old Germans - the Muslims welcomed their privates.
Long weeks they were screaming on the Czech TV reports, as the Germans say, almost all of them for the arrival of immigrants.
Of course, who was only a few days in Germany, knows that it's a lie like a tower.
Which confirms more information.
For example, a famous public opinion research organized by the ARD - Czech Association of Public Legal Television Societys of the Social Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, more than 50% of the Germans wanted to accept even more refugees a week ago.
That's what our television's been calling.
Of course, it has been secreted that the next day in Germany: 94.5 per cent of the Germans no longer want immigrants - a survey attended 67,000 people.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly in November 2010, which is five years ago, said, "Our efforts for `multi-culti' community totally failed."
Then she said, "Germany gives up the struggle for multicultural society."
"All attempts to use such a combination have totally failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, it does not believe that a strategy that allowed people from different cultures to live by themselves without being integrated. Today they live here and we lied to ourselves that they would not be gone again for a while.
It's not reality.
Multicultural approach, when we think we just live happily with each other, this approach failed.
He totally failed.
But even Merkel may not have the power to go against powerful Germany and Europe and, mostly, against political correction.
It shows the escalation of events.
Conflict is rapidly rising.
The Euro-German Schulz, the President of the European Parliament, the Member of the SPD, the only one who has reportedly had no maturity in the euro parliament - yes, this is the one about whom Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said he could play a concentrate overseer for a minute - as he has shown himself more times.
It appears, especially under the impression of the recent German politicians' statements that Germany exceeded Rubikon.
Notice that, to some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the nationals of the nazis victims are frightened.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
Which years have tried, at least outside, to deal with their horrible past of aggressor and a million killer?
Are those who say that in the soul of Germany, the devil's aggression, superiority, and violence?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped the attempts of the Eastern people to control the whole Europe?
When did he say that the Great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he had.
When he was suspended, preparation for World War One began.
The thought of the UK, which led Germany and Europe into two wars of millions of lives, probably returned in another form.
After trying to control the state, for example, with Rote Armee Fraction, and after the failure of the NDR, the ecology, which, by the way, was one of the main ideas of Nazism, began to develop a new German ideology.
We'd say sunshine.
The German elites have long defended the creation of German nationalism, so they have left all those fighters against the atom, the enthusiasts looking for a paradise for all, quietly supported the old emperor's and Nazi password Our forest must live.
To satisfy the uncomfortable youths who all around the world want to do something different and better, they're fully on the side of the warners against the warming of the planet, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there is also a strong anti-semit - so-called propalestinian - and the anti-Slovak stream that all Slovaks considered a difficult verba - since Karl Marx, who, after their parents, was the mainly German nationalist.
Also, as the latest statements of Schulze and German ministers show openly threatening unsubordinated eastern States, the idea of leadership of Germany.
Which must be listened without a refusal.
Otherwise, it's bad for you!
And if we interfere with the fact that immigrants are a very influenced group of voters, we have what we have.
And it always stands behind it as a capital, especially German, which is satisfied and which is the fact that Germany actually controls most European countries through banks and the Union.
The sunbeat pseudover first led Germany into the basins of ecology and multiculturalism and brought them home today and perhaps brings millions of Muslims.
Which, grabbed voices of siren, will soon face the wall of reality that Merkell doesn't want to see, and they start to wreck.
Germany can only threaten its neighbors again by force, again part of its people - but as it seems, a smaller part - ideologically blur, but eventually reality will achieve it as always.
Is Germany gonna burn again?
Muslim accommodation is on fire.
What will the German government do when the Germans protest against the arrival of Islamists?
Jim will come to help the Muslims living in Germany for a long time, but certainly not assimilated to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, arriving Islamists and Germans who are watching the fear of islamising their country?
What will it do to the Germans and at all with Germany when people rise loudly and publicly protest against the new Euroman Muslim?
Germany just changed.
The conflict, which caused the support of suncase ideology in Europe, that is, elite ideology, and in principle totality, and its non-natural banks, is growing.
And because of the uncontrolled negotiations against the democratic Germans and all the underlying and disobedient eastern neighbours, it can't go well.
Tomorrow's finished.
The best way to get rid of the incoming sellers: to scare them to death.
Just knock, and the robust knock on you is a way that weaker nature doesn't have to stand.
The renewed head will erase you nicely and poured you, to the way away, to accompany an unnecessary salesman and a live statue.
Maybe it's a shame that the speaking can't even be ordered.
It would be useful for a lot of bullshit and assholes in our place.
Pink (Oxalis corniculate).
A tiny bordel that tolerates the dry environment.
So it's between the outside tiles near my place.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which belongs to expansive grass, but looks like it makes a nice impression about flowers.
It's between the outside tiles.
She's inexperienced, she's good at our garden.
She likes the dryer environment, she's easy to adapt, modest and unpleasant.
It creates sheets with chaotic composition, but it is worth watching it and taking pictures on.
The beauty of the details is only found under a small view - yellow flowers and green sheets with purple escort.
Brazilian paediatric company Rio Grande promotes healthy diet in breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric company SPRS came with a shocking way to try to mediate women awareness of the importance of good food in breast-feeding with pictures of children sucking from the breast painting of unhealthy food.
Human mother milk consists of different proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide the baby with all the foods needed to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to the reconciliation of energy requirements, pregnant women and newly baked mothers are recommended to increase the daily calories income by 500 calories per day.
However, the new research suggests that the increase in calories income is not the only diet measures that mothers should follow.
A recent study carried out by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic creation of their children and protected them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets have negatively affected the child's immunity system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, even though Nine's is trying to take the lead at Today Show
Karl Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra were not able to create sufficient increases in the estimates for Today.
The morning show Nine projected from the National Capital after Malcolm Turnbul was dumped by Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise with host David Koch and Samantha Armytage has stuck in London as part of a week of a long series of international television broadcast, which includes Dubai, New York, Niagara waterfalls and Cancun.
It didn't seem to be so important on this tiranny to the Aussie TV watchers because she recorded in the average 3,970,000 viewers in five main cities compared to 330,000 broadcasts Today.
Today, she observed a smaller increase in her assessment compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was until last Thursday (343,000).
Today, in the last months, he fills the space in Sunrise.
In August, it was in Today in the average of 318,000 compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the space was moving between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has a average of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds affect more than Parliament this morning, friends!
Carl and Lisa are well, thank you for asking!
Added TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The great news for Seven was an impressive debut 800 words with the former star Packed to the Rafters Eric Thomson.
The new drama about a recent widow father, who decides to move with his two children to the New Zealand director, is in the average of very impressive 1,219 million viewers.
The critics were wondering if Thomson himself could pull a television hit without a star Rafters Rebeccy Gibney.
The result of last night makes it clear yes.
The X Factor of Seven has kept strong 1,136 million viewers, and it is smoothly defeated The Block (838 000) and TBL Familys (726 000)
Seven recorded the mixed tracks of the other night The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of a new TV quiz (from 5:00 till 17:30), which Andrew O'Keefe introduced had a average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (which was 17:30 till 18:00) risen to 623,000 viewers — which was enough for a small victory over the Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of the Chase Australia had an average of 520 000 viewers and the second half of the incredible 720 000.
Hot Seat was about 620 000.
The Chase Australia's second night's decline will be convinced that the Hot Seat will eventually win at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is replaced by a series of Million Dollar Minute that couldn't defeat McGuir's show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is a perfect boy - but who will he choose?
The secret revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwantedly discovered who wins Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will come to Bachelor is covered by an invincible secret.
And three girls who stay to state will definitely not tell who is the real one that gets the rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lany Jeavons-Fellows a day before they left only two, they thanklessly told us who will win.
Sam Wood holds his tongue to the quarter final
All three women lyrics singed why Wood is a perfect man, quoted his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness as reasons why they would want to be his partner.
Anyway, when the question was, "When it wouldn't, who would get Wood's final flower?," their answers could work as a composer about who gets Bachelor's heart.
As Jeavons-Fellows, both Marcos quickly named Mackay as the one that would be best for Wood except them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared a light relationship since a day.
"From the moment I entered the house and watched the energy of Sarah and Sam, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think of it during the course," says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a really rude woman, she's very funny with her," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and there's the right chemistry among them.
They're well and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay thinks Sam Wood and I could make a nice couple.
She himself claims that during his last visit home she realized that Wood could be "the right one."
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is not just a game anymore - I opened his whole heart now," he adds.
I asked who Wood would choose if not her, she faced mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I like both girls as well - it's between Snow and Lana indecisive.
Bachalor is emitted on Wednesday at 7:30 on Ten.

Jarrid Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest in his moving to the United States and many teams asked after his great beginning of training at the end of the last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsull, and it looks like a reasonable decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit down for the rest of the season, because he made a mistake, which performed the convertity of the Australian Rugbian League at the first excavation of the win 20:3 at Minnesota Tuesday.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and put him in a game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula was also sincere in the game dress.
Instead of chewing the new ones in front of the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at a press conference after the match.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, announced that Hayne was also encouraged by a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and to take care of only another game.
During the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne fixed his mistake.
Surely it wasn't the start in which Hayne and his massive Australian fanclub hoped at his NFL debut.
Hayne was captured when he broke out of the field and later told the Australian Hamish & Andy radio duu at 2DayFM 104.1 the worse start of his career in NFL he could not even imagine.
"This happens, you're just focusing on the next game and that's all," said Hayne
Hayne compared a trapas to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in its own branch territory led to the three Queensland.
Totally, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne published a photograph with fans on which he holds the Australian flag on his own Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Rus Vladimir Putin meet at the discussion on the rights of homosexuals
In 2003, the richest man of Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovski, was arrested by guns targeted in Siberian ranway.
After he openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovski was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his democratic efforts were limited.
The ES has acquired emigrants who have been reimbursing property.
Two emigrated in 1984 and their property got a new owner.
After 1989 the property was no longer able to be recovered, so the couples turned into a claim of compensation under the law on extrajudicial rehabilitation.
The Court first gave them the required amount, that is, over 2.8 million crowns, the appeal court, but their privilege changed by confessing to them only in the amount of less than 90 000 crowns with a reference to the amount of the refund is fixed under the Price Regulations of 1991.
The immigrants became the Supreme Court and put them in charge.
However, the Ministry of Finance, which was to pay, has turned the complaint to the ES.
In the meantime, a social and economic change has occurred that the refund recognised under the applicable laws - being the refund of adequate in relation to the property taken - is now only acquiring a fractional value of property.
"This can't come to the difficulty of side participants in the restitution of legitimate persons who have acquired their rights from at least 1995 and who had no possibility of home to grant a refund earlier," explained the rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk, why the U.S. has arrived on the side of the emigrants.
"The U.S. has repeatedly spoken to the general courts to proceed in restitutional matters so that any inconsequences may not be interpreted in the absence of the authorized persons and that the purpose of restitutional legislation is always achieved, therefore, the removal of the property offence caused by the acts of the previous totality state," the judge added.
Evita in the musical Study DVA is now facing Radka Fisar.
By the way, Radka Fisar became the world's youngest Evita, when in 1998, in her twenty years, she formed the role of the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Peron in the first Czech introduction of this famous musical Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice in the Prague theatre of Spiral.
To return to the same role, he says, "The difficulty of Evita has not yet been balanced."
Evita is not just an incredible role, it is also responsibility.
In the role of the first lady of Argentina, Monica Absolon recommended it.
I saw the monch three times in Evita, and it was definitely inspiring for me.
This is where I suddenly saw a new concept.
I'm a lot more favourable of modern adjustments, but this one is just a special leader.
"The director of Ondrey Sokola is original, eager and current," Fisar states.
At the birthday concert of Monica Absolon 27. September from 19 hours in the theatre Studio DVA.
Tonight, he's going to make a top of the musical of Evita.
It will certainly belong to the common duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Shush your cry, Argentina!).
In the limited number of presentations, Ondrej Sokol will also jump away from the director's board when he enters the film of Karl Roden in the role of President Peron.
For the interest of the public, further terms were added to the sale until May 2016.
The Fifth Czech Study of World Musical Evita states theatre Studio DVA in collaboration with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
In the director of Ondrey, Sokola originally studied Monica Absolon.
By her side, Karel Rodden appears as President Peron and in the role of Che Peter Partenaczk.
Legendary songs from Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's workshops with Czech texts Michael Samojevski sound in the application of a alive orchestra under the leadership of Christoph Mark, who was already participating in the first introduction in the Spiral theatre.
4 people killed after the cops shot the rubber missiles on the demonstrators in Nepal.
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in South Nepal after the police shot the rubber missiles into the mass of demonstrators against the proposal for a new state constitution, stated the official in the middle.
Violence took place on Tuesday night in Rupandehi, about 175 miles west from the capital of Kathmand.
Bišnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief of the district officer, states that more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered before the police station and some throwing stones and burning bombs.
Mr. Dhakal states that the police used a tear gas and then fired in the air before they slipped to the rubber missile.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projections known for their ability to kill but traditionally used as a less mortal alternative, obviously caused a high number of deaths.
This conflict was the last week of violent demonstration throughout the southern mountain of Nepal, where members of the Madhes ethnic group say that they created a new province under the proposed new constitution and mitigated their political influence.
Another demonstration in Western Nepal was also recorded by the ethnic group of Tharus, which requires the creation of his own state.
Since August 10th, at a violent conflict, at least 40 people were killed, including 11 cops.
When four main political parties signed a country division agreement to the provinces — a great step towards the new constitution, but a very controversial question in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has lasted since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after a ruining earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators in Kathmand voted this week on the provisions of the proposal for the Constitution and the officials stated that the new chart should be adopted by Sunday.
We must definitely not panic now.
After the loss on the ice of the Imperial Lithuanian you haven't managed even a home duel with hockeyists Sparta (3:5).
Don't you worry about a similar catastrophic entry into the extraligy like a year ago?
I hope nothing like this doesn't happen again.

NHC predicts 60% probability of cyclone south of the Capverd Islands
The broad low-ground system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the Southern Capverd Islands is likely to have 60 percent in the result of the tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, stated on Tuesday the National Hurricane Centre of America.
Another well-defined low-sized system, about in the middle between Capverd Islands and Small Antilles, also has 60 per cent probability in the result of a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, added weather forecast with a seat in Miami.
Google has launched a campaign to choose 11 million dollars for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) stated that it has been launched a campaign to select 11 million dollars for humanitarian organisations helping thousands of refugees who floated the European States to escape from wars denied and poor countries.
Google announced this on his blog in a very unusual way.
The report on her blog was published by Googlu Rita Masoud's employee on the basis of personal experience when she fled with her family from Kabul as a seven-year-old.
"We traveled in many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear," said Masoud.
I was lucky.
But the worsening immigration crisis in Europe is increasingly more families, like that, willing to help.
All contributions will be divided between 4 non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Refugees.
Google stated that all the contributions made over the Google.com/refugeerelief will double $5,5 million.
Europe faces the biggest wave of refugees from the Second World War, most of them come from Syria by a four-year war that only expelled 4 million people this year.
Many people are also running away from the war of defeated Afghanistan, Jemen, Iraq, and Libya.

For mildly sensitive diabetics, a useful loss surgery could be
The benefits of reducing surgery for mildly obsessed people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too soon to say whether the slightly obsessed people with type 2 are living longer after a loss surgery than those who are provided with non-surgery treatment.
"The mortality data takes a long time to see," states Dr. Robin Blackstone, expert on the loss surgery, who wrote the initiator for a new JAMA surgery study.
Baryatric surgeries use different methods to reduce stomach.
Reduction of hunger and limitation of the human body to absorb food.
During years, bariatory operations have been shown to be effective for the treatment of diabetes of type 2, but most of the research has been carried out in people with morbid obsession with body weight index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the weight ratio at the height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values 25 or higher indicates the overweight of a person and persons with a value of over 30 are considered to be obsessive.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Tajwana have used data gathered from the 2007 study, which deals with two types of bariatory surgery - stomach bipass and gastroectomy - in treatment procedures for type 3 of diabetes in people who were mildly obsessive.
The average BMI among those who succeeded in surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 to the end of their fifth year.
Meanwhile, BMI remained those who had not been surgery treatment for diabetes, approximately the same at the value of 29.
Among patients with surgery, the diabetes was fully resolved in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
For comparison of diabetes, only 1 percent and partially only 2% of patients were resolved in the treatment group.
Furthermore, blood pressure control, trigylcerides and "life" LDL cholesterol were demonstrated "usually better in the surgery group", found by the authors.
Researchers also monitored the patient's hemoglobin levels of A1c in the blood that reflects the persistent blood sugar levels in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best maintained under 7%, according to researchers.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c of approximately 9% to approximately 6% decreased.
However, in the medicinal products treated by the group, this value remained approximately 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" -- which reflects in better levels of hemoglobin A1c -- did not reduce mortality in five years, according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu's main researcher and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bipass group lost more weight compared to the gastroctomy group (18.7 to 14.2 kg), increased BMI declines (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 per cent versus 2.1 per cent) and had a greater probability of diabetes remise (46.9 per cent against 16.7 per cent).
While a new study does not show improving survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from the study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to prolongation of life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to the Swedish study, obsessive people who have taken a barrier operation had about 29 percent more chances of survival in the next 15 years, compared to a group that had tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study has not shown improvements in survival among patients after surgery, Blackstone says it is a comforting result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"It is critical right here because it states that surgery is safer in a lower BMI group," he states, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone also claims that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously after the BMI decrease between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long with showing people the seriousness of the situation," he says.
I think once you accumulate these genetic changes that firmly link their bodies to the obsession and sugar, the way back is really difficult.
"It's impossible for all to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to capture all refugees, said Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the near East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in refugee homelands.
Dalajlama was dealing with the issue of a refugee crisis in his speech in opening Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is a study of ethics at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He claimed that, under present circumstances, the interest of mankind should be placed before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also emphasized that the response of Western European countries, regardless of its admirableness, to the refugee crisis in this situation was inappropriate.
"It is impossible for all to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama approved the efforts of Germany and Austria to solve the crisis, he emphasized that it was only a temporary solution.
"A few thousand refugees are beautiful, but you will have to think of a long-term solution, how to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we have to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
When dealing with violence, Dalai Lama also expressed complaints on George Bush after the 11/11 terrorist attack and claims that "the US violent response caused a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere compassion in the letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent path.
I know his motives were good, but he used the strength and created unexpected consequences," Dalaylama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have benefited from sanitation in the last 4 years
Toxicological centres around the United States have reported nearly 400 per cent increases in the number of children up to 12 years of age, which swallowed high alcoholic sanitation, according to the Georgian toxicological Centre.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopeze, Director of the Georgian Toxicological Centre, the number of uses of sanitation in children up to 12 years of age reported to the control centres of poison has increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"The children get more frequently to these products, and unfortunately there is a percentage of children to be taken to an emergency," Lopez CNN said.
Some children drink sanitation intentionally, while some want to make an impression on their friends or as a challenge on social media.
The videos on Youtube show the teenagers how they drink sanitation because of cheap screaming.
Adolescents reportedly mixed the sanitation with oral water containing alcohol for stronger drinks.
Younger children may be attracted by attractive smell of the media.
"The children don't think about what could hurt them," said Lopez.
Many more attractive (sanitation) are those who are perfused.
The sanitation with the smell of strawberries, grep or orange are very attractive to children.
The sanitation measure contains between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol.
Especially in small children, several elbows may mean alcohol poisoning.
"One is highly concentrated alcohol," said the Fox 4 station in Kansas City, the medical director of the Toxicological Control Centre at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't let a glass of whiskey just so, but people leave these sanitation means outside, and when children get to them, it's a quick way to drink.
Nhaiah Russell, a six - year - old girl who recently had eaten up to four sanitation devices with a smell of strawberry and was taken away for emergency treatment.
Her level of alcohol in her blood was .179, which was twice the threshold value considered drunken in adults, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who cared for her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhajah spoke inexplicable words and was not able to walk after she arrived in an emergency.
The doctors monitored her overnight in a separate child hospital on any brain trauma sign, because the girl fell down and hit her head, says Ritchey.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, Mother Nhaiah.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to ensure that the sanitation is from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitation measures were associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontaria died after the swallow of a sanitation media containing toxic, non-declarated ingredient.
Medicines believed that the product contains methanol, a mortal measure, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three students of the fourth year in Northern New York planned to poison their "looking" teachers by posting antibacterial products in the room," according to the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation and has prohibited their presence in the room.
The police evaluated a screwed plan as "innocent pushing," and referring to the discipline of the school quarter,
Fama: No disagreement in the Celtic team
Griffiths are talking about non-solady in Celtic, while Deila admits Hoops are in the wrong place, but he'll turn it back.
Hearts will fight the SFA against Neilson's attack and Warburton is worried that new supports from January will break the unity of the team.
Dons increase their acceleration over Celtic by 5 points
The first half penalt in the administration of ADAMA Rooney secured Aberdeen's close victory over Hamilton in Pittodria, which made Dons five-point score between them and Celtic.
Griffiths denies talks about non-solady
This situation has caused talks about the disagreement in Celtic, which have been denied by Griffith, who insists that he and his fellow players are not working under any pressure from increased supervision in preparations for the fight with the leaders of the Netherlands League.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the player is looking forward to it.
Deficiencies in the Scottish title rivalry bore the Netherlands - de Boer
Former carrier Rangers and former representative of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer claims that the Dutch Football fans lost their interest in Celtic - because there is no rivalry between them anymore because of the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ambassador of Ajax, states: "In the Netherlands they no longer show the best of the Celtic games, and why?"
Because there's no Rangers anymore.
People here don't just talk about the return of Rangers.
He's talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're just interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the games of the Old Company and not only people from Scotland are watching these games.
I'll turn things back to good, Deila's bound.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was a little confused, but the Norwegian boss committed to turning things back to good.
The failure of Malm and the next drop of the Master League was quickly followed by the defeat against Aberdeen, who had only 10 players and is now on the top of the table with a five-point scope.
But Deila says, "Celtic has experienced a bad period and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad in the current day.
We're in the same way -- but we have to go on.
Really, we really need support for Celtic because it makes players much better.
Now it's very important to stay with each other.
Warburton is concerned about January Strength
Despite comments that appeared a few weeks ago and suggested that he had already identified some of his January targets, Chief Rangers Mark Warburton is concerned about the great shopping of aid and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
Former boss Brentford says, "The ice crossing window is very different from that summer."
The players who come in summer have the whole pre-season period for accommodation, which you could see at our own team this season.
The team's doing really good.
Sometimes there is more harm to add unnecessary players to those you really need.
The cross-cutting target of Celticu Michu indicates retirement
The attacker of Swanse Mich, who was connected with Celtic in the cross-border window, indicated that after the expiry of his contract with Swansea, he could retire.
Twenty-year-old shooter has had two years of trouble with an inclined bowl and couldn't find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight SFA for comments against Neilson.
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the dress and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on this defense was canceled later - it is a third red card issued by the judge Collum, which was revoked.
Neilson stands behind his claim and says, "I didn't doubt integrity, I didn't comment on the performance."
Griffiths had to avoid Tynecastle.
The stubborn Hibbe was strictly punished after he admitted that he was singing a song with a text aimed at a former player, Hearts Rudolph Scacell.
The incident took place in the Roserburn area in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014
"It was only a derby and it was a moment," the attacker said and continued, "I can say safely, I can't go back to Tynecastle unless it's in the Celtic dress."
The Council in Tannadice believes in the management of Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists that the Council of Dundee United still believes in fixing the situation with the current team management - but admits that the fall on the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll prepare the boy for action again," Donnelly promises.
MCInnes loves for "suck winning" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to desperately stick against Hamilton Accies, so they could win the seventh league victory by themselves and a five-point scope in front of Celtic on the top of the table thanks to the penalty from the first half of the administration of Adam Rooney.
McInnes says, "There's no team that wins anything, any cups or leagues, without wining this type of games."
Scotland's unemployment remains unchanged, while the total UK unemployment increases
THE USE in Scotland remains without a change in the number of 164 000 in the period between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The rate of unemployment was 5.9 per cent above the level in the UK (5.5 per cent), as shown from the National Statistics Office (UNS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during three months, and the number of workers now stopped to 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland dropped to 74.0 per cent over the British average 73.5 per cent during the quarter.
The Secretary of the State of Scotland, David Mundell, commented on the latest data: "The long-term government plan has laid bases for stronger economy."
It's almost a year that Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we were witnessing further improvements in the labour market and the Scottish employment rose, while unemployment declined.
Why I was witnessing the execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I will watch the death of a man.
If that happens, and I hope that it won't happen, I'll sit in the viewing gallery in the death chamber of the Oklahoma State Prison and see Richard Glossip who will be executed by a death injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials who would witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day is coming, I'm starting to be afraid of it.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America and because they are often more requests than free places, there is a morbid lottery that decides who will be elected.
Oklahoma reduced the number of rooms for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen will be watching the entire execution inconveniently.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends and I have made a special connection with him through months of phone calls and one and a half hours visit.
I like that kid.
We often laugh when we talk.
Prison administration claims that I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't have a note block and I will not be able to record what I will see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused me on Twitter for compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the beneficiaries the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "this could be a better formulation," but she still thinks that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the list of witnesses anytime.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell a story at the scene.
He thinks if he dies, his case will help against death penalties.
Kim Bellware, a Huffington Post journalist, will be next to me.
If you want to know more information about the case, please listen to the series of subcasts I have created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details again.
I can't be sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His acts after Barry Van Trees murder would make him guilty of his collaboration in criminal crime.
But I believe there's a great probability that he's innocent from murder.
I definitely believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think the execution is bad.
And from this perspective, I'll watch his death.
I can't say I'm really objective.
You can contact other journalists for this purpose.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing a man I like to die in no use.
The man fled from Canning River after a police hunter
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after he expelled the man from the Canning River.
The bet of a man from Petrh to flee the police, didn't go after he got into a minor blank water just meters from a cop who tried to force him unnailly to get back to the shore.
The Canning Vale Police was called in a incident over to Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them through the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and repeated 'I won't go out, just come get me'," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec just didn't want to wet his uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactics and the police negotiations."
"People sometimes try to do funny things when they escape," Castledine said.
Ben Cousins' football champion gives a memorial example.
In 2006 Cousins boarded a car to avoid the bus and tried to swim through the Swan River.
His efforts were vain, but he inspired the local to start planning the biatlon of Ben Cousins.
Peter Moody claims that the orderers tried to spy on him and threatened by ending the races
Peeter Moody accused the director of the Racing Victoria that last year they tried to get his spy and threatened to terminate the race immediately.
He focused on the orderer and integrity department Racing Victoria and was convinced that they had a personal campaign against him with late scratching Lady Tatai during the day of the race, which was the last drop for him in the Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do what is best for race and was in a difficult situation in terms of Lidar's positive rubber on a cobalt that he couldn't explain.
He bit his tongue about a spying charge for 18 months and didn't want it to look like dry grapes.
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you're just feeling so frustrated that it's gonna come out of you all at once," said Moody.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go up with my head and make the owners think I'm doing the maximum for them.
If they start thinking the opposite, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'm going to do with my license.
Earlier Moody released in his racing.com bomb interview that integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
"After 18 months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I'm going to name after question - and offered him employment in my states for finding information about things that are being done in my states," Moody on Racing.com said.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If so, they should all show their information because they have completely burned me in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former President of RVL, David Moodie, current President of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, the current Director-General of the RVL, were aware of that at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think this happens personally?
Will RVL grow a few balls and make sure that people outside the training position take responsibility for what's going on in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really so bad for this industry?
Maybe people here think they do.
Maybe they need me to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt what I'm saying will give them the material to think.
But I got to the point when I don't care about it anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really sadded me.
I'll push them and put the burden on them to make a decision.
I have my family's support and I can leave.
The frustration of the coach has increased with a long-term investigation for cobalt including Ledari and recent scratching in it has a feeling that "he could watch his license on the table."
The mood, the most famous for the preparation of an unbelievable champion Black Caviar, marked the rules of treatment on the day of the race as "funny" after the horse's legs were applied a clay or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of race.
I must take full responsibility," he said.
Someone of my team accidentally put a mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it also happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced three-month disqualification for the treatment of the rivals on the day of the race to which the orderers have already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who create these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.
The Cobrama driver who fell was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit the cycle on the weekend in Cobram and went away after the collision.
The cycle was transported to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after the car was hit on Murray Valley's main road on Saturday morning.
The police said that the engineer left without stopping and helping a wounded rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia confessed himself to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected to be accused of non-stop in an accident, no aid and other traffic offences.
A ciclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in a hospital in a stable condition.
Coach Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy returns the rivals due to wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, coach Melbourne Storm, criticised the steps of his players as "designing a plan" with two NRL favorites of premiership.
Trent Robinson, coach Sydney Roosters, said that the judges allowed the players of Storm "wrestling" his players during the controversial victory of the Storm team in the final qualifications in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly hidden note on Strorm after his team won the final qualifications over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game "preview" of the rugby league and he believed that two of Queensland were not "too large" on wrestling.
Bellamy defended the steps of his players and said they focused on "Contact" during them.
Bellamy added that this situation has increased his self-consciousness because his team is criticised by two coaches, which may mean that they are afraid of the defeat of the Storm team.
"I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we were beaten 24-2," said Bellamy in Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything from our defensive system and technology in the last year, but in recent weeks, we were just emphasizing contact during the interventions, and that meant turning to us.
Trent's been here for three years and apparently trained a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could be a little shock for him.
It's funny how such things always come into this part of the year.
Bellamy disagreed Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's team St. George-Illawarra Dragons won the premiership in 2010 by playing a "nurse" football.
Wayne's talking about an exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours. It was also exciting," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was criticised for being a boring team and Wayne said that he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play a game style that seems to him cancelling, especially his young hostages with their speed.
Such a football would you like to play if you had this type of players available.
This opinion said in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his football style - but not every team has two customers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It makes me more self-conscious because they say things like that because they're worried about the fight against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think of us when they were getting into big games.
Bellamy also pointed out the fact that the Storm and Roosters struggle more gates than Broncos and Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos team was probably good, didn't I look at it, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two other attempts in our game, but is it an exciting football?
Or is it interesting for the rest and non-cooking of attempts?
I think they're agents.
If they mention us, that means we'll meet again at the stage.
The storm has this weekend break and wins the right to host either North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night in AAMI Park. The tickets will be sold from the morning next Tuesday.
Serbian man got bail 200 000 USD for drug charges
A man who faced a possible lifetime for holding 40 pounds of cocaine, which was passed from Queensland, was bailed at $200,000.
Marko Maximovic (29 years) was one of the five men arrested by the federal police last month looking for 100 pounds of drugs from the Solay yacht, who arrived from South America through Vanuat and in August.
Maximovic was seen in a meeting together with the accused in the harbor during the morning and later met them in the Coomera Roadhouse cafeteria, where the police found 40 pounds of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Although he faced a potential lifetime judgment for possession of commercial quality cocaine, Maximovica's lawyer set up the defense that there is no proof that he could own all the quantities and that he could be in the cafeteria completely random and innocent.
The judge of the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, thought Maximovic would escape.
He has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the middle of the court.
In a crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Mother and father of Maximovice offered a bail of $200,000 for his release.
"After reading the vow declarations of both persons, it is obvious that the bail of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
Their efforts were obviously insufficient, because the accused did not proceed further in court, he warned.
Maximovic has been bailed under the condition that he will give up both the Australian and Serbian passport, he will report to the police every day and will observe the ban on the exit from 18 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Steven Hogg used a girl's phone to drag pedophiles to send pictures
Pedofil used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to get pictures of child abuse.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone when she slept, then logged in on her online chat, where he had a lot of inappropriate pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl wake up and found out she missed the phone and then found him in Hog's sleeping hand.
She passed through him and before she warned her mother, she found anxious news.
The police joined and saw five photos, then the analytical computers found the address and discovered a "threatening" search on the web using expressions for searching for immoral pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the cops that his reason was to make pedophiles online before he "pretend to be a police officer and scare them."
Fiscal representative Eilidh Robertson said for Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was dependent on scaring people.
He confessed that the computer search was on him, but he said he was just trying to pretend he was a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send another.
He thinks he's doing it to drag them into it.
He claims he was screwed up in drunkenness and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added, "When the girl found messages on her phone, she called her mother, she was shaking and crying.
She saw immoral pictures on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interrogated and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he.
Hog, 23, residence in Ward Road, Dundee, confessed guilty of the complaint on the adoption or provision of inappropriate images of children on 14 June of the last year, violated the conditions of bail on 25 January and did not acknowledge the court on 24 March of this year.
The defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be placed on the list of sexual offenders, because he could argument that in his act there was no "no essential sexual subtext."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed a judgment on October for reporting social workers.
Hogg was bailed in this case, but he was held in custody before hearing about other unsolved cases.
He was placed on a list of sexual offenders before the date of his judgment.
Zimbabwski Robert Mugabe has spoken wrong in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the African oldest leader, fell on the stage stairs earlier this year.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of his fall became viral in social media.
The opening of Parliament was also distorted by the claims of opposition lawmakers that they received anonymous threats to murders that warned them of the waste of Mr. Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, he was provoked and provoked during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament, which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The Chairman of the Chairman of the Movement Club for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gones, said that seven opposition politicians received text reports on their mobile phones with warning to prevent Mr. Mugabe.
"The report comes from a number that will not be displayed but is named 'Death'," he told journalists after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
He warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and once it comes from Parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The Chief stated that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai has "functions" on threats against the messengers.
Hewlett-Packard is about to reduce the number of jobs to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard cancelled 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within its efforts to restructurate and save the costs of business services.
The HP will later this year be divided into two companies at the bureau and separate the computer trade and printers from its rapidly growing companies' hardware and services.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change in approximately $2.7 billion and starts in the fourth quarter, states HP.
"This restructuring activity will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable expenditure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, Director-General of HP and Head of the Bureau, who will be head of the unit after division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a wide and wide portfolio of trades that will help businesses move into a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate society, we will be in a much better position to meet our customers' needs throughout the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have an annual income over $50 billion after the announcement of the company and "will be focused on providing non-competitive integrated technological solutions" by the company.
This will be the deployment of a company established in 1930 by the Stanford University students Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, manufacturer of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was named "Silicon Valley".
HP has been through massive reorganization to manage the movement from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This HP move, the second largest PC producer and one of the largest technical companies in America, is the latest of this sector based on conviction that the specialized company has better results.
Captain Arsenal Michael Arteta says the colleagues must get injured by Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also emphasized Wilshere that he's still only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to the plan, there's no reason he's not playing again on Christmas.
This best scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least four more English games and, from history, his involvement in the next summer European championship is obviously uncertain.
The great pity of this newer problem is that Wilshere ended the last season strong after the injury of the bunch and then again arrived in the former form during the pre-session.
"This type of wound does not threaten a career," said Wenger.
It's a wound that requires treatment.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his bottles or the wounds he suffered before.
This could be true from a pure medical perspective, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of other injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There's also an unpleasant pattern here.
The study conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different wounds of Wilsher since six years ago he had his game debut.
During the last five years, he only played in 65 lig matches of Arsenal from the total number of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eighth seasons since 2007-08 was one of the two Premier League clubs, who lost most days because of injuries.
Wenger accepts the potential of a charmed circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in the areas of recorded injuries will continue during the last season.
"Cas when you return after injury, you have a vulnerable period, the time you need to strengthen your body and get a competitive competition," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body is stabilized, I'm sure it is, and he will have the career he deserves.
Arsenal begins a campaign in the Lisa of champions on the middle night against Dinamo Zagreb games with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspure next Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey weren't traveling to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuh and Arteta will probably join.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
"I try to maintain balance and let players need to breathe," Wenger says.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite for the F group, Maximir in Zagreb has a reputation of the most scary stadium in Europe.
Dinamo was also not defeated in total 41 matches after the campaign "unbelievable" last season.
The stadium was shaken at the middle of the night by earthquake 3.2 degrees of Richter.
That was this year in Zagreb already.
Wenger thinks that the Arsenal had learned from the last season of the Champion League, when he was capitulating against Monaco and remained a remote hope that the club would lead to the first victory in the European cup.
"It's awesome," said Wenger.
It never happened to the Arsenal.
In 2006 we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be realist.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar views in various shows is beating into the eyes, especially in view of how the need for men to open more desperate than ever, about suicides between young men under 15 years.
In 2013, it was the only major cause of death in men aged 20-45 in Great Britain and remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an effort to address this problem, Campainign Against Living Miserable (CALM) 2015 as the Year of Man, whose aim is to question the culture that prevents men from looking for help when needed.
The heart of this struggle is a friendship to fulfill this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 high-school students showing depression symptoms found that in the case of a damaged one had sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," their chances for recovery were doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends represents a half chance to have mental problems.
But to make friendship work, it must, of course, be achieved first.
In this communication through social media with a emphasis on the style and not on the content of the communication, the immediate answer is often preferred before meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful, even though we are more isolated in reality.
This surface success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, everything to the cost of our real values -- our personal desire for growth and friendship -- which have a deep influence on our mental health.
And as a billionaire explained recently and a gamemaker, money really won't buy more luck.
The beauty of the series Friends was the source of this thought for him.
None of the figures were defined by their work, but by their personalities that shineed through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, the time of football watching on comfortable chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all the sources of knowledge that yes, men can also identify themselves, even though they mostly keep their feelings for themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me: ...."My role in listeners who feel depressed or have suicide tendencies really confirmed me that even the least friendly interactions can make a difference."
People who contact us often feel incapable in communication with friends.
The old term "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be weak to open problems.
Friends are one of the series that will rise up to me when I try to offer a longer-term compensation mechanism.
It emphasizes small moments in male friendship.
With regard to my task, the outsider's condition on the phone helps people in desperation, but long-term support must come from closer, from a network of friends and family.
So if you're going to FrindsFest this weekend, organized by the Comedy Central station, why don't you take your friends to a glass to Central Perk, where the interior for the occasion of celebration will be fully processed.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
The series Friends will be sent to the Comedy Central station from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG move Malmo side
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavani after the shooting of a gate against Malm.
Angel Di Maria scored at his debut in Lisa Masters and so helped PSG Tuesday defeat the Swedish team Malmo.
Here's a match report and a response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in the Tuesday match and Paris Saint-Germain started their journey in Lisa Masters with the final convenient victory 2-0 against Malm on Parc des Princes.
Di Maria shot a gate less than four minutes after his debut in Lisa Masters and this PSG player sent French champions to win, but then they threw a few chances, when they finally increased their acceleration when Cavani shot the head in 61th minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in group A, and therefore the team of Paris needed a strong start against Swedish champions, because they focused not only on qualifications in qualifications, but on improving their journey to the quarterfinal, which they recorded in each of the previous three years.
But even though they got three points, it wasn't a classic performance of Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was marnotratous before the gate, and later he was trained against his home team and club, in which he started his famous career in 1999.
"In the League of Masters, it is not easy to win outside or at home, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents trouble and look comfortable in the defense is a good beginning, even though there are things that we have to improve with the season procedure," said Blanc.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I'm sorry we didn't shoot one or two gates more.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury as one of the three changes of PSG team, which broke this weekend of remisa 2-2 with Bordeaux in Lisa 1, but in the fourth minute he was shadowed by Di Maria.
The Argentine wing was marked as a man who moved PSG in Europe to a new level after the transition from the United Manchester, which ran last month, and showed why when he ran into the pass of Marca Verratti for the defence of Malma and by a beautiful ending, he sent the ball behind the back of Johan Wilanda to the remote corner of the gate.
However, if anyone expected it to start a great PSG victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malma, who defeated Celtic in play-off and reached this stage, came up with nine internationals in the basic composition and five defenders and two dragged hostages were a heavy competitor.
But besides Nicole Djurdjice's shot, who just passed the remote corner of Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG themselves looked at the benefit of the attack of the bad extracts and the miserable ending, which was not good even from Ibrahimovica, who couldn't shoot five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot arrived in the network shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, he showed himself much more suitable when he came to prepare chances for his fellow players, and it was just from his submission when Di Maria sent a round shot that ended in Wiland’s gate after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after the hour of the game thanks to Cavanim, this Uruguayec sent a head on the line the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic came to him after the left wing from Maxwell.
It ended all the thoughts of Malma about the possibility that they could get something out of the game, and only the excellent action of Wilanda in a great closer ruined David Luiz's hopes and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of the sequenced Ezequiel Lavezzi was not recognized at the end of the match.
The trainer of the team Malmo Age Hareide admitted that PSG was a class higher than his team, Nor said, "Our last game in Lisa Masters took place in December last year."
Since then, we played only a Swedish League, which is not at the same level.
The qualification games are not enough.
The hat down for Paris.
It was a marvelous game for them.
Glencore earned $2.5 billion for stock sales
Glencore's giant, with a headquarters in Switzerland, who was affected by a decline in the commodities prices, earned $2.5 billion from the sale of shares within its large debt reduction plan.
The company Glencore states in its statement that it sold a new share of approximately €1.6 billion to pay the debt.
This company, which has lost 57% of its market value this year, is facing commodity prices, since the Chinese economy's slowdown reduces demand and burns spark destruction across the markets.
The problem of rights has sent Glencore's stock price on the top of the London stock market in early morning markets.
The shares have risen by 2.77 per cent to 131,60 pens on the FTSE 100 index, which have opened by 0.69 per cent above.
The Glencore company discovered last week that the sale of shares worth $2.5 billion was part of the broader plans to reduce their debt $30 billion, which accumulated about a third.
The company sold new shares in the price of 123 pensions per share, which meant a 2.4 per cent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
They removed 1.3 billion shares in the total price of 9.99 per cent per group.
The concerns about the prolongation of Chinese growth braking decreased the price of iron rude by almost half and copper, copper and other commodities by 20 to 40 per cent.
White House confirmed that Washington visited Xi Jinping
The Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in his Tuesday report.
The first visit to President Xi in Washington will take place on 25 September in Barack Obama's response to the visit to Peking, where the president welcomed in November, the report reported.
The American President and First Lady Michelle Obam will invite President Xi and his household Peng Liyuan to the state dinner that will be held after the interviews are completed.
"The visit of President Xi is an opportunity to strengthen mutual relations between the United States and China and encourages cooperation in addressing international, regional and common concerns and is an opportunity to constructive debate on the conflicts of both States," the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he meets several U.S. technical leaders on his way to Washington and then continues to New York at the United Nations lighting session.
Obama and Xi are expected to deal with disputed problems, including Washington's concerns from the alleged cyberspiece of China and its increasing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
As the fugitive crisis embarrassed the Schengen space.
The urgent lightfire launched by Germany did not smash the European crew far away, but it already forced the ship to change the course, wrote the French Journal of Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal with the issue of refugees: it would rather systematically classify migrants and asylum applicants as soon as they enter the old continent -- especially in Greece, rather than to fight about the future division of refugees according to quotas based on the quantities that are increasingly deployed in reality.
Six days after the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker requested 25 of the 28 EU countries to redeploy 160,000 refugees, the Ministers of the Member States have changed their priority.
Before taking care of the final destination of the runners, it is necessary to filter those who are already here today and to resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen space.
"Effective management of EU external borders is necessary to manage migration," stresses the text of the ministers discussed in Brussels on Monday.
After the crisis, he finds the EU's shared currency in danger in its next large integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its decision and increase pressure.
It renews border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influenza of those who are looking for asylum in this country.
The central power makes it clear that no free movement in Europe is possible without it.
As evidence, Austria and Slovakia have already joined this measure in Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and even France also consider it, even though with different intensity.
Hungary has come to this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permitted according to Schengen rules.
That it's a dominary effect, but he can see blind.
The key question for Berlin and Paris is now an effective introduction of mandatory input controls in Greece, Southern Italy and Hungary for those who have already gone into the inland.
The French Minister of Interior, Bernard Cazeneuve, and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière, intensely dealed with them during their private conversation with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This is not a new idea, but it's realized tough.
In Italy, unofficial statistics have already been registered and identified by the removal of two-thirds of the new arrivals of runners.
Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point in its territory, because they fear more than others that there are no camps in which refugees would accumulate on her account.
A real black hole remains Greece.
On his islands near the Turkish coast, more than 200 thousand people landed in this year, which was twice more than recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum applicants who came directly from Syria after they passed over the camps in Libanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge zoe hole.
Athens who are still in financial divorce and waiting for a new government have put their hands in the knee.
This is the default point for the Balkan road and the source of common concerns now for the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban.
Juncker's committee promises that the introduction of the checkpoints will take place as soon as possible, but it has not entered any number or date.
"The challenges faced by Greece apply to Europe," EU Ministers agreed on mobilization on this front on Monday.
It is therefore to place the intervention teams of the European Frontex border control agency in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for asylum benefits and strengthen the surveillance of the islands.
"The need will be adequate financial resources," warns the text submitted to the Ministers for approval.
They will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The question of the real European border guards has not been formally raised, but Europe is approaching.
The new emergency situation of the eighth-year-old, as did the second row, raised the question of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees set up by Juncker's Commission and the European Parliament, which was strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande in the early year.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still don't want to hear about it.
He considers it as an attack on his sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was kept in the text approved by most of the eighth.
But as a political commitment.
Otherwise, the process is aborted.
The only solid promise includes the renewal of 40 thousand refugees in the next two years, which has already been reached in June during the EU's habitat summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead under the Alps, allegedly three Czechs.
Three Czech and four Germans are among the seven tourists killed by the lavina in the French Alps.
Germany's nationality is also according to the authorities a woman who survived as the only one of the affected eight-party group.
Previous media reports indicated that it was about Polk.
Some 30 - year - old woman was hospitalized in the city of Briancon with a serious injury of her leg in the area of the bone bone.
The dead were based on the AFP mainly forty-years.
"The rescue operation is over, and the victim's bodies have also been transported to Briancon," stated the prefect of the Hautes-Alpes Pierre Besnard department.
Unfortunately, around the afternoon in the mountain area of Pelvoux under the top of the mountain Dôme de Neige des Ecrins measured 4015 meters.
"A sudden lavina was 250 meters wide and high about a meter," Nicolas Colombani, head of savior, noted.
He believed that about 3900 meters on the eighth group, there was a huge amount of snow.
The weather service today did not warn in the area against uncomfortable weather.
Tropišovski before the Brago fight: Finally real Europe.
Coach Jindrich Trpišovski was able to walk through the European League for the basic group with his chapel premier, and now he is looking forward to enjoying the real Europe with the team.
The Slovak welcomes the 2011 finalist and, according to the coach, he wants to force her game style.
After all the nerves in the eruption fights, when every goal and any situation could put you out on the way to a dream group, now we're there and we're going to play six games.
Of course we want to win, but we don't have to be afraid of every incassed gate, we can play our tactics and we are not bound by just a double fight.
"I'm very looking forward to this and it's a real Europe, before it was only qualification," Trpišovski said at the press conference.
Bragu considers the top team.
It will be very active, they have Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good on the ball.
The competitor may be harder to say that he has no name, but he has a player in his barn that I think Manchester was giving three goals.
"It is an excellent total at top team level," Trpišovski stated.
But she doesn't think Bragu's favorite.
I think we're playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we have shown that we are strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm it," said a coach whose team lost from 11 duels of this season only the introductory Super cup in Plzni.
He believes that Liberec can force Braze to make his style.
We're waiting for a team that's strong on the ball, while it's not typically disciplined for them.
They're playing 4-4-2 with a rapid transition to the attack phase.
"It is a very difficult opponent, we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players do it at the field," said Trpišovski.
We studied a lot of rivals in the predecessions, which has helped us, and this time we want to focus on our game, which we have adapted to training.
"And we definitely want, even though it will be very difficult to play according to our notes," the coach added.
Student movies control the Sand, the international festival begins.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries this year reported their work to the 15th year of the International Student Film Festival in Pisca.
Four dozens of them, which the Commission composed of students and teachers sent to the final, will be projected from 15 to 18 October in the cinema Portic.
The best of them will choose the international jury, said the speaker to the festival James Charvat.
Each year the festival has its special theme that differs from the festival sounds.
She's a detective this year.
The director of this year's celebrations Richard Blumenfeld plans to connect the elements of TV, movies and theatre.
"And, of course, we also have to solve the crime that was committed in our this year's instruction," said Charvat.
Visitors will see the choice of the most interesting student creation - films played, animated and documentary.
It will be evaluated by the international jury to which, for example, the winner of last year, the director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda will gather.
Festival organizers are preparing an accompanying program every year.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondrej Ruml, professional player on dogeridoo Ondrej Smeykal, Turboshanson group Let's Fly?, plays a band of Zrni or, for example, Petra Hapk with recital Life on the bar.
The festival will host two photo exhibitions.
The first will be brought by the student of the Song Film School and the holder of prestigious appreciations, including not even from the World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ashenbrenner.
The second exhibition approaches the atmosphere that ruled in Nepal after a tragic earthquake.
On the word with the visitors, cameraman and documentary Martin Czech, the German film The Cameraman will be accompanied by the Gerhard Gruber and the sandwich relatives of Brukner, Novotny and Hlach in the attellery of Jan Novotnega will baptize his new book 3 friends from the city P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ondric, FAMO patrona, who recently left us.
Our school and Festival are his link, which will continue to live.
"Young people around the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences between themselves and develop joint links and film artwork," the speaker said.
It will certainly help the Pitching Forum, where students can meet film professionals, graduate a number of work audiences at once and get such a job position.
The festival is connected to the creation of Private Higher Film Schools in Peace.
Her founders, Vladina's husbands and Milon Terch, organized the first year in 1997.
By sixth year, he was held once for two years.
In the fall of CK, insurance companies have to place the customers' rights at full level.
Insurances should place the customers' privileges when the travel office falls fully.
It decided on this on Wednesday, when it approved the amended novel of the law on the conditions of business in the travel movement.
The travel offices will be able to replace the insurance against the decline of the bank guarantee, according to the proposal to assess to the Senate.
Insurances with the obligation to place the customers' rights even above the agreed limit shall not agree.
The Ministry of Local Development insists on the adjustment, arguments the protection of the consumer.
Insurances have already threatened to terminate travel office insurance when the novel is paid.
But the proposal is also criticised by travel offices.
Because without insurance, they will either have to quit or leave abroad.
The Ministry of Local Development Karla Plecht (ANO) pointed out that cases where insurances did not pay full refunds are not eurocomform.
She noted this year's decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client has the right to full reimbursement of the money, regardless of the limit of insurance.
Insurances will receive enough information on travel office management and will be able to determine the correct limit, emphasized the Pleasure.
"We appreciate the efforts to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit to be realizable," deputy Vice-President ToP 09 Miroslav Kalusek opposed.
The bank guarantee is not going to work because no one gives it unlimited.
"The travel offices will have to terminate their activities or move to abroad," Kalosek warned.
Member of the Chairmanship of the Czech travel offices and the agency Tomio Okamura (SPD) with Kalusic cowards on the basis of an examination between the CK Members.
"Stop showing us lobbing insurance," he said.
The insurance statement does not refer to Okamura as relevant, any of their official written expressions in this sense does not exist.
They say they find out whether the travel offices will be involved, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
She also warned Jan Fischer (ODS), which refers to the opinion of the Competitive Association of Travel Offices of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Peter Bendl, who spoke about the wiping of the stairs by the Czech travel office.
Travel offices according to Fischer will not be able to negotiate insurance.
"Protection of consumers works," judges Fischer.
Her proposal for release of a controversial passage was not accepted.
It did not apply either to Vojciech Philip (CSCHM) with a proposal to return the proposal to the Committee for alleged contradiction with the Civil Code.
Philip warned about travel agencies that he believed that consumers could threaten.
In view of the Constitutional Court's judgment, the rapporteur Martin Berdich (ANO) has withdrawn its proposal, which would limit the liability of insurance in cases where they could not know that the insurance performance does not cover the whole risk.
In the novel, there will be no initial proposed minimum four million insurance limits for travel offices offering air carriages and a million limits for offices selling bus railways, for example.
The border will remain at 30 per cent of the markets planned from the sale of railways.
However, the insurance limit will have to be such that, in the event of a decline, the travel office will cover all customers' rights.
Norma, even after the amendments, states that travel agencies will have to reintroduce which travel office organizes.
The travel offices will be required to provide insurance before the contract is concluded, inter alia, information on the economy and number of races.
The approved amendment proposal to the Public Administration Committee also counts on further regular insurance information.
The travel offices will have to provide them with data on the number of passengers and sales visits each month, the total prices of sales and the amount of reserves and markets and for instructions on them.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds out that the travel office has not fulfilled any of the legal obligations against the insurance, it will invite it in accordance with the proposal for repair or will be able to prohibit the closure of new contracts if an infringement of the obligation could compromise the interests of the customers.
Novela should also update the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of subsidy to the mountain service on the basis of its request, which will always be submitted by the end of April for the next year.
The request will include a report on the use of state money last year, a financial plan for expenditure and a view for the next two years.
According to the Association, the lawmakers did not figure out what would happen if the insurance confessed the CK contract.
It will not be allowed to organize races, and the clients who bought the race before the insurance exemption will lose it according to the association.
In such a case, CK will suffer a significant loss and may also disturb, although its economy was in good condition.
One of the possibilities for such situations as travel offices will be the remuneration of a complaint.
Another option will be to go to abroad and to use many softer conditions in abroad, and then on our market, we will only act as agencies, said the Vice-President of the Association of Jan Pope.
Although the proposal of the novel also appears to contain a bank guarantee institution, it is not so thoughtful that it cannot be implemented in practice, as the bank guarantee cannot sound at an unlimited amount.
According to the association, the change in the original practice de facto is unusually useless.
In the horizont of two years, the EU's new directive will need to re-establish the entire law.
The Czech market is now operating in total of 942 active travel insurance offices.
Only three CKs have completed their activities this year.

Merkel: We need to improve the conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must plant on improving humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Libanon to limit the arrival of runners to Europe.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced it after negotiating with the German Earth Prime Ministers.
At the same time, she again appealed to the division of refugees who have already arrived in the EU, among the eight-year-old Member States.
We must help more to countries where refugees leave, wherever they are delayed after leaving the country.
I expect a signal from the European Union to settle on the dignity conditions in refugee camps, such as Jordan and Libanon, the German Chancellor said, according to which such a signal could be a higher financial aid or greater EU cooperation with international humanitarian organizations.
"The Communities also support the German government in promoting a fair dilution of the weight of the refugee crisis to the European country," Merkel further said.
The Earth Prime Minister of Braniborska Dietmar Woidke, in this regard at the press conference, said he expects real solidarity from all EU countries.
The division of the EU runners on the basis of quotas has been rejected for a long time, inter alia, from Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke to the acceleration of asylum management in Germany.
People need to know if they have a chance to stay here as soon as possible.
It's also necessary for the authorities to begin more quickly with the integration of foreigners, said the Branch Prime Minister.
It also states that the majority of the money that Germany is expensing for the care of the runner is needed to be used to integrate those who have a chance to gain asylum.
It'll take more teachers to handle German.
It is a great challenge for our country, but I believe that if the runner is able to integrate, they can be a benefit for us, he said.

Matt Damon confronted the Afroametical Effie Brown movie during the debate on diversion with the claim that it was not necessary at the scenes.
During the Sunday Episode, the Greenlight project interrupted an actress involved in Brown's series when she emphasized the need for alternative views on black protagonists in the scenario.
"When we're talking about diversion, you're doing this by a movie, not at the series of show," says Damon.
She was shocked, she reacted awkwardly Brown with her uncertainty and sighed "Hoo! Wow. OK," when the comments about Marcian came into the television.
Damon and Brown joined a common known producer Ben Affleck and the brothers Farrelly to discuss the finalists of the show.
"I would like to appeal to people to think, whether anyone is a director, how they will behave to the character of Harmona," Brown said at first.
The only black man who's a whore that's packed by a white patch.

After the debate went forward, the social media exploded in disagreement with Damon's comment.

Tweet gained more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 figures since the publication was published.
Damon's comment comes when the exact racial representation in the media is in front of the social debate.

In February, Prince's singing made a motion singers, while he stated the nominated in the Album category of the year during the transfer of Gramma prices.

"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," said the manager.

"American Ninja Warrior has the first winner"
Professional peasant and Isaac Caldiero chick became the first competitor who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday and took home one million dollars.
In the competition that just ended its seventh season, no competitors have been able to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During the final year's season, two men hit the last round, Caldiero and Geoff Britten cameraman.
The last obstacle was a 30-second slip of more than 220 m long chain.
Britten graduated the slip as the first, in a limited limit, and became the first competitor that in America Ninja Warrior overcomed a forced 4 pieces, however, Caldiero overcome it by three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero provided an interview for the reporting! News immediately after his hard-defeated victory and was found that he was still in shock of the winning of the main price of $1 million.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never earned more than 10,000 dollars a year in my life," Isaac E! said in response to my victory.
"So suddenly... I can't imagine what it's going to be."
The executive producer Kent Weed provided an interview with the Hollywood Reporter on the course of the final and why Britten won't gain any rewards even though he became the first competitor who finished the track.
Because according to the rules, the money belongs to the one who finishs the trail as quickly as possible.
"If more competitives are participating in the tracks, the winner wins with the best time," Weed said.
Even though the profit of the primary victory would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
"I don't think he would be anger in himself.
He's glad he was able to achieve what he did.
He got a hot reception from the fans.
He's a great guy and he likes his family.
He's a hero for his children and a woman."
Geoff told me: “If there was someone who could be defeated me, I am glad it was Isaac. ”
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eighth season that begins to film on spring 2016.
Tigers from Detroit only passed closely around Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For tigers from Detroit, the second half of the season was not just walking in a pink garden.
Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, are now in the last place of the Central Division of the American League.
They just distracted Tigers when they defeated Minessota by a close result of 5-4 at the Target Field stadium.
The twins lost their chance to get closer to the Houston Astros team and grab the second wild card in the American League.
Even though for one night, for Detroit, it was the return of the word to Z, which was so unacceptable for them during the second half of the season.
"It's always fun and it doesn't matter how to play," Brad Ausmus, manager of Tigers, said.
The Tiger Thunderman, Alfredo Simon, maintained his offences, and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts, and then took the next one at the sixth and ninth shift.
Simon (13-9) allowed the rival 6 1/3 fires and 3 rounds.
It was only his third leading game from the last nine matches.
"I want to end with convincing results this year," Simon said.
"It's hard to get into the game when you're sitting on a knife often and that's why I want to get into the game."
The tiger's patchman Victor Martinez hit three times and made two rounds and his first downloaded point since half August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point match since the last June game in which he hit four times in a fight against Seattle Mariners.
"He's been very relieved," said Ausmus.
"He looked good at the training, he burned a lot better, and he managed to carry it into the fight."
Thanks to three circles at the end of the seventh shift, the Twins got the greatest chance to return to the game.
The middle polar Byron Buxton got a shift thanks to two points on the left side of the field.
The right polar Aaron Hicks got a point by the set-up toe and Simon strapped Brian Dozier before he was replaced by Blaine Hardy's left.
Hardy expelled his only contest Mauer and he had a bullet Miguel San, who fired the ball and rounded two targets and left the right of Drew VerHagen behind him.
With two meth players and the chances of remise in the second shift, VerHagen managed to send a third meter over two targets.
Plouffe has already won 27 rounds over two targets in this season and reigns the league table.
Detroit held the ninth shift, Mauer got two downloaded points and Bruce Rondon secured a score 5-4 for Tigers.
Nevertheless, this rightman dismissed Sana for three ways.
Detroit used advantages and got points at Phil Hughes' game.
Tigers received three rounds in the first two shifts against a served rightman who entered the game after more than a monthly break because of the inflammation of the back muscles.
"I definitely didn't imagine such a start," Hughes said, "but during the third shift, I felt that I was able to throw better."
After he resisted the effort in the first shift, Hughes released one point to the other meter Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for the right polar J.D. Martinez took out Victor Martinez, who first rounded all the targets.
Victor Martinez interrupted his series 0-21.
The third meter Nick Castellanos followed him with the point on the right side of the field and scored the next round, but Victor Martinez was bailed when he tried to hit the third target.
Tigers added in the second shift when James McCann and polar Anthony Gose received two, and let's score 3-0 on the results table.
"This has led us to knees," said the manager of the Twinchat Paul Molitor.
"Don't hit the ball well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won the number of bullets, ended up in a third shift without points and was replaced by the right A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three targets, got six fires and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the true Thumbman of Tigers, ended the fight with pain in the right shoulder.
Dr. James Andrews, who operated Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who is on the list of injured due to muscles in his shoulder since half August, should enter the middle fight.
Sanchez will replace the left Daniel Norris who will return after the injury and go against the twins.
Since June 30th, when Norris was replaced as David Price's left handballer, he has a score of 1-1 to 4 matches.
But since August 20, he hasn’t played yet because of the muscle.
Tigers and Twins will play a third game on Target Field stadium on Wednesday.
For Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) the Minnesotic Left Arvin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) will be constructed.
Xi calls for the opening of the economy to the wider world
Economy needs to be opened to a wider world to strengthen growth, said President Xi Jinping to the group whose task is the Tuesday Reform of Management.
"The action should be engaged in attracting foreign investments and expertise and improving open policies," the central head group said on the 16th meeting for the promotion of the overall reform.
A new impulse and vitality will also provide a new space for economic growth, states Xi.
The leader group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of market regulatory access, the release of border control policy, the support of state enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital and reorganization of the registration residence system.
The declaration states that a negative list of sectors and businesses outside the investment limits will be drawn up.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
This step is important, as it will provide a greater role in the allocation of resources, the provision of legal business environment and make the market more open, it states.
The government will also release checks on the power he delegates to companies and make sure that the companies themselves will decide how to manage their business.
It also states that China will allow border areas to identify new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for regional growth support.
In an effort to open a state of controlled sector, more areas will be opened to private investments.
"The government will not change its policy against foreign investments and protect legal interests by companies financed from abroad and will provide better services to them," the statement states.
Furthermore, it will be easier for foreigners to ask for a permanent stay or a "green card" through optimization of the requirements and simplification of the application process.
The protection of the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and state representatives was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and the leaders of Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to the statement issued after the meeting.
There may be a new bed department in the Karlovar district.
According to the Deputy Heitman of the Karlovar region, Jacob Vorica (CHSSD), the current capacity of bed offices of two district hospitals and two private hospitals in the region should be done on the basis of the agreement between separate hospitals.
But there are also options for extending care in the area.
For example, a single surgery centre could be established in the surgery department where surgery performances that do not require hospitalisation longer than 24 hours should be performed according to the specified concept.
In which specific hospitals the workplace should be focused on one-day surgery, it is not clear yet.
In the skin department of Karlova Vara, the laser center could rebuild with the possibility of using laser technique for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apalian center that would care for patients with brain infected in vegetative condition.
Such a centre should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological-resuscitation department.
There is also a possibility to concentrate such a device in the hospital of Islands, where there is already similar care.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovar region, is the bed of the next care and, in particular, the bed of the Leiceben long-term sick (LDN), whose capacity in the Neydk is insufficient and should be closely connected to the bed of acute care.
Part of this device should work as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, recommends concept.
As he notes, the next care bed is missing mainly in Karlova Vara hospital.
There could be use of abandoned buildings after centralization.
In the latest series of cases in the Karlovar region, socially health beds are absent, focusing on the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
These beds are deficiencies throughout the Republic, so it could also serve for other regions as so-called Alzheimer Centre.
Patients should also be prepared according to the recommendation for the introduction of so-called retail beds to which the funds of European grants will be released.
"One of the beds that will be connected to suspecialized care stores and will form a place for the translation of patients after the intervention, for example, after cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, transplantation or other action," the circuit concept of bed care describes.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
