Welsh Congregation Representatives are concerned that "will look like Muppeti"
Some of the congregation representatives (English Assembly Member, AM) surprised the proposal that they could be called representatives of the Welsh Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament, IWP).
This is because of the plans to rename the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Congregational representatives from all political spectrums are concerned that they could become a subject of nausea.
A corporate representative from the Laburist Party said his group is concerned about the name "removing with Twp and Pwp".
For the readers outside of Wales: in the Welsh twp means stupid, and pwp shit.
The Saborian representative of the Wales Party (Glaid Cymru) said that the group in general "is not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was "open" to change the name, but that the MWP could be converted to Muppet quickly.
In that context, the welsh word “w” is said similarly to the word “in” in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly committee, which is currently preparing the law on the introduction of the names, said: "Of course, the final decision about how the congregational representatives will be titled on themselves."
The law of the Government of Wales in 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly authority to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that encountered wide support for the change of the names of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the name of the representatives in the congregation, the Committee was inclined to call "the members of the Welsh Parliament" or the MWP, but the MWP option received the greatest support during public consultation.
The Assembly's representatives suggest alternative options, but the fight to achieve consensus could bring headache to the President of the Assembly, Elyn Jones, which is expected to submit a proposal to the Law on Changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the functioning of the board, including the rules on disqualification of the representatives of the congregation and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the law, the Assembly's representatives will have a decisive vote on the question of how they want to be called.
Macedonians come to a referendum on the change of country name
The voters will vote on Sunday whether they want to change their country's name to the North Macedonia Republic.
The aim of voting is to resolve a multi-annual dispute with neighbouring Greece with a province called Macedonia
Athens has long endured to claim that the name of her north neighbour is the possession of the Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the initiation of the procedure of its accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a plebiscite opponent for changing the name, said he would not acknowledge a referendum decision.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change is called a simple price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
They shut down St. Martin's bells while the churches in Harlem fight for survival
"The older people I have spoken to have said that bar and church could be found in the past at every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"There is none of them today."
He said the extinction of bars was understandable.
"People today hang out in a different way," he said.
"Bars no longer represent the living rooms in which people stay regularly."
However, when it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the church leaders think and "before or later will be found again at the beginning."
He added that churches could replace accommodation buildings with apartments in which people who will not help the rest of the churches in the neighborhood.
"A large majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "they will come sooner when these churches will be fully closed because it is unlikely that the residents who enter into those apartments will become members of those churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original white methodistic congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The Black Congregation that held worship in the vicinity took over the property of the building.
St. Martin's church took over a black congregation with Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was headed by a boycott of traders on a bit in the 125th Street, the main street for shopping in Harlem, who opposed the employment or promotion of black people.
The 1939 fire has hardly damaged the building, but since reverend Johnson's masters planned its rebuilt, ordered a series of bells, called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Johnson’s father and heir in St. Martin, proudly called carillon “the rings of poor people. ”
The expert who played on carillon in July used the second name: “Cultural Treasury” and“independent historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first carillon in the world in which a black musician Dionisio A. Lind played on a larger carillon in the Riverside church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What happens in St. Martin over the past few months is a complicated story of architects and construction workers, some of which have brought the Laic leaders of the church and other episkopal dicesis.
Sakristia, the governing body of the county composed of the laik, wrote to the diceze in July because of the concern that the diecesis would "train to transfer costs" to the sakristic, although the sacristism was not involved in the engagement of architects and construction workers sent by the diceza.
Some of the districts complained of the lack of transparency on the side of the diecesis.
A sea dog injured a 13-year-old man during diving lobsters in California
According to the official statement, the sea dog attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while flying after a lobster in California on the day of the opening of the lobster hunt season.
The attack happened something before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV station in San Dieg that he dived with his friends about an hour and a half in Saturday morning when he heard the boy's call for help, and then led him with the group to the scene of the attack to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was an excitement for a catched lobster, but then realized he was screaming: “He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire key bone was broken apart.
"I beat everyone out of the water: 'There's a sea dog!' Hammel added.
The boy was transferred to the San Diego Children's Council Hospital and is still in critical state.
The type of sea dog responsible for the attack is not known.
The rescue team captain Larry Giles said at the press conference that the sea dog was seen in this area a few weeks earlier, but it was established that it was not a dangerous type of sea dog.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the top of the body.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for the investigation and security of the buyers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 types of marine dogs in that area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans for entering the Beauty Market in the United States
Sainsbury's becomes competition to chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic pults in the style of store houses and by hiring specialised sellers.
In the context of a large entry into the UK beauty market, it is worth 2.8 billion. GBP, which continues to grow compared to the fall of sales on the market of clothes and equipment for home, large cosmetic boards will be tested into 11 shops throughout the country and extended to additional trades next year if they show successful.
Investing in cosmetic products is one of the ways in which supermarkets try to use space on shelves that were once predicted for TVs, microwave ovens and home equipment.
The representatives of Sainsbury’s said that they would double the offer of cosmetic products to 3000 products, including the first time the trademarks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing assortiman of L’Oreal, Mogelline and Burt's Bees will get more space with areas for certain trademarks similar to trades like Boots.
Supermarket also restarts its asortiman decorative cosmetics Boutique, so most products will be suitable for vegans, and that is what younger customers are looking for more.
Furthermore, Fragrance Shop's parcel trader will test the concessions in two Sainsbury's store, the first one that last week opened in Croydon in southern London and the second opening in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Network shopping and returning to daily shopping of small foods in local food shops means that supermarkets need to make more effort to attract people.
Mike Coupe, Director-General of Sainsbury's said that the outlets will look more like storage houses while the supermarket chain is trying to resist favourable trades such as Aldi and Lidl by offering a larger number of services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's introduced outlets Argos in hundreds of shops, as well as a large number of Habitats departments because he bought both chains two years ago, by which he claimed to encourage the sale of food foodstuffs and made these acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt of supermarket to refresh its departments of cosmetic and pharmaceutical products has not been successful.
Sainsbury’s entered a joint deal with Boots in early 2000, but it ended up arguing about the distribution of medicinal products in his supermarkets.
The new strategy followed after Sainsbury’s three years ago for 125 million. GBP sold his pharmaceutical job in the 281 Celesiu, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
He claims that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by putting asortiman of luxury products for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks Commercial Director Sainsbury's said: “We have changed our appearance and impression of our departments with cosmetic products to provide our users a more comfortable environment.
We also invested in a special training of colleagues who will be at the hands of the customers and give them advice.
Our marketmark assortiman is designed to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for buying cosmetic products, which will lead to changing old buying habits."
Peter Jones "wretched" after Holly Willoughby quit a contract worth 11 million pounds
The star of Dragon’s Dan Peter Jones left that "cooking of anger" after Holly Willoughby gave up the contract worth 11 million pounds with its trademark to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV trade chain
Willoughby doesn't have time for their household brand and fashion supplements Truly.
Their trade mark is compared to the Goop Mark Gwyneth Paltrow.
The show manager of this Morning (37) on Instagram announced that he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragon’s Day Peter Jones to cook from anger by pulling out of the joint profitable work in order to focus on her own new brilliant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources argue that Jones was "anger" when a golden TV girl during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new contracts worth up to 1,5 million pounds mean that there is no longer enough time to devote to their householdmark and fashion supplements to Truly.
This job was compared to the trademark Goop Gwyneth Paltrow and was to double Willoughby's wealth estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s greatest priorities.
This should have been a long-term investment in the future that would provide it for the next few decades.
Her decision to retreat was intimidated by everyone involved in that job.
No one could believe what's going on Tuesday so close to running the whole line.
There's plenty of goods ready to sell in the seat of Marlow's warehouse."
Experts believe that because of the departure of this Morning show leader, one of the stars in Britain in which it was most costly invested, the company could suffer millions of losses due to the large funds invested in the products ranged from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothing and the possible additional deference of the launching of the line.
And that could mean the end of a long-term friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were ten years close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined them as President of the Administration in March.
The couples spend vacations together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a trademark ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the leader of the ITV show I'm a celebrity.
The source close to Jones last night said "We don't want to comment on his business activities."
Hard negotiations, and then we fell in love
He was joking about the criticism that he would receive in the newspapers for the comments that some might consider as "indecent to the president" and for having such a positive attitude toward the leader of North Korea.
"Why did President Trump give so many resignations?"
Said Trump, imitating the voice of the newsman.
"I didn't give any resignations."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But the denuclearisation negotiations are involved.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore on Saturday, the chief diplomat of North Korea Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the north had not noticed the "suitable" US response to North Korea's disarmament activities.
He noted that instead, the United States has still failed to dismiss the sanctions whose target is further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic attitude in his talk.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"He threatened us with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results – the breakdown of missiles' test launching, the help to release hostages and the return of the remaining US soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to behave as president, but instead of filling this arena in waiting 10,000 people, we'd have about 200 people there," Trump said, pointing to a bunch of people directly in front of us.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the earthquakes in Lomboc, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lomboc population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
"Oh, unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear about not asking for international assistance, so it's all a little troubled," Ms. Sumbung said.
Although the Children organisation is composing a team to travel to Palo, it is not yet safe that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman of the National Disaster Office, said that Indonesian officials evaluate the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to engage in the efforts to provide assistance.
Given the continuous trembling of soil in Indonesia, this country is still sadly unprepared to carry a nature's anger.
Although shelters in the case of tsunamis have been built in Aceha, it is not something common in other parts of the coast line.
The lack of siren for warnings on tsunamis in Paluo, although the warning was in force, likely contributed to the loss of life.
And at the best time, traveling between many Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
The hospital boat that was whipped in Lomboc to take care of the victims of earthquake on the road to Palo, but it takes at least three days to reach the scene of a new disaster.
Improving the Indonesian dissolved structure was the foundation of the election campaign of President Jokoa Widodo and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
However, the state administration under Yokoa fights the lack of financial funds, and the next year new elections are held.
Joko is also facing the pressure of the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members acquired a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fight on the streets by cats, ports and arrows and other primitive weapons.

The Statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest monument that was launched in the middle of the debate on "the end of history"
His persecution would be poetic justice for almost the Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts committed by his fanatic puritanian followers.
But Cromwell's company called Mr. Crick's attempt with "bullshit" and "I'm trying to end history."
John Goldsmit, President of Cromwell’s society, said: “In the debate currently being held about the removal of statues, it was unavoidable that the image of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace became a matter of debate.
Iconoclasm of English civil wars is not something Cromwell ordered or spent.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the past century.
The wonderful resurrection of Cromwell Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the way of thinking in the 19th century and part of the history of the person that many still believe is worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Mnogy consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a parliament defender of external pressure.
Is that an entirely reliable opinion a matter of historical debate that continues.
What is sure is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed a subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a individual recognizing figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements in the role of the Lord of Protection continue to be worthy of honor and marking."
Killer's pig killed a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, pigs attacked and killed a farmer in the southwest market in China.
The man for whom the name "Yuan" was only mentioned was found dead cut arteries and covered by blood near the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou, published the South China Morning List on Sunday.
The pig farmer was about to vaccine pigs in May 30, 2005, in Xining, in the Chinese Qinghai.
Apparently, on Wednesday, he traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province Yunnan to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighbouring pig was open.
He said there was a big pig male in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, the forensic examination confirmed that the pig was weighted 250 pounds to death.
The evening news of Guiyang suggests that a cousin named "Wu" said: "My cousin's legs were bloody and crushed."
The security camera video showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal who killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked in order to prevent attacking someone else while the police were collecting evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market administration are allegedly negotiating the compensation for his death.
Although this is rarely happening, the attacks of pigs against people have already been recorded before.
In 2016, the pig attacked her wife and her wife at their farm in Massachusetts, and his husband suffered the injuries of dangerous to life.
Ten years ago, a pig of 300 pounds scratched the welsh farmer to the tractor until his wife expelled the animal.
After the pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said to CBC News that pigs were not usually aggressive, but that the blood taste could act as a “lapter”.
"They are just played.
They bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show respect," he said.
The remains of the hurricane Rosa brings strong rains to the southwest of the United States
As announced, the hurricane of Rosa is weakening through the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the next day, however, Rosa will bring flood rains in the northern Mexico and southwest of the United States.
Rosa drowned at 5:00 a.m. at east time at 140 km/h, which makes it a hurricane of 1 category, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, above the Pacific is created a low pressure area and moves towards the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baya California halfway Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push a deep layer of tropical moisture towards the northwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical moisture in interaction with the nearing low pressure area will then cause strong declines in the large part of the southwest.
In local areas, 25 to 100 mm rain will cause dangerous floods, mud floods and possible slippers in the desert.
The depth layer of tropical moisture will cause a rainfall of approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in certain places, especially in the parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Even 25 to 100 mm rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially above the largest part of Arizona.
It is possible that bujical floods with rapid deterioration of the conditions due to the spreading nature of tropical rain.
There is no advice to go to the desert of walking because of the danger of tropical destruction.
The strong rain could turn canyons into wild rivers, and thunderstorm plugs will bring local storm winds and dust vials.
Approaching the low pressure area will bring local strong rains on the parts of the coast of southern California.
The possibility of the quantity of more than 12 mm is possible, which can cause less mud and slide roads.
It will be the first season of wet season in this region.
The exhausted tropical plugs will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday late evening and Monday early morning before the end of Monday and cover the wider area on Tuesday.
The strong rain will expand on Tuesday to the area where the borders of the federal states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah will be touched and last all day on Wednesday.
In October, there are huge temperature changes across the United States how Arctic is colding, but tropical parts will remain pretty warm.
Sometimes it leads to dramatic temperature changes at small distances.
Sunday is an excellent example of dramatic temperature differences in the Central United States.
The difference in the temperature between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the summer heat remains growing and spreading again.
In most Central and Eastern United States, it is expected that the beginning of October will be warm from 27 degrees from the Southern Equiples to the parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a great possibility of high average temperatures in the East of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people were watching Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people watched a tense testimony for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of a sexual attack that allegedly happened in the '80s.
Meanwhile, the political account continued, and the rapporteurs interrupted the regular program to notify the reverse at the last moment of Friday: the agreement reached by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, that the FBI will conduct a single weekly investigation of the charge.
Ford told the Senate court committee that Kavanaugh was totally sure that Kavanaugh touched her in a drunk state and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
In a zealous testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was absolutely sure that it didn't happen.
The hearing on Friday was probably followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number listed in the Nelsen report.
The company counted the average number of watchers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no immediately available number of viewers for other networks transmitting the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nelsen's company usually has difficulties with measuring the number of people who look at the contents in the offices.
In order to make it better for you, it's about the audience that is countless similar to the one who watches to play the American football or the appointment of Oscar.
The Fox News Channel, whose guests in the study strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the largest number of viewers with a proportion of 5,69 million during the whole day hearing, reported from Nelsen.
ABC took a second place with 3.26 million viewers.
The company Nelsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.2 million.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the office of that moderate Republican issued a statement that Kavanaugh would vote for the benefit of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning recorded the screaming of the demonstrators when he was trying to go to the hearing of the Court of Justice Committee.
For a few minutes, he was standing in a broken eye while the demonstration cameras of the CNN were putting him up with contempts.
"I stand here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth of this country?"
They said to him: “You have power as many women are helpless. ”
Flake said his office published a statement before the elevator's door closed that he would say more at the committee's hearing.
A few hours later, all cables and television networks monitored live when the Justice Committee was to vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh at the voting of the entire Senate.
But Flake said that it would do so only if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate during the next week, as required by the democrats in the minority.
Flake was partially convinced of conversations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then a few more senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that the Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to approve of Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI investigation against Kavanaugh.

Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the demonstrators defending independence struggled with the intervention police and after thousands of people joined the anti-demonstrations for the marking of the catalonic polarizing voting on the seclusion.

Independence groups spent on Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations from supporting the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but the demonstration was forced to move on the other route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who attended separatist demonstration along with his wife said he no longer hopes that Catalonia will receive independence.
"We have experienced one of the best moments last years.
I watched my parents cry from happiness that they could vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite the key, although the close victory of the regional elections last December, the catalonic independent parties are difficult this year, because their most famous leaders in a self-integrated exile or in custody waiting for a trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanist who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of the police, said that the conflict was motivated by politicians of both sides.
"The situation is increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine catalonic leaders who announced the investigation prison since the end of last year, that he would run for elections for the European Parliament next year.
"European election candidate is the best way we can declare the regression of democratic values and repression that we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.

Menge's hit brought Livingstone victory over Rangers with results 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Menge for Livingston brought a victory
The new Scotland Premiership League Livingston surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to acknowledge his only second defeat from 18 games in the Ibrox Club.
The hit of Dolly Menge appeared to be decisive while Gary Holt's team in a second settled with the Iberian.
Gerrard's team is still without winning guests in Premiership this season, and next Saturday they play against Hearts, the leading club in the League where they remain eight points.
Before that, the Rangers in the European League will accommodate the Rapid Vienna Club on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston has increased his series of victories to six games, and chief coach Holt has still failed since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed the chances against the dead guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead before they got that hit, since their directness in the attack caused a whole series of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke himself, but he was slow on his way to the naked, and then Alan Lithgow could only guide the ball wide after he slipped down to intercept the head of Craig Halkett to the naked.
The hosts were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause the difficulties to the guests.
And that's how a key goal is achieved.
The Rangers missed to stop a free strike, and Livingston designed the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson assisted Mengi who hit the middle of the naked.
Until that moment, the Rangers mostly had control over the ball, but they faced the invasive domestic defense, so the golman Liam Kelly didn't usually have a job.
It continued in another half-time, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the hit.
The golman's legs of Rangers Allan McGregor prevented Scott Pittman, and Lithgow directed a broad blow from another organized attack of Livingstone.
The long adding failed to cross the Livingstone naked line, and no two one-esters were condemned – after Halkett's conflict with the substitute player Glen Middleton and one for playing hands.
“Great” from Livingstone – Analysis
Alasdar Lamont from Scotland BBC in Arena Tony Macaroni
Excellent game and the result of Livingstone.
Everyone was excellent, and they continued to overcome the expectations on that entrance path.
Their style of games and staff barely changed since they returned to large clubs, but the great credit goes to Holt and the way he united the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant on the head of an excellently organized defense, and Menga didn't let Connor Goldson and Joe Worral rest.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards that set up a good game under Gerrard.
They just once opened a hole in the home team, and it's a kind of call for the Rangers in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan welcomed with mixed feelings in Koeln
On Saturday (September 29th) all had a lot of smile under the sky when Turce and Germany leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit to President Erdogan Germany -- aimed at fixing relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed in the opinions on issues involving human rights, freedom of press and accession of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Coelne to open a huge new mosque.
The largest Turkish population lives in that city outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police blocked a mass of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but there was a lot of president's supporters who came to see him.
And hundreds of demonstrators of the opponent Erdogan -- of which a large number of Kurds -- raised their voice by condemning Erdogan's policies and decisions of the German government to welcome him with welcome in the country.
Conflict demonstration reflects the division caused by a visitor some German Turks famous as a hero and others attack as a autocrat.

The prison administration announced that six police officers were injured in troubles in a male prison of a prisoner.
The disturbances exploded in Long Martin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and still continues.
Special Tornado troops have been brought to resist the disturbances that include eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.

And in October last year, the intervention police was invited to prison to solve the serious situation in which the staff was attacked by billboard balls.
The hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City to flood floods (possible benefits for dry areas)
It's rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but there's a chance that this will happen at the beginning of the next week when the hurricane of Ross through the remaining forces cross the Desert Southwest and brings the danger of buic floods.
The National Hydrometeoroological Service has already issued warnings about bujical floods for Monday and Tuesday in the West Arizona area, across South and East Nevada, South East California and Utaha, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should come close to Phoenix late on Monday with rain and cross it on Tuesday.
The National Hydrometeoroological Service in Phoenix in its Tweet stated that “only ten tropical cyclones brought tropical storm or depression within 320 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
The hurricane of Katrina, 1967, passed 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest model of the National Centre for Hurricane foresees 50 to 100 mm of declines, with isolated amounts up to 150 mm on the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
In other areas of the Desert Southwest, including the Stone and the Great Pool, there is a probability of 25 to 50 mm decline, with possible isolated total amounts up to 100 mm.
For those outside the danger of the floods, Rosa could come as a rescue because the region was hit by drought.
Although the floods are a great danger, part of these destructions could be useful because the jugowest government of drought.
"In the U.S. dry map, a little more than 40% of Arizona was affected by at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com announced.
The hurricane trip first approached the coast along the Mexican Peninsula Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the power of hurricane with the maximum wind speed of 130 km/h and was 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving north at 20 km an hour.
The storm encountered the coldest waters of the Pacific and thus weakened.
Therefore, Monday afternoon or evening is expected to be near the coast of Mexico by the force of the tropical storm.
The rain on the parts of Mexico could be strong and constitutes a significant danger from a flood.
"The total quantity of the turkeys expected in the area from Baja California to Northwest Sonore is 75 to 150 mm, possible maximum 250 mm," said the weather.com.
Rosa will then head north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early in Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and South Utah until Tuesday late evening.
"The main danger that is expected from Rose or her remains is very strong rain in Baya California, northwest of Sonora and in the US Southwest," the National Centre for Hurricane said.
The rain is expected to cause the life of dangerous floods and floods of mud in the deserts and slippers in the mountain area.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: four people arrested for attempting murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-olds were arrested for suspicion of attempting a murder after a 16-year-old in Summerset was found in Summerset.
About 04.00 BST on Saturday in Excelsior Terracea in Midsomer Norton was found an injured teenager.
He's taken to the hospital, and he's stable.
Avon and Somerset's police administration announced that 17-year-old, 2 18-year-old and 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the area of Radstock.
The police officers have invited everyone who has a recording of the events.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh suffered anger and anger of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to reject the cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at the Wheeling pre-electoral meeting in Wheeling, Western Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "has suffered anger and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination procedure.
On Thursday, Kavanauh testified before the Congress and strongly and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's accusations of sexual assault decades ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at the hearing of the accusation she filed.
The president said on Saturday that that day "the American people saw the brilliantness, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The voice for confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, the judge with an integrity career in public service," he said to the collected supporters in Western Virginia.
The President touched Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke of the importance of the Republicans' elections at half the presidential mandate.
"Five weeks divides us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I am," he said.
That's why I'm fighting for brilliant candidates everywhere."
Trump stated that the democratic mission was to "generate resistance and obstruction".
The assistant of the Republicans' leadership said to CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected on Friday the latest.
Hundreds of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunamia, and the number continues to grow
The competent bodies stated on Saturday that at least 384 people suffered death, from which a large number of of them took away the huge waves that hit the coast when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island Sulawesi.
Thousands of people gathered at the beach festival in Palo on Friday when the waves of height up to six meters in the dark, dragging many of them to death and ruining everything on their way.
Cunami followed after the magnitude 7-5.
"When there was a cunamian danger yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't run immediately and were killed," said Sutop Purwo Nugroho, speaker of the Indonesian Agency to mitigate the consequences of the BNPB disaster at a press conference in Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he dragged cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said and added that the tsunami crossed open sea at 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
"Some people climbed into trees to escape the cunamis and survived," he said.
About 16.700 people were evacuated in 24 centres in Palou.
The air photographs published by the catastrophic agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and broken bridges and the mosque surrounded by water.
The later strikes continued to strike that coast city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could have been felt in the area where 2,4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Appliance Agency (BPPT) announced in its statement that the energy released by a giant earthquake on Friday was compatible with the two-fold force of the atomic bomb thrown in Hiroshim in World War II.
It states that the geographical position of the city at the end of the long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of cunamic.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 are considered missing.
According to Nugroh’s words, the number of victims and damages may be greater along the coast of 300 km north of Palua, in the area called Donggala and closer to the epicentrum of earthquakes.
"The communications are completely interrupted and we have no information from Donggal."
"In this area more than 300,000 people live," says the Red Cross announcement which adds, and that staff and volunteers have moved to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could be much worse," the statement states.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for non-employment of information that the tsunami hit Palo, although officials claim to have arrived the waves at the moment the warning was issued.
In the amateur video divided on social networks, you can hear a man on the upper floor of the building panicly warns people down on the street about the coming tsunami.
In a few minutes, the water wall fell down on the coast, carrying with him buildings and cars.
The Reuters agency could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused electricity disappearance that caused the discontinuation of communications around Paloo, which made it difficult for the competent to coordinate rescue actions.
According to the competing troops, they started sending cargo aircraft with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still needed food and other necessary estate.
The city airport is reopened only for humanitarian activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centres in Paloo on Saturday.
Cunami in Indonesia took over 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"Although the staff of the World Vision of Donggala has successfully arrived in the city of Palo where the employees have been placed in the tarpoulin tents at the yard of their office, they have forwarded the scenes of destruction on the road," Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw numerous destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched wheels of help in the disaster, some have complained that foreign humanitarians with great expertise had been disabled from arriving in Palo.
According to the Indonesian regulations, the financing, supply and employment of staff from other countries can only begin if the scene of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Ariani, speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'Okay, it's a national disaster' we can receive international assistance, but such a situation has not yet been declared."
When the second night of the earthquake and tsunamis on Friday, friends and families of those who still consider themselves missing still hoped that their beloved would be one of those miracles that mitigate the black scenarios of natural disasters.
Saturday, the boy was saved from the sewer.
On Saturday, saviors released a woman who was trapped two days under ruins next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian State Paraglaiders team, trained two missing paraglaiders for Asia games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those in Roa Roa Roa, including Peter Mandagi, were his students.
"Because of many years spent in paraglaiding, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled that after the news about the destruction of Roa Roa Roa, who expanded to the paraglajder community, he desperately sent messages to the competitions from Paloo who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a grey quack, instead of with two blue quacks.
"I think that means that the messages are not delivered," he said.
Thieves took 26.750 US dollars during the charge of bankomats in Newport Centre on the Levee
The thieves stole 26,750 dollars from Brink's employee who filled a bankomat in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, says a press release for the Newport police administration.
Detective Dennis McCarthy said that the car driver was emptying a bankomat in a fun complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy with that, the other man "in the race came to Brink's employee behind his back" and stole a bag of money that was to be put into the bankomat.
The witnesses noticed a number of suspicious people running from the scene of stealing, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Everyone who has any information about their identity should contact the Newport police on number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes the name in Ye
Raper Kanye West will change the name in Ye.
On Saturday published on Twitter in which he announced that change, he wrote: “Live will be officially known as Kanye West. ”
West (41) has a name Ye for a while and used it as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change comes in front of his visit at the Saturday Night Live show that it is expected to launch its new Yandhi album.
The emission authors said he replaced Ariana Grande's singer in the show, who canceled for "emotional reasons".
Besides the shortness of his current art name, West said earlier that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe that the word 'ye' is most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ye'," West said earlier this year in the discussion on the title of his album with the Radio Leader Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it's us.
It came from Kanya, which means “one”, in only Ye – it is a reflection of good, bad, confused, everything in us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are."
He's one in a series of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
And the former West's associate, Jay-Z, played with the versions of his name without a draw and a draw, and a large letter written.
Mexican AMLO promised not to use the army against citizens
The candidate for the Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military force against citizens while the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody revenge over students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday on the Tlatelolco Square that "he will never use the army against the Mexican people."
Military troops fired during peaceful demonstrations on that square on October 2, 1968 and killed 300 people at the time the left student movements began to spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador committed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support for those who study and opening a larger number of free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education is attracting young criminal gangs.
United States should double investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
"Because China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount invested in research in this area," the investor in artificial intelligence and expert for this area of Kai Fu Lee who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment followed after the various parts of the US government announced plans on artificial intelligence, although the United States in principle lacks a formal strategy on artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal was to become the first country by 2030 by AI innovation.
"Double increase in the research budget in artificial intelligence would be a good start, since all other countries are far behind the United States and are looking for the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"Double increase in investment could double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will come to the United States," Lee said this week in the CNBC interview.
Lee, whose book: “AI velesile: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order”, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's publishing house, the chief director of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of the most emphasized AI companies in China, Face++.
The 80s of the past century, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, worked on the AI system that won the best American player of the game Othello, and later was director at the Microsoft Research Division and the President of the Chinese Department of Google.
Lee commended the previous technological competitions of the US government, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next time will be held to find new visioners.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, but corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired the brightest minds from the university to work on researching artificial intelligence over the past years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the United States to stimulate its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that doctors in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards," he said.
The Chinese State Council published the Art Intelligence Development Plan of the next generation in July 2017.
"The Chinese National Science Fund provides financial resources to persons in academic institutions like the National Science Fund and other state organizations provide financial resources to American researchers, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established the Joint Intelligence Centre, whose purpose is to include partners from the activities and the academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to NSF, he currently invests more than 100 million US dollars a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, the American legislation that wanted to establish the National Security Commission on Art Intelligence has not been doing anything for months.
Macedonians vote at a referendum on the change of their country's name
Macedonia's citizens voted on Saturday's referendum on whether they would want to change their country's name to "Republic Northern Macedonia". This is a move that could solve the dispute with Greece that lasts for decades and which has blocked the opening of negotiations for accession to the European Union and NATO.
In Greece there is a province called Macedonia and Greece claims that the name of her north neighbour is the ownership of its territory and has invested a veto to enter the country in NATO and the EU.
Two governments agreed in June about the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonian Slovenian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote at the referendum, and the voting boycott campaign has questioned whether the output would fill the minimum 50 per cent necessary in order to make the referendum valid.
The issue on the referendum voting list was: "Are you for membership in NATO and the EU with accepting agreements with Greece?"
The applicants of the names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price worth paying to Macedonia, one of the countries emerging after the breakdown of Yugoslavia, has allowed access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonia to live freely under the cover of the European Union, because that means safer lives for all of us," Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje said.
Although the outcome of the vote was not legally binding, enough members of Parliament said they would respect it in order to be considered decisive.
Change of names requires a two-third majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that unregularities were not reported until 13 hours.
However, the output was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters were voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gose Tanevski, a voter from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and Dusko's son, joined the country's referendum on September 30th 2018 in Strumica, opening the way to join NATO's alliance and the European Union.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov in front of the parliament in Skopje set a small stage and received chairs in front of the tents set by those who bounce the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the elevated heads, not as servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to receive us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring so much necessary investment to Macedonia, a country where unemployment rate exceeds 20 per cent.
"I believe that the major majority will support the referendum, since more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the "positive" result would be "the confirmation of our future".
The survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute shows that between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters will access the referendum, which is under the necessary response.
The second survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV showed that 57 percent of the respondents intends to vote on Sunday.
From that number, 70 percent said they would support the referendum.
In order to make the referendum successful, the output must amount to 50% plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious strike to the pro-west government policy since it took the mandate in May last year.
Look: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero is going through the entire defense of Brighton to achieve a hit
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England, broke Brighton's defense and for Manchester City won with results 2 : 0.
Aguero made the victory crazy simple, reaching a hit in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received adding in the middle of the field at the beginning of the attack.
He broke through three Brighton's defense players and then arrived in open territory.
Aguero was then surrounded by four opponent players in green shirts.
He circled a defenseman, and then he got over a few more on the edge of Brython's space.
Then he added the ball to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker from the first attempt returned the ball to Aguer who put the right balls into the right side of the network and defeated the Brython gateman Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some difficulties with the foot," the journalists reported the Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola.
"We planned to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're happy he's got a hit at that point."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Bluesima initial advantage in the struggle of the Prime Minister of League.
That shot was reached in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's field during this game.
He beautifully added the ball to Leroy Sane along the left side.
Sane pushed the ball several times before sterling to the stativa.
The Sky Blues attacker put the ball in the net net before slipping into the car.

Scherzer wants to disable Rockies' progress
Since the Nationals players were eliminated from the surveillance, there was no too much reason to insist on a new start.
But always the contestant Scherzer hopes for a weekly victory against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies, who have the advantage of one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West, reach in the winning.
Rockies won from 5 : 2 over the Nationals at least provided a place in the wild-card ending, but they hoped to win their first title on Friday night.
"If we play for nothing, we can at least throw out knowing the atmosphere here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I would testify this year.
Why don't I want to compete in that?"
Nationals still have to publish a Sunday launcher, but they are apparently willing to offer Scherzer to play.
Scherzer, who will make his 34st start, warmed up on Thursday in the threshold space and will play Sunday when he usually rests.
The right man from Washington in this season has achieved the results of 18 : 7, the average of the winned runs (ERA) from 2,53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-third changes.
Trump at a meeting in Western Virginia
During the talk on the importance of the release of the Republican voters to the general elections, the President commented on his choice of Brett Kavanaugh for the judge of the Supreme Court.
"All we have done will be tested in November.
There's five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the great, big - I didn't run, but I'm actually in a race and that's why I'm everywhere, to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continues: "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of democrats, you see it happens right now.
Their intention is to reconsider government in any way; you see evil, corruption.
They don't care whom they have to hurt, whom they have to strike in order to take control and control; therefore they want authority and control; we will not give them."
Democrats say they have a mission to "cover and distract".
"You have seen this in the last four days," he said, calling democrats "anger, evil, corrupt and liar."
He addressed the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein from the Senate Justice Committee by name, which caused a loud disrespect of the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document go public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for a document -- it was really a bad body speech, the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer considers different opinions.
Do not tolerate personal opinions
I wasn't surprised when the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censure me.
Finally, I am the last in a series of representatives of the Laburist Party who have been told that they are not welcome – and all because we have said what we have in mind.
According to my associate Joan Ryan, they acted similarly because she decisively opposed anti-semitism.
I was criticised in the censure proposal for disagreeing with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, the ironicly similar topics about which Jeremy Corbyn did not agree with the preceding leadership.
At the notification of the meeting of the Labour Party's Nottingham East on Friday, it was stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years during which I work as a local representative of the Labour Party, the meetings of the Main Council on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings have been held in a different tone, and the promise of “neathing, gentle ” policy has been longly forgotten if its fulfillment has even started.
It has become more obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Laburist Party, and every opinion is estimated on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, since associates that I thought we shared similar political opinions from me began to require dramatic change in my opinion and acceptance of views that I would never agree with -- whether it was a national security or a unique EU market.
Whenever I speak to the public -- and it doesn't really matter what I say -- follows a bunch of insulting words on social networks that call my response, which deny centre policies and tell me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know that I've had more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments that I've received are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and determination of colleagues who daily face the lavine of sexistic or racist comments, but never fail.
One of the aspects of this political era that disappointed me most is tolerating an insulting speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Laburist Party should promote the culture of tolerance.
The reality tells us that we no longer consider different opinions and that, with every suggestion of confidentiality or changing the election rules, we become a more disadvantaged party.
They've advised me many times in the last two years to move my head, not to be so loud, and to tell me that it's gonna be all right."
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Laburist Party as a student 32 years ago, motivated by ignoring the government Margaret Thatcher, who left my school class of multi-purpose destruction, I wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most – either as a local council or minister in the government.
I've never hid my policy, nor in the last elections.
No one in the Nottingham East could have been misleading about my political positions and disagreement areas with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at the moment the country grabs Brexit that will negatively reflect on households, companies and public services, I do not understand the desire to lose time and energy to my loyalty to the leadership of the Labourist Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my election units, whether it is about the members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat by revoking or political benefit will distract me from acting as I think is in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 Unbelievable Ayr goes upstairs
Two late attempts may have somewhat affected the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this extremely interesting game of the Tennent's Premiership League.
Now they're on the top of the ladder and they're the only unbelievable of ten teams.
Finally, the top defense and better exploitation of opportunities led them to win, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
"They have already tested us on every game and we are still unbelievable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose Club said: “Everything to Ayra, they have used opportunities better than us. ”
The attempt of Grant Anderson in 14 minutes, which was implemented by Frazier Climo, led Ayr to lead, but the yellow card for the Scotch player Rory Hughes, who was excluded from the game of Warriors, allowed Melrose to raise the results, and Jason Baggot used an unrealized attempt.
Climo has increased the leadership of Ayra by a 11-ester before, at the very half-time time, he has reached a hit and implemented an independent attempt to change the result for Ayra at 17 : 5 in the eye of the break.
But the second half - time Melrose began well, and the attempt of Patrick Andersson, who realized Baggot, reduced the advantage of five points.
Then there was a long break because of a serious injury of Ruarid Knott, who was taken on the carriers, and when the game continued, Ayr continued a good game by attempting Stafford McDowalle, who implemented Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson then got the yellow card and Melrose rebuild the additional player to pay, and that unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The side player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to destroy the Clima who had no ball; from a line for a punishment, MacPherson took a position behind Ayr in the full wave of a probe.
Climo realized that he did it almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe received a high hit by David Armstrong and sent a side player Gregor Henry in the fifth attempt of the home team.
The star of the Still Game series seems ready for a new career in restaurant activity
Ford Kiernan, a series star Still Game, seems ready to continue working in service activities after it was discovered that he was appointed director of the licensed restaurants company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the favorite BBC series whose scenario and one of the stars, along with a long-year comic partner, Greg Hemphill.
The two people announced that the next ninth season will be the last one to show, and it seems Kiernan plans to devote life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although one source for Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan wanted to be involved in "a growing restaurant activity in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours," Bolivia, who has no way out to the sea, hopes that the court will grant her an exit to the Pacific
Navy patrol the marine center filled with elevators in La Paz.
A flag of ocean color has been reported in public buildings.
The sea bases from the lake Titicaca to Amazona are a wingman: “We have the right to sea.
It's our duty to return it."
In the entire Bolivia, which has no seaway, the memory of the lost sea coast for Chile during the 19th century conflict with resources is still alive – just like the desire to re-swim through the Pacific.
While Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice, expected on October 1st, after the five-year procedure, and hopes may be at the highest level in the past few decades.
"Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, optimisticly expects the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
The crowd of Bolivians throughout the country will look at the International Court of Justice's judgment on large screens and hope that the Hague court will decide in favour of the Bolivian opinion that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate the withdrawal of the sovereign exit to the sea of Bolivia.
Here's Morales, the Bolivian Carismatic President who faces a controversial battle in order to be re-elected next year, can also benefit from the judgment on Monday.
"We are near the return of the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will judge in favour of Bolivia and that there would be little changes if it were.
The United Nations body with the Netherlands has no authority to allocate the Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The verdict of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the final hearing means that the case was not "complicated", said Paz Zarate, Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting the interests of Bolivia, the last four years may have returned them.
"The question of access to the sea has adopted the current Bolivian leadership," Zarate said.
Morales' war rhetoric buried every good will of Chile, he thinks.
Bolivia and Chile will continue a dialogue at one point, but after this, it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
These two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in Hague, disagrees with the view that the court made an unusual decision quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring a "incredible opportunity to start a new period in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "close 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denyed that Morales -- still one of the favorite presidents in Latin America -- used the maritime issue as a political stack.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea said there would be no nuclear disarmament if she couldn't trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be nuclearly disarmed unless he could trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He invited the United States to keep the promises of the day during the meeting of the leaders of these two opponent countries in Singapore.
He directed comments at the moment the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appears to have a tendency to restart diplomatic discussions on nuclear issues, which comes over three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Una.
Ri said sanctions continued because of "free imagination" and the opposition of the United States to the declaration of the end of Korean war will never throw North on the knees.
Washington is not inclined to support the declaration without Pjongjang first to take concrete disarmament steps.
Kim and the President of the U.S. Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting at the top.
However, scepticism is widely present about the serious intention of Pyongyang to renounce the arsenal that this country is likely to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
Paris' fashion magazines reveal that the last line of large covers for the head on the road to a luxury trade in your neighborhood.
If you want to improve your collection of hats or fully cover the sun, don't look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a line of distracted large covers for their spring and summer collection in 2019 and admired the style fans in Paris Week Mode.
Extremely irregular hats this summer they blew Instagram, and these designers sent their creatives that attract attention to the flight.
The example that was highlighted was designed by Valentino, and it was a large begging hat decorated by a wide circuit like a feather that completely "whispered" of the model's head.
Other glomaz supplements included jewelry, wizard hat, and even ananas, but these supplements are not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also presented the collection of bizarre masks – dark in time for Halloween.
Many red masks had sewed lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than parts of high mode.
One creative was like a diving suit with a breathing and a mask, and the other looked like a drilled ice cream cream.
If you follow a big fashion - happiness is on your side.
Stilists predict that the huge hats could come to luxury stores in your neighborhood.
The huge hats are perfectly fitted with the "La Bomba", broken hat with a wide range of approximately 60 cm, which was seen on many famous and famous persons, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cultural trademark behind an extremely irregular hat that succeeded in social networks on the fashion track has sent another large creation — a powdered beach bag as much as a model in a bathing costume that was wearing.
The exhausted orange bag of rafia, decorated by rafia and white skin lunch, was an exhibition instance in the summer collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera for 2019 in Paris Week Mode.
The list of famous and famous, Luke Armitage, told F.S.A.: “I expect large hats and bags for beach in luxury shops for the next summer. Since the designer left such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large fashion supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills the citizens of the world need
Scotland's independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of extraordinary results of the examination, and the additional weight of it gives individual and common success in sports, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools representing the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are trying to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aimed at preparing students for further education and high education, career they want and make them citizens of the world.
As a educational sector that can design and implement the school course, we see that modern languages continue to be the favorite and desirable object chooses in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language that understands, it goes into his head.
If you speak to him in your mother's tongue, it goes into his heart."
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot only use English if we want to build confidence and relations with people from other countries.
The latest results of the final exams this year show that the most linguistic evaluations have been achieved by students of independent schools.
Total 68% of students who learned foreign languages received excellent evaluations.
The data collected in 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received excellent evaluation for the mandarin language, while 72% of the students learning German, 69% of students learning French and 63% of students learning Spanish also received the highest possible evaluation.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Today, Languages as Electoral Subjects are considered as important as STEM items (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the course of independent schools, as well as in other places.
The United Kingdom Employment and Skills Survey, held in 2014, revealed that 17% of employers cannot fill their jobs because of the lack of workforce with language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly impetus for the preparation of young people for careers.
Since more jobs are required to learn languages, the skills are key in the globalized world.
Regardless of the choice of career, people who have learned to speak foreign language in the future will feel the advantages of such long-term skills.
A person speaking more languages can communicate directly with strangers, which gives it the advantage of competitiveness.
According to a YouGov study in 2013, in which more than 4000 adults participated, 75% of those in the United Kingdom knows the foreign language well enough to communicate on it, and the French is the only language that speaks a double percentage of the questionnaires, more than 15% of them.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for today’s children.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good employment.
In Scotland, every school offers various languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their programme, while others will decide languages that are considered to be the most important in the United Kingdom in 2020, for example mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, independent schools will always have a variety of choices, as well as teachers who are professional in this area.
Scotland’s independent schools enable children to prepare and arm the skills needed for success, regardless of the future.
It cannot be ignored the fact that in today's global business knowledge of languages is very important for the future of each country so that it must also reflect on education.
So the knowledge of modern languages should indeed be seen as “international communication skills. ”
Independent schools will continue to offer a choice of languages, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Council of Scottish independent schools
LeBron will play in Lakers' dress for the first time on Sunday in San Diego.
The fans will soon welcome LeBron James's first show for Lakers from Los Angeles.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would play in the first seasonal game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still don't know how many minutes they're going to play.
"For more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton told the Laukers official page.
The rapporteur of Lakers Mike Trudell published a tweet that James probably won't play the whole game.
After training at the beginning of this week, James answered questions about his pre-session plans in Lakers, consisting of six games.
"In this stage of career, I really don't need pre-season games," he said.
Trump maintains a meeting in Western Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a campaign with numerous meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five planned meetings that Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not voted yet for the new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the coming elections because there is a danger that the Republicans will lose the majority in Congress after the vote in November.
What time does Trump's meeting in West Virginia start tonight, and how can you look at it on the net?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling in Western Virginia was scheduled in 19 hours after eastern time, tonight, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's collection in Western Virginia you can look online through a stream live on YouTube.
Trump will probably comment on this weekly hearing of a candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh who has caused disputes for sexual abuse.
But the primary goal of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans achieve the advantage of elections in November.
Accordingly, the Trump Presidential Campaign headquarters report that five meetings scheduled for the next week aimed at "promoting volunteers and supporters because the Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the Deputy House," Reuters reports.
"The majority in Congress is so important for the president's plans that they will travel to as many countries as possible while we enter a burning campaign," an anonymous speaker of Trump's campaign said to Reuters.
The tonight's meeting in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from "Ohhia and Pennsylvania, as well as the media from Pittsburgh," said West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the past month, with more than 40 percent points in that country in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate of the Republicans for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey from West Virginia, who remains in the surveys.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to help him improve the rank in the surveys," Politologist Simon Haedar from the University of Western Virginia for Reuters said.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team left the heart on the ground before individual crashes on Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, a couple break on Sunday afternoon may have been exactly what it was about to turn Ryder Cup.
The "Wool of happiness turns" is the saying which is especially worth sport and which sportsmen believe, especially in competitions like this.
Who's the bike of happiness now favored?
"They had six points of advantage, and now they have four. So I think happiness is on our side right now," Jordan Spieeth said at the end of the day.
The Europeans are in advantage with four points, while there are still 12 points to the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in their back and encouraging his game with Justin Thomas, with whom after the whole day, he won three of four points.
Spieth played killly from thee to the green and can serve as an example of others.
The cheerleading celebrations were increasingly loud when Spieth and Thomas reached two points of remnant, and everything cultivated the key path by which Spieth came to unsolved results.
After the way he won the game with 15 holes, a similar cheerleader's scream was followed in which the hope and the belief that the Americans could turn everything around.
"You just need to concentrate and think on your game," Spieeth said.
These players are all that's left now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players who won more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup Sensation.
The European strange, but awesome couple has a maximum number of points and can't make a mistake.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't lose a score on Saturday afternoon, but he also escaped Bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back nine on Friday morning.
This victory series, as well as an incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinaria, shows that they are the only players to win on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two of them who can seal the victory of the Europeans while the sun sits over the Paris Le Golf National.
Maybe both of you will win at the same time on different holes.
But it's too early to talk about the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly hit Alex Norren and Sergei Garcia who had a great performance in the morning's game of couples.
One godey and two double godeys on the first nine holes in the playground buried the Spanish and Sweden in a hole from which they failed to dig.
However, there will be no one to help individuals dig out of their hole on Sunday.
It is fascinating to watch the games of couples close because you can see the interactions of the players in a pair, to hear the advice they give and those that don't give, and to study a strategy that can change at the moment.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far, and on the last day they enter with a significant advantage, but this game in couples also showed that the US team has needed resistance, which some, especially Statesids, doubted.
Europeans on the last day of Ryder Cupa enter with lead from 10 : 6
Europeans after Saturday games in couples in the last day Ryder Cupa enter with a significant advantage over the United States of 10 : 6.
The dynamic duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two victories over Tiger Woods took four points of difference on Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn attempted to win the trophy that had escaped her in Hazeltine two years ago was more powerful than the US team in the morning games in couples by reaching the result of 3 : 1.
The American team has shown greater resistance in couples by wining two games, but the difference in points has already been large.
To win the trophy teams of Jim Furyk, eight points should be collected in 12 single games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first debitant from the European team who won four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after the sensational weekend, only another couple who won four points in a couple in Ryder Cupa history.
After they defeated Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they showed themselves to be superior in the game against Woods and the US debitant Bryson Dechambeau victory from 5+4.
Woods who has not shown the best performance in two Saturday games has performed some brilliant moves, but now he has 19 defeats from 29 games in fourballs and couples and seven defeats in a row.
Justin Rose paused the morning's fourballs so that he and Henry Stanson would return to the game with couples and have been defeated by 2&1 of Dustin Johnson and Broox Koepki, the first and third best player in the world.
The Europeans, however, did not work as a mess during a pleasant day southeast of Paris.
A triple winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday and so set the ladder high to their American team.
First they defeated the Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter with the results of 2&1 in fourballs, and then they defeated Poulter and Rory McLroy with 4+3 in couples after the first two holes lost.
Two times in the entire history, the Ryder Cupa team, which was in the absence of four points, has been able to return in individual games, although the Furyk team needs only an unsolved result to keep the trophy.
After two days in the removal, they seem to have a severe weekly attack.
North Korea announced that there is "no way" for unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister on Saturday, in front of the United Nations, said that further sanctions increase confidence in the United States and there is no way North Korea will unilaterally disarm and give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said in the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, for example, stopped nuclear and missile tests, demonted the nuclear station for testing and decided to stop nuclear technology and weapons development.
"But, we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States," he added.
"If we don't trust in the United States, we have no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way that we will first unilaterally disarm ourselves."
Although Ri repeated the known complaints of North Korea against Washington's opposition to the "progressive" approach to denuclearisation within which North Korea would gradually dismiss sanctions, his statement is significant because he did not reject the unilateral denuclearization of what Pjongjang did in the past.
Ri referred to Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump's joint statement at the first meeting in the history of the current President of the United States and North Korea leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim promised to work on the "denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean war that lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States provided that Pjongjang would be given up nuclear weapons before that.
Washington has also ignored calls for a reduction of strict international sanctions for North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that a denuclearisation be performed before that and increases the pressure through sanctions in order to force its goal and even oppose the "declaration of the end of the war", Ri added.
"The perception that sanctions can throw us on the knees is just a confusion of people who don't know anything about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases the lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention whether there were plans for the second meeting of Kim and Trump, which the President of the United States spoke at the beginning of the week in the United Nations.
However, the minister stressed that Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in held three meetings in the last five months and added: "If the denuclearization was asked South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not come to such a delay."
Nevertheless, the tone of Minister Rio's speech differed greatly from the last year when he spoke to the UN General Assembly and said that the targeting of continental United States missiles was inevitable after the wicked President Trump called Kim "at the time of the missile" on a suicidal mission.
The Trump, who threatened the “complete destruction” of North Korea last year, commended Kim in the United Nations for his courage to disarmament, but added that they were still awaiting a lot of work and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea performs danuclearization.
Trump said on Wednesday that there is no time frame for denuclearisation and added: "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three or five months."
China and Russia have expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongjang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary-General Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue strictly until the full, final and verified denuclearisation is reached."
The Security Council unanimously introduced sanctions for North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stop the financing of the nuclear and ballist programme in Pyongyang.
Pompei met with Rie in the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjongjang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pjongjang in July and said progress was made, but North Korea called him after a few hours for "gangster demands".
North Korea arranged a meeting with Moon this month for the demolition of the missile location and nuclear complex that will be realized if the United States take the "suitable measures".
He added that Kim discovered that these "suitable measures" relate to the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps towards the stability of relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard attend a course to learn how to rest well
A new course at Harvard University has enabled all students to sleep well in trying to fight more widespread learning culture with caffeine and unsleep nights.
The Academy found that students in the world's best university often have no idea of the grounds for care for themselves.
Charles Cheisler, a professor of sleep at the Harvard Medical University and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed a course that he considers the first of that kind in the United States.
On the idea of the course, he came after he talked about the effect of the deprivation of sleep to learn.
At the end of the lecture, a girl approached me and said, "Why did I learn this just now, at the last year of college?"
She said no one told her how important the dream is, which surprised me," the Telegraph said.
The course held for the first time this year to students explains how good sleep habits help in academic and sports success and generally improve health.
The Psychiatric Professor at the Harvard Medical University and the executive Director of the University of Health, Paul Barreira, says the University has decided to introduce a course after a serious lack of sleep was observed in students during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes the picture of a student bedroom on which students need to click on cups of coffee, curtains, tennis and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how lack of sleep affects success and how important the routine of sleep is.
During the class, students also find out how long-term lack of sleep can increase the danger of heart attacks, brain attacks, depression and cancer.
After that, a campus map is shown with interactive icons that encourage students to think about their daily routine.
"We know the behavior of the students will not be changed immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," said Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride on all night learning before the exam still exists, says professor and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that the lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Professor says that a secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality dream. Sleep helps also fight thickness because a lack of sleep affects the brain, puts it into the famine and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, 19-year-old chemistry and biology student in California, helped Professor Cheisler develop a course after he attended his classes at the first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to expand courses to the entire campus.
As the next step, he plans to ask all graduates to finish a similar study before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommends students to incorporate alarm during sleep, as well as during awakening. They must be aware of the harmful effects of the “Blue Light” that emit the displays of electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disturb the circadial rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Mengin gol beat Gerrard's boys
The Rangers have suffered another defeat after Dolly Menge hits the missing defense of Steven Gerrard and finished the game with Livingstone victory with results 1 : 0.
The Ibrox team wanted to achieve the first victory after the triumph in February and results 4 : 1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, so his team now remains eight points in Ladbrokes Premiership for the leading Hearts.
Menga has reached the event seven minutes before half-time, and the Rangers seemed to have lost their inspiration, and it didn't seem to be equal to the result.
While the Rangers now fell to the sixth place, Livingston climbed to the third with only one event of the difference behind Hibernian.
There could be a new problem for Rangers after a linear judge Calum Spence got a head injury when a subject was thrown out of the distance.
Gerrard made eight shifts on the sides, and so he stretched by the Ayr to the semifinal Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same line of Livingstone that Hearts took the measure last week and would be thrilled how his well-designed position suffocated every attempt of opponents.
The Rangers may have had a ball in possession more, but Livingston has achieved more with it.
They had a chance for the event for two minutes after Menga was first thrown out of the game that opened the space for Scott Pittman to move to Allan McGregor's naked, however, the collar missed that opportunity.
The deep free strike of Keaghan Jacobs was intercepted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive companion Alan Lithgow could only forward an unprecise strike to the back lines.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game, they seemed to play with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos definitely felt that the judge should have given him a one-esterian in 15 minutes after his crash with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not respect the Colombian's request.
The Rangers were able to guide only two balls to the naked, but the former Ibrox gateway, Liam Kelly, one hit by the head of Lassana Coulibaly, and the pitom hit of Ovie Ejaria, was not a big problem.
Although the 34-minute game of Livingstone slowed the game, no one can deny their efforts.
The Rangers missed again using the deep Jacobs backball.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson who kept his presence and chose Menga for a simple end of the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly Ryan Kent. The replacement almost had the current effect because the wing player added the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into exactly the game they enjoy, while Lithgow and Halkett had one long hit after another.
Holt's side could have extended its leadership in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a broad trip out of the corner.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton once later asked for a one-esterian because he settled with Jacobs, but Thomson and this time he turned a look.
Almanah: Inventor of Geiger's numerator
And now the page from our Almanah in the Sunday Morning show: on September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and a few days ago ...the day of birth of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactiveness, and from that invention later developed a device known as Geiger's numerator.
The main scope of science since then, Geiger's calculator became also the main spot of pop culture, for example in the 1950 Bells of Colorado film, in which the main roles of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had seemed to be incredible scientists:
A man: "What is this for God?"
Rogers: “It is Geiger's numerator, and it is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these listeners on, you can actually hear atoms that react to radioactiveness in minerals."
Evans: “Look at that, it's hearing. ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that wears his name still lives.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and destroy them
"The vaccine teaches the immune system that as part of the treatment recognises bad cells
The procedure includes extraction of immune system cells from the patient and their changes to the lab
The cells are treated in order to "recognize" protein that is common to many types of cancer and then injected again in the patient
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise bad cells, an egg cancer has withdrawn over 18 months.
The procedure includes the extraction of immune system cells from the patient, their change in the lab to know how to recognize the protein called HER2 common to many types of cancer and reinjecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda in the Federal State of Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine. ”
HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, eggs, lungs and fat womb cancer," explains Professor Berzofsky.
Similar access to the extraction of immunological system cells from the patient and their “science” to recognize cancer cells has been successful in treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after visiting the Saturday Night Live show, participated in the Trump debate and supported it, wearing a hat with the title "Let America become again great."
It didn't go well.
Canye West was acquired in a study during the Saturday Night Live show after the breaks in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for the President 2020.
After he performed the third song of the night named Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat "Let America be regretted," he continued to speak against the democrats and repeated supporting Trump.
"I talk to white people so often, and they say to me, "How can you like Trump, he's racist."
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The Saturday Night Live show began with a satiary sketch in which Matt Damon laughed at the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Committee for Justice of the United States Senate on the claims of Christine Blasey Ford for sexual abuse.
Although she wasn't broadcast, the recording of West's speech to social networks was transmitted by comic Chris Rock.
We don't know if the announcement of Rock was trying to ruin West.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had been thrown behind the stage for the hat he wore.
"They bothered me behind the stage.
They told me, "Don't go anywhere with that hat."
I've been abused!
They said I drowned," Washington Examiner transmitted.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom?" and said that he would wear his Superman's coat because that means that I can't tell him what to do.
Try with love."
The magazine Variety wrote that his comments had caused audience’s disgrace at least twice, and the members of the Saturday Night Live show seemed ashamed, while one person for the magazine said: “The whole studio was silent. ”
West was invited at the last moment as a replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, reper Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
West performed the song “I love it”, dressed like a bottle of mineral water Perrier, amazed many.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the chief of the TPUS Conservative Group, who announced on Twitter: “One of the bravest people: thank you for confronting the Mafia. ”
But Karen Hunter's show manager on Twitter announced that West was simply "he was his own and that it was absolutely wonderful".
"But I choose not to reward someone (to buy his music, clothing or support his "white art") for whom I believe he accepts and expands ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we are," she added.
Before the show, the reper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, saying that he is now "will be officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist who changed his name and followed Diddy's steps, which was also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Reper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the musical legend of Prince had changed the name into a symbol, and then to the artist previously known as Prince.

The star of the series Game of the throne Kit Harrington turned on toxic manhood
Kit Harrington is known for the role of Jona Snow who swords with the sword in HBO's violent medium-level fantasy Game of the throne.
But 31 - year - old actor turned himself to a stereotype hero cat, saying that because of such TV roles, boys often feel that they must be strong to get respect.
In the conversation for the newspaper The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and asked himself how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married a 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie from the Game throne series, admitted that he wanted to face this problem very "decisively".
"I feel very decisive at this moment -- where have we made a mistake with maleness?" he asked.
"What did we teach men when they grew up, with regard to the problem we now see?"
Kit believes that TV, thanks to very male characters on the screen, could partially be responsible for the growth of toxic manhood.
He continued: “What is born and what was learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets and that the boys feel like they have to have these certain characters of a man?
I think that's actually one of the major issues of our times -- how can we change that?
For it is obvious for the boys something went wrong."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not record the continuation of the throne game after the end of the next summer and said "he's done with battles and horses".
Since November, Kit will play a new show of True West author Sam Shepard, a film producer and his brother's robber.
The actor recently discovered that he believed that meeting Rose's wife was the best thing that happened to him during the film of the Game of the throne.
"I met my wife by filming that series, which gave me the family and the future life," he discovered.
Rose's in a fantastic series that won Emmy's award played the role of Ygritta, the love of the Kit character John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/SIDA: China reported the increase in new cases of 14%
China announced that 14% of people living with HIV and AIDS increased.
Health workers say more than 820,000 people in the country were infected.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were recorded only in the second three months 2018.
Most of the new cases of infection are transmitted by sex, which is a change in the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted throughout some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
At the Yunnan Province Conference, the Chinese health authorities stated that the person infected with HIV in this way is almost not.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
Transfer of HIV by sex is a permanent problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been decriminated in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination is a large LGBT person.
Research estimates that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sexual relations with other men will eventually marry a woman because of conservative values in the country.
Many cases of transmission of disease in such relations occur because of inappropriate protection during sex.
As part of the efforts to face this problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV medicines in 2003.
Maxine Waters declines that a public person has given the data on the GOP Senators, calling it "dangerous lies" and "theories of conspiracy"
American representative Maxine Walters reputed on Saturday that her staff published personal information to three Republican American Senators on Wikipedia's websites.
The Democratic Representative of Los Angeles assures that these claims are extended to individuals of the "ultra" of the right wing, as well as the web sites.
"Lying, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The publications reportedly contain home addresses and phone numbers of American Senators Lindsey Graham from South Caroline and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
Information appeared on the network on Thursday and was published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate committee on the claims on the sexual offence of the candidate of the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Information leaked after three Senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that IP address discovering the source of the publications belongs to the Office of Representative Waters, as well as information on the representative of staff member, reported in the newspaper The Hill.
"These unfounded indications are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters continued.
“Article of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false and incorrect indications – is not responsible for leaking these data.
These unfounded indications are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Ms. Waters' statement quickly attracted critics on the Internet, including the former spokesman of the White House of Ary Fleischer.
"This is a mad denial," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that Waters have no temperament to be a member of the Congress.
Someone who's been accused of something he didn't do must not be mad.
He can't be rude.
He must not examine the motives of the accuser.
He has to be calm and consolidated."
It seemed that Fleischer compared Barbara Walters' response to the criticism that democrats pointed to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate contesting against Waters at general elections, also called on Twitter.
"This is important if it is true," he wrote.
Waters stated in her statement that her office had informed the “measurable bodies and order bodies”.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they bear legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire office," she continued.
Film review “Johny English: Again on mission” – Not enough interesting Rowan Atkinson fights spy
Now it's already common in every new British film to look for messages about Brexit, and it seems that it is also in the new screening of the Johnny English Action Series, whose first extension called "Johny English" first shown in 2003 and returned to large screens entitled "Johny English rides again".
Will your own satisfy how obviously we are worthless to become a new national export opportunity?
Incompetent Johnny English has the right to complicate the situation again, while his name is more than anything says that it is a comic design for a wide audience designed for countries where the kinematography is not in English.
He, of course, is a distracted secret agent who despite his bizarre claims to the "solved" glamur reminds inspector Clouseau, has a shift of the character of Mr Bean and somehow reminds the guy who singed one note of the introduction song "Chariots of Fire" at the ceremony of the opening of London Olympic Games 2012.
His character is also inspired by a passenger and a mystery world man that Atkinson once played in already forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard and who is a painting of chaos.
There's one or two hot moments in this latest film edition.
I liked when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a medium-level armor and when the propeller hit his helmet for a little while.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems quite uninteresting and unusually excessive, especially now when "serious" film titles such as "007" and "Invisible missions" offer the elements of comedy themselves.
Humor seems to be aimed at children, not adults.
The assumption that Great Britain is in serious trouble now has already been generally accepted.
Hacker entered the most secret British spy network and discovered the identity of all British agents, the horror of an agent at the duty, who, unfortunately, appeared by Kevin Eldon.
It has transmitted a glass of prime ministerial patience, an overwhelming and warfare character who experiences a total breakdown of the system because it is politically hated: Emma Thompson is trying to faithfully display a character that should represent Theresa May, but has not received material to do anything.
Intelligence advisors reveal to her that all active spys are compromised and therefore they will have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And that person will be unwavered by Johnny English's head and beard who is currently employed as a director of some famous school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: there are several handsome gegas here because English teaches spying in rock's style.
They quickly bring the English to government rooms to an emergency meeting, where they meet again with Bough, a former partner and their eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an excessively enthusiastic commander of the submarine played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is mostly wasted.
And so two members of the Secret Service of Her Majesty who are doing everything completely wrong return to action and meet the beautiful fatal wife of Ophelia Bullett, whom Olga Kurylenko has enslaved.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has fallen dangerously under the influence of a carismatic technical billionaire who claims that he can solve British computer problems, evil Jason Walta, whom Jake Lacy plays.
English and Bough start their exciting journey with absurd and funny events: broken into waitress burn the famous French restaurant, causing a huge mess smuggling on Walta's luxury yacht, and english causes complete anarchy by trying to use the phones for virtual reality to find out how the inside of the Waltina house looks.
Everything is done properly for this last continuation, but as attractive and embarrassing, it still contains a lot of children’s elements.
Pretty central accomplishment.
And as with other movies about Johnny English, I wondered again, can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson the role that would match his talent?
The Laboratory Party denies that she develops a plan that the British work four days a week and will be paid in five days
The Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn will consider a radical plan on which the British would work four days a week and have been paid for five-day work.
The party apparently wants the business chiefs to forward savings to workers by the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and give them an additional day off.
That would mean that employees would have the right to a three-day weekend with equal salary.
The sources indicate that the idea could be "incorporated" into the party's economic programme and plans for the country to be accorded to the interests of workers.
The union convention supported transfer to four-day working week as a way that workers benefit from changes in the economy.
The Laburist Party's high source said to the newspaper "The Sunday Times": "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
"The four-day working week will not be achieved overnight, but it is a desire to match the approach that this party has to balance the economy for workers, as well as the whole industrial strategy of this party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept that pursuit.
Labour Party's spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not a party policy and the party does not consider it."
The Shadow Officer, John McDonnell, used the last week's conference of the Laburist Party to develop his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to abduct power from the hands of the "withouthandless directors" and "profiters" in communal companies.
The Chancellor's plans in the shadow also mean that the current shareholders in water-economic enterprises may not be able to recover their entire role because the Labour government could make "exemptions" on the basis of noticed irregularities.
He also reaffirmed the plans for the inclusion of employees in the company's administrative committees and the creation of inclusive ownership funds in order to give 10 per cent of private company capital to employees, which would earn annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI investigation on judge Brett Kavanaugh's accusations has delayed the final vote on his candidate for the Supreme Court for at least a week and asks whether the conclusion of the agency can influence the Republican Senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility that the FBI would find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Caroline.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said to the debate, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after it was made up to you, and said, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, unconscious, indecisive."
Graham's voice, however, is as if it was in the stone.
"I am determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and it really should have a strong accusation of changing it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett denied everything decisively," added Graham thinking of Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the persons she appointed could confirm her claims.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has he achieved anything about poverty reduction?
This Saturday New York will be host of the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars and equally impressive mission – the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only star performances, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is the extension of the Global Poverty Project project, an international advocacy group in the hope that poverty will end by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket for the event (except if they were not willing to pay the VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "work" such as volunteering, sending e-mail to the world leader, phone calls or any other meaningful way to raise consciousness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful is the Global Citizen, taking into account that he has 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with free concert a real way to convince people that they require an invitation to act, or just another case called “clictivism” – where people feel that signing internet petitions or sending tweets really changes something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims that he has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of his supporters who have been pursuing a series of different goals.
He claims that these actions were the encouragement of world leaders to announce commitments and policies that would result in an amount of $37 billion that would have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
In the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 obligations and statements resulting from its activities, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the Power of Nutrition, the partnership of investors and holders in the United Kingdom, which is required to “help children to develop up to their full potential”, with a promise that after receipt of more than 4700 tweets from the citizens of the world, they will provide $35 million for Rwanda's assistance to end the consumption of food in this area.
"With the help of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can achieve social injustice to become just a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the "The Power of Nutrition", public at the London concert in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5000 actions taken to improve food for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the "The Power of Nutrition" project to provide food interventions for 5 million women and children.
As an answer to one of the most common questions on your web site, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answers: "It will be a long and difficult road ◯ sometimes we will experience failure.
But we will succeed, as did the great movements for civil rights and against the apartheid before us, because we are stronger together.
The shows of Janet Jackson, Weeknda, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae belong to some of the shows on this year's event in New York, which will lead Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy as a "bloc” to prevent Russian energy exports Ö Minister of Interior
Washington can, "if necessary," use his navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, discovered the US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, as said by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that the Russian engagement in Syria is especially where it acts on the call of a legitimate government for research in new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why Russia is in the Middle East is because he wants to sell energy in this area as it does in Eastern Europe, Southern Europe," he says.
But, according to his opinion, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"United States with the navy can ensure the openness of maritime roads and blockade, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendance of the event whose host was an unprofit group of Consumer Energy Alliance, represented in the United States as a “glass of energy consumers”.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less exploitation and fuel replacement," he said, and for Russia it is "producing the same trick" in the economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made at the same time with the intention of Trump's administration to increase the export of its coated natural gas to Europe, by substituting Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
In that regard, the officials of Trump's administration, including the US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project of Nord Stream 2 (North Stream 2), which, according to Trump, has made Berlin "a captive" of Moscow.
Moscow emphasized several occasions that Nord Stream 2, gas supply is worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing gaswater capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, a pure economic project.
Kremlj claims that the violent opposition to the Washington project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the opinion that energy cannot be a means of exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has caused Germany's response that reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German industry (BDI), invited the United States to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third country gets involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German industry (BDI), after a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" the possibility of running for president in 2020, Senator Massachusetts said
Senator of the Federal State Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "seriously consider" the presidential candidacy after the medium-term elections.
During a direct meeting with the Citizens in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about running herself.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which implies a woman's head," she said, transmitted by The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will consider seriously the possibility of running for president."
Warren expressed her opinion on President Donald Trump during the meeting with the citizens, saying "this country is leading in the wrong direction."
"I'm terribly worried about Donald Trump doing our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticised Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On the Tweet she published on Friday, Warren says: "Of course we need a FBI investigation before vote."
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that most Warren's voters do not think that it should be run in 2020.
According to the Centre for Political Research of the University of Suffolk / Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters in Massachusetts said the Senator should not be running.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed greater support to the candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% votes for potential candidacy and 48% against.
The other highlighted names of the Democrats discussed about the potential race for the President in 2020 were former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Beaden said he would make an official decision until January, Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSP Track Palin at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after he signed up in September.
He was also charged with a family violence incident that happened on Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after return, is comparable to other families that feel the consequences of PTSP and other wounds with which our soldiers are coming back," said the audience at the Donald Trump meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem to be silent for her son and other war veterans, saying that "they are returning a little different, returning back, wondering if they have respect for what their colleagues are soldiers and pilots, and all other members of the army have given for this country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and was accused of family violence against a woman, distraction of family violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic condition, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Police Department of Vasille.
18 federal states and D.C. support the review of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that reduces asylum to victims running away from gangs or violence in the family.
The representatives of 18 federal states and the district filed a friendly report on Friday in Washington in order to support the asylum-based asylum seeker, reports NBC News.
The full name of the prosecutor in the lawsuit of Grace against the sessions which the US Union for Civil Freedoms filed in August against federal policy has not been discovered.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang" abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers supported by Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum applicants come from in the United States, as countries facing all-existing problems with gangs and family violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States has changed the decision of the Immigration Committee made in 2014 by which immigrants who have no documents and flee from violence in the family, permitted to file a request for asylum.
The state district attorney of Colombia Karl Racine said in his statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring the decades of state, federal and international law".
"The Federal Law invites all asylum requirements to be resolved on the basis of concrete facts and circumstances of the law, and such an obstacle breaks the principle," the court's friend's report states.
Advocates further stated that the policy that reduces immigrants' entry damages the US economy, claiming that it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
The Chief State Advocate Jeff Sessions ordered judges for immigration to stop approving asylum to victims running from family violence and gang violence in June.
"Azil is available to those who leave their homeland for persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political opinion," the Sessions said in their 11 June policy statement.
The purpose of asylum has never been to mitigate all problems ◯ even all serious problems that people meet every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of victims is doubled in the race for the finding of survivors
For survivors, the situation was increasingly difficult.
"The situation is very tense," said the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, comforting her boy who was shaking in a fever in the evacuation center in the destructed city of Palou.
"The ambulance vehicles bring the bodies every minute.
The government of the poor water."
The inhabitants were seen to go back to their ruined homes, picking through flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
A hundred people were injured, and the hospitals damaged by 7.5 degrees were crushed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a break in his back and shoulder, rested in front of the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated openly due to continuous strong afterwards earthquakes.
The tears filled his eyes when he talked about the feeling of a rape earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was depressed inside the ruins of the wall," Harris said to the Associated Press, and added that his family came to the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "mouthing" by means of "propaganda ads"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published four pages of a long ad in the American daily list that promoted the mutual benefit of the US and China trade, the US Ambassador in China accused Peking of the abuse of the US Propaganda Press.
The US President Donald Trump considered on Wednesday a paid supplement of China Daily newspapers in the most selling newspapers in Iowa, Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere with the US Congress elections on November 6th, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Peking is trying to interfere with American elections marked what American officials in the statement for Reuters characterized as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to do pressure in China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place commercial advertising, Peking and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that led to high import tariffs.
Revenges of China in the beginning of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa who supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador in China and former long-year governor of Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural products in China, said that Peking damaged American workers, farmers and companies.
In the article in the Sunday Journal of the Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China "this abuse is doubled by launching propaganda ads in our own free press".
"With the expansion of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free press by putting a paid ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in a kiosk for papers on the streets in Peking, you will find limited votes of opposition and you will not see any real reflection of the different views that the Chinese people can have on the disturbing Chinese economic path because the media are under strong pressure by the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most emphasized Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper was involved.
Cavanaugh's debacling Republicans have removed the voters before the medium-term elections, the analysts warn
Since many Republicans are standing with a candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh and defending him by several indications of sexual abuse, the analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the existing medium-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions that surrounded this event have been very excited, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to vote.
Such things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell University of Syracuse, for the article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed suspicion that the last insistation of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to conduct the FBI investigation would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday Ö will not forget it either tomorrow and not in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a higher advisor and a national speaker of the MoveOn Progressive Group, said the newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestants sang: “The November comes!”, protesting in the Senate Chamber while the Republicans who control the Justice Committee were preparing to continue with Kavanaugh’s appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of democrats will be beyond all expectations," Stu Rothenberg, non-party political analyst, told the news.
"People say they're already at high level, which is true.
But they could be even higher, especially among women in suburbs and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who, although they don't like the president, often don't make elections."
Even before the public testimony of Ford, in which her claims for sexual attacks were detailed by the candidate for the Supreme Court judge, the analysts suggest that there would be a negative response if the Republicans continued with confirmation.
"This is a real confusion for the Great Old Party," Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, said NBC News at the beginning of the last week.
"It's not only about voting in the committee or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh was sent to a reservation bench, but also the way the Republicans approached all of this and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities Organization, a group that helps to choose democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided about what they will believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more inclined to him.
The new YouGov survey indicates that 41 percent of the investigators are definitely or likely believe in the truth of the testimony of Ford, while 35 percent said that they believe Kavanaugh safely or likely.
Furthermore, 38 percent stated that Kavanaugh believed that he probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same for Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the indications that Ford has made, along with at least one more prosecutor, Debora Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford's witnessed before the Senate's Tribunal, sworn last week that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunk state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for Judge of the Supreme Court showed her genitalities at the party during the Yale study in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web inventor plans to run a new Internet to download Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launchs a new company aimed at becoming a competition to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is developing on the basis of Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose the location of their data storage and people to be allowed to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company, Berners-Lee was kidding about the intention that was hiding behind Inrupt "world domination".
"We must do it now," he said thinking of startup.
"This is a historical moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "personal network data storage" or sub.
It may contain contact lists, obligation lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that the decision of who can access any information completely of the users.
The company calls it "personal reinforcement through data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the chief executive director of John Bruce, is that the company is providing resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform bought by IBM, several engineers who signed a project contract, as well as the community of voluntary programmers.
Starting this week, developing engineers from around the world could make their own decentralized applications with tools available on the Inrupt web site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about whether they would make a complete change in which all their business models would turn all overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In the publication of the Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupta "is a mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect integrity and quality of the new network built on Solida."

Bernard Vann: Praise on the denomination of priests from World War I by Victoria's cross
They celebrate in the honor of the only priest of the English Church, who was depicted by Victoria's cross as a fighter in the First World War, was in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in a attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had received the greatest British military honor.
The memorial stone discovered two of his grandsons on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “incredibly symbolic ” that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's submission.
According to the Official Journal of London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through St. Quentin channel “with a very dense fog and under a strong fire that came from the direction of the battlefield and the machinery. ”
Later, he rushed into the first lines and led the army forward with “incredible courage ” before he rushed without any help to the Polish top and slaughtered three of the military crew.
Lieutenant Vanna killed a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little more than a month before the war ends.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s works were “the things I know that I would never have achieved, and that motivates humility. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid the vein after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that “he feels very honored to participate in the parade ” and added that“ the braveness of the true hero is shown through the support that many people will give. ”
Mixed fighting skills lovers stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead, they got Prastic Peppu
Imagine this ◯ staying awake all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches so that you will eventually be disabled by monitoring the main event.
The program from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in Great Britain, they were presented live at channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, just when Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's match, the Watchers in Great Britain remained shocked when the transfer broke off the Praščic Peppa.
Many were not impressed after only because of the fight, they stayed awake until early morning.
One lover's interruption of the transfer by a child's drawing on Twitter described as "some kind of sick joke."
"In the state regulation, this content is not suitable for broadcasting at 6 a.m., so they had to transfer to the child program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president for the marketing and communications of Bellator when they asked him about the transfer.
"Up, "Leave Peppa."
The President of the Bellator, Scott Coker, said he would harmonize his schedules in order to include in the future viewers from Great Britain.
"When I consider reprising, I think we might be able to fix something," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at six a.m. on Sunday, and we will not be able to realize anything until we have Sunday, when they will be on Monday.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the transfer was interrupted, there were many leaflets that weren't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We're going to keep five fights instead of six † what we're doing otherwise, and we've tried to give more to our fans, but we've overreacted.
These are unfortunate circumstances."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
Tom Daley's olympic jumper in the water says he grew up with a sense of inferiority against others because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to get successful.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to high school, he was aware that "not everyone like me."
In his statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, who runs Lauren Laverne, he said he talks about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also said that the victory of the Olympic Games was less important since he became a father.
The regular leader of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, took a few months of vacation because of the disease.
When he appeared as a wasteman in Laverna’s first show, Daley said that during his growing up, he felt “minor ” than others, because“ it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls. ”
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity against others were real things that gave me power and strength so that I could succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove that he was “one and something, ” so he would not disappoint anyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
Double winner of the bronch Olympic Medal became an excellent person who is in favour of LGBT persons and used his performance at this year's Games of Commonwealth in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he believes he was happy to live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give “nade. ”
The triple world champion said he was surprised by falling in love with a man of the American movieman, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married a scarf, who was 20 years older than him, last year, but he said that his age difference was never a problem.
"When you're so young through so many things," Ö he looked at his first Olympic Games when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later ¶ said that it was hard to find someone the same age and that he experienced similar rises and falls.
In June, they became parents of a son whose name was Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "the whole perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, all the story would be about "I have to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold Olympic medals.
Robbie is my gold Olympic Medal."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 when he was 40 years old after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they got tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the first order.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you won't be here long enough to be in first order," he said.
"I held him for my hand while he was breathing, and only after he stopped breathing and died, I finally became aware that he was not invincible," he said.
Next year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I dreamed about all my life ◯ to jump in front of the home audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It was also an inspiration for the choice of the first song Ö "Proud" singing of Heather Small Ö who echoed in it during the preparation for the Olympic Games and to which it is always embarrassed .
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of the form on a bench on Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Rider Cup game, but he'll have to totally revert the form to avoid an inconvenient turn.
Mickelson, who plays a record 12th time in this two-year competition, sent Captain Jim Furyk to the bench in the Saturday games with four balls and four fours.
Instead of being in the center of action, as he was often for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day in cheering and developing his game on the exercise in the hope that he will correct what tortures him.
Never the most precise player, even at the top of his career, this 48-year-old isn't ready for the demanding field Le Golf National, where a long inequality field routinely punishes precise strikes.
And if I'm not enough frightening, Mickelson faces a precise British Opensco Molinarius, who won with Tommy Fleetwood in all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who start 12 single games with four points less, get to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely key.
Furyk said he trusted his man more than that and couldn't say.
"He fully understood the role he had today, crushed me on his back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"There's a lot of confidence."
He's famous and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't imagine playing two games.
I imagined there would be more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we should do so.
He wants to be in the field, like everyone else."
Mickelson will get Nick Fald's record on the number of Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
That could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup which never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven half-times, although Furyk said his presence also brought some non-material values in the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to be joking with people and he's a great guy behind it," he explained.
"I think younger players were fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great advantage may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of the Rider Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable race.
The Danish debited in the game in Valderrama in 1997, where the team of Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point privilege against the Americans, but the game was completed with their victory with a tight distinction from 141⁄2 × 131⁄2.
"You keep reminding that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a tight difference," Bjorn said in the picture, after he observed the team in 2018, which won the results of 5 Ö 3 on Friday and yesterday by the result of 10 Ö 6 in Le Golf National field.
So history will show me and everyone in the team that this isn't over.
You'll play with full power tomorrow.
Get out of the field and do everything right.
Nothing's over until the floors go on the panel.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and it remains focused on it.
I talk all the time, I focus on 12 players on our side, but we are quite aware who stands against us Ö the biggest players in the world."
Bjorn added: “I would never run before the rude in this.
Tomorrow you should face a different beast.
Tomorrow there are main individual performances, and that's something completely different.
It's great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you're there as a individual, you're on the final test of your skills of a golf player.
It's a message you have to transmit to the players, and she is that tomorrow they have to give the best of themselves.
Now leave your companion because he has to give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask their players to play better individually than they played with fellow players, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points of four.
Furyk himself was at both of those great turns the last day, since he was part of the victory team in Brooklyn before he ended as a loser after Europe performed "the miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," said Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the start as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When this facility goes in a certain direction, it puts a big pressure on medium swords.
According to that, we organized our position and placed the boys as if we were, you know, trying to perform magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead an attack and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the rest of the Europeans in the upper half.
I have decided that this group of boys go in this order because I think it covers everything," said Bjorn about the chosen players for individual matches.
German new warship re-established to wait
The latest fregate of the German Navy was to be released in 2014 to replace old warships from the cold wartime, but will not be ready by at least next year because of incorrect systems and cost increases, local media reported.
The release of the ship “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the leading ship of the entire new fregats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, is now delayed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit reporting a military speaker.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but concerning problems after delivery have affected the fate of an ambitious project.
Four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the Navy ordered in 2007, will replace the old Bremen fregate class.
As far as known, they will have a strong gun, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-blood missiles, as well as some invisible technologies, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods Ö should be possible to lay down the latest fregates for up to two years without return to the maternal port.
However, continuous delays mean that the most modern warships are said that Germany will allow power to be displayed abroad until the moment of entering the ministry, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 fregate last year reached all the covers, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship into use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ship building in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy returned the ship to the ship builder after delivery.
It was a little known about the reasons for return, but the German media indicated numerous key "software and hardware deficiencies" that would make a warship useless if he was sent to a battle mission.
Software shortcomings were particularly important because the ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg will be managed by a crew of approximately 120 sailors Ö half less than on the older fregats of the Bremen class.
It also proved that the ship is dramatically too heavy that reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the navy to add future upgrade.
It is believed that "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7000 tonnes is doubled than ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the incorrect hardware, the cost of the entire project Ö including the training of the crew also becomes a problem.
It is said that the price has reached amazing 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) in comparison with the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems covered by the latest fregates are particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German maritime force is reducing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Committee for Defence, admitted that the Navy is actually "closing out of ships capable of schedule."
The official said that the problem has increased in time because the old ships were placed outside the engine and there were no replacement vessels.
He expressed regret that none of the fregats of the Baden-Württemberg class can join the Navy.
The National Treasury is listening to a secret life of the squirrel
New research conducted on the property in the Scotland High are intended to discover how squirrels use a landscape to hunt food.
There is hope that the results will explain the behavior of these unique flying suckers and help leading future preservation activities.
The study conducted by scientists in the National Treasury for Scotland (NTS) will follow the ordinary and swamped patches, as well as brown long-treated and river mixers in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the slipper during the whole season.
The NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile checks using manual detectors.
Expert analysis of the sound of all videos will determine the frequency of the vote of the slippers and what kind it does.
Then a map of accommodation and a report will be made to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Protection Adviser, hopes that the results will find out which areas are the most important places for squirrels and how each kind uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of working on the management of accommodations, such as the creation of livadas and how best to maintain forest areas for slippers and other connected species.
The population of squirrels in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has significantly decreased during the past century.
They are threatened to build and work on the arrangements that affect shelters and loss of accommodation.
Wind turbines and lights can also be a danger, as well as muholders and certain chemical treatments of construction materials, and attacks of pet cats.
The slippers aren't actually blind.
However, because of their habits of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to find bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of the country throughout the country, takes it very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, shelter inspections and sometimes rescue.
The organization even set up the first and only reservation for squirrels in Scotland at Threave's property in Dumfries and Gallowey, where eight of the ten species of squirrels live in Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says the property is a perfect area for them.
"Here in Threave we have a huge space for slippers," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good places.
However, there is a lot more we don't know about the slippers, so the work we do here and on other objects will help us better understand what they need to make progress."
Emphasizes the importance of verifying the presence of squirrels before starting maintenance work on the buildings, since uninterested destruction of one bed can kill up to 400 females and young people, which is likely to destroy the entire local population.
They are protected and illegal to kill them, torture or disturb or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative of the Scotland Swiss Protection Association, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our slippers and for many of our species we simply don't know how their population progresses. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape claims while lawyers are preparing to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has declared the rape charges against him as "fake news", saying that people "will promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who published these accusations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently then he paid her $375,000 to keep silent about the incident, reported on Friday Der Spiegel.
In a live video that he set on Instagram for his 142 million followers a few hours after the complaint, Ronaldo, 33, criticised allegations as “fake news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," says the five-fold winner of the Golden ball in the camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the work.
I'm a happy man and everything's good," a football player added with a smile.
Ronald's attorneys are preparing to sue Der Speegel for the indications that they called "inappropriate reporting of doubts in the area of privacy," Reuters says.
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the football player would seek a compensation for "moral damage in the amount corresponding to the weight of the offence, which is probably one of the most severe injuries of personal rights in the past few years."
It is stated that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the hotel apartment and the Palms casino in Las Vegas.
After the nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the football room, where it was reportedly analytically raped, the documents submitted in the District Court of Clark in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that "99%" was a "good boy" whom the "one percent" failed.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that a couple had sex, but that he was agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they photographed her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she "scared of revenge" and was worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
Thirty-four-year-old girl says she wants to cancel the settlement now because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the edge of crossing to Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, and this summer he transferred to Italian giant Juva as part of a transfer valued 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will "withever regret" for losing car manufacturers
The UK will "regret forever" if after Brexit loses the status of the world's leader in car production, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "restraining" that Toyota UK told BBC that in case Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnastone, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of waiting on borders in the Brexit case without agreement could cause a loss of jobs.
The Burnaston engine which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis has produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that, if Britain exits from the EU by March at the end of March without an agreement, we will experience the stability of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyotin Director-General in Burnastone.
Other car manufacturers in the UK expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreement because of possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says he'll close his Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is the risk in the supply chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
Toyot's production line functions according to the principle “on time” where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers to the UK and the EU for cars working on orders.
If the United States leaves the EU without the agreement on March 29th, there could be a breakdown on the border the industry says it could lead to delays and lack of parts.
The Toyota in its factory in Derbyshire could not hold more supplies than those needed for one day, they said from that company, so production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that the Chequers plan offering Theresa May for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We want to reach the best possible arrangement that will allow, as I say, not only to maintain current success, but also to use this opportunity," BBC Radio 4 told today's programme 4.
"The evidence does not only Toyote but also other manufacturers show that we must absolutely be able to continue this very successful series of supply chains."
In Toyota, they couldn't tell how long the production could be stopped, but they warned that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnastone for 24 years and who is a member of the union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, after your jobs go away, they never return. ”
The rapporteur of the government says: "We have made a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein could be "continued in another week" as a bid for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh said.
Rosenstein monitors the work of a special lawyer Robert Mueller, investigating the involvement of Russia in elections, the links between Trump's associates and Russia and the eventual distraction of justice by the president.
The question is whether Trump will fire the Deputy State Attorney, and that would endanger Mueller's independence, he has been arguing in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the carrying of wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein refused these statements.
But last Monday he went to the White House in the middle of the announcement that he would just resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he would not like to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a breakdown by hearing the Senate Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation on lawsuits against Kavanaugh, which further deferred a lot of Senate votes.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News on Sunday.
On questions about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not specified, it could be this week; and it could be delayed in another week, taking into account all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to inform the press about everything."
Some journalists would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10th.
Chief Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not the result of adverseness to the "theateral behaviour" of television reporters, although she said: "I will not oppose the fact that they're disturbing."
Then she suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President organizes more meetings for answers to questions than any president before him," she said, adding without indications: "We analysed numbers."
Short talks will continue, Sanders said, but "if journalists have the opportunity to directly ask the question to the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to allow this often, and you could also see it in the last few weeks, and just that you can talk to the President of the United States will replace short talks to the press."
Trump regularly gives answers to questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with guests.
The independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of gathered journalists.
Health Minister writes to EU employees in the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to the EU staff employed in Scotland NHS to express its gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter in a few months before the United States retreat was withdrawn from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already pledged to reconcile the costs of submitting requests for a stay status for EU citizens working in its decentralized public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on retreat have continued, which are moving towards the expected decisions of this autumn.
However, the United Kingdom government also strengthens preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
So now I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
The EU's colleagues, as well as broader, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and help patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie subjected to an emergency operation after head injury
The line player tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury in the Saturday defeat from the Vanderbilt Commodores Club with the results of 31 Ö 27, reports Mike Organ from Tennessean.
The Chief Coach of Tennessee, Rod Reed, told the press that the injury occurred just before half-time.
"He came to the playground line and just crashed," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the ground before they put it on the noses and sent to further searches.
The representative of the State University of Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie left the surgery in the Vanderbilt hospital.
Harris added that there are no "details of type/scope of injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when there was a injury.
Abercrombie, a third year student with two years of toy internship, plays the first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday he had a total of five drops before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 seasons.
Foreign customers will be charged with a higher fee for buying real estate in the United Kingdom
According to new conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged with a higher fee for buying real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless
That step will neutralize the success of Corby's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in fees will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The treasure expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year Ö for help to homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign customers will be charged with higher fees for buying real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless.
This move will be recognized as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters to promise that they will provide more favourable housing solutions and focus on those with high payments.
Increasing the fee will be charged from individuals and companies not paying taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will contribute to government efforts to fight homelessness.
The additional fee collected to the current fee, including an increase which was introduced to other homes and real estate purchased for issuement may also be up to three per cent.
The treasure expects that this move will be collected by 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the newly built real estate in London are buying inhabitants who have no residence in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy their first real estate to be involved in the company of those who have their own home.
Many rich areas in the country ◯ especially in the capital Ö have become “grounds of ghosts ” because of a large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy followed only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in fee to help a larger number of young people reach their first home.
He accused large construction companies to maintain high prices of real estate by taking but not using the country, and urged Mrs. May to give up quota to valuable property in order to repair "happiness for the housing situation" in Britain.
Corbyn announced the proposal for a series of attractive housing reforms, including housing controls and ending with no-provoked delocations.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Ms. May said: “Latest year I said that I would devote my mandate to renew the British dream that life of every new generation should be better.
And that means fixing our failing housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build life.
However, it cannot be proper that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with accommodation in abroad, can buy homes as easy as worthy British.
The dream of owning home has become too far, and the shame of homelessness is still real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland."
The Chief of Sunderland Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is one day to become Scotland manager.
Scotch (42) enjoys the challenge of renewing the Northeast Club, which currently takes the third place in the First League, with three points less than the leading.
This summer he moved to the Stadion of Lights after St. Mirren was running again at the Scotland football championship last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and that always dragged me back.
But that opportunity could still be achieved only if I had been successful in the club management."
Ross' precedents at the head of Sunderland, include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Cania.
Former head of Alloa Athletica says he didn't feel fear because he inherited so famous names in such a big club, after he had previously refused calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me will at this point be measured to whether I will be able to return this club to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and content, this club certainly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club back there."
Ross only completes the third year of his managerial career, after the period during which he was the assistant chief in Dumbarton and the 15-month experience as part of Hearts' training staff.
Then he helped Alloi recover from falling into the third category and took St. Mirren from the edge of falling to the winner of the champion's title of the next season.
And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a real crossing," he recalled taking Alloe.
"I really believed that managing is more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I worked well, earned solidly and enjoyed quite successful times.
But the game can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to get through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and job pressure, but management seems to be the right thing.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, and I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life."

Perfect time for the pinta is on Saturday 17:30, as the research shows
The summer heat wave has increased revenues to British pubs that have suffered from finances, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Data show that pubs and bars have achieved an increase in revenues in July by 2.7 per cent, but the revenues in restaurants are reduced by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from the business consultation of the Office of the Chief Business Book Controller, who gathered data, said: “The continuation of the good time and participation of England in the World Championship that took longer than was expected, meant that July would be similar to the previous month of June, when the revenues of the pubs increased by 2.8 percent, with the fact that the restaurants were now even more affected.
The fall of 1.8% in the revenues of the restaurants in June just got worse in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mostly served have achieved much bigger profits under equal conditions in relation to the losses suffered by restaurants.
The pubs where food is mostly used also suffered from the heat, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to get out for a drink.
In controlled beverages and selling bars, drinks increased by 6.6% during the month, and food sales fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, a RSM analyst for vacation and hospitality, said: “This results continue the trend we see since April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sale in the external market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight difficulties, although the sales drop of 4.8 per cent at the annual level will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
Long hot summer could not come up at a worse time for local leaders in which food is used, and the time will show whether the moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will be given over the necessary rest."
The total growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown of market shares.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales system for the British pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyses data on the efficiency of 47 operational groups, with a total traffic of over 9 billion pounds, and an industrial reference value has been established.
One of the five children has secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents
Research reveals that one of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents and teachers
Study 20,000 high schools showed the increase in the number of "fake Insta" pages
The news has increased fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account showing to their parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, open secret accounts on social networks that hide from adults.
The survey covering 20,000 students of high schools showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Insta" accounts Ö references to the web site for sharing photos.
The news has increased the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a cleaned "main" account to show to their parents, while they have private accounts at the same time.
One mother who met the secret web site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged other words: "Rap me."
The study, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of independent schools, showed that 40 per cent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, of which half admits that they own private accounts.
The chief of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's anxious that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be a "sports vote" in the Scotland Athletic Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scotland Athletic Committee as an inexecutive director at the annual congregation of the administrative body.
Doyle is the most excellent Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those who have sports to use its broad experience gained at the international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that the sports athletic in Scotland will benefit greatly by making it a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to be a sports voice and I hope I can actually contribute to sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won a 200 and 400 meters race in the games in 1996 in Atlanta, from his total four Olympic gold, and now he's a regular BBC expert, after the past ishemic attack, could no longer walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a brain attack a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show if I was going to recover and how much.
It was hard, but he was completely recovered, learned to walk and today for the exercise of agility!
Thank you for the message of encouragement!"
Shared opinions on the Internet on the advertising of a traitor comparing mothers to cows
The company for the production of traitors by its advertising that mothers breastfeeding their children compares to cows that the muse has moved to share opinions on the Internet.
In order to mark the launching of the product that is claimed to be “first silent traitor in the world, Elvie’s company for consumer technology published a advertisement inspired by the ironical music video to show the freedom that a new traitor gives to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a stadium full of seed and cows with the music which says: "Yes, I am the man of myself, but you don't see any tail," and "If you didn't notice, this is not my breast."
Then the refren follows: "Pump, pump, feed the baby with it, pump, pump, pump, the husband of your ladies."
However, the advertising, published on the Facebook website of the company, has caused a controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video record has received mixed reactions of the viewers, and many say that it lights the "great" milk industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and born to produce milk, except for stealing their children a few days after birth," one person wrote.
Elvie's traitor is discreetly fitted into the breastwear (Elvie/Mother)
Another person comments: “Reasonably traumatic for mother and child.
But yes, why don't you use them to advertise traitors for mothers who will be able to keep their babies?"
Someone added: "Attowerly unrelated advertising."
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman confessed that her song was “surprising. ”
"I think this is a genius idea.
If I had another breast, I'd buy one.
Tradition of milk made me feel like a cow.
The ads are a little crazy, but I figured it out the way she is.
This is a genius product," she said.
Another person commented: “This is a fun advertisement focused on mothers who issue milk (often at their jobs or toilets) and feel like ‘ cow. ’
This is not an advertising that commends or condemns the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovers that they were dancing all with discreet traitors placed in the brackets.
The concept of the campaign is based on knowledge that many women who betray milk say they feel like cows.
Elvie's traitor is, however, completely quiet, no wire or pipes and discreetly fits into the breast bracelet, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even exit during treason.
Anne Balarin, a partner and an executive creative director of Mother, commented: “The traitor of Elvie is so revolutionary product that deserves bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between showing women and cows we wanted to put in the center of our attention the betrayal and all his challenges, and at the same time in a fun and understandable way to demonstrate an incredible sense of freedom that a new traitor will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's traitor got on the covers.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Marta Jacobski while she used the product.
Thousands of migrant children quietly transferred to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained children of migrants increased, although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly, and because the heavy rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made children more difficult.
Traditionally, most sponsors were themselves immigrants without documents and feared to endanger their own residue in the country by setting up and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household will have to give fingerprints and that the data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the High Commissioner for Immigration and Customs, testified before the convention that the agency arrested tens of people who signed up for sponsoring minors without escort.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrests were not recorded in criminal records.
"At least 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of the sponsors' household in the country are illegal and most of them are criminal strangers.
Therefore, we continue to search for these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
According to the shelter workers, with a view to a quicker implementation of the child proceedings, officials have introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, which was earlier the standard.
Many will appear through a video conference call, not personally, in order to present their case before the immigration court.
Those who do not satisfy the aid criteria will be deported quickly.
According to the shelter statements and reports that have appeared from the system of the past months, the longer the children remain in custody, it is more likely that they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent failures or attempts to escape.
The defenders said that these concerns were expressed in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, due to his size, it is very likely that the signs of the child's suffering will be overlooked.
They added that moving children into a tentless city without enough time to be emotionally prepared or to say goodbye to friends can cause a trauma that many children are already fighting.
Syria orders American, French and Turkish occupational forces to withdraw immediately
In turning to the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has lasted eight years.
Moulem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the excuse of fighting terrorism, and that "will be treated accordingly with them".
"They must retreat immediately and without condition," he told the congregation.
Moulem insisted that “the war against terrorism is almost over ” in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died since 2011, while millions have lost their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "the fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleaned" from terrorist groups and "without any illegal presence of strangers".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in a war-destructed country.
As for refugees, Moulem said that the conditions for their return were fulfilled and blamed "some Western countries" for "proliferation of irrational fears" that motivated refugees not to return.
"We invited the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicize what should be a pure humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that it will not be helpful to renew Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the war ending opposition.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of the tampone zone in the last large rebel rebellion Idliba has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented the mass attack of Syrian forces by supporting Russia from a province in which three million people live.
Moulem, however, stressed that the agreement had "jassy deadlines" and hoped that the military action would be focused on the Jehadists, including the fighters from the Nusra Front related to Al-Kaida, "who will be eliminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Misstura hopes that he will soon convene the first meetings of the new committee composed of the government and resistance members in order to draw up the post-war constitution for Syria and open the way for elections.
Moulem set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the commission should be limited to "a revision of articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win the second mandate
According to this logic, Mr. Trump should win on the re-elections in 2020 unless many liberal viewers are likely to hope for, revocation and scandal to end his presidency too soon.
In what would no doubt be "the dramatic finals of presidentship ever!"
There are no signs of the watcher's tired right now.
Since 2014, the perspective in the impact term has doubled more than 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nelsen, Fox News has a average of 2.4 million audiences in the impact term, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the MSNBC show "The Rachel Maddow Show" exceeded the perspective of up to 3.5 million viewers in the nights of broadcasting major news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," Neal Baer's producer of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", said the secretary of the government who becomes president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of the comedy and author of the book Only the funny parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking In the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she'd vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He answered: “Because he laughs at me, ” said Mrs. Scovell.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories coming from Washington can define the future of the law on the abduction of Roa against Wade, can immigrant families be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, you're overcome the level of informed citizen when you catch that you've been watching a team of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used sources of "deep background" for his book "Fear", on Paul Manafort's jacket of skin worth $15,000 (a clothing subject full of cheer," says Washington Post) and the implications of intimate descriptions, this, the anatomies of Mr. Trump, which Mr. Stormy Daniels gives.
I, for example, Super Maria will never look at the same eyes again.
"The part of what he does is to see it as a reality show is that you are feeded by something every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director Wheelhouse Entertainmenta and the manufacturer of the show "Player", about the rotating acting set and the daily games of Trump's show (fighting with N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss any of the episodes because you're going to fall behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, in front of his house on the north coast of Kauai Island, it was sunned at 80 degrees (about 27 °C), but he was inside and watching MSNBC and filming CNN at the same time.
He couldn't separate himself from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Court of Justice, and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging on the end.
"I remember when we used to do all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outside money is left in the most uncertain medium-term election race for the Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania experiences a flood of money, thanks to the re-establishment of the congress districts, resulting from two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently restructured circuit of Pittsburgh's pregradary part emphasizes Democrat Conor Lamb Ö who won the place in the second district at special elections last spring.
Lamb is competing against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely compounded with the new 17th district.
The tickets were reimbursed after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were unconstitutionally designed for the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has launched a fight to finance the campaign between the main parties' funding collectors, the Committee collecting funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in widely monitored special March elections for the 18th Congress District of Pennsylvania.
That position was held by the Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won a 20-point district.
Political analysts have given a minor advantage to democrats.
The U.S. matters whether they should punish El Salvador for providing support to China, and then retreat
The diplomats noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Peking, with a small resistance of Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel from Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump's management team.
State Department officials decided to invite US diplomatic mission chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "new decisions not to recognize Taiwan," spokesman Heather Nauert said.
However, the penalties were considered only against El Salvador, who received estimated $140 million of US aid in 2017 for, among others, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including the reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Mediterranean country and high unemployment rates and murders.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to continue to a similar gathering last year, which was considered a progress in efforts to prevent migrant movement towards the United States.
However, by the mid-September, the high administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and thus actually terminated any consideration of the penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for the middle of October, as a sign of the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new serious messages or punishments from Washington.
The spokesman of the White House on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal debates under the condition of anonymity.
Their reports confirmed the external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next thing that is being prepared could be the report of special investigator Robert Mueller on the possible Trump's obstruction of justice, which is now very significant publicly available evidence.
Mr. Mueller, reportedly, has also directed his investigation to whether Mr. Trump's campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of its attack on our elections.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he is preparing to stand back before the voters, and perhaps in the end and to the jury of his equals.
There's a lot of these "if" and I don't want to suggest that the inevitable fall of Mr Truma -- nor those like him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938 the German officers were willing to strike Hitler, just to resist the West and support the Czechoslovaki in München.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter.
History turns around such influx points, and the unpleasant democracy march is accelerated or late.
The Americans are now facing several of these points of inflexy.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since these newspapers reported that he secretly suggested the recording of the president last year and assumed his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we answer if the recent FBI investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite convincing accusations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?"
And above all, shall we vote at the medium-term elections for the Congress that will invite Mr. Trump to responsibility?
If we fall on those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I believe we're not going to fall for the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia deported to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime that was once stood in my Ambassador's house.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me to burn the candles for Sabbath on that table with a cooking cross.
With such heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimist before facing Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers host Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning them over the Austrians, after an impressive remie in Spain against Villarrel at the beginning of this month, will put them in a strong position to be qualified from the Group of the European League.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from showing up in the first season to the season to the remie of 2 Ö 2 with Villarreal, but believes that the Rangers can use this result as a bounceboard for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," a 31-year-old boy said.
"We entered the game, believeing that we can achieve something, and we pulled the point.
Maybe we could finally steal the game, but, generally, the unsolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
Thursday is another big European night.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it's gonna be a tough game because they had good results in the last game, but with the support of the cheerleader, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
Last year, it was definitely difficult, among all that happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now it has a good feeling.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy; training is good.
Let's hope we can continue now, leave the past season behind us and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of fear of pension savings
Despite the fact that the research participants had a clear idea about what they wanted to care, few people talked about it with their family.
About half of Nationwide researchers said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they do not take steps to start a conversation," Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Nationwide's life insurance.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your husband and children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you don’t advance your wishes.
Collaborate with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to take care, because these choices can be a significant factor in the determination of expenses.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay these costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care can include traditional insurance for long-term care, hybrid life insurance policy with monetary value that will help you cover these costs or self-sustainment with your own wealth as long as you have money.
Fix your legal documents: Stop legal battles in root.
In order to identify a trusted person who will supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you can't communicate.
Also consider giving powers to manage your finances.
You want to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure payment of your accounts if you are not able to.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your older parent is in a situation that requires emergency medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Specify details in the written plan to be prepared.
"It's not just finances, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What are the meds?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that plan on your hand."

Threats and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a strong earthquake and tsunamia affected by the Indonezian city of Palo on Friday, officials reported, and the number of deaths was expected to rise.
Since communications were discontinued, the aid officers could not get any information from the Donggala region, northern from Palua near the epicentre of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Paloo after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donghali, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palo is the capital of the province Sulawesi, located at the end of the west coast of Sulawesia, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated his 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit him.
Donggala is a district that stretches over 300 km of the coast in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The district, the administrative region lower than the province, had estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the foundation of the province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nicle mines are also important in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Moralia, on the opposite coast of Sulawesia.
Palo and Donghala have been hit by tsunami several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, he killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donghala.
Tsunami also hit Western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis last years:
2004: The large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian coast, more than half of the Aceh.
2005: The west coast of Sumatre at the end of March and the beginning of April has been hit by strong earthquakes.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees hit south of Java, the most inhabited island in Indonesia, which caused tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: The earthquake of 7.6 degrees hit the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: The earthquake of 7,5 degrees hit one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A tiny earthquake has affected the region of Pidi Jay in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because he reminded people of the destruction of the death earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time there hasn't been tsunamis, but more than 100 people died in the fall of the building.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, which killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for family violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and the candidate for the Vice-President, Sarah Palin, was arrested for an assault charge.
Palin, 29, from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of family violence, distraction of family violence and resistance of arrest, the report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Officer.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in custody of Mat-Su and is retained on an unsustained $500 bond, CTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said "innocent, of course," the network reported.
Palina is burdened by three breaches of class A, which means he could be in jail for a year and be punished with a $250,000 penalty.
He was also accused of a breach of class B, punishing one day of prison and a penalty of $2,000.
It's not the first time against Palin the criminal statements were filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of an attack on his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is right in front of the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of family violence, disruption of family violence and possession of weapons associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her face.
Sarah Palin criticised the veterans in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behaviour to PTSP after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake hit by the Indonesian island Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 degrees caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electric energy networks and communications have been discontinued, and in the next days the number of dead is expected to rise.
The earthquake was hit by the immediate nearby of Central Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia Jakarta.
Societal networks circulate video recordings that show the moment of strike.
There were hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in Paluo when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for a suspect for terrorist attack in New York.
The federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people were killed in a rare penalty that has not been executed in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a truck to rent Home Depot to attack the bicycle track along the West Side road in the lower Manhattan, where he slaughtered the pedestrians and bicycles that were found on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally ” killed eight victims and“ deliberately ” caused severe physical injury, according to the intention to seek a death penalty that was filed in the southern county of New York.
Both of these points lead to the eventual death penalty, consistent with the judicial document.
Several weeks after the attack, the federal major jury of Saipov hit 22-point charges that included eight charges for murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors usually use in cases of organised crime, and charges for violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded a "sensitive planning and prediction," the plaintiffs said, describeing the way Saipov performed it as "nasty, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diega Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diega Mendoze and Alejandra Damian Pagnuccca," said the announcement of the intention.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern County of New York was last processed by a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder two drug suppliers, but was finally sentenced to life prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a federal case in New York, in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after they were convicted to spy for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 1953.
According to the judicial documents, Saipov, born from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of regret in days and months after the attack.
He said to the investigators he felt good for what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone, he was inspired to commit an assault, the accusation indicates.
He also asked for an ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He said he was not guilty of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "approximately disappointed" by the decision of the plaintiff.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty rather than accepting the confession of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only extend the trauma of those events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the plaintiff not to ask for a death penalty.
Conservative Parliamentary Member says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize the national army" during the protest at the conservative conference.
Former Head of the United Kingdom Independence Party said that politicians had to "sense" the pressure" of the euro skeptics because one of the members of the Parliament of Theresa May suggested that it should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative Deputy Peter Bone said to the Birmingham processors that the United Kingdom would have "exited" so far if Mr. Farage was a secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge to which Mrs. May was faced in reconciliation of her deeply divided orders emphasize the torievs of the residue that joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister strives to maintain its compromise plan "Chequers" in the middle of the Brexita entrepreneur, the remnant and the EU.
The allies insisted that it will continue to try to make a deal with Brussels despite the reactions and force Eurosceptics and labourists to choose between its package and its coss.
Mr. Bone said at the "Leave Means Leave" campaign in Solihull that he wanted to "flip Chequers".
He suggested Mr. Farage should have received the title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd have already been out," he said.
Member of the Wellingborough Parliament added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel Chequers."
By expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be undermined.
We want to bring our own laws in our country."
Mr. Bone dismissed that the public opinion has changed since the voting in 2016: "The idea that the British have changed their views and that they want to remain completely incorrect."
Conservative girl Brexita Andrea Jenkyns was also in the process, speaking to the journalists with words: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the wider public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not popular in our party and among our activists who actually were the ones who went to the streets and chose us.
Please dismiss Chequers and start listening."
In a highlighted message, Mrs. May added: “The premieres keep their jobs when they fulfill their promises. ”
Farage told the gathered politicians to force themselves to "sense pressure" if they are about to fail the decision made at the referendum in 2016.
"It is now about confidence between us Ö people and our political classes," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them "this won't pass."
In the message of the excited public, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the edge of Brexita, to feel pressure.
We mobilize the people's army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and we will not calm down until we become an independent, self-governmental, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the residues marched through Birmingham before held a two-hour meeting in the center of the city.
The mass of activists waved the transparency of the Torius v. Brexit after launching the group this weekend.
The Labourist Lord Adonis laughed at conservatives because of the security problems they suffered with the application of the party during the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all technology for the Canadian plus plus plan, for the uninterrupted state on borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
There's no good Brexit," he added.

The Baton Rouge police published information about the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), at 11 a.m., at the ET press conference.
On Friday, they published a murder tape, asking for help in identifying a man from the video.
Sims, 20, was killed early Friday near the Southern University campus.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion after the order guarantees his victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team order would "play a great role in the race".
From his initial position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two circles and called on Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Wettel went to the box first and left Hamilton to enter the traffic at the beginning, something that was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered a circle later and went behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a wheel wheel action, which caused Ferrariy's driver unwillingly to leave the free inside in danger of delaying after a double move in the defense of the third curve.
Max Verstappen started from the last row and was the seventh to the end of the first circle on his 21st birthday.
Then he led a lot of the race while he trusted his tires to reach a quick ending and ran Kimie Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally, he arrived in a box in the 44th circle, but he failed to speed his pace into the remaining eight circles while Raikkonen took the fourth place.
The day was hard because Valtteri was doing a fantastic job all weekend and he was a gentleman who let me go.
The team has done a really excellent job to achieve a formation finality," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body speech.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein's meeting on Saturday because of her insisting that she did not let Christine Blasey Ford publicly a letter accusing the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh for sexual abuse.
In addressing the meeting in Western Virginia, the president did not directly deal with the testimony of Ford before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "wretched and ugly and dishonest".
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the past few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and wicked, ugly and unhonest," he said.
"When you look at publications and leaks of information in public, and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that.'
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you released the information?
Remember her answer... have you released the document public, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let... no, we didn't," he added by imitating the Senator.
Senator Feinstein sent a letter in July with details on Ford's instructions against Kavanaugh and leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein demanted that information came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't let her story public," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep her secret, and I kept her secret, which she sought."
However, her denial did not encounter the approval of the president, who commented on a meeting on Saturday night: "To tell you something - it was a very bad body speech.
Maybe not, but I've never seen a worse voice of the body in my life."
Continuing his defense of candidate for the Supreme Court, whom three women have accused of sexual abuse, the president suggested that democrats use these accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return power at any price.
You see evil, nasty, they don't care who they're going to hurt, whom they have to cross to get to power and control," the words are the president, Mediaite transmitted.

Air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers in the aircraft avoid earthquake
The air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he died as he provided a safe flight with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died, and many have gone missing after a great earthquake that hit Sulawesi and caused tsunami on Friday.
Strong earthquakes continue to affect the area, and many are trapped in ruins in Palou.
However, despite the escape of his colleagues to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job in the Mutiara Airport Control Tower Sis Al Yuffrey, who was hungry.
He remained to ensure the safe flight of Batik Air on flight number 6321, which was then on the track.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was ruining.
He died at the hospital later.
Yohannes Sirait, speaker of Air Navigation Inndonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter from Ballipapan in Calimantan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Paloo.
"Our heart is breaking up for that," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands of people, and the state disaster relief agency says that access is limited to the towns of Donghali, Sigiu and Boutongu.
"The number of deaths is believed to continue to increase, since many bodies are still under ruins, and many could not even come," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the agency.
The waves that reached the height and up to six meters destroyed the Pala, where the mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: “The vehicles of ambulance bring bodies every minute.
The government's poor water.
Little shops are robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "Indonesian Red Cross is chasing the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse."
Indonezian President Joko Widodo arrived on Sunday in Palo and said to the country's army: "Please all of you work day and night in order to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" reports CNN.
Indonesia had been hit by earthquakes in Lomboc earlier this year, with more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now says that one man is missing after an accident in the laguna
The aircraft company owned by an aircraft that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one man is being run missing after all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the drowned aircraft.
In his statement, Air Niugini said that since Saturday afternoon, I can't track one of the passengers.
The airline company announced that they cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in attempts to find an individual concerned.
The airline did not respond immediately to the requirements for additional information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water while he was trying to land at the airport of the island Chuuk.
The officials said on Friday that seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline company reported that six passengers were held in the hospital on Saturday, and that they were all stable.
Which caused the fall and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline company and the American Navy stated that the plane landed in a lagoon near the highway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was very low.
"That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to slip through the water that slipped them to the stream to the exit in the case of the danger of the flying plane.
He said the stewardes paniced and screamed, and he suffered a smaller head injury.
The American Navy stated that the navy who worked nearby to repair the ports also helped to save a boat to surveillance people to land before the plane drowned in about 30 meters of water.
The Air Niugini Air Niugini's safety network data indicate that in the accidents of air carriers registered in PNG, in the last two decades, 111 people died, but none of them were involved in Air Niugini.
The analyst presents a time review of the night where a woman is burned alive
The prosecution ended the case in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analyst of the American Ministry of Justice, witnessed for hours as an intelligence analysis artist.
He described the jury's use of cell phone data to compose a puzzle about the movement of 29-year-old accused Quinnon Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got the location information with a few phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers' night when she was killed, which was contrary to his previous claims, reports the Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin at the time he was with Michael Sanford's friend, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was at Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he “lied because his truck was in Nashville. ”
Another inconsistentity was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The cell phone data indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis, a certain time after Chambers' death, deleted her messages, phone calls and contact information from the phone.
"He deleted it from his life," Hale said.
The defense should start the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.

Another black girl?
New York Nanny sued a couple for cancellation after a "racist" message
The New York Nanny sued a couple for discriminatory cancellation after she received a wrong directed message from a mother called it "one more black girl".
A couple deny that they are racists, comparing the charge with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed displeasure when, at her arrival of the first working day in 2016, she learned that the new nanny of her children, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"NEEE OTHER CRNKIN," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in her wife's message.
However, instead of sending her to her wife, she sent her to Ms. Maurice twice.
After she realized her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in a "worst" situation, and fired Mrs. Maurice, because, as she claims, that their former nanny, who was Afro-American, was badly doing her job, and that instead she expected a Philippine, New York Post, was transmitted.
Mrs. Maurice got her pay for one day of work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice has sued a couple for the reimbursement fees and asks for $350 per day for a six-month period for which it was originally hired, although without contracts.
"I want to show them that they can't do such things," she said to Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination."
The couple replied to claim that they were racists, saying that Maurice's ending of employment was reasonable, because of fear that she would not be able to trust her later because of an insult.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her in a message.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But would you trust your children to a person to whom you were rude, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said that his wife received only two months of birth leave after birth of a child and that she was in “very difficult situation. ”
"You will sue someone who is in such a situation
"It's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still in progress, the public opinion court quickly condemned a couple on social networks, criticizing them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington's publishers were afraid that the readers would not be the same with the bear speaking, revealed in a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in the letter: “It is difficult before the publication to put someone who will read the book for the first time.
It's very fun what we know now about Paddington's huge success."
Saying that her father, who worked as BBC's recorder before a little slippery bear inspired him to write a child's book, was optimistic if his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the edition of the books was filled with happiness and grief after his death last year.
About Paddington, described as “a very important family member, ” she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man and wasn't a praiseman," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it all experienced as some achievement of his own child: you're proud of him, even though nothing of it really is your work.
I think Paddington's success was watching that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington."
My daughter died and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was urgently transported to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nica, where doctors tried to save her life for nothing.
"Nad regularly called to say it was really bad and they believed it would not get away," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad invited me to tell me that she will die in the next two minutes and that I have to say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said, “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The medicinal products given to her doctors to maintain the heartwork slowly lost effect and left her body system.
She died just before she boarded, and then everything turned off.
I just had to sit and wait to know what's going to happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything in me."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was already regretted about the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers -- who were not aware of the temptations she was through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head down, and my tears were all the time laying down my face.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt a strong feeling of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women's messages in grief on the bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost their loved ones because of suicide are working on preventing others from committing the same thing.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at his age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a cook with an infectious smile waiting for a brilliant career.
"Everyone remembered him by his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy."
However, before he died, he left his job because he was in “really dark condition. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found a brother after you took this life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I'm constantly worried that it will have a negative effect. ”
Ms. Davis came to the idea with cards “to make people know that there is someone you can go and talk, even if he is a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a long-year friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sad, depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas he was on the bottom of the day when the children opened gifts, he didn't look them in the eye or wanted anything else."
She said that his death was a big trauma, but they had to overcome it: “All that leaves a great mess in the family.
He's kicking us.
But we will continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs at the end while the FBI starts the investigation.
"I thought maybe we could introduce a little unity if we were really able to get something like what he asked for a time and range of limited investigation," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would "depreciate" in the middle of the rooted party blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republicans want a FBI investigation?
Their disagreement is motivated by the choice of a moment.
The medium-term elections only arrived in five weeks, on 6 November, if the Republicans are not expected to pass well, then they will be seriously weakened in attempts to lead the desired man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush constantly calls the Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes his report?
They will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 democrats are currently sitting.
It's still not clear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break his decisive voice and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
Number of escapes from North Korea's "decline" under Kim's leadership
The number of escapes from North to South Korea fell after Kim Jong-un arrived seven years ago, South Korean legislator said.
Calling on the data of the United Southern Alliance Ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1127 escapes last year in comparison with 2706 during 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors are strictly controlled on the border crossing between North Korea and China and more fees that smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang didn't comment publicly.
The large majority of northern escapes eventually received South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross it than a very protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China of escapes considers illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them violently.
Relations between North and South Ö which are still technically in the war have significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang at the talks focused on the permanent denuclearisation negotiations.
This followed after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Yong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work broadly on the release of the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, accused US sanctions that they had not made any progress since.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and it does not come into account that we first disarm ourselves under such circumstances," Mr. Ri said in the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histerical", says he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court
The opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called a candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh "histerical" and said he was unable to serve in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi commented on the Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't have thought that if she ever acted like that, they would call Pelosi her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally demanted claims that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they both were teenagers.
During the introduction statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and drowning while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling charges against him "grothesque and coordinated blackouts" organized by the liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that she couldn't participate in the work of the Supreme Court, because he showed that he had prejudice against democrats.
"I think he discvalifies himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs. Clinton and Democrats," she said.
On the question whether he'll try to call Kavanaugh back if he's confirmed, and if the democrats get the majority in the Deputy House, Pelosi retreat.
"I will tell the next Ö if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not capable not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court on which he is now," Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh is currently a judge of the Federal Court of Appeal in Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a democratic woman, she is concerned about the potential Kavanaugh's decisions against the Law on Accessory Care or the Law on the Abduction of the Roa v. Wade Procedure, because it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh has overlooked questions about whether he will alter some decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time that a hysterical, side person goes to court and expects us to say, "Isn't it wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Justified criticisms, anger gathered for months and years . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual.
She continued: “The woman who used to be an executive director, who said she was crying when she was mad, but she developed a technique that, when she got mad and started to cry, the one with whom she said: ‘ You may think I am sad because I cry.
I'm mad."
And then she went on.
And I thought it was excellent."
The tears are allowed as a way out of anger, partly because they are basically misconcepted.
One of my most clear memories from one of the first jobs, in the office in which men dominated, is that once I cried about an unspeakable anger, one older woman, a cold manager, who always feared a little, dragged me to the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they'll be happy because they'll think they'll hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congresswoman from Colorada, worked with Gary Hart at his presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an outside affair on the Monkey Business ship and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, she concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider the idea of running for the president.
"It was not a well-designed decision," she told me in the laughter 30 years later.
"The race has already been seven candidates, and they certainly didn't need one more.
Someone called them Snow and Seven Dwarves.
Since the campaign was already out, it was delayed with the collection of funds, and she pledged that it would not enter the race unless he collected two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of the supporters, who gave her $1,000 to men, only gave her $ 250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she asked.
While she was saying that she would not run a formal campaign, she was so obsessed with emotions to people who supported her, frustration because of the system that made it difficult to gather money and target the voters instead of delegates, and anger because of sexism, that her throat had squeezed.
"You would think I had experienced a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled the media response to her.
"You'd think Kleenex is my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about putting on my grave monument.
"She cried."
How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Peking
The beginning of a trade war between the United States and China has voted loudly and, while the battle is far from the end, the dissolution between countries can be of use to Beijing in a long-term period, the experts say.
Donald Trump, US President, fired the first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation in this week appeared with new customs that affected the products worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), in fact taxing half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing returned every time in some way, and a customs duty of five to ten percent was recently introduced to $60 billion of American goods.
China promised the United States will respond with a hit, and the second largest world economy will certainly not be surrendered soon.
The withdrawal of Washington could be achieved by resigning demands, but public submission to the United States would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Peking plays his cards well, the pressures of American trade war can provide a long-term positive support to China by reducing the interdependence of two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Peking could create conditions for the launch of economic strikes in both countries is actually much more dangerous than the observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a scientific associate for strategic thinking focused on Asia in the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says she is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and appeals for assistance in the renewal of a country destroyed by a war that lasts over seven years.
In addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem said the conditions in the country are improved.
"The situation in the field today is stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks to establish a normal situation.
All conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country have now been fulfilled because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures focused on their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped from the country since the beginning of the 2011 war.
Six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian regime would be welcome to help rebuild the destructed country.
However, he emphasized that he would not accept the conditional aid or help of countries who sponsored the rebellion.
Europe won Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by winning the U.S. team with the final results of 16.5 Ö 10.5 in Le Golf National field near Paris, France.
Until now, the United States has lost six times in a European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe reconquered the crown while the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn team reached 14.5 points to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was tortured almost during the whole tournament, on the 16th hole of a couple three, sent a ball into the water at the first stroke, leaving Francescu Molinarium's match.
Italian golfer Molinari brightened in all rounds and became one of the four players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the tournament started this format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth expelled Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest ranking player of the European team, with 5+4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 of the English Ian Poulter who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran of eight Ryder purchases, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became a European with the most victory in the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't stop my tears today.
It was a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting in me.
I'm so happy, so happy I've won a bunch again.
I'm happy I could help," Garcia said, full of emotions after the European victory.
He transmits the battery to his co-national John Rama, who won a legendary American golfer in Sunday, Tiger Woods, resulting in 2&1 games.
"I feel unbelievable pride because of winning Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play," Rahm said 23 years old.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistics of one of the biggest players of all time, who won 14 main titles, and is right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been fighting to find an exit all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a top golf during the whole tournament.
After his team was disappointed, US Captain Jim Furyk said: “I am proud of these guys, they fought. ”
In certain moments, we resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna get over it, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, so we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take off the hat of people.
We're overgrayed."
