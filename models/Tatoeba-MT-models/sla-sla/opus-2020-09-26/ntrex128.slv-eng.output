Members of the Valijan Assembly are concerned that they are “like Mupetkom”
Some members of the congregation are compromised by the proposal to be named as a new MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, i.e. member of the Valian Parliament).
This has occurred because of plans to change the name of the congregation into the Valijan Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the political spectrum are concerned to smile.
The member of the Labourists congregation said that they were concerned in their group, “because the name is rimed with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside of Wales: in Valian twp means nonsense and pwp cacoat.
The member of the Plejd Cymru party said that their group as a whole “not satisfied” and proposed other options.
The Valijan conservative said that his group of “open spirit” regarding the change of the name, while noted that the words of the MWP and Muppet were a small difference in the phrase.
In this context, the word “w” is similar to the word “u” in the yorxhir word.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing the draft legislation for the presentation of a change in the name, stated: “The final decision on possible descryptors for members of the congregation will, of course, have to be adopted by the members of the congregation.”
With the law of the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Valijan Assembly received the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Valijan Parliament.
For the members of the congregation, the Commission has chosen the name ‘Welsh Parliament’ or ‘WMP’, but it has received the most support in the public consultation.
Members of the congregation clearly propose other options, but reaching agreement will be a difficult task for the presidential official Elyn Jones, which must submit a draft amendment legislation within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes in the functioning of the congregation, including the rules on incompatibility of the functioning of the members of the congregation and the establishment of a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will participate in the deliberation of legislation in the final vote on their name.
Macedonians will decide by referendum to change the name of the country
The volunteers will vote on Sunday, whether they will turn their country's name into “Republic North Macedonia”.
By voting, they want to resolve decades of long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its province named Macedonia.
Athens have long insisted that the name of their north neighbour is the right to their territory and have repeatedly opposed its requests for EU and Nata membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite on the change of the name, said he would not take into account the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including the President of the Government, Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name is the price they need to pay for EU and Nate's accession.
The bells in St. Martin’s Church have been molested because churches in Harlem face problems
“ The older people I talked to, they say they were sometimes bars and churches on every corner, ” Adams said.
“There is no one or another today.”
He explained that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“Now people hang out differently.
The bars are no longer the neighbours' living room where people regularly start.”
In the churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that they will soon be again at the beginning.
He added that churches could be replaced by housing buildings with a common authority (condomine), where people who will not help refugees in the neighborhood remaining.
“Most people who buy condomies in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and that will soon come the day all of these churches will be closed, because it is unlikely that people who will move into these condomines will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white religious communities before Harlem became black metropolitan – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s decade later.
The original white methodistic church community moved out in 1930.
The building was taken over by a black religious community who was doing worship in the nearby.
St. Martin’s took over the black religious community under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who was on the 125th street, the main shopping street in Harlem, led a boycot of sellers who did not want to hire or support the darks.
In 1939, the fire had severely injured the building, but when the father Johnson's masters planned to reconstruction, they ordered ringing bells.
To honor David Johnson, father Johnson’s son and his successor in St. Martin’s Church, he proudly called the bells “bells for poor people. ”
The expert, which was printed in July, has named them a little differently: “Cultural Treasury” and“unreplaceable historical instrument”.
Expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first bells to be used by a dark musician, Dionisio A. Link, who went to the Church of Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said he was not replaced in St. Martin’s Church.
In the Church of St. Martin’s, in the past few months, a complicated story with architects and contractors has been held; some have brought church laiques and other bishops.
The Zakristia — the Administrative Body, composed of the Laiqs, wrote to the Bishop that the bishop would “suppose to transfer costs” to the county, although the district was not included in the employment of the architects and contractors sent by the Bishop.
Some of the parishers complained about the transparency of the Bishop.
The sea dog damaged 13-year-olds while hunting lobsters in California
The officials report that, on Saturday in California, the sea dog attacked and injured 13-year-old while hunting lobsters at the opening of the lobster hunt season.
The attack took place just 7 hours ago in the morning near Beacon’s Beach Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV television in San Diego that on Saturday, about half an hour in the morning, he drowned with his friends when he heard the boy screaming to help, and then he swimed to him and helped him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought that the boy was just enthusiastic because he caught the lobster, and then found out that he screamed “He bit me!
He bit me!"
When he came to the boy, Hammel noticed that he had a broken whole key.
"I shouted all of them to go out of the water: 'There's a sea dog!' he added.
The boy was transferred with a helicopter to the Council's Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The type of a sea dog responsible for the attack is not known.
The savior from the water, Captain Larry Giles, said in the media statement that a few weeks ago they noticed a sea dog in this area, but it was found not a dangerous type.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries from the upper part of the body.
Responsible for 48 hours have disabled access from the Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to the Swami Beach in Ecinitas for investigation and security.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of marine dogs in this area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the British Beautiful Market
Sainsbury's coming to Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with beautiful corners as they have in the clubs, and with professional staff.
As part of the entrance to the British Beautiful Market, worth 2.8 billion GBP and still grows, while sales of clothes and household apparatus falls, the larger beauty will be tested in 11 shops in the country, and the next year in more shops, if they prove to be successful.
They decided to invest in beautiful products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves used earlier for television, microwave bakers and household appliances.
In Sainsbury’s, they say that they will double their offers to 3000 products and include marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing offer of marks L’Oreal, Mordalline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space in the areas of trademarks similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The Supermarket also renews its both offer of cosmetic products, so most of the vegan products – something that younger buyers are increasingly demanding.
Furthermore, Fragrance Shop's sales perfumes will test the concession in two Sainsbury's shops. The first week opened in Croydon, South London, and the second will open in Selly Oaku, Birmingham by the end of the year.
Because of the online shopping and daily shopping of smaller foods in local sales, supermarkets must make more effort to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, executive director at Sainsbury’s, said that retail sales would be similar to high-markets, since the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-vital products.
The Sainsbury Group has opened outlets of Argos in several hundred shops, and also the Habitat trade, since the two years ago it bought both chains, which increased the sale of food, and the downloads were more profitable.
The previous supermarket attempts to renew their departments with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products have ended unsuccessfully.
Sainsbury’s started a joint trip with the Boots chain at the beginning of the 21st century, but the link ended after a dispute regarding the division of profits from drugs in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s three years ago for 125 million GBP sold his pharmaceutical company with 281 Celesio trades owned by Lloyds Pharmacy.
They stated that Lloyds would play a role in this plan, since in four shops, they would expand the offer of luxurious marks for the skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy marks.
Paul Mills-Hicks, a commercial director at Sainsbury’s company, said: “We have changed the appearance and impression of our beautiful cats and thus improved the environment for our clients.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues available to consult.
Our offer of mark is designed by meeting all the needs, the attractive environment and the manual locations mean that we are now an interesting beautiful destination, which represents a challenge for old shopping method.”
Peter Jones 'being mad' because Holly Willoughby retired from work worth 11 million pounds
The star presents Dragons Den (Good Business) anger because Holly Willoughby's television manager has withdrawn from work worth 11 million pounds, with his lifestyle trade mark to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their brand of clothes and supplements to Truly.
The business pair was compared to the Mark Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
The head of this Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby angered the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones, since at the last moment she retreated from their profitable business with a lifestyle mark to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was “wretched” when a golden TV girl on Tuesday during a tense meeting at the seat of his company in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that because of its new jobs — up to 1,5 million pounds — has no longer time to devote their brands of clothes and supplements to Truly.
The company was compared with the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow trademark and predicted that its property should be doubled by 11 million GBP.
When a 37 - year - old Willoughby announced in Instagram that she was leaving Truly's trademark, Jones flew from Britain to one of her holiday homes.
The source states: “Truly was the most important thing for Holly.
This would be her long-term future that would survive the next two decades.
Her decision to leave has completely surprised everyone involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was going on, since the opening was so close.
The seat of the company in Marlow is full of goods prepared for sale.’
Experts believe that the departure of the head of this Morning, which is among the most interesting links to the banks in Britain, would stand over millions due to large investments in products, from blasins and candles to clothing and supplements and additional delays in opening.
In addition, this may mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been a good friend for ten years with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby established Truly with Cappo in 2016 and 52 years old Jones joined them as president in March.
The couple were holidays together, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become Ambassador of the M&S Mark and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV series I’m A Celebry.
The source near Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business. ”
Hard conversation “and then we fell in love”
He was kidding about the media's criticisms for the comment that some seem “unpresident” and a positive opinion on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump resign?
The Trump said, with his ridiculous “innovative” voice:
“I didn't drop anything.”
He emphasized that Kim showed interest in the second meeting. Their first meeting in Singapore in June marked Trump as a major step against the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
However, nuclear disarmament negotiations have been delayed.
For more than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly meeting that North Korea has not seen the “suitable response” of the United States to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He emphasized that, instead, the United States continues to sanctions with which they continue to be pressured.
Trump was much more optimistic in his invitation.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim had brought positive results — the missile testing stopped, helped free hostages and brought home the death remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in the conversation of relations with Kim.
"It can be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this full scene, we have 200 people standing here," Trump said and pointed to the crowd right in front of us.
Cunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia have destroyed the island, more than 100 dead
For example, the effects of the earthquake in Lombok were told to foreign NGOs that they did not need their assistance.
Although more than 10 percent of Lomboc’s population have been moved, they have not declared natural disasters, which is the condition for sending international assistance.
"In many cases, they were very clear that they did not require international assistance, so the situation is a little complicated," Sumbung said.
The Organization Save the Children is composing a team to travel to Palo, but it is not clear whether foreign personnel can help on the ground.
The Sutop, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian officials assess the situation in Paluo and determine whether they would allow international agencies to help.
Since the earthquakes in Indonesia are a station, the country remains completely unprepared for anger of nature.
In Aceh, they built accommodations in cunamia, but on other coasts this is not a common practice.
The apparent absence of the warning siren for tsunami in Palou was likely contributed to the loss of life, although the warning was applicable.
The journey between many Indonesian islands is also a challenge in the best times.
Because of natural disasters, logistics are even more complicated.
The hospital ship, which is accompanied by the victims of the earthquake in Lombok, swims against Palou, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the scene of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has set up the improvement of the destruction of Indonesian infrastructure in front of his election campaign and spent a lot of money for roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit is a problem for the Yokov administration in re-electing next year.
Joko is also facing the pressure of long-term tension between sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and more than ten thousand evacuated from their homes, because the Christian and Muslim crowds fought on the streets with cats, lobsters and rifles and other primitive weapons.

Cromwell's statue in parliament has become the latest memorial target of a dispute on “Rewriting History”
His removal would be a poetic right to destroy many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical puritanism advocates.
However, Cromwell Society marked Crick's proposal as “idioticity” and“a try to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s debate on the elimination of statues, it became clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westministration Palace would become a target. ”
Iconoclazm in the English Civil Wars, Cromwell has not ordered or implemented.
For the actions of his ancestor in the past century, he may be sacrificed wrong Cromwell.
The marvelous presentation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a witness of the 19th century’s opinion and is part of the history of the personality that some believe that is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said for The Sunday Telegraph: “Mnoge of Cromwell (may be more late in the 19th century than today) are seen as a parliamentary protector against external pressure, in his case, of course monarchy.
If this is a totally precise show, it is subject to constant historical debates.
Clearly, in the middle of the 17th century, the dispute has formed a further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognised individual representing one side of this division.
His achievements from the time when the Lord was the Protector also deserve the celebration and memory.”
The killing pig crushed a Chinese farmer to death
After reporting local media, the chinese pig attacked and killed a farmer in the southwest market.
The man who was identified only by the name “Yuan ” was found dead with a cut artery and covered with blood near the pig market in Liupanshui, Guizhou, was reported on Sunday at South China Morning Post.
The pig ray is preparing to vaccinate pigs on a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining City in the Qinghai Province in China.
After the reporting, she and her cousin should travel from the neighbouring province Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighbouring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig with a bloody pig.
The forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig crushed a farmer to death.
“The Brother's legs were bleeding and molded, ” a cousin named “Wu” quoted in Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera records showed that Yuang came to the market on Thursday at 4.40 to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was not either his or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was closed to not attacking anyone else while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and market leadership should negotiate the compensation for his death.
Even though rarely, the cases of assaults against a man have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, with a man suffering severe physical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram pig squeezed a Valian farmer along the tractor, but then the wife threw the animal away.
After the pigs ate a farmer from Oregon in 2012, another farmer in Manitoba for CBC News said that pigs are usually not attacking, but the blood taste can work as a “inflammator”.
"We'd just play.
They're like little kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
It is only necessary to show them sufficient respect," he said.
To the southwest of the United States, the remains of the Orcan Rosa are coming from a strong rain
According to prophecies, the Orkan Rosa moves against the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico and the weak.
However, in the next days Rosa will bring floods in the north of Mexico and southwest of the United States.
Rosa is from Sunday from 5.00 a.m. after eastern time of Orcan 1 category with wind speed 137 km/h and is located 620 km south-east of Punte Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Pacific is strengthened by a low air pressure area moving east to the west coast of the United States. Rosa will approach Baja California as a tropical storm and will push high tropical moisture to the north in the southwest of the United States on Monday.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm rain on Monday in Mexico.
In the coming days, the tropical influenza that will mix with the low air pressure area will create abundant declines in a wider south-west area.
Locally from 25 to 100 mm rain will cause dangerous floods, relocation of floods and the possibility of land plazas in the desert.
Due to the high tropical moisture, the amount of drops in certain places will be approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-west parts, especially above the largest part of Arizona, the falls from 50 to 100 mm are expected.
Floods are possible due to a rapid deterioration of the situation due to a dispersed nature of tropical rain.
It would be very unreasonable to walk into the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
The strong rain can turn canyons into thick rivers, and the storms will bring local sunshine wind and dust in the air.
The nearby air pressure area will be brought to the parts of South California's coast.
It is possible to decline more than 12 mm, which can cause a smaller deposition of floods and slide roads.
This will be the first rain for the region during the rain period.
Some dispersed tropical boards will begin to approach Arizona on Saturday late afternoon and on Monday early morning, late on Monday and on Tuesday, the drops will spread.
The strong rain will spread on all sides of the sky on Tuesday and will last on Wednesday.
On October, there can be huge temperature inches to the United States, since the Arctic is cooling, and the tropical areas remain very warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
The week is an excellent example of a dramatic difference in the temperature in the central part of the United States.
Among Canas City in Missouri and Omaho, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, there is 20 degrees of difference.
In the next few days, summer temperatures will try to stop and expand again.
Most of the Central and East United States will enter a warm October with temperatures approximately 27 °C from the Southern Plain region to the parts of the northeast.
In New York, we could have 27 °C on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees more than the average.
Our long-term forecast shows good opportunities for temperatures above the average for the Eastern U.S. in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people mirrors the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people viewed the interesting Thursday testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political pat position continued, since the TV stations terminated the regular program because of the Friday Recovery in the last minute: the agreement made by the arisonal senator Jeff Flake, the FBI will conduct a united survey of charges.
Fordová told the Justice Committee that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh was in a vineyard and tried to take it off at the high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a burdenous testimony that he was 100% convinced that this didn't happen.
Nelsen reports that more than 20.4 million people should take a look at the witness on Friday.
The company considered the average watching of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that played testimony, including PBS networks, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Furthermore, Nelsen usually has some problems with the number of viewers watching the program in offices.
In order to make it easier, the audience is similar to the one in playing the football game of the horses or the awards of the American Film Academy.
Television Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh’s appointment, leads to all networks with a average of 5,69 million viewers, reports Nelsen.
The second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2,52 million viewers, reports Nelsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake played a central role on Friday drama.
After a moderate republican's office made a statement that he would vote in Cavanough's benefit, CNN and CBS television cameras were recorded on Friday morning when the protesters screamed at him when he tried to enter the elevator to participate in the hearing of the judicial committee.
During the construction, he hung up a few minutes to see what cameras of CNN were captured live.
"I'm standing here before you," a woman told him.
"You think he's telling the truth to the country?
You have power, while many women are immoral."
Flake said that his office made a statement and added that he would say more at the committee's hearing and then the door lifted.
All television networks were presented in live hours later, when the Justice Committee voted on the surrender of Kavanaugh's appointment to vote in the Senate.
But Flake said that it would only be done if they agreed that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate in the next week, as the minority party of democrats called on.
Flake's talks to a friend, a democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and more other senators later, Flake took his decision.
Flake's voice was determined, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have votes to appoint Kavanaugh without investigation.
The President Trump launched an investigation of the U.S. Federal Investigation Office (FBI) on the charges against Kavanaugh.

Vulcan vomiting ash on Ciudad de Mexico
Ash vomiting by the Vulcan Popocatepetl reached the southern neighborhood of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano on Saturday, since the activity was strengthened in the krater and recorded 183 gas and ash releases in 24 hours.

Police in conflict with catalonic separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the protesters who supported independence struggled with anti-expected police units and thousands of people joined the rival demonstration that marked the first anniversary of the Catalan Polarized Polarized vote on deception.
The group of masked separatism supporters held by the anti-explosive police units was obsessed with eggs and metal paint in dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually floated by tourists.
Later, there were beatings, and the police had to use the pendrakes to stop the fights.
The supporters of independence, who cried “without forgetting, without forgiveness, ” faced protesters who support unity and shouted“ Let Spain live! ”
According to local media, 14 people in protests have received easier injuries.
The year after the referendum of 1 October, which was identified illegal in Madrid, the catalonic separists celebrated it, the tensions in the region supporting independence remain.
Most voters voted for independence, although the participation was low, since the opponents of the deception were largely bojcotted elections.
According to the Catalonic authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the continuation of voting in the electoral region.
The groups supporting independence have camped overnight before the elections to prevent demonstrations and thus support the state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take the other way.
68-year-old Narcis Termes, a electrician who participated in separatist protest with his wife, said that there was no hope that Catalonia would become independent.
“We experienced one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents crying from happiness because they could vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite the important, although the close victory on regional elections last December, the catalon parties supporting independence have difficultly maintained this year, since many of the most famous leaders in voluntary exile or are in custody waiting for a trial due to their role in the organisation of the referendum and later declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanist who recorded a telephone protest in support of the police, explained that the protests were initiating politics on both sides.
"The tension is increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine catalon leaders, who have been in custody from the end of last year before the beginning of the trial, announced that he would run the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Canding on European elections is the best way to condemn regression in democratic values and torture that we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: they arrested men flying into the house with a car
Three men, 33, 34, and 39 years old, were arrested for flying into a house in Londonderry.
The incident happened on Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday at approximately 19:30 after the British summer time.
Detective inspector Bob Blemmings said that the door was injured and the building itself.
At some point, we were supposed to shoot against the car with a sam shot.
With the mengai hit, Livingston won with 1:0 against Rangers.
Dolly Menga with his first naked for Livingston guaranteed victory
Livingston surprised Rangers and Steven Gerrard had to admit his second defeat in 18 games as a coach of the Ibrox club.
The shooting of Dolly Mengai took care of the difference, because the team of Gary Holt equipped with the Hibernian team in the other place.
Gerard's team has thus lost the victory of the guests in the year's championship, and next week Hearts are waiting for them, leading on the ladder and behind eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston increased his series of indefeats in the division at six runs and chief coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet tasted the defeat.
Livingston wasted options against direct guests
Holt's team should have led a lot before the attack, since they caused many problems with their directness to Rangers.
Scott Robinson was able to score, but he sent the ball through the door frame, then Alan Lithgow hit off the neck, and Craig Halkett shot his head over the naked.
The hosts left the game to the Rangers because they knew that the guests could be dangerous at the interruption of the attack.
And that's how they came to the key naked.
The Rangers gave Livingstone a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Mengai, who shot and hit from the middle of the criminal space.
The Rangers had a larger ball, but the home defense couldn't be stabbed, and the gateman Liam Kelly didn't have much to do.
This pattern continued in another half-time, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's defense.
The doorman of Rangers Allan McGregor defended Scott Pittman's shot from his leg, and Lithgow fired another Livingstone interruption in the naked attack.
The proposals continued to come to Livingstone's penalty space, but the locals rejected all attacks, two offences – Halkett's offence over the replacement of Glenn Middleton and a hand-game offence — and the judge did not judge.
“Excellent performance” Livingstone – analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena stadium
Excellent show and results for Livingston.
Clearly, they were all excellent and continue to overcome the expectations on this way up.
The style of the game and the law has not changed much since they returned to the top, but Holt needs to pay credit for the way he woke the team from his arrival.
There was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played an extraordinary role, and he well distributed an excellently organized defense, while Menga kept in the readyness of Connor Goldson and Joe Worral.
But the Rangers simply lacked the inspiration.
Although they are excellent under Gerrard’s leadership, they are very lacking these standards.
The lack of arrows on the nak – only once successfully defeated hosts – is some kind of a buddy for Rangers who were located in the middle of the staircase.
Erdogan was mixed in Köln
On Saturday (September 29th), when Turkey and Germany's leaders met at breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue sky were overcome.
Today is the last day of a controversial visit to President Erdogan in Germany, which aims at improving relations between Nate's allies.
There have been disputes on human rights, freedom of press and Turkish accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan traveled to Köln to open a giant new mosque.
The city is a home for the largest number of Turkish people outside Turkey.
For security reasons, 25,000 heads have prevented the crowd from gathering before the mosch, but many supporters have managed to come closer to see their president.
Several hundred protesters also expressed their views — among them, many Kurds – who do not support Erdogan's governments and condemn Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The opposite protests reflect the divorce of the visitor, which some German Turks celebrate as a hero, and others despise as a autocrat.
Disastrous accident in Deptford: a bikeman crashed in a car race.
In London, the bike crashed in a race with a car involved.
The accident happened near the crossroad between the streets of Bestwood and Evelyn Street, on the roadway in Depford, in the southeast of the city at approximately 10.15 after the British summer time.
The car driver stopped and the rescue came, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred only a few months after the bike died in a race where the driver fled on Childers Street, about 1,5 km from the Saturday accident.
The police made a statement that the police were checking the identity of the man to inform their properties.
They set up road locks and redirected the bus lines, and the engineers were advised to avoid the area.
Prison Long Lartin: Six guards damaged in the accident
Six prison guards were damaged in an accident in a strictly protected male prison, reported from the prison administration.
The mess exploded in prison HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire on Sunday at approximately 9.30 after the British summertime and is still running.
They called the police specialists from the Tornado unit to take care of the incident in which eight prisoners are involved and are limited to one wing.
The guards were provided with smaller injuries on their face alone.
The representative of the prison staff said: “We have called a specially trained personnel to take care of the accident in prison HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff suffered injuries.
In our prisons, we do not tolerate violence and it is clear that the police will be responsible for this, and that may make them even longer behind prisons.”
In prison, HMP Long Lartin is more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminal offences in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was in the hospital care because the prisoner attacked him.
And last October, they called the police's contravention unit to intervene in a serious accident in which the staff were attacked by billboard bullets.
Orkan Rosa threatens Pheonix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week, since the remaining energy of the Orkan Rosa is putting its way through the southwest of the desert and brings the danger of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings from sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday to the West Arizona, south and eastern Nevada, South Eastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The Orkan Rosa was supposed to be mad at Phoenix on Tuesday, and he'll be approaching late Monday with rain.
The National Time Service in Phoenix stated in Tweeting that only “the ten tropical cyclones maintained the status of tropical storm or depression within 300 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
The Orkan of Katrina (1967) was angry about 60 miles [60 km] from the Arizona border.”
The latest models of the National Orcan Centre provide for 50 to 100 mm declines with individual drops up to 150 mm in Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
In other areas of Southwestern desert, including Rockies and Great Basin, it is expected from 25 to 50 mm deficiencies, possibly individual declines up to 100 mm.
For areas outside the danger of sudden floods, the rain of the Orkan Rosa may be a blessing because the region has been affected by drought.
Although the floods are a very serious problem, part of the falls will probably be useful, since the dry period currently lasts in the southwest.
“As indicated by the American Drought Tracking Centre, good 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drying,” reports weather.com.
The path of the Orcan Rosa leads first to the land of the Mexican halfway Baja California.
Rosa, who still has the power of the orcan on Sunday morning with the highest wind speed of 137 miles per hour, is 620 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north at a speed of 19 km per hour.
The storm comes in contact with cold waters in the Pacific, so it weakens.
The land in Mexico is expected to reach by the power of the tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The falls in the parts of Mexico may be rich and therefore constitute a great danger of flood.
“From Baja California's halfway to the northwest of Sonora, we expect 75 to 150 mm of fallings with the option of 250 mm pads”, reported on the weather.com website.
The Orkan Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona in early mornings in Tuesday as a tropical depression that will then travel through Arizona and against Southern Utah until late on Tuesday.
“The largest danger we expect from the Orkan Ross or his remains is a tremendous rain in Baja Califonia in the northwest of Sonora and in the Southwestern desert,” said the National Centre for Orcani.
These descendants may cause lifely dangerous floods and floods in deserts and ground plasmas in mountains.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempting murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were arrested for suspicion of the attempt of murder after 16-year-old in Summerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsion Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4.00 after the British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remains “stable”.
17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-old were arrested at the Radstock area at night, reports Avon and Somerset police.
The police are calling everyone who may have caught the event to contact.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “with suffered intimidation and anger” of the Democratic Party
"The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against unmilosure and unanimous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at the Wheeling conference in Wheeling, Western Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “has suffered an intimidation and anger” of the Democratic Party in its appointment process.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh witnessed before the convention, with clearly and emotional denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusations of sexual attacking her decades ago when they were teenagers.
She also witnessed Ford's accusations at the interrogation.
The President said on Saturday that day “Americans saw Kavanaugh’s brilliantness, quality and courage.”
"The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an exceptional record of public service," he said to the people of supporters in Western Virginia.
The President indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke of the importance of the vote of the Republicans in intermediate elections.
“Five weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
I really do my efforts with the candidate," he said.
“So I fight everywhere for excellent candidates.”
Trump argues that democrats are on the mission of “presentation and obstacles”.
The first key procedural vote in the Cavanaugh appointment Senate was to take place at Friday at the latest, CNN advisor of the Republican party said to the CNN.
In the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami killed hundreds of people, the number of victims grows
The authorities reported on Saturday that in the earthquake and tsunami affected by the Indonezian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people died, many of the giant waves that were waves on the coast.
Several hundred people gathered on Friday at the beach festival in Palo, when the six - meth waves hit at the dark side of the shore and took many to death and destroyed everything on their way.
Cunamia was followed by the earthquake with the power of 7.5 degrees.
"When the cunamic danger occurred yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not escape immediately, so they became victims," the representative of the Indonezian Agency for Disaster Mitigation BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at the meeting in Jakarta.
“Cunami didn't come alone, he dragged with him cars, trees, houses, he smashed everything on the ground”, explained Nugroho and added that he traveled tsunami through the open sea at 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
He said that some people climbed into the trees to escape the tsunamis, and they survived.
Approximately 16.700 people were evacuated in 24 centres in Palou.
The air photographs published by the accident agency show destroyed buildings and stores, wiped and broken bridges and mosques.
The earthquakes continued to shake the coast on Saturday.
In a area of 2.4 million people, there was a range of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT) stated in the statement that the energy released in the Friday strong earthquake is approximately 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima in the second world war.
The geographic of the city laying at the end of the long and narrow bay should also increase the size of the cunamic.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive ” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found captured under the ruins of buildings, and he added, 540 people were damaged and 29 still missing.
Nugroho explained that the victims and damage may be bigger at the coast of 300 km north of Palou, in the area of Donggala, near the epicentre of the earthquake.
As Nugroh said, communications are completely interrupted and have no information on the Donghall area.
“In the area more than 300,000 people live,” said the Red Cross statement and added that staff and volunteers are moving to the affected areas.
“It's already a tragedy, but it can become worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms because it did not inform the public that the tsunami affected Palo, but the officials say the waves had arrived at the time of the issue of the warning.
In the amateur video published on social networks, a man in the upper floor screams warns people on the street on the nearby tsunami.
In a few minutes, the water wall ran along the coast and took away buildings and cars with him.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the integrity of the video.
The earthquakes and tsunamis have caused an outbreak of electricity that has discontinued communications around Paloo, which has made the authorities difficult to coordinate rescue action.
The authorities report that the army began to send cargo aircraft through Jacarda and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other basic life needs.
The local airport was only open to provide aid and will remain closed by October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit the evacuation centres in Paluo on Sunday.
The number of victims in the Indonesian cunami has increased to more than 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Personality, members of the World Vision Organization from Donghala arrived safely in Palo, where employees in the courtyard in front of their rooms built a shelter from their poems, but they saw many scenes of desolation on their way.
“They told me that they saw a lot of ruined houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups launched aid initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with a lot of experience would not allow to come to Palo.
In accordance with the Indonesian Regulations, cross-sea financing, staff stocks and assistance are allowed only if the scenario of the disaster is declared for the area of national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is still considered an accident at the province level”, said Aulia Ariani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says “all right, this is a national accident”, we can accept international aid, but there is no such status yet.”
On Friday night after the Friday earthquake and the cunamie in Paluo, friends and relatives of missing ones are reluctant to hope that their nearby miracles are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled the boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescueers released a woman who was caught under ruins two days, and her mother's body lied along with her.
Gendon Subandono, Coach of the Indonesian Nuclear District Representative, trained two missing nuclear droppers for Asia games that ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Others, caught in Roa Roa Roa, said Mr. Mandagi were his students.
“As aged in the field of sailing, I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that in the hours when the news about the destruction of Roa Roa Roa circled through the communities of nuclear fallers, he sent messages in desperately in the application of WhatsApp to competitors in Paluo, who attended the festival on the beach.
But his messages were marked with only one grey knock instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Dads stole 26.750 USD while filling a bankomat in the center of Newport on the Levee
Following the Newport police report, the thiefs stole 26.750 USD from Brink's security worker who filled a bankomat in Newport on the Leeve on Friday morning.
The car driver emptyed the bankomat in the entertainment complex and was preparing for money delivery, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the public statement.
While he was employed, another man “closed close to Brink’s employee from behind ” and stole the bag of money for delivery.
Following the report, the witnesses saw more suspects escape from the scene, but the police did not specify the exact number of participating in the event.
All who have information on the identity of suspects to call the Newport police number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
The change was reported on Saturday on Twitter and wrote: “Fight with the official name Kanye West.”
41-year-old West has a name Ye for a while and has also been used to address his eighth album issued in June.
The amendment comes right before his show at the Saturday Night Live show, in which I should present my new Yandhi album.
He will replace the singing of Ariano Grande, which has cancelled the show for “personal reasons”, said the maker of the show.
The word is shortening his current professional name, but West has already said that the word has religious meaning for him.
“I think the word “ye” is the most commonly used in the Bible, where “you” (i.e.), West said at the beginning of this year when he spoke about the album address to the radio host of Big Boy.
"So I'm you and I are all me.
Kanye, which means "one", I transformed into Ye – that reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of everything we are."
Kanye is one of the many famous rapers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed his desire for the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West colleague, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with thinking or without him and with large letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected Mexican President Andress Manuel Lopez Obrador sweared that he would never use military forces against civilians as soon as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody violence against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday on the Tlatelolco Plaza market that “he will never use the army to harass the Mexican people.”
At the time in Latin America, the left student movements began to operate, the peaceful demonstration on the market on October 2rd, 1968 soldiers started shooting and killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador swore to support young Mexicans and students to provide monthly subsidies and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education brings young people to criminal associations.
United States should double the financing of artistic intelligence
Since China becomes more active in the field of artistic intelligence, the US should double the funds spent for research in this area, the investor and expert on the art intelligence of Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after the various parts of the US government predicted the use of artificial intelligence, although the United States has no official strategy for artistic intelligence.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: their goal is to become the best innovation in the field of artistic intelligence by 2030.
“Dubling the budget for artistic intelligence research would be a good start, since all other countries are quite for the United States and we are looking for the next breakdown in the field of artistic intelligence”, said Lee.
The double funding could double the possibility that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will occur in the United States, Lee said to the CNBC in the interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Super Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” (Supersile Art Intelligence: China, Silician Valley and New World Order) published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, President of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most visible intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, the University of Carnegie Mellon developed a system of artistic intelligence that defeated the highest classified American player of the game Othello and later was the executive director in Microsoft Research and the Chairman of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee said that he was aware of the previous technological competitions of the US government, such as the robotic competition organized by the DARPA Agency (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), and asked when the next time he would find the next visioners.
The U.S. researchers must work hard if they want to receive State support, Lee said.
“It's not China's one who takes over the best academics, but these are companies,” Lee explained.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired the best from universities in recent years to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that people with a physician from artificial intelligence should automatically offer a green card,” he said.
On July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a new generation's artistic intelligence development plan.
China's National Fund for Natural Sciences finances people in academic institutions, like the National Scientific Foundation and other government organizations, they divide money to American researchers, but the quality of the academic work in China is worse, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established the Joint Intelligence Centre, which combines partners from the industrial and academic sector, and the White House announced the establishment of a stronger committee for artificial intelligence.
This month, however, the DARPA projected an investment in the AI Next Initiative of two billion USD.
The National Scientific Foundation (NSF) in Art Intelligence Research currently invests more than 100 million USD per year
Meanwhile, the American legislation that wanted to create the National Security Commission for Art Intelligence has not done anything for months.
Macedonians will decide to change the name of the country at the referendum
Macedonian citizens voted on the referendum on Sunday, whether they would change their country's name into the Republic of Northern Macedonia, so that they would resolve the decades of long dispute with Greece, which opposed their requests for membership in the European Union and Nate.
Greece, which has its province named Macedonia, insists that the name of her north neighbour is the right to their territories and has invested veto on its entry into Nato and the EU.
On June, the Government concluded an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would destroy the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonians.
The President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote at the referendum, and the boycot campaign expressed doubt that the participation would be at least 50 absences as long as it was necessary to make the referendum valid.
The question on the referendum list was: “Are you for membership in Nata and the EU with the adoption of an agreement with Greece?”
The supporters of the referendum, including the President of the Government of Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying for accession to bodies such as the EU and Nato for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging after the breakdown of Yugoslavia.
Today I have come to vote for the future of the country and the young people in Macedonia to live freely under the cover of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of Parliament have said to respect the results of the vote that will be decided.
The change in the name requires a two-third majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission has reported that there were no irregularities reported until 13:00.
However, the participation was only 16% compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters were given their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our city is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from the capital of Skopje.
The Macedonian President Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and Dusko's son, presented their lectures to the referendum in Macedonia on 30 September 2018 on a change in the name of the country that opens the way to join Nat and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small branch and placed tables in front of the tents set by those who will bout the referendum.
"We are for Nato and the EU, but we want to join the heads raised, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Integration."
The President of the Government of Zaev says that membership in Nat will bring a strongly necessary investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the majority will be for more than 80 per cent of our citizens to support the EU and Nato," Zaev said after the presentation of his election ticket.
He added that a positive result would be “affirmation of our future”.
The survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research showed that the referendum would take part between 30 and 43 percent of the voters, which is less than the necessary electoral participation.
The second survey made by the Macedonian Television Telma showed that 57 percent of the questionnaires would be voted on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would vote for.
In order to succeed the referendum, the voluntary participation must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first serious strike for the policy of the Western Government, which took over the mandate last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has played the whole Brighton defense and target
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defense on the Manchester City victory with 2-0 on Saturday.
Aguer's hit in 65th minute was seeming ridiculous simple.
At the beginning of the action, the Argentine attacker accepted the presentation in the middle of the playground.
He flew between the three Brighton defense players and found an open space.
Aguera then rounded four green players.
He played one defense player and was faster than the other on the edge of Brighton's criminal space.
Then he handed Sterling on his left.
The English attacker, with his first touch in the criminal space, returned the ball to Aguer, who defeated Brighton's right leg and sent the ball to the right side of the network.
"Aguero faces problems in his legs," coach Pep Guardiola told the journalists.
"We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to hit the naked at that point."
But Sterling was the one who provided the blue with the initial advantage in the fight of the first English League.
The naked reached in 29th minute.
In this action, Aguero took a ball deep in Brighton's half.
He handed the ball on his left hand to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball several times, and then sent Sterling ball to the remote necklace.
The wise blue attacker put the ball in the net just before she flew through the naked.
The city will meet Hoffenheim at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium on Tuesday at 12.55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium, Sinsheim, Germany, in the group of the League of Champions.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies and spoil their address options
The Nationals team fell out of the end, so there's no special reason for a new attack.
But always the contestant Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he can rise to the metal grid against the Colorado Rockies team. This will only happen if Rockies will still have the possibility of playing at the end, since they have an advantage in the Western League in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers team.
Rockies won 5:2 on Friday at the Nationals team, but they still wait for their first address in the division.
"Although we can't get anything, at least we can play in a great atmosphere in front of a large crowd here in Denver and the opposite team will play at the probably highest level this year.
So why don't you want to compete?"
The Nationals have not yet published the names of the first metalman on Sunday, but it's probably Scherzer's metal in this case.
Scherzer, who will be the first metal for 34 times, has a metal as a tender player on Thursday and would have had enough days of rest by Sunday.
The Washington rightman gathered this season 18 wins and 7 defeats with an average of 2,53 and 300 executions with strokes in 220 2/3 changing this season.
Trump in Western Virginia Congress
The President directly touched the situation regarding his choice for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke of the importance of the Republican election participation in intermediate elections.
"All we've done will be at stake on November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This will be one of the biggest - I really try to make a candidate, so I fight everywhere for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “We have this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, and this is happening now.
They are determined to take over the authorities, using all the means they can use.
They do not care whom they are injured, whom they must be slaughtered to receive power and control; for they want, power and control, but we will not give it to them.”
According to him, democrats are on the mission of “presentation and obstacle”.
"And you could have noticed this in the last four days," he said, "the democrats were called "anger, evil, low and liar."
He exposed the member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, with a loud disapproval from the public.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you post the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I'm not, wait. This was really the bad speech of the body, the worst I've ever seen."
The labour client is no longer open for different views.
She is impatient to those who express their opinions.
When an activist of the Momentum organization in my local client said untrusted to me, it wasn't even a surprise.
Finally, I am the last member of the parliament from the labour party who is not desirable for the expression of my opinion.
My colleague, Ambassador Joan Ryan, happened similarly because she strongly resisted anti-semitism.
In my case, there was an unconfidential proposal for my unconfidentiality with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, the ironically similar issues about which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Friday meeting of the Nottingham East party stated that “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
In eight years, as far as I am a member of the parliamentary local labour party, Friday meetings were mostly the same.
In most meetings, unfortunately, this is not used today and the promise of “better and gentle ” to politics has been forgotten for a long time if it has even started.
It is increasingly obvious that different views in the labour party are not allowed and in each opinion it is assessed whether this is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This began soon after Jeremy became the leader, and the colleagues I thought before that we shared similar political views were expecting me to change my opinion and take a view that I would never agree to be in the field of national security or the EU Single Market.
When I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I say -- there are criticisms on social networks that call for non-election, they condemn the environment policy and they tell me that I should not be in the labourist party.
And that's not just my experience.
Actually, I know that I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments for me are only political.
I admire the expertise and determination of the colleagues who daily meet the flood of sexist or racist complaints, but do not let themselves frighten.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this policy period is how abuse rates have become something completely common.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the labour party must promote the culture of tolerance.
However, the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions and with every unconfidence proposal or change of the rules for the choice of a party becomes more disadvantaged.
In the past two years, I received many advice to remove my head and not to be so loud, and it will be “all right ” with me.
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago – the reason for this was Tatcher's government's lack of care, which has literally brought down the school in my basic school — as a local saint or government minister, I tried to take advantage of better public services for those who need the most.
I've never hid my political beliefs, including the last elections.
No one in the Nottingham East party could be confused about my political positions and areas that I disagreed with the current leadership.
Those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I don't understand their wishes after wasting time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the leader of the labour party when the country swims against the brexite that affects households, businesses and our public services.
But my real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters and voters, whether they are members of the labour party or not: I am proud I have served you, and I promise you that no threats after no choice or political competence will distract me from acting in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: Unbelievable Ayr on top of the ladder
Two familiar attempts have distorted a few final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned a victory in this wonderful entertainment primary game of the day.
Now they're on the top of the stairs and they're the only unbelievable team of ten.
In the end, their high defense and better exploitation, and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason for satisfaction.
"We have passed a lot of tests in our current games and we are still unbelievable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: “Greets to Ayra's team, opportunities have been better than us.”
The attack of Granta Andersona in 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Climo, led Ayr to the leadership, but the yellow card for the Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, which he received in the game with Warriors, meant a number of overpowers for Melrose and Jason Baggott.
Climo increased the leadership for Ayra at the offence, before he hit at a half-time time and then turned an independent attempt for the result 17:5 for Ayra at season.
But Melrose began very well the second half and the attempt of Patrick Andersson, who was converted by Baggot, reduced the remnant to five points.
It followed a long interruption due to the serious injury of Ruarid Knott, which he was taken on his wearers, and afterwards, Ayr made progress with the attempt of Stafford McDowall, which Climo turned.
Temporary captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received the yellow card and Melrose again used the game with a player with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of the period of forced pressure.
But the hosts returned and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for Clim's obstacle without ball, MacPherson was hit in the attack.
Climo reached the point after Kyle Rowe shot David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's wing player in the fiveth attempt of hosts.
Series star Still Game starts a new career in the guest
The star of the Still Game Ford Kieran is apparently presented to the guest, but he is supposed to be the director of the licensed company with restaurants.
A 56-year-old in the popular BBC series, for which he also wrote a scenario, played Jack Jarvis with a long-year-old partner in the comedies Greg Hemphill.
Two of them announced that after the next ninth season, the last season, and it seems Kiernan's already planning on life after Craiglang.
According to the official documentation, the Director of Adriftmorn Limited is.
The player did not want to comment on the story, but the source for Scottish Sun implied that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the “blossom hospital” in Glasgow.
“Sea is our”: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Navy patrols on the seat in La Paz.
In public buildings, the navy blue flags are exclusive.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaka to Amazon are covered with slogan: “We have the right to sea.
It is our duty to return it.”
In continental Bolivia, the memory of losing the coast in a bloody dispute due to natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive — just as the desire of a renewable float across the Pacific.
This hope may be the biggest after decades, since Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court, which will be received after the five years of consultation on October 1st.
"Bolivia has a launch, a spirit of unity and impartiality and, of course, expects the results in a positive spirit," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will consider the decision of the International Court of Justice on large displays across the country and hope that the Hague Court will decide on the benefit of Bolivia, which claims that after decades of unstable talks, they will negotiate the access of Bolivia to the sovereign access to the sea.
Eva Morales, the Bolivian Carismatic Native President, who is waiting for a controversial battle for re-electing next year, has also great expectations on Monday's judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” promised the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will not decide on the benefit of Bolivia, and even if it did, it would not change much.
The UN authorities in the Netherlands have not authorised Bolivia to allocate the Chilean territory and will not decide on the results of possible talks.
The fact that the decision of the International Court comes only six months after the final arguments have been heard means that the case was not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, the Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, they're not talking about Bolivia, but they might cost a lot.
“The current Bolivian government has used the question of access to the sea”, Zarateova said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric crushed all the goodwill from Chilenz, which could still remain, explained.
The talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at one point, but it will be extremely difficult to participate in the debate.
State has not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, the Bolivian representative in Hague, rejected the idea that the court had decided unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring a “extraordinary opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile” and the possibility of“ ending 139-year disagreements with mutual benefits”, he said.
Calzadilla also denyed that Morales — still one of the most popular Latin American presidents — used the maritime issue as a political resistance.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access to the Pacific”, he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea stated that nuclear disarmament would not happen unless the United States could trust
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his people will never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington.
Ri had a talk on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He invited the United States to fulfil their promises made at the meeting between the leaders of the rival countries in Singapore.
His statement comes in time when US Minister Mike Pompeo is apparently before the restart of nuclear diplomacy, which was at a dead point, more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says that the United States is wrong if they think that the continuation of sanctions and the objection of the prognosis of the end of Korean war, North Korea will be kneeled.
Washington is precautionary in the approving of the prophecy without Pyungjang to take decisive measures first to disarmament.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, it is general doubt that Pjongjang is serious about the cancellation of the weapons that the country sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare everything for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.

The list of famous Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and bags for the beach to arrive in the shops for the next summer – since the designer made such a strong impression, the request for too many supplements would be difficult to overlook.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools enjoy the celebrations of the academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results on examinations strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scotland Council for independent schools (SCIS) are trying to ensure the highest level of service for their students and their parents.
Individual schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, the selected professional path and the city they have as global citizens.
As a education sector that can form and implement a adjusted school programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable choices in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, the conversation is impressed in his memory.
But if you speak with a man in his mother’s language, the words will be affected by his heart. ”
This is a good reminder that we must not rely on English only when we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
This year's results of recent tests show that the languages are at the top of the ladder with the highest level of success in single schools.
68 per cent of students learning a foreign language have reached an excellent assessment.
The data collected in 74 schools of the Scotland Council for independent schools (SCIS) showed that 72 per cent of the students had a great assessment in mandarin and 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French and 63 per cent of Spanish students received excellent evaluation.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the key knowledge that children and young people will need in the future.
Languages are treated as electoral objects in educational plans of independent schools and in other cases as subjects in the fields of nature, technology, engineering and mathematics.
The study carried out by the Commission for the Employment and Training of the United Kingdom in 2014 showed that, for the reasons for which employers are attached to the lack of language skills, 17 per cent of them can be reported.
Therefore, knowledge of languages becomes increasingly urgent in preparing young people for their future professional journey.
In future employment opportunities that require knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in the global world.
If someone learns another language, no matter what the professional way he chooses, with such lifelife knowledge, he has a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person who can directly communicate with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage before competitiveness.
The YouGov Survey of 2013, which covered more than 4000 adults in the United Kingdom, showed that 75 percent of people were not speaking foreign language enough to talk, with the only French language spoken by the bilateral percentage of the questionnaires, which was 15 percent.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for children today.
With the knowledge of several languages, especially those from the developing economies, children have better opportunities to find appropriate employment.
In Scotland, schools differ in languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical contemporary languages, while others teach languages that are the most important to the United Kingdom in 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Despite your child’s interests, you will always be able to choose many languages learned by experts in this area.
Scotland's independent schools are dedicated to the provision of a learning environment that will prepare and arm children with the knowledge they need for success, regardless of what the future brings.
In the global business environment, it is not possible to deny that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, so it must also be expressed in education.
In fact, contemporary languages should be treated as “international communication skills”.
Individual schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scotland World of Self-Schools
LeBron will debit Sunday in San Diego in Lakers' dress.
For the fans who look forward to the first LeBron James show for the L.A. Lakers team, the waiting will soon be over.
Coach Lakers' Luke Walton foretold that James will play in the Sunday Preseau against Denver Nuggets' team in San Dieg.
He doesn't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
“More than one and less than 48,” Walton explained on the official site of Lakers.
The official rapporteur of Lakers Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James will probably play a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers flows before the season.
“In this stage, I don't need my career to prepare before the season,” he said.
Tramp Congress in Western Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today in Wheeling, West Virginia, begins a series of conventions in his campaign.
This is the first of Trump's five planned meetings in the next week, including the stations of the favoured countries, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since his candidate for a free place in the Supreme Court is not yet confirmed, Trump wants to obtain support for the coming interim elections, as the Republicans are threatening to lose the control of Congress after the November vote.
At which hour will Trump’s convention in Western Virginia, and where will it be possible to be seen online?
The Trump Congress in Wheeling in West Virginia will be on Saturday, 29 September 2018, at 19:00 a.m. after east time.
The Trump Congress in Western Virginia can be viewed live online on YouTube channel.
Trump will probably discuss the hearing of the candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh this week, which has become tense about sexual offence charges, which is why the confirmation in the Senate is expected to be delayed for one week for the FBI to conduct an investigation.
However, the primary goal of this series of conventions is to help the Republicans who are in awaiting important elections in November to acquire a new start.
Therefore, in the campaign of President Trump of these five conventions, “the incentive of volunteers and supporters, since the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority of the senate and representative home, reports Reuters.
"The supervision in the Congress is so important for his programme that the president will travel in as many countries as possible," the representative of the Trump campaign, who does not want to be appointed, told Reuters.
Today's meeting in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, after the West Virginia MetroNews report, could also be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, which would attract interest in the pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit the West Virginia for the second time in the last month, in which he received more than 40 percent of points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Western Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, who remains in public research.
“For Morrisey, it is a bad sign that the president has to arrive and raise him in public research”, said Simon Haeder, political scientist at the University of Western Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder's Scock 2018: U.S. team has still a desire for winning and maintaining hope before Sunday's single fights
After three one-sided games, Saturday afternoon fights of two two (foursome) were probably what Ryder's cake needed.
It is a totally invented sport concept, but players really believe it, especially in such competitions.
So where did it go now?
"They had six points of advantage, and now they have four, so it is probably a new start for us," Jordan Spieeth said at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the privilege, because it leads to four points, and there are still twelve.
But the Americans feel that the winds in the sails, including the forms of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three points of four.
Spieth was condemned from the starting strike to the vegetable and gave a good example.
The screams of happiness continued to be louder and led to a decisive strike, when Thomas and I had two points to be equal in the fourth game.
The strike that came to the win on the 15th hole was accompanied by a similar screaming that would tell you that the American team believes that the American team still has a chance.
“You just need to find your internal power and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the uncontrolled story of Ryder's cake.
An unusual, but magical two of Europe have won four points from four and are inadequate.
The two Molliwood were the only ones who did not hit a bug on Saturday afternoon and also avoided the bugi on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way that apparently the energy flows between them and the noise community confirms the fact that they are those players to be defeated on Sunday, and no other player could better seal possible wins of Europe than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun comes over the Le Golf National game.
And, if possible, both of you on different holes at the same time.
However, talking about European glory would be too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcio, the morning hero in the game with four balls, who were together with Alex Norren.
Because of the bug and two double bugs in the first nine holes, Spaniard and Sweden fell into a crisis that did not find a way out.
But the players won't have any help on Saturday.
Games with four balls and the fights of two two two are exclusively monitored from nearby due to communication between couples, advice they give to themselves, advice that they do not give, and how the strategy can be changed at the moment.
Europe has played better so far than the team and has a great advantage before the last day, but the two fights showed that the United States team also has the desire to win, and some, in particular, on the American side, have doubts.
Europe leads 10:6 before the last day of Ryder's cave
Europe goes on the last day of Ryder's cake with a nice privilege after the Saturday games with four balls and two fights lead with 10:6 to the United States.
The excellent couple composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari has made his best and with two victories over Tiger Woods and on Le Golf National playground ripped four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to win the trophy that she lost in Hazeltin two years ago, had four balls over the American team that sinned, and said in a series of 3:1 in the morning.
The United States team had better opposed two fights, where two games were won, but the removal could not be compensated.
The team of Jim Fury needs eight points from Sunday 12 individual fights if they want to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European journalist who won four sequences, while Molinarius and the couple were called Molliwood after the sensational end of the week only another couple who won four points in his first four games in the history of Ryder's cake.
After the winning over Woods and Patrick Reed in the game with four balls, they turned out again and even more persuasively conquered the lost Woods and the US newsman Bryson Dechambeau with 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliantness for a moment, but lost 19 out of 29 games in fights with four balls and struggles of two two balls, of this seven in a seven sequence.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning's game with four balls, returned to fight two and in a couple with Henry Stanson with 2 and 1 defeated Dustina Johnson and Broox Koeopko, who were classified at the first and third place on the world's ladder.
But on a pleasant, wind day in the southwest of Paris, it was not all according to the European team's plans.
The three winners of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set up a new criteria for the Americans on Saturday.
With 2 and 1, they strongly won against Spanish John Rahma and Ian Poulter in the game with four balls and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in the fights of two two, losing the first two holes.
Only once in Ryder's history, the team came back after the remainder of four points before each fight, even though Fury's team needs only an equation to keep the trophy.
But after two days in the second place, the Sunday Anti-Availability may seem too much to eat for it.
North Korea: “We will never disarm ourselves unilaterally”
The North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that further implementation of sanctions causes increasing non-confidence in the United States of America and that North Korea, under such conditions, will certainly not unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jong Ho, at the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this World Authority, said that North Korea has adopted many “relevant measures in the sign of goodwill”, such as stopping the implementation of nuclear and missile trials, the season of nuclear trials and the promise that they will not expand nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we do not see the appropriate US response," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we will not be sure of state security and, under such conditions, we will not be unanimously disarmed first.”
While Ri repeated the known complaints of North Korea regarding Washington's resistance to the gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded for the adoption of procedural measures, its statement was important because he did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pjongjang did in the past.
Ri was linked to the joint statement Kim Johng Una and Donald Trump from the first top between the current President of the United States and the North Korean leader, which took place on 12 June in Singapore, and then Kim committed himself to pursue the “nuclear disarmament of the Korean half” while Trump North Korea promised security.
North Korea wants the official conclusion of the Korean war, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States stated that Pjongjang had to renounce nuclear weapons first.
Washington also did not let the invitations to release strict international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
“The United States continue to pursue nuclear disarmament first and increase the pressures with sanctions to achieve their goals by force and even object to the announcement of the end of the war”, said Ri.
“When he thinks that sanctions can bring us to his knees, it's an unrealistic hope of people who don't even know us.
However, the problem is that the further implementation of sanctions continues to promote our untrustedness."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US President exposed at the United Nations Assembly at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun Je In, which took place in the past five months, and added: “If we were talking to South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have agreed to such dead points.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ria’s speech was completely different from that last year, when the General Assembly of the United Nations said that the attack on the U.S. intimate part of the United States with North Korean missiles was inevitable after the “gospodine of the wicked president” Trump Kim named“ a racket man ” on a suicide mission.
This year, the Trump, who threatened last year to “destruct fully” North Korea, commended Kim and his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said he was waiting for a lot of work and that sanctions must remain valid until North Korea is nuclearly disarmad.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there was no predicted time frame for this, and said: “Three may take two years, three or five months — that does not matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for the measures taken.
However, on Thursday, US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said to the United Nations Security Council: “The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue firmly without exceptions until we recognize the complete, final and verified nuclear disarmament status.”
The Security Council has adopted further sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent the financing of North Korean nuclear and balistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Rio at the edge of the General Assembly of the United Nations and later said Pjongjang would visit again the next month for the preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
On July, Pjongjang said that progress had been made, and North Korea has criticised him in a few hours, if its requirements were to be “gangster”.
At the meeting of the Mun in this month, North Korea committed its commitment to undermining the missiles testing stations and the nuclear test infrastructure if the United States adopt “suitable measures”.
Munu should say that with “suitable measures”, the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and the measures to normalize relations with Washington were considered.
Students of the University of Harvard visit a course where they learn how to take enough time to rest
The goal of the new year course at the University of Harvard is to teach all the graduate students how to afford more sleep. With this course, they want to fight the growing crustaceous culture of “complete ” teaching, with which the powers are collected with cafeine.
The university professor found that students of the world’s best university often do not know the basics of care for themselves.
Charles Cheisler, a medicinal professor at the Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Women's Hospital, has formed a course that, according to his first type in the United States.
In order to implement such a course, he decided after his class on the impact of the lack of sleep on learning.
After the lecture, a girl approached him and said: “Why am I going to know this just now when I am in the last year? ”
She said that no one ever told her how important sleep is.
The course that they conduct for the first time this year refers to the key importance of good sleeping habits for studying and sporting success, as well as to improving the general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatric professor at the Harvard Medical School and executive Director of University Health Services, says that such a course was decided when they found that the students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The Enourn course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, a picture of the doors of the student home where students can click on coffee cupcakes, curtains, sports copates and books to obtain information about the influence of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep lack on sports success and the importance of the sleeping routine.
In the second section, participants find that the long-term lack of sleep may increase the risk of heart failure, brain drop, depression and cancer.
The map of the student settlement with interactive participants' icons encourages thinking about their daily routine.
“We are aware that the behavior of students will not be changed immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know these facts, just as they have the right to know how smoking cigarettes affect their health,” adds Professor Cheisler.
Professor says that the culture of pride in “a survived full-night learning” is still present. It also adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students, resulting in lack of sleep, are increasing problems.
Professor Cheisler says that sufficient amounts of quality sleep should be “the secret weapons” of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety.
The 19-year-old California chemistry and physical biology student Raymond So helped professor Cheisler form a course. Last year, he attended one professor's lecture.
He says that the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct a course throughout the student settlement.
He hopes that at the next stage of the sub-diplomacy students will be able to ask for the completion of a similar study programme before they enter the competition institution.
Professor Cheisler recommends students to set up a sleeping buddy as well as awakement. He also wants to warn them of the harmful effects of the “blue light” that is transmitted by electronic screens and LED-lights, because they can cause an imbalance of circadiane rhythm, which makes it difficult to sleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with a hit drowned upe Gerrard's team
Rangers again defeated in guests: Dolly Menga in Livingstone, the proclaimed team Steven Gerrard condemned to be defeated by 1 : 0.
The Ibrox team has been hunting its first guest victory after February's victory at St. Johnstone stadium with 4 : 1 , but the team of Gary Holt has defeated her second defeat in 18 games since he was headed by Gerrard, with which his team for the leading Scotland League team remains 8 points.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the expiry of the first half-time, and the selected Rangers species had no impression that he wanted to equate.
The Rangers fell into a common place, and Livingston progressed to the third place, but with the differences of goals, the Hibernian team left behind.
Calum Spence, a side judge, suffered a head injury when he arrived from the city of the cheerleader's guest team after his reporting.
Gerrard was in the crew, who had been able to defeat Ayr and joined in the Betfred Cup halffinals, and performed eight changes.
On the other hand, Holt kept the verified Livingstone 11, who took the point to the Hearts team a week ago, and he was certainly thrilled about how his escaped team effectively neutralized all guest attempts.
The Rangers had a higher ball property, but Livingston had better use of it.
The first opportunity came for two minutes after the beginning, when Menga found Scott Pittman with the first brief report, he then went on Allan McGregor's naked, but the connection was incorrect and missed the opportunity.
The long free shot of Keaghan Jacobs then reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense assistant Alan Lithgow failed to naked.
In the last third, the Rangers took over control, but the game showed more hope than a real desire to win.
Alfredo Morelos was quite convinced that after the race with Steven Lawless after 15 minutes of the competition, a punishment shot should be reached, but Judge Steven Thomson had poisoned the Colombian's demand in the chale.
In the first half time, the Rangers were able to compose only two arrows on the naked, but not a head shot sent against the naked Lassan Coulibaly, nor the flipping ball of Ovie Ejari, they did not constitute any danger to the gateman of Liam Kelly.
Livingstone’s introductory naked in the 34th minute may have surprised everything, but he has already been fully earned because of endurance.
The Rangers failed to retrieve another Jacobs supplement with a long submission.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher balled to Scott Robinson, who made Mengi rutinally the report for a simple end of the attack.
Gerrard acted and replaced Coulibaly during his vacation with a wing player Ryan Kent, who immediately showed up with the Morrelos report, but Kelly efficiently ran off his line and blocked the attack.
Nevertheless, Livingstone continued his style and forced the guests into his game, while Lithgow and Halkett took care of more trails before the naked.
Holt's team could still increase the leadership at the end of the competition, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was untouched after the angle.
In Rangers, Glenn Middleton received a chance for a punishment shot after contacting Jacobs, but Judge Thomson didn't admit it.
Almanah: Inventor of Geiger's Counter
We present a page from our Sunday editions: 30 September 1882, which is now more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany, which later became a worldly famous physicist.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactiveness, and this invention was the basis for the development of a device called Geiger's number.
In the scientific world, he became a standing station, and he also received his city in pop-cultural, for example in the "Bells of Coronado" film in 1950, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played cowboy scientists:
The man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This is Geiger's number. It is used to search for radioactive minerals such as uran.
When you wear your listeners, you can hear the effect on the atoms of radioactiveness in materials.”
Evans: “Madonca, but now they are really responding! ”
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before the 63rd birthday.
But his name's invention lives on.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize the attack cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize the attack cells and destroy them
Therapeutic vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise the attack cells
This method includes the acquisition of immune cells of patients then modified into the lab
After that, they may see protein characterized for many cancer forms, then return to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancer diseases.
In one of the women who received the vaccine that the immune system learns to recognize the attack cells, the cancer on eggs disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method includes the acquisition of immune cells of patients transformed into the lab to “see” the HER2 protein which is characterised for many forms of cancer and then inject again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the American National Institute for Cancer Research in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine. ”
HER2 “incentives the growth of several different types of cancer”, including breast cancer, eggs, lungs and fat wombs.
Similar approach to acquiring immune cells of patients learning to target cancer cells has also worked in the treatment of the type of leukemia.
Kanye West after showing at SNL performed a protrumming point with the MAGA inscription on the cap.
The community was not thrilled
Kanye West was exposed in the Saturday Night Live studio by a miraculous point in which he expressed support to the US President Donald Trump, and also said that 2020 will be searched for a chair.
After the end of his third song, called "Ghost Town", he was wearing a hat with the "Make America Great Again", West started attacking democrats and reiterated his support to Trump.
"It often happens to talk to a white-pool person and he says to me, "How can you like Trump, but he's a racist?"
"Well, if I was concerned about racism, I should have moved out of America for a long time," he says.
This time the SNL show began with a parody with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywoodian player was declined from the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Commission for Justice in the Senate, which Christine Blasey Ford accused of sexual assault.
The video of West's monologist was not played, but a comic Chris Rock was loaded into the social network.
It's not known if Rock was going to make fun of it from West.
West also complained to the public that he had some problems in the back of the hat.
"They've got me behind the sandwich.
They told me, “Don't go to the hat. ”
I've been harassed!
But they say I'm lost," said Washington Examiner's report.
West continued: “Do you want to see the lost scene?” and added that he had to get himself a “Superman's blanket, because that means that no one can command me. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His comments prepared the public to whistle at least twice, and the members of the SNL team were apparently disturbed, and someone said to Vanity: “In the studio there was death silence. ”
West was invited to replace the goat for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boy, raper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West has caused many surprises already with a videospot for a song “I Love it” where he was wearing a bottle of mineral water mark Perrier.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the chief of the TPUS Conservative Group, which Tweeted: “One of the most brave souls: THANK YOU FOR THE PARAGE.”
The director of the talk show Karen Hunter said that West was simple “what it is, and that's all right.
However, I will NOT reward anyone (with the purchase of his music, clothing or supporting his “interests”), who, in my opinion, greets and extends ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And we also," she added.
Before the show, the raper on Twitter announced that he changed his name and then it will be “being formally known as Kanye West. Now I am YE.”
He's not the first musician who decided to change his name, but before him, Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His residence colleague Snoop Dogg once called Snoop Lion, but we cannot forget another musical legend: Prince turned his name into a symbol, and then he was an artist, once known as Prince.

The star of the Tron Game Kit Harrington has a sharp act against toxic manhood
Kit Harrington is famous by his sword in the role of Jona Snow in HBO's exciting medievally colored fantasy series Game of thrones.
A 31-year-old player who has strongly condemned a stereotype of a macistic hero says that due to the appearance of such roles in screened young boys often feel that respect can be earned with stubborn life.
Kit told the Sunday Times Culture that in his opinion, something went wrong, and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manship during the movement period #JazTudi.
The player, who recently married a 31-year-old partner from the Game of the Royal Throne of Rose Leslie, admitted that he has strong beliefs on this subject.
"I'm personally seriously wondering where we made a mistake at the time of manhood," he said.
“What have we taught men about the problems we are facing now?”
Kit thinks that the TV is partly responsible for increasing the toxic manhood because of showing very husbandly characters.
He continued: “What is born and learned?
What are we taught on television and on the streets that young boys feel that they have to choose this certain manship wage?
I think one of the important questions of our time is how can we change this?
Because apparently there was something wrong with young men.”
In the interview, he also said that after the end of the summer, he would not participate in the recording of any prediction or continuation of the Game of thrones, because he “conclosed from battles and horses”.
Kit will play in the main role of the new show of True West Sam Shepard on November, which is a story about the film producer and his brother's thief.
The player recently discovered that the best thing that happened because of the Game of thrones was that he met his wife in the video.
"For this series, I met my wife, so she kind of gave me my future family and life from here," he said.
Rose was in the fantastic series, rewarded with Emmy, playing Ygritte, the lovely defense of the Kite's character, John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/aids: Report from China of 14% new cases
China has declared 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS virus.
Health officials say that more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases have been reported.
In a large majority of new cases, the disease has been transmitted with sexual relations, which represents a change in comparison with the past.
Usually, HIV was rapidly spread in some parts of China due to the transfusion of infected blood.
However, according to Chinese health officials from the June Province Conference, the number of people infected by HIV has been reduced to almost nothing.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100 000 people annually in China.
Transfer of HIV with sexual relations in the Chinese community of LGBT is a very laying problem.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but the discrimination of people from the LGBT community is still very present.
Since conservative values are still applicable in the country, 70 to 90% of the men who have sexual relations with men are eventually married to a woman.
The disease is often transmitted because of inappropriate protection in sexual relations in such situations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government, as part of the efforts to solve the problem, has promised a common access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff have issued information on the Republican Senators, the conviction of “dangerous lies” and “theories of the conspiracy”
The American Congresswoman Maxine Waters rejected the charges on Saturday that the member of her staff published information on three American Republican Senators on their website in Wikipedia.
The Democratic Democratic in Los Angeles claimed that these accusations came from individuals and websites of the extreme right.
"Lies, lies and more inadmissible lies," Waters wrote in Twitter's statement.
The information published under the instructions include the local addresses and phone numbers of American Senators Lindsey Graham from South Caroline and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from the Utah Federal State.
Those data appeared on the website on Thursday, and the unknown person from Capitol Hill was published during the session of the Senate on the sexual suppression of the candidate for the Supreme Judge, Brett Kanaugh.
The information was derived after the three senators concluded with Kavanaugh's interrogation.
Conservative web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicate that through the IP address the source of the publication that is supposed to be linked to the office of Senator Waters and to conclude that information was published by one of the staff, reports Hill.
“This unfounded accusations are completely wrong and clean lies”, Waters continues.
"My employees, whose identity, personal data and security are in danger because of these false accusations, are not responsible for the recognition of these data.
These unreasonable accusations are completely unrealistic and pure lies.’
The statement of Senator Waters rapidly encountered criticisms online, including the former representative of the White House for Press, Ari Fleischer.
“From this denial of anger,” wrote Fleischer.
"This may mean that it is not from the right test for the Congress.
When you accuse someone of something he didn't do, he shouldn't show anger.
He can't resist.
And he must not doubt the motive of the one he accused him.
It must remain calm."
Fleischer compared Waters' response to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the fourth hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate, who is searching for the town of Waters at the interim elections, spoke through Twitter.
“If this is true, it is serious”, he said.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had informed the “suitable institutions and authorities of persecution in relation to these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be disclosed,” she continued, “and they will be responsible for all the acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and all of them.”
Johnny English again in action - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
The search for brands on Brexit in any new British movie has become traditional, and it also applies to the recovery of the Johnny English Action Comedy, which came to the first place in 2003 by Johnny English and continued in 2011 with Johnny English 2.
Will it be a fun satir about how bad we are, a new export opportunity for us?
Incompetent Johnny English with exhausted eyes and unusual grimas gets permission to mix the screws again; his name already indicates that it is a comic character created for a kinematographic audience in the Neanglish speaking areas.
It is an unfair secret agent who, despite his bizarre moves, contains a part of Clouseau, Mr. Bean and the smallness of the one who contributed to the last note of the Chariots of Fire at the ceremony at the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It is also based on a traveller and an international secret that Atkinson once played in a forgotten TV ad for Barclaycard, with a real chaos behind him.
In the latest film, one or two pleasant moments are presented.
I liked when Johnny English approached the helicopter, wearing a medium - century barn, and the rotor leaves were about a short time with his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for the comedy is clearly displayed, but humor seems a little mild and excessively unnecessary, especially because “real” films such as 007 or Mission cannot now offer comic elements without bad conscience.
It looks like the humor is intended for children and not as many adults, and therefore the refusal of Johnny English's adventures is not as innovative and directed as Atkinson's nemical scores are in the role of Mr. Bean.
The permanent theme is now obvious that Great Britain is in serious problems.
The Internet hacker has infiltrated the network of British most secret agents and has revealed the identity of all British agents, which caused great problems to the competent agent, who is a surprising little role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the point of breakdown for the premier, a familiar figure that has already experienced a fracture because of political unpleasure: Emma Thompson has tried to do so with the role of the suspected Teresa May, but there is nothing in the script that could help herself.
The Intelligence Service informs her that all active spys are exposed and must decide on one of the retired spys.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at a reputation school who teaches unofficially how to act under cover: here are scenarios hit, because English is performing some kind of spying rock academy.
They take the English to Whitehall to an emergency meeting where he meets a long-year-old colleague Bough played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a stereotic sports fan, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is just a little lost.
So Batman and Robin are ready to create more trouble on behalf of the secret service of her Majesty, and they meet the fatalist of Ophelio Bullet, who plays Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister has a dangerous impact on a carismatic technological billionaire who claims that he can solve the computer problems of Britain: this is the wicked Jason Walta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odessade: dressed in a candidate a fire in the French restaurant, they create a chaos when they prehotate on the roof of Walt's yacht, and when English attempts to use the glasses to seem reality to meet the inside of Walt's house, he can create a general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the sympathy and energy of the child's film.
Very average.
Like the other Johnny English movies, I can't help myself here and think: Is the British movie Atkinson able to play a role that actually justify his talent?
The labs deny that the British are planning a four-day working week, with a payment for the five-day working week.
The Laboratory Party, Jeremy Corbyna, thinks about a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive payment for five days.
The company's leaders wishes that savings created by businesses due to the revolution of artificial intelligence be transmitted to workers and allow them an additional day off.
So employees would enjoy the three-day weekend at the same high salary.
The sources say the idea is consistent with the economic plan of the party and the plans for the state to be placed on the side of workers.
The unions support the transition to the four-day working week, as this is the way that workers use the advantages of changing economy.
The source of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "The policy review should be published before the end of the year.
“Not going to happen overnight, but the four-week worker is the goal that we will strive to achieve by accessing the party to balance the economy for workers and the general industrial strategy of the party.”
The labour party would not be the first to support this idea, since the four-week working week in its campaign in the general elections in 2017, supported the Green Party.
This objective is not currently supported by the Laburist Party as a whole.
The representative of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy, and the party does not consider it.”
Cancler in the shadow John McDonnell used the labour conference last week to present his vision of socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to erase the power of the “disciplinary directors” and “containers” in communities.
The drafts of the Chancellor in the shadow also mean that the current shareholders in water companies may not regain the total share, as the labour party could introduce “exemptions” on the basis of alleged injustices.
He also confirmed the plans for the inclusion of workers in administrative committees and the introduction of ownership Funds, by which 10 per cent of the share in private companies would be transferred to employees that would receive annual dividends to 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, in the show “60 minutes” (“60 minutes”) discussed whether they could change their views of Kavanaugh's investigation carried out by the FBI.
The investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, which is being conducted by the FBI, has delayed the final vote of his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises a question whether the findings of the Office of any Republican Senator could convince the judge to withdraw his support.
In the interview carried on Sunday, the correspondent of the issue “60 minutes” by the Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could find anything that would change her opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than a colleague from South Caroline.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“Before the interrogation, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh
When I called him when this accusation appeared, I asked him, ‘ Did you do that? ’
He was determined, unlimited, unsubstantiated.’
And Graham's voice seemed stuck in a stone.
“I have created my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would need an extremely convincing reason to change it,” he said.
“ I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know the following: Brett denied it firmly, ” added Graham, mentioned Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the named ones could confirm this
It's 36 years old.
I do not see any new changes."
What is the Festival of global citizens (Global Citizen Festival) and has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual music event in which a really excellent type of stars is involved and which has the same excellent mission: to eliminate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will take place for a week, will be attended by ten thousands of people. They will sit in the Great Trail of the Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise interest in the real purpose of the event, i.e. the elimination of extreme poverty until 2030.
The Festival of Global Citizens, which began in 2012, is the enlargement of the Project of Global Citizens, an international defendant group who hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (except if you were willing to pay for the VIP ticket), participants of the concert had to perform a number of tasks or acts such as volunteer, a letter to the world leader, a telephone call or any other meaningful way to increase awareness of their goal to eliminate poverty.
But how successful is the movement of Global Citizen, which remains 12 years to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concert a way to convince them to require action, or is this just another example of so-calclictivism — creating a belief that people actually have an important impact on the situation with the signing of the online petition or by transmitting the Twitter?
The Global Citizen Movement states that since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters should be recorded in the effort to achieve a variety of different objectives.
It says that these acts have helped world leaders to adopt commitments and policies of over 37 billion USD, which would have affected the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In 2018, the group indicated that the fruitage of its acts should be 390 commitments and communications, on the basis of which it has already been paid or collected at least 10 billion USD.
The group estimates that the funds gathered have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key covenants are the Energy of Food (The Power of Nutrition), the partnership of investors and decision-makers committed to helping the children realize their full potential, which the Rwandas promised 35 million USD aid to help eliminate support after more than 4700 Twitters of global citizens were received.
“With the support of the United Kingdom Government, donors, national governments and global citizens such as you, we can redeploy the social innocence of sustainability in historical archives”, told the crowd at the concert in April 2018 Tracey Ullman, the Ambassador of the Power of Food.
The group also stated that the government, following more than 5000 acts made by the United Kingdom, called for improving mother and children's nutrition, had informed that it would co-financiate a project The Power of Food that would achieve 5 million women and children with food measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the Internet, “Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty? ”
The movement of the Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and hard way — sometimes we will fall and fail.
But both the great movement for civil rights and the fight against the apartheid ahead of us will work, as we are stronger together.
Among some of the performers that will be performed in New York this year are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae. The event will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy — the US Ministry of Internal Affairs for the “blocada” of Russian energy exports
The US Internal Minister Ryan Zinke was supposed to say, after the report of Washington Examiner, that Washington could use the navy to prevent the Russian energy market, including in the Middle East.
Zinke said that the Russian intermediation in Syria (it should be warned that lawful governments should be invited) is an excuse for the research of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy, as it is marketed in Eastern Europe in the south of Europe," he should say.
However, the functioner considers that there are ways and means to deal with it.
“United States can start this. The Navy shall ensure that our seaways are open and block them, where necessary, to prevent Russian energy from gaining into the market”, he said.
Zinke referred to the participant of the event hosted by the Union of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group referred to as the “glass of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, warning that he was actually the same.
“As regards Iran and Russia, the economic possibility of more or less impact on fuel and replacement”, he said, named Russia a “pony that knows one trick” with an economy depending on fossil fuels.
The statements were made at the time when Trump's administration seeks to increase the export of its exhausted natural gas to Europe, where it is intended to undermine Russia, which is a significantly cheaper choice for European consumers.
For this purpose, the officials of the Trump Government, including the US President itself, Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to renounce the “inappropriate” gasway project 2, which is supposed to be a “taker” after Trump Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the Northern Stream 2 gasway is worth 11 billion USD, which should double the existing gaswater capacity at 110 billion cubic meters, exclusively the economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington has violently opposed the project only for economic reasons and that it is an unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we have the same view that energy must not be a tool to carry out pressure and that consumers must have the right to choose suppliers," the Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said, after the September meeting with the US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany rejected the American position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leadership of the German industrial organisation, the Union of German industry (BDI), invited the United States to avoid interfering with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“Integrating the third country into our energy supply is a big problem for me”, after the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Dieter Kempf, head of the German industry Union (BDI).
Elizabeth Warren will "exactly study" her candidacy at the elections for the US President in 2020, says Massachusett Senator
Massachusett Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "exactly examine" her candidacy for the US President after the interim elections.
In the city house in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider a candidacy.
"The time is to go to Washington to women and repair our corrupt government, which requires a woman's leader," the officer of The Hill said.
"I will examine my candidacy for the President after 6 November."
Warren was congratulated by President Donald Trump at a meeting in the city's house because he was supposed to lead the country in the wrong direction.
"What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, I am terribly concerned," she said.
Warren has already criticised Trump and candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh sincerely.
In Tweet published on Friday, Warren said: “Of course, before elections, we need a FBI investigation. ”
The survey published on Thursday showed that most of its own voters believed that Warren should not be searched for the position of the President in 2020.
According to the suffolk Political Research Centre in the Suffolk/Magazine of Boston Globe, the senator should not be running for the president, eighty-fifty percent of the “probably” voters in Massachusetts.
Twenty percent of her candidature would support them.
The survey showed that the former governor Deval Patrick had greater support for the candidate, with 38 percent of the surveys, and 48 percent were to oppose it.
Other high democrats who would take respect for the candidacy in 2020 are the former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Beed, after the Associated Press report, said that it would be officially decided by January.
Sarah Palin mentioned post-traumatic stress disorder Track Palin at the meeting in support of Donald Trump
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq.
On Monday night he was arrested and accused of family violence
“As my own son ends with the experience of his return, he connects me to other families who face post-traumatic stress disorder and the measure of injury with which our soldiers return," he told the public at the meeting in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
She marked Palin's son's arrest as “the elephant in the salon ” and said that her son and other military veterans were returning to a number of modified, embarrassed, wondering where respect for what the soldiers and aircraft and all other members of the military were offering to the country.”
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska, and was accused of violence in the family with attack on a woman, obstacles in the report of violence in the family and possession of weapons in guilty, said Dan Bennett, a representative of the police station in Vasilla.
18 federal countries and Colombia County support the appointment of a new asylum policy
The 18 federal states and the Colombia District support the legal recognition of a new American policy that is denied the right to asylum to victims running from violence against gangs or violence in the family.
The NBC News Agency reported that representatives from 18 countries and the circuit were filled with judicial prescription on Friday in order to support the legal recognition of the policy.
The full name of the prosecutor in the lawsuit of Grace against the sessions, which the American Union for Civil Freedoms against Federal Policy has not issued, has not been published.
She said that her partner and “her violent sons, members of the gang ” abused her, but the American authorities rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was locked up in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace have described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which many asylum applications come from in the United States, as countries that constantly deal with the problems of gangs and violence in the family.
The new asylum policy of the United States has dismissed the decision of the Committee on the Calls of Immigrants, which is unsaved immigrant, fleeing from violence in the family, in 2014, allowed the application for asylum.
Public Prosecutor Columbia, General Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new policy “wisses the decades of state, federal and international law”.
“A federal law requires that all asylum requirements be assessed on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the application, and that type of prohibition is violated”, states the requested requirement in the Court.
The state prosecutors further indicated in the request that the policy that denied the immigrants' right to enter is harming the US economy, as they should be more likely to become entrepreneurs and should “require the necessary labour force”.
The General Public Prosecutor Jeff Sessions decided to immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims running from domestic violence and violence by June.
“Azil is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or membership in a single social group or political opinion”, said the Sessions on 11 June in its publication of policy.
Asylum was never thought of addressing all the problems, even serious problems that people faced every day around the world.
The number of victims in Palou has doubled, but there are desperate attempts of rescue to find survivors
The survivors were getting worse.
“The feeling is very tense,” said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, when she comforted her hot boy in the evacuation center in the dissolved city of Palo.
“Saviourers are carrying the bodies constantly.
It lacks clean water."
They seemed to be residents returning to ruined homes who were going through the wet stuff and trying to find anything useful.
There were hundreds of people and hospitals damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 were overloaded.
Some injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered the injury of his back and shoulder, were resting outside the military hospital in Paluo, where patients were treated on free from the persistent severe earthquake sun.
When he remembered the rape earthquake that shook the hotel room in the fifth floor where he was accommodated with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was compressed against the ruins of walls," Harris told the Associated Press Agency, and he added that he was with his family in town because of the wedding.
“I heard a woman calling for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe."
The US Ambassador accuses Chinese “surgery” with “propagand advertising”
One week after the publication of a four-sided announcement of the official Chinese newspaper in an American journal praised the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China of Peking accused the abuse of the American Propaganda Press.
The US President Donald Trump mentioned the last week's payable supplement of Chine Daily officer in De Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the Federal State of Iowa, after he accused China of interference in the US Congress elections on November 6th, which China denies.
The Reuters Agency reported that American federal officials Trump's accusation that Peking tried to interfere with the US federal elections described as a new phase in the increasing intense efforts of Washington to press China.
Although the announcement of ads to promote trade is common for foreign governments, Peking and Washington are currently complicated in a more intensive trade war in which they exchange their impacts by imposing customs on import products.
The Chinese reimbursement tariffs in the beginning of the trade war were to affect exporters in federal countries such as Iowa, supporting the Trump Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador in Chinese and former long-year governor Iowa, the chief exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Peking hurt American workers, farmers and companies.
China, recorded Branstad in the column in the Sunday edition of Officer Des Moines Register, “this oppression is now doubled by publishing propaganda advertising in our own free press”.
“In the expansion of propaganda, the Chinese government used a valuable American tradition of free speech and free press to publish a paid ad in Officer Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, you will see only a few other opinions on the papers in Beijing and no real reflection of the diversity of opinions made by Chinese citizens on the alarming Chinese economic paths, since the community is strictly supervised by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers rejected the offer for publication” of his article, although he did not indicate which.
The Republicans are losing voters before intermediate elections with a breakdown with Kavanaugh, warn the analysts
The analysts warn that the support of numerous most important Republicans who support and defend the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, despite a number of charges on sexual attacks, will be known in the arriving intermediate elections by losing elections.
Emotions are extremely high here, but most Republicans have already said that they want to continue voting.
This cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, a professor of politology at Maxwell University in Syracuse for the article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubts that the pressure of Senator Jeff Flake to investigate the FBI in the last minute will be enough to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it either tomorrow and not November” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a higher adviser and a national representative of the advanced MoveOn group on Friday, according to Washington Officer, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters sang “November is coming!” when they demonstrated in the senate hall, when the Republicans who supervise the Justice Committee decided to further support Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the New York Portal Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of democrats will overcome all the borders," Stu Rothenberg, non-party political analyst, told the journalists.
"People say they're strong now, and they hold it.
However, it could be even stronger, especially among the undefined voters in pred-spots and young voters aged 18 to 29 years old, who do not like the president, but do not choose often.”
Even before the public testimony of Ford, in which she detailed her charges for the sexual attack of the candidate for the Supreme Court, the analysts said that further Republican support could have negative consequences.
"This has become a big mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Council at the beginning of the last week.
"It's not only about the vote of the world or the final vote or the Kavanaugh's constraint; it's also the way the Republicans face the Republicans and how they treated Ford," Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities Group of the US, who supports democrats at elections.
But the Americans seem to be a little divided between whether to believe more in the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh, with a little more support for them.
The new YouGov survey indicates that 41 percent of the surveyers are sure or most believed in the testimony of Ford, and 35 percent said that they surely or most trusted Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh believed that it was likely or sure that he lied about Ford, and that said only 30 percent.
Following the pressure of Flake FBA, he is currently investigating the charges made by Ford, and at least one accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported in the Officer The Guardian.
Ford's last week before the Senate's judicial world, she witnessed that Kavanaugh, when she was 17 years old, attacked her.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her sex when they were at the party together during their study at Yale University in 1980.
The inventor of the world's Internet intends to start a new Internet to combat Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world's website, opens a starting company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Googlu.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company building on Berners' open-road platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee was kidding about the purpose of Inrupt "to overcome the world".
"We have decided to do this now," he said about the new company.
"He's playing for a historic moment."
The application uses the Solid platform technology that enables the user to create a ‘personal data storage storage storage’ or the sub
This may contain contact information, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser and at the same time.
The specificity of the personal data storage warehouse is that the user can fully determine who can access any information.
The company calls this “the personal authority of the data”.
The Executive Director John Bruce says that the idea of the company is to combine resources, processes and appropriate skills that will enable everyone to access the Solid platform.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few rented developers for the project and the community of volunteers programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications by using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group “with Facebook and Googlem are not talking about whether they could introduce a complete change that could dismiss all their business models overnight.”

Bernard Vann: Holiday of Victoria's cross from World War 1
In the home town for 100 years, Victoria’s crusade was celebrated to the only priest of the English Church that he gained as a warrior in the first world war.
Colonel Bernard Vann deserved a recognition on September 29, 1918 in the Belenglise and Lehaucourt attack.
But four days later he was shot by a shooter, so he never learned that this highest British military honour was given to him.
On Saturday, two Colonel's grandsons discovered a memorial stone on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the lawyers, Michael Vann, said that it was “extraordinously symbolic ” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s deed.
Following the report of Officer London Gazette, under Colonel Vann on September 29, 1918, he led his batalion through the Channel of St. Queenin “with a very dense fog and under the strong fire of the battlefields and machines. ”
Later, he planned against the shooting line and led the line forward with “the greatest heroism ” and then attacked the engineer and hit three members of the team.
Lieutenant Vanna was shot by a German shooter only a good month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of the old father were “something I know and I could never achieve, so he taught me humility. ”
With a brother, Dr. James Vann, the paradise was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt “happy to participate in this paradise, ” and“ that the courage of the true hero is reflected in the support that many people will express. ”
The enthusiasts of mixed fighting skills have been watching Bellator 206.
Imagine: You've been watching all night to watch the totally selled Bellator 206, then you can't see the main event.
The event in San Jose covered 13 fights, including six on the main parket, and was carried live in the United Kingdom on the 5th channel.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to see them, the audiences in the United Kingdom surprisedly found that the transfer was replaced by the playback of Puys Pep.
Many were not very enthusiastic because he remained awake by morning because of the struggle.
One of the enthusiasms described on Twitter a switch to the child’s painting as “some kind of painful joke. ”
“In accordance with the government Regulation, this content is not suitable at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to the child programme”, said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of the Belator Organisation for Market and Communication, when asked for transfer.
"Puisa Pepa, yes."
The President of the Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they were trying to adapt the schedule in order to include the United Kingdom viewers in the future.
"When I think about re-playing, I think that we could arrange this," Coker said.
"But then there is six o'clock on Sunday, and we will not be able to arrange this until Sunday after our time or Monday after them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, many messages were exchanged at the switch and not all were kind.
We tried to fix this problem; we assumed it was only a technical error.
However, the actual reason was a government regulation.
I can promise you that this won't happen again next time.
Instead of six, we will endure five fights — as usual, and we have tried to offer more than the expectations to worshipers, and we have recorded it.
This is a very ungrateful situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “minor. ”
Tom Daley, the Olympic flooder, said he felt less worthy because of his sexual focus — but it motivated him for success.
The 24-year-old said that “not everyone” as himself was conscious at the entry into high school.
During the first talk in the Desert Island Discs radio station 4, Lauren Laverne said that he had spoken about gay rights to give to others “the hope. ”
He also said that when he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympic Games decreased.
The regular leader of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, has been absent because of a multiple-month disease.
Daley, who appeared as an exemption in Laverne’s first show, said that he felt “no less valuable ” as everyone else, as“ it was not socially acceptable to have boys and girls. ”
He said: “To this day, these feelings of minority and difference are a real thing that gives me strength and persistence to achieve success. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said that he would not disappoint anyone who would finally learn about his direction.
Two times the bronch Olympic competitor became an influenced LGBT-right advocate and appeared this year twice at the Games of the Nations in Australia to invite countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy to speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give to others “the hope. ”
The three-fold world champion said that a romance with a man — an American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 — was “with surprise. ”
Daley and a winner who is older than 20 years old married last year, but she says that the difference in years was never a problem.
“When you are so young” — in the age of 14, the first Olympic Games took part, and three years later his father died — he said, it is difficult to find someone equal to age that would experience similar rises and falls.
The couple adopted the child, Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, June, and Daley said that he changed his whole view.
"If you asked me last year, all I would have to say would be "I must reach the gold medal," he said.
"But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son has the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011, 40 years old, because of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father didn't accept that he had to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether he had tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the first row.
I couldn’t say to him: “This time you won’t be in the first row, Dad, ” he said.
"I held him for my hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I had to finally admit that he was not impressive," he said.
Next year, Daley competed in the Olympic Games in 2012 and reached a bronze medal.
“I knew that this was what I dreamed about all my life — to flood in the Olympic Games in front of the local community. There was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired his first choice of song — Heather Small’s Music Stream, followed by the preparations for the Olympic Game and still boiling his skin.
Desert Island Discs is played at BBC Radio 4 every week at 11.15 (BST).
Unprepared Mickelson, Saturday Ryder's scattered
The American Phil Mickelson will make a record on Sunday when he's playing his 47th game in Ryder's cave, but he's gonna have to get back to the form so that it doesn't become an unfortunate frontier.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event for the records of 12 times, Captain Furyk left seats on Saturday four.
Instead of being in the center of the event, as often as for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day partly as a fan and parts in improving his game to fix what it is heavily demanding.
Since even on the top of the career has not been the most straightforward, the 48-year-old does not fit the best narrow game Le Golf National where the long ice is inevitablely punishing missed strikes.
And if only the playground wouldn't be enough frightening, Mickelson will have a deal with the exact winner of Britain Open Francescom Molinarius, who was in a victory in all four games this week with the newsman Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans who have four less games at the beginning of 12 games of individuals were to start a good start, Mickelson's game could prove to be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he didn't say much.
"He fully understood the role he had today, he had me on his back and hugged me with his hand and said he was ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"There's a lot of confidence in the village.
He's one of the famous ones, and in the past, and also this week he made great contributions to the teams.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but it worked out and we thought it was necessary to do so.
He wants to play, just like everyone."
Mickelson's gonna break Nick Fald's record on Sunday for the largest number of runs played in the Ryder Cup slaughter.
This could have marked the conclusion of Ryder's career cake, which never really matched with the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven equations, but Furyk said his presence in the team also brings some inconvenient benefits.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he loves being a fool of people and it's wonderful to have it in the team space," he explained.
"I think the young players had fun with him this week, which was fun to see."
It gives much more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon be scattered
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, from experience, knows that an important advantage at the beginning of the last day of the games of individuals in Ryder's cattle can easily be converted into an unpleasant ride.
The young Danec debited in 1997 at the Valderrama competition, where the captain of Seve Ballesteros had five points of advantage before the Americans, with its goal, with the advantage only for hair, with the result of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"Do not forget that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but barely," said Bjorn (in the picture) after the review of Class of 2018 , who won with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and led Le Golf National playground with 10-6.
So history tells me and everyone in the team that the cake is not over.
Play full tomorrow.
Go and do whatever you need.
It's not over until that's what it says on the board.
We have a goal to win this scatter, and we have to stay focused on it.
He says all the time that I focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know well who stands on the opposite side — the best players in the world.”
Bjorn added: “I would never have hurried over there.
It'll be a different day tomorrow.
Tomorrow the game will be in front of individuals, so it will have to be done differently.
It's nice to have a partner when things go well, but when you're alone there, your skills of golfists are tested to the end.
This is a message you have to pass to the players: Tomorrow you have to extract the best.
Now leave your partner behind, and he also has to extract the best out of himself.”
In contrast with Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played as a partner, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who reached three points from four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of the last day, because he was part of a victory team in Brooklyn before he ended as a defeat when Europe performed the "The Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every surprised word," he replied when they asked him how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, brought his players to the last day of the competition.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important runs, but we would like to start as fast as we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When this start gets persistence, it is strongly pressured on middle games.
We created the appropriate setup and set the boys in a way, until we felt that we would do something magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the battle and combat Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the upper half of the sort of order.
“In this group of boys, I have decided for this kind of order because I think it covers all the schedules,” said Bjorn about the choice of individuals.
New German warship retired
The latest fregate of the German Navy should be transferred to the use of 2014 to replace older warships from the cold war, but due to system disorders and rapidly growing costs, local communities reported.
The transfer of the ship ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leading ships of the new class fregat Baden-Wuerttemberg, is now translated to the first half of 2019, says Officer Die Zeit, who indicates a military representative.
The sailing should join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project pestises concerning issues after delivery.
Four boats of Class Baden-Wuerttemberg, ordered in 2007, will be replaced by the older Bremen class fregat class.
It is expected that they will have a strong top, type of anti-Aviation and anti-laid shooting and some covering technologies, such as radar, infrared and acustical signature.
Other important characteristics include longer intervals between maintenance – the latest fregates should stay outside the domestic port for up to two years.
The continuous delays, however, mean that the top warships that would allow Germany to influence oversea by its power, until the start of use, have already become older, states Die Ziet officer.
The unfortunate F125 fregate appeared last year on the covers when the German Navy officially rejected the capture of the ship and returned to the Blohm & Voss ship in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the ship after the supply.
The reasons for reimbursement are not known, but the German communications indicated a number of key “programme and technical deficiencies” that would have caused the warship to be unused if it was directed to the battle mission.
The deficiencies of the software equipment were particularly important because the ships of the Class of Baden-Wuerttemberg will manage the crew with approximately 120 sailors – only half of the workforce on the older fregats of the Bremen class.
It also proved that the ship is very heavy, which reduces its capacity and limits the navy's options for its future upgrade.
The 7000-tonne boat Rheinland-Pfalz should be twice harder than the ships of a similar class that the Germans used in the second world war.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the price of the entire project, including the training of the crew, has also become a problem.
This should reach EUR 3,1 billion ($3,6 billion) from the starting EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest fregats are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the naval power of Germany is declined.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy is actually "without ships suitable for direction."
The official said that the issue was eventually aggravated because the old ships were degraded and the replacement vessels were not guaranteed.
He regretted that no ship from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund is listening to the secret life of the netopiers
A new study in Scotland’s landscape has been conducted in which they are trying to find out how netopurs use food to hunt food.
They hope that the results will reintegrate the behavior of these unique flying suckers and help direct future preservation activities.
In the study, Scientists of the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small netopias and tiny nettopires and brown arrested netopias and circuit nettories in the property of Inverewe Gardens in the Wester Ross area.
In key places of property, special recorders will be placed to monitor the activities of non-topiers throughout the entire season.
The NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using manual detectors.
The struggling audio analysis of all videos will confirm the frequency of calls of non-topiers and what kinds of things they do.
Then they will prepare a habitat map and a report to create a detailed picture of their behavior throughout the province.
Rob Dewar, NTS advisor for nature maintenance, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitats are the most suitable for netopias and how each individual species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management of habitats such as the creation of grass and the maintenance of forests for netopiers and other related species.
The number of netopriers in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has been significantly reduced in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects refugees and loss of the habitat.
Risks also represent wind turbines and lights, as well as flying and some types of chemical processing of construction materials, as well as house cat attacks.
They're not really blind.
But because of the night habits of hunting, they help themselves more with their ears than with their eyes.
For a precise determination of errors and obstacles on the flight, they use a precise echolocation technique.
NTS, responsible for providing more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76.000 hectares of the country, takes the netopia very seriously.
He hires ten experts regularly carrying out research, shelter reviews and occasional rescue.
The organization owned Threave in the Dumfries and Gallovey area even the first and for now the only Scottish reserve, especially for the netopirs.
The owner of the property, David Thompson, says the property is a perfect land for them.
"In Threavo we have an excellent area for netories," he said.
“We have old buildings, many ancient trees and all quality habitats.
However, there is still a lot of familiarity on the netopias, so the work we do here and on other propertys will help us better understand what they need to do to achieve.”
He emphasized the importance of verifying the presence of nettopiers before the implementation of the maintenance parts on the property, since possible unwanted destruction of one childbirth can cause death to 400 females and young men, which may mean a decline in the entire local population.
They are protected, so they are forbidden to be murdered, oppressed or disturbed and also prohibited to destroy their families.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scott leader of the Storage Fund, has encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said: “We still have to learn a lot about our netopias and we just don't know how well their population is. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges and attorneys are preparing for the German magazine's lawsuit
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated rape charges that he was supposed to be wronged as “fake news” and said that people would want to “promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine with the news of Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The attackers of Portugal and Juventus were accused that in 2009, in the hotel room in Las Vegas, he raped the American woman named Kathryn Mayorga.
Der Speegel reported on Friday that he would then pay $37,000 for the silence of the event.
In the invitation of 142 million followers in Instagram Live video several hours after the report, Ronaldo, 33, marked the reports as “fake news”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said were false news,” said five times the Golden Ball winner in the camera.
“With my name, they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which belongs to the work I do.
I am a happy man, and I wish all good," a smiling player added.
Ronald's attorneys are preparing to sue the Der Spiegel magazine for the charges referred to as “inappropriate reporting of suspicions on private life”.
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the player would require compensation for “indefeated damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the past years.”
The alleged incident was to happen in June 2009 in the hotel hotel Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
In the documentation incorporated at the District Court of Clark in Nevada, after meeting in the Majorgo Night Club with Ronald would return to the player's room, and it should be analytically raped there.
Mayorga claims that after this event, Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her he was “99% good man” that was disappointed only in“one percent”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo has confirmed sexual relations, but he described it as an agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she was headed to the police and that the hospital had taken photos of her injuries and later agreed for an outstanding settlement, because she was “scared of revenge” and was concerned with“ public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old claims that he wants to dismiss the settlement, since the suspecting event continues to have a severe trauma.
Ronaldo was at the time of suspecting attack just before the Real Madrid transition to Manchester United, and this summer, according to an agreement worth 100 million dollars, moved to the Italian giant Juventus.
Brexite: The United Kingdom would regret the loss of car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom would “regret forever” if after the brexite lost the status of the leading world car manufacturer, the Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “restraining” that the Toyota UK for BBC said that the exit of Great Britain from the EU without an agreement would temporarily stop production in the Burnastone factory, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delay on the border in the case of brexite without agreement could lead to the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston factory produced by Toyotina models Auris and Avensis has produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the remaining European Union.
"I believe that if Britain exits from the European Union by the end of March without an agreement, the production in our factory would be stopped," said Marvin Cooke, Toyotin administrative director at Burnaston factory.
The concern of how the exit from the European Union without an agreement will affect cross-border trade has also been expressed by other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Hondo, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, the BMW said that after Brexit, for a month, it would close its Mini factory in Oxford.
The main thoughts relate to what car manufacturers call risks related to the supply chain in the case of brexite.
Toyot's production line operates under the principle ‘in the right time’, with parts of the suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for cars on order coming every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom exited from the EU on 29 March without an agreement, this could cause disturbances on the borders that representatives of the board say that they could cause delays and lack of parts.
Toyota could not be stored in its factory in Derbyshire for more than one day, said the representatives of the company, so the production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely moderate to avoid such border checks".
“We need to reach a deal. We want to reach the best arrangement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success but to grab this opportunity”, he said on Today BBC Radio 4.
“It is not only Toyote, but also other producers that we must be absolutely capable of continuing a highly successful set of supply chains.”
The Toyota company could not comment on how long the production would be stopped, and she warned long-termly that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of the union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, the lost job is never returned.”
The government representative said: "We must present a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be transferred again, says the White House
The important meeting of Donald Trump with the Deputy General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be “presented for another week,” said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein controls the work of a special advisor Robert Muller, who studies Russian eligible interference, links between Trump's colleagues and Russia and the potential president's obstacle to the judicial authorities.
The question of whether Trump will forgive the Secretary-General's attorney and threaten Mueller's independence is that it's been powering Washington speakers for months.
In the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of a tape device to record talks with Trump and the possibility to remove the President on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denyed the report.
Last Monday, he visited the White House, in the middle of the reporting that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was declared Thursday at the United Nations conference in New York.
Trump said that Rosenstein “will not be forgiven ” and then the meeting was transferred to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the Trial Committee of the Senate, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of inappropriate sexual behaviour, Dr. Ford.
On Friday, Trump appointed a united investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which also postponed the vote of the Senate.
Trump's press agent, Sarah Sanders, showed up in Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not yet specified, and it could have happened this week, according to all the other things in the Supreme Court, but it could be postponed for another week.
We will see. I always like to make sure you're informed."
Some rapporteurs would object to this, and Sanders didn't call for a meeting of the White House with journalists since September 10th.
Chris Wallace's broadcast manager asked her why.
Sanders said that the rare meetings were not going to resist TV rapporteurs, but she said: "I couldn't deny them to be placed."
Then she mentioned that direct contact between Trump and press would increase.
"The President performs more press conferences than any president before him," she said, "We have looked at numbers without a source."
The meetings will continue to take place,” said Sanders. "If journalists can address the President of the United States directly with their question, this is infinitely better than being discussed with me.
We are trying to make this possible and you have seen that we have done this often in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference on which you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with guests.
The independent press conferences are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why, when he appeared loosely and partially bizarrely before the gathered journalists.
Letter from the EU Health Minister in NHS Scotland concerning the fears related to brexite
The Minister for Health wrote to the EU staff working at the Scotland NHS that he would express his appreciation for the country and the desire to continue the work after the brexite.
Jean Freeman, SME, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom exit from the European Union.
The Scotland government has already committed to paying the costs of applications for the organisation of the status of EU citizens working in its decentralized public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “In the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued on the exit, when the decision was approached, this autumn.
However, the United Kingdom government has also accelerated preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know it must be a time of great concern for all of you.
Therefore, I want to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution of each staff regardless of its nationality.
Colleagues from all the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health sector and benefit the patients and the communities we provide.
You can feel perfectly home in Scotland. We really want to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie urgently operated after head injury
The line supporter of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, after injury to the head in the Saturday defeat with 31:27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores team, passed an urgent operation, reports Mike Organ from The Tennessean.
The Chief Coach of the Tennessee State University told the journalists that the injury occurred just a few months ago.
“He came to the edge of the playground, and it was kind of ruined there, ” said Reed.
Coaches and medical staff provided Abercrombie on the edge of the field with oxygen before they put him on the noses and took him out of the playground for further review.
The official of the Tennees State University told Chris Harris from the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie is recovering after the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that “details of type/scope of injury are not yet known” and that the Tenneese State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is currently bruc at the university, plays for the Tenneese State University for the first time after the transition from the university to Illinois.
On Saturday, he experienced five hits together before he left the game, which increased his total number of hits in the season to 18 hits.
Foreign customers will be charged with a higher fee when buying real estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign customers will be charged with a higher fee when buying real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used in order to help homeless.
The move will neutralize the success of Corby's efforts to attract young voters
Increased quantities will be charged by those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The treasury expects to gather up to 120 million pounds a year, to help the homeless.
Foreign customers will be charged with a higher quantity in the United Kingdom when they buy real estate and the money will be collected to the homeless, today Theresa May will be informed.
The move should be considered as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremio Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide price-available apartments and greater taxation for persons with high income.
The increased quantity will be charged to persons and companies not paying tax in the United Kingdom and will encourage government efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The fee, which will be charged by the current collapse, including the increased levels introduced two years ago for other homes and property for delivery, could amount to not less than three per cent.
The stockholder expects the introduction of a measure to gather up to 120 million GBP per year.
According to the estimates, the non-State of the United Kingdom should buy 13 percent of the newly built london real estate, resulting from the increase in prices and the heavier purchase of the first real estate.
Many rich areas of the country — especially in the main city — have become “doms of ghosts ” because the number of buyers who spend most of their time outside the country is increasing.
The new policy was adopted only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called on to reduce the bunch so that young people could easily buy their first home.
The large construction firm has accused the price increases by robbing the land that they actually do not use, and Mrs. Mayevo called on to leave quotas for pricely accessible apartments to repair the British “housing shame”.
Mr. Corbyn foretold a attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and ending of forced expulsions without mistakes.
Furthermore, he wants to share greater powers to build new homes to the city.
Ms. Mayeva said: “In the past year, I said that I would devote my premier leadership to the renewal of British dreams — that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means repair of our non-operating housing market.
Great Britain will always be open for people who want to live here, work and create their life.
However, it cannot be right for those who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies to buy home is as simple as for the British Garay citizens.
For too many people the dreams of their own home are all too far away and the humiliation of homelessness remains too real.”
Jack Ross: “My final goal is to manage the Scotland Club”
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his “final goal” is once to become the Scotland Club Manager.
The 42-year-old Scott enjoys the challenge of renewing the North-East Club, which currently sits the third place in the First League, with three points less than the first-classed.
At the Stadion of Light he moved this summer after St. Mirren took again to Scotland's championship in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I got a B cap, and that was it," Ross said about the BBC Scotland's Sportsound show.
“But I grew up with a frequent observation of Scotland in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that dragged me back.
This opportunity would only be offered to me if I had been successful in the club management.”
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the Alloa Athletic team, who had already rejected the offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, said that he had not felt fear as heir of such great names.
“The success is measured to me with the question ‘Can I take this club again to the First League?’."
According to the structure and capacity, this club certainly belongs to the First League," he said.
"The journey to there is not easy, but it would probably be considered successful only if the club could take it there again."
Ross has only been doing the work of the manager three years after the Assistant Chief in Dumbarton and he was part of the Hearts Coach for 15 months.
Alloi then helped prevent the fall in the third League, and St. Mirren led from the edge of the fall to the title of the championship in the next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever during playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
“It was probably a real breakthrough”, he recalled the Alloe's receipt.
“I was truly convinced that managering was the right thing to me, much more than playing.
It sounds ridiculous, because I was doing good as a player, and I've been living well, and I've also achieved some more success.
But the game can become necessary.
There are many things to be faced every week.
In this regard, in the sense of stress and pressure at work, I still face myself, but the management simply feels like the right thing to myself.
I always wanted to run the club, and I do that now. In my skin, I now feel more comfortable in my entire adult life.”

Research results: ideal beer time is on Saturday 17:30
The summer heat has increased revenues of hard-beating British pubs, but the pressure on the chains of restaurants has also increased.
In July, pubs and bar groups increased sales by 2.7 per cent, but the revenues of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business advisor of CGA, who prepared the data, said: “The persistent sun time and participation of England in the world’s cattle that lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar sample as June in the past month when the arrival of pubs increased by 2.8 percent but that the restaurants were even stronger.
Traffic fall in restaurants for 1.8 per cent in June has also increased in July.
Traffic in pubs and drink bars increased more in comparison than the traffic in restaurants has been reduced.
The solar weather also reduced sales in pubs offering mainly food, but not as dramatic as in restaurant managers.
Looks like people just wanted to go drink.
In various pubs and bars, the sale of drinks in one month increased by 6.6 per cent and food sales decreased by three per cent.”
Paul Newman, analyst group for free time and hospitality of RSM, said: “The results continue the trend we have observed since the end of April.
The largest factor of time and impact of major social or sports events remains in the sale market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups continue to fight, although the fall of 4.8 per cent at the intermediate level will be particularly painful due to continuous costs.
For food owners of a long hot summer could not come at a more bad time and only time will tell whether the recovery will be necessary to bring the moderate temperatures that we experienced in August.’
The total sale in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7%, which indicates a slow inclusion of trade marks.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sale criteria in the pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyses data on the performance of 47 business groups with a total transport of more than 9 billion pounds and has been introduced by an industrial reference.
One of the five children in the social network has a secret account hiding from their parents
Research showed that one of the five children — some of them only 11 — are a secret account on the social network that hides from parents and teachers
A survey among 20,000 students showed the growth of false Instagram pages
The news strengthened fears of proclaiming sexually related contents
Twenty percent of the students said they had a “main” account intended for their parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, create an account that is hiding from their parents on social networks.
A survey among 20,000 students showed the rapid growth of false Instagram accounts.
The news strengthened the fears of proclaiming sexually related contents.
Twenty percent of the students said that they manage the censured “main” account that they show to their parents and have private accounts.
The mother, who ran into a secret page of 13 - year - old daughter, noticed that her daughter invites visitors to rape her.
The research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK Network and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of independent schools showed that 40 percent of 11 to 18 years have two profiles and half of them recognizes the private account.
The President of HMC Mike Buchanan said: “It is anxious that so many teenagers face temptation and create a web space where parents and teachers can't find them. ”
Eilidh Doyle will be “glass athletes” at the Scotland Athletic Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scotland Athletic Committee as a non-executive director of the annual General Assembly of the Administrative Committee.
Doyle is the most elevated Scottish athlete in the field and on free and President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who direct sports to use its extensive experience at international level in the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and World Athletic Community. We are convinced that the athletic in Scotland, with its involvement in the committee, would have gained hugely,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am thrilled to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope that I can actually contribute and help to the Sportsmanship in Scotland.”
The American , who won from the total four Olympic Medals at 200 meters and 400 meters on the Olympic Games in 1996 in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, left without speech after a transitional ischemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: “From a month ago, I was hit by a drop.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I could recover and how much.
It was hard work, but I was completely recovering, learning to walk again, and today I exercise training for agility!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!"
The ad for the breast pump comparing mothers with cows shared online opinions
The company that produces breast pumps shared opinions with an ad that compares mothers with cows in the mud.
For the start of the marketing of “first silent breast pump”, Elvia has published a provocative musical ad that would show to mothers all freedom that the aid allows.
Four real mothers dance in the company of cows in the tree, filled with shadow, on a song that includes the following word: “Yes, I push myself, but there is no tail,” and “If you haven't noticed, these are not my seats, these are my boobs.”
The collector continues: “Don't exhaustion, exhaustion, I feed babies, exhaustion, I'm harassing breasts. ”
However, the announcement published on the Facebook website has caused a lot of distraction on the Internet.
At 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, he received mixed reactions from the viewers, while many said that he was joking on the account of the milk industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they are pregnant and hot to produce milk, but their children will be stolen in the first days of the cottage," said one.
Elvie's ring pump is discreetly fitted in breast-feeder (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Of course, it is traumatic for both, mother and a young man.
But why not use them to advertise the breast pump for mothers that keep their children?’
Someone added: “The ad is absolutely without feelings. ”
Others praised the ad, and one of the women admitted that she seemed like a song “to crush for funny. ”
"I think that's a brilliant idea.
I would have bought her too if I still had breasted.
When I was pushing, I felt just like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I understood it, just as it was thought.
This is a brilliant product," the second wrote.
Someone commented: “This is a funny ad that aims at mothers who are exhausting milk (often at work or toilet) and feel like cows. ”
This is not an ad that would praise or condemn the milk industry.’
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that they were dancing with hidden pumps in the bruise.
The concept of the action is that many women who push breasts say they feel like cows.
Elvie Pump pump is totally silent, has no wire or tubes and is discreetly fitted in breast-feeding, which allows women to move, hold the baby and even to work free during the milk pumping.
Anne Balarin, a partner and ECD in mothers, further commented. “Elvia Pump is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a daring and provocative presentation.”
With a stream of comparison between women who push milk and cows of milk, we wanted to put in the lightlight the drawing of milk and all its challenges, while in a fun way that women can connect, to show an incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first case when Elvie's pump came to the covers.
During the London Sunday Mode, the mother of two children on the model path walked to form Marta Jacobowski when she used the product.
Thousands of children migrants quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained children of migrants has risen strongly, even if the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because the grave rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made children more difficult to transfer to sponsors.
The majority of undocumented migrant sponsors are traditionally concerned, so they fear to threaten their own opportunities to stay in the country by request for the child.
The risk increased on June when the federal authorities were informed that potential sponsors and other family members of the household will have to give fingerprints and that the data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high official at the Immigration and Customs Agency, witnessed before the convention that the agency arrested more than ten people who asked for sponsoring adolescents without accommodation.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrests had no previous criminal evidence.
“Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or household members of the sponsors are illegal in the country, and many of them are criminally punished foreigners.
Therefore, we continue to look for these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
In order to address children faster, the officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month after they were detained and not after 60 days of the previous standard, workers in the shelter said.
Many will appear with a video conference call, not personally to defend themselves against the immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for aid will be expelled quickly.
The longer the children in detention are more likely to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent explosions or escape attempts after the statements of workers in refugees and reports in the system in recent months.
The defenders said that these concerns were larger in larger institutions, e.g. Tornill, where the signs of child’s tribulation due to their size were likely to remain undetected.
They added that the move of children into the city of tents, without being emotionally prepared or given them an opportunity to speak from friends, to confuse a trauma that many of them face.
Syria calls for American, French and Turkish “occupational forces” to withdraw immediately
In the invitation of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moul called on the Syrian refugee to return home, even though there has been a war for eight years in the country.
The Moule, who also performs the tasks of the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces on the Syrian ground are illegal, under the claim of fighting terrorism, and that “their will also act accordingly with them. ”
“Instantly and withoutconditionally, they must be withdrawn” he said to the congregation.
He said that “the war against terrorism ” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011, and millions had to leave homes,“ almost finished. ”
He said that Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we clean up the Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and“ any illegal foreign presence. ”
The United Nations has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria who are primarily training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Basar Al Asad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war of the dispersed state.
With regard to refugees, he told Moul that the conditions for them were suitable for return, and extended “some Western states” to “proliferation of unreasonable fears” that the refugees persuaded to remain abroad.
“International Community and Humanitarian Organizations we have invited them to contribute to their easier returns,” he said.
"They change into the political issue, which should be exclusively a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria not to receive renewable resources until Assad and the opposition reach a war-ended agreement.
The United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a tamponic zone in the last important rebel rebel rebellion, Idlibu, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented the extensive attack of Syrian forces supported by Russia from a province in which three million people live.
However, Moul stressed that the agreement had a clear hand, and expressed the hope that military intervention would be focused on the Džihadist, including the Fronte Nusra fighters associated with Al Kaido, which would be “eradiated.”
The Member of the United Nations, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that he will soon convene the first meeting of the new committee composed of the government and opposition to prepare a military constitution for Syria and press the way to elections.
He defined the conditions of the Syrian Government for the participation in the committee, saying that the work of the committee should be limited to the “review of the members of the current constitution” and warned before interference.
Why Trump will reach the second mandate
After this conclusion, Mr Trump will win on the re-electoral elections in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, his presidentship will soon end with interpelation and scandal.
Which would, without doubt, be “the most dramatic finals of the presidentship ever! ”
There's no sign of the audience's tiredness for now.
Since 2014, the CNN perspective was more than doubled by 1.05 million during the maximum view, while the MSNBC view was almost tripped to 1.6 million.
The Fox News channel has an average of 2,4 million viewers in the highest visibility, which is more than four years ago, when he had 1.7 million, and the The Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC channel reached the largest number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers at night’s important news.
“This is a fire that attracts people because it is something we don't understand,” said Neal Baer, director of the drama “Designated Survivor” (Designed survivors), about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a recognised comedian and author of the book “Only funny parts: and a few hard truths about shining in the Hollywood Boys Club,” offers a different explanation.
It is recalled to take a taxi ride in Boston before the elections in 2016.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
The chaos is a fun value.
Of course, contrary to what it looks like on TV, the Washington story could decide about the future of Roe v. Wade case, given whether immigrant families can be reunified and healthy of the global economy.

When I talked to Mr. Fleiss this week, he was outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai of sun 80 degrees (26.7 °C), but he was screwed inside of the MSNBC watching when he filmed CNN.
He could not distract himself even when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in the air.
"I remember that we created all these crazy shows at that time and people said, 'This is the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

External money is drawn up in preparing for the closest intermediate elections
It is not surprising that in the 17th Pennsylvania district, the flood of money was observed because two candidates found themselves in the same seat.
This has recently been a home of a Democratic Representative, Conor Lamb, who won his seat on special elections this spring in the second district.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents an old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is strongly covered by the new 17th district.
The tickets have been drawn newly when the Pennsylvania Supreme Judge of January condemned that the old districts have been contrary to the Republicans.
The new 17th district competition touched the fight to finance the campaign between the main party's financial bodies, the Congress Committee for Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in broadly monitored march special elections for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This seat was held by the Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political comments award a slight privilege to the Democrats.
In the United States, sanctions against Salvador were being considered for the support of China, and then they retired.
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Peking, at just a few oppositions from Washington.
Mr Trump had a warm meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Varelo in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump organization.
The officials of the Foreign Ministry have decided to revoke the American leaders of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panami RRD 'The recent decision to cease recognition of Taiwan'', said Heather Nauert, representative of the Ministry in the beginning of the month.
However, the sanctions were considered on Salvador, which, according to the estimates of 2017, received 140 million USD US aid, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions that included the restriction of financial assistance and the targeted limitation of visa issuing would have a strong impact on this Mediterranean country with high unemployment and the number of murders.
During the internal meetings, the North American and Mediterranean officials postponed a high-level conference intended for security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration in the direction of the United States.
By mid-September, the highest government officials explained that they wanted the conference to continue and thus concluded their opinion on the penalties for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now obliged to convene the participants of the conference, which is now planned for the mid-October, which is a sign of the importance that the US government assigns to the meeting, were added by diplomats.
Three American ambassadors returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new strong communications or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House for Mr. Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss them under the conditions of anonymity.
Their testimony has been confirmed by an external analyst near the government and has also spoken about it under the conditions of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be the report of a special advisor Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle of the judicial authority, which is now in public records a very large number of evidence.
Mr. Mueller should also focus on whether Mr. Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in the attack on American elections.
If the Congress changes his hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer before the authorities, and perhaps even before the jury of his colleagues when he is preparing to reconcile his voters.
There are a lot of questions and I don't want to claim that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, and also not his colleagues in Europe.
On both sides of Atlantic, we will have to take decisions that will affect how long the fight could be.
In 1938 the German officials were willing to strike Hitler if the West resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Münchn.
We failed to miss the opportunity to avoid the years of worship that followed.
This type of breakdown changes the flow of history and accelerates or inhibits the indifferent democracy course.
The Americans are dealing with more of these breakthroughs right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires the Deputy General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, a man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in the barrel since this officer reported that last year he proposed a secret recording of the president and speculated his inappropriateness for this position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Officer's report was incorrect.
"How will we respond if the requested investigation of the FBI Brett Kavanaugh will not be exhausted or fair or if he is appointed as a Supreme Judge despite the credible charges of sexual attack and false testimony?
And in particular, will we vote in interim elections for a convention that will require Mr. Trump's responsibility?
If we fail in these trials, there's a long winter democracy waiting for.
But I'm sure we're not going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Judy, deported by the same Nazi regime in Auschwitz, which once seated my ambassador home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she ordered me to burn sabbath candles on the swastick table.

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic before facing Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and it is clear that they will be defeated by the Austrians after the impressive removal against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month in a convincing position for qualification from the Group of the European League.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from appearing before the season with 2:2 against Villarreal, but believes that the Rangers can use it as an accommodation for greater achievements.
“It was an earned point for us because Villarreal is a strong team,” said a 31-year-old.
“We have entered into the conviction that we can achieve something and take the point.
Perhaps we could eventually play a victory, but in general, it is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we showed up and were better sides in the other half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope that we can get three points, but this will be a hard game because the last game has achieved a good result, but I'm sure with a crowd behind us that we can try and achieve a positive result.
Last year, it was certainly difficult, in view of everything that happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place now.
The team is good, and the boys really enjoy; training is good.
I hope we can continue now, leave the last season behind us and achieve success."
A weak sleep of women because of fear of savings
Despite the clear idea of how to care for the surveys, only few people talked to their family members.
The half of the surveyers of the Nationwide insurance research said that they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said that they were talking to children.
"The people want family member to care for them, but they do not try to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the life insurance sector in Nationwide insurance.
You can start this way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to worry about you if you don't talk to her about it in time.
Talk to your advisor and family about where and how you want to receive supplies, since this may be an important factor in the cost assessment.
Include the financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of long-term financing may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash and life insurance sheets to cover these costs or self-sustainment, if you can afford that.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles when passing.
Choose a healthcare agent to determine the trustworthy person who will supervise your health care and ensure that experts will respect your health wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider also the authorization of a person for your finances.
Choose confidence to a valuable person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are unable to do so on your own.
Do not forget small details: Imagine that your elderly parents need medical assistance urgently and are on their way to the hospital.

earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a strong earthquake and tsunami, which affected the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, said officials, and the number of victims was to increase.
With the interrupted communication links, rescueers from the Donggala Regent could not receive no information from the area north of Palou, near the epicentre of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Paluo after the earthquake.
Several key information on Palou and Donghali on Sulavezi:
Palo is the capital of Central Sulavesia, a province laying at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of Sulavezi, and should have 379.800 people in 2017, according to the estimates.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami affected.
Donggala is a province stretching over 300 km (180 miles) of the coast in the northwest of the island of Sulavezi.
Registership, the administrative unit under the province, was estimated in 2017 299 000 people.
The main economic activities of the province Central Sulavezi are aquaculture and agriculture, in particular in the central region of Donghala.
In the province, the mining of niklus, but mostly in Morvali, is also an important activity on the opposite side of Sulavesia.
Palo and Donggalo have suffered tsunami several times over the past 100 years after the report of the Indonesian Agency for the Mitigation of Natural Disasters.
In 1938, tsunami caused more than 200 people to die and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donghala.
In 1996, the tsunami also affected the northern Donghalo and caused nine people to die.
Indonesia is sitting on the earthquake of the Pacific Fire Round, so the earthquakes are frequently appearing.
In recent years, some larger earthquakes and tsunamis were:
2004: A larger earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province Aceh in northern Sumatri on 26 December caused tsunami, which affected 14 countries and which killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian assessment, more than half in Aceh.
2005: The type of strong earthquakes affected West Sumatro late March and early April.
More than a hundred people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The magnitude earthquake 6,8 affected the Southern part of Java, the most inhabited Indonesian island, and launched tsunami that flooded its southern coast and caused nearly 700 people to die.
2009: Magnitude earthquake 7.6 happened near the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: Magnitude earthquake 7.5 affected one of the Mentawai islands and launched tsunamis of up to 10 meters, which destroyed the dozens of villages and caused nearly 300 people to die.
2016: The flood of earthquake affected the regency of Pidi Jaya in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the death earthquake and tsunamia in 2004.
This time the tsunami did not start, but the failing buildings caused more than 100 people to die.
2018: Greater earthquakes have affected the Indonesian tourist island Lombok and caused more than 500 people to die, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily detained thousands of tourists.
Arrest the oldest son of Sarah Palin for family violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor and Vice-President candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for the charge of the attack.
29-year-old of Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of violence in the family, obstacling domestic violence and opposition to arrest, the police agency Alaska State Troopers reported on Saturday.
According to the police report, Pala's acquaintances, when she tried to call the police to report a suspected criminal offence, took the phone from her hand.
The Palina was closed in the Precaden Institute Mat-Su and is in custody under an unsustained guarantee of 500 USD, the CTUU television network reported.
He appeared in the court on Saturday, where he said he was “surely innocent” when he was asked about the defense, the network reported.
The fuel was accused of three infringements of class A, which means that he could be imprisoned by one year and punished at a deep amount of $250,000.
It was also accused of one breach of Class B, punishing one day in prison and a deep amount of 2000 USD.
The felony is not accused for the first time.
On December 2017, he was accused of the attack on his father, Todd Palina.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a suspect attack.
The example is right now in front of the Alaska veteran court.
On January 2016, he was accused of violence in the family, interference with domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholised state in connection with the event.
Palin's girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin criticised the veterans in 2016 when her son's violent behavior was linked to post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
Tsunami earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died in the earthquake that affected the island of Sulavezi in the Indonesian Friday.
The magnitude earthquake 7.5 triggered tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electric and communication networks are broken, and the number of death victims should be increased in the coming days.
The earthquake happened just at the central Sulavezi, which lies north-east of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
The social media circles videos that show the moment of the earthquake.
When he hit tsunami on the coast, there were hundreds of people in Palo at the beach festival.
Federal Prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a terrorist suspect in New York.
The federal prosecutors in New York require a death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect for a terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people died.
Saipov, 30, was intended to use an rented supply truck to perform a bike attack along the West Side Highway at the Lower Manhattan, when he drove more foot and bike carrier on October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally ” killed eight victims and “intentionally ” caused serious physical injuries, as stated in the notice of a request for death penalty imposed in the Southern County of New York.
According to the judicial document, any of the charges may be caused by a death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, the large federal jury of Saipov acknowledged a 22-point accusation, which included eight murder charges to help expulsion generally used by federal prosecutors in the cases of organised crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded “significant planning and acquisition”, said prosecutors who described Saip’s way as“ a shameful, cruel and distorted. ”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diega Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drak, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferrousi, Herna Diega Mendoze and Alejandra Damian Pagnuccoa,” is stated in the notice of intentions.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Court of Justice for the Southern District said the last death penalty ten years ago.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was sentenced to murder two drug suppliers, and he was finally converted to prison in life in September 2009.
The death penalty was last sentenced in New York in a federal case in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who was executed for the conspiracy of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years ago.
Both Rosenberg were executed on the electric table on June 1953.
Saipov, the Uzbekistan citizen, did not show regrets in the days and months followed by the attack.
According to the police, he said to investigators that he felt good about what he did.
After the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS videos that he saw on the phone.
The police also stated that he demanded an ISIS flag disclosure in his hospital room.
On 22 counts of the accusation, he claimed himself to be an innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were “approximately disappointed ” by the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to require a death penalty instead of accepting guilt in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved will only extend suffering in these events,” said Patton.
Saip's defense group has asked the prosecutors before that to not require a death penalty.
For the Brexite negotiations, NIGEL FARAGEA should be owed, says the Turkish Member
The Nigel Farage promised today during the protest at the Torian conference that he would “mobilize the human army. ”
The former Ukipa leader said that politicians must “sense the heat” of euroskeptics, when one of the own Members of Theresa May suggested that they must be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Ambassador Peter Bone said in the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom would be “will already be outside” if it had been Mr. Farage's Secretary for Brexite.
However, the challenge faced by Mrs. Mayeva to coordinate its deeply divided species has also been stressed by the Torians, favorable dismissals of brexite that joined a separate protest against brexite in the city.
The Prime Minister strives to keep its plan in the run between the brexite attacks, the opponents of Brexite and the EU.
The allies insisted that Mayeva in Brussels will try to reach a agreement despite the opposition and force Eurosceptics and laburist to choose between its package and the "cacos".
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave (Departure means departure) in Solihul that "he wants to get rid of Chequers".
He said that we should name Mr. Farage as a colleague and give him responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, they would have been out by now,” he said.
This messenger from Wellingborough added: “I will support the brexite, but we must get rid of Chequers. ”
He described his opposition to the EU in the following words: “In the world wars, we have not fought to be servants now.
In our own country, we want to adopt our own laws."
Mr. Bone rejected the proposals that the public opinion since the voting in 2016 changed: "The thought that the British had changed their minds and wanted to remain in the EU is absolutely unreal."
Andrea Jenkyns, who told the rapporteur, also attended the meeting, said: “I just say: ‘ Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, and the opposition will not vote for it, and it is also unfavoured to our client and our activists who are active on the streets and bring us to the election.
Please leave Chequers and start listening.’
In a message designed by Mrs. Mayeve, she added: “The prime ministers keep their job when they fulfill their promises. ”
Mr. Farage said at the meeting that politicians should be given “sensitive hot” if they intend to make a decision adopted at the 2016 referendum.
“There is now a matter of trust between us — the people – and our political class,” he said.
"They are trying to issue the brexite, and today we are together to tell them: ‘We won't let you do that.’
He added in his message to the excited crowd: “I want our political class, which is on the edge of the brexite, to feel the heat. ”
"We mobilize the human army of this country that has provided us a victory in the brexite, and we will not be peaceful until we become independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the rest of them walked through Birmingham, where they then held a two - hour meeting in the city center.
The sand of activists was waving with the Torian flags against the brexite after the establishment of a group.
The Laburist Tribunal Lord Adonis laughed at the conservatives because of security problems in the application of the party after the opening of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can establish IT-systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the limit of unfree, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a perfect farce.
There is nothing like a good brexite," he added.
Warren's possibly streaming for the President's position "to exactly study"
The American Senator Elizabeth Warren says that “the cooperation in the presidential city competition will be exactly studied” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe journal reports that the Massachusett Democrat talked about her future at a meeting with citizens in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical to President Donald Trump, will be re-elected on November against the Republican Geoff Diehl, who was a co-Chairperson of the Trump election campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is in the centre of speculation to deal with Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was its 36th meeting with voters in the form of “Town Hall” since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her whether she intends to pursue the presidency.
Warren answered that it was time that “the city of women in Washington and repair our corrupt government, which requires a woman on the top. ”
Arrest after LSU Simsa's death in shooting
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that the suspect was arrested for the shooting of the LSU basketball player Wayd Sims.
The police station in Baton Roug news about the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. after east time.
They published a video of Friday shooting and asked for help in identifying a man in the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday near the South University campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a shot in his head and finally died,” said the press chief of Murphy J. Paul, reporting the network 247s.
Wayde interfered to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
At the interrogation, Simpson admitted that there was an event at the scene that he had a weapon and that he shot Wayd Simms.
The Simpson was arrested without opposition, and he was detained at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims, a 198-century young man who grew up in Baton Roug, played 32 games with 10 starts in the last season, average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps to the game.
The Russian great prize: Lewis Hamilton approached the address of the world champion, and the team ordered him to leave the victory to Sebastian Vettl
On Saturday, the moment Valtteri Boltas qualified before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that “the Mercedes team will have a strong impact on the race. ”
Bottas started well on the stake and almost left Hamilton dry when he defended his position in the first two bandages and invited Vettl to attack his municipal colleague.
Wettel took the first to box and let Hamilton ride on the tail of traffic, which should be decisive.
Mercedes took him to the box later and left him for Vettle, but Hamilton noticed that after some driver's driver's driver Ferraria's innocence leaves the inner side open and risks that after two defense moves in the third corner he will remain.
Max Verstappen started with the last type of network and was at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday in the seventh place.
Then, the majority of the car competitive cars without changing tires, because he was going to perform a quick finish, expedite Kimi Raikkonen and capture the fourth city.
He eventually entered the box in the 44th circle, but in the remaining eight rounds he couldn't increase the speed, so he captured the fourth city of Raikkonen.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri was driving fantastic all weekend and it was a real cavalry when he left me through.
The team has done a really excellent job to reach the first and second place," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body talk.
President Donald Trump laughed at the meeting on Saturday, Senator Dianne Feinstein for her endurance that she did not disclose the letters of Christine Blasey Ford, who was the candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice of Brett Kavanaugh.
At the Western Virginia meeting, the president did not directly touch the testimony of Ford before the Senate investigation committee, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “nasty, corrupt and false”.
“The only beautiful thing that could happen and that happened in the Senate in the last days that we can see anger when you can see that people are wicked, corrupt and false,” he said.
"When you look at your publications and disclosures and people say, 'No, I didn't do that."
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you discover that?
Remember her answer... you disclosed the document... "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose it.'
Okay, wait a minute.
We discovered it... no, we didn't," he added about the impression of the Senator.
Ford's letter with details about the charges against Kavanaugh was sent in July, and the media was revealed in the beginning of September, but Feinstein denies that it came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charge, I didn't reveal her letter," she told the Commission after the report of Officer The Hill Feinstein.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I kept him confidential, as she asked."
Her denial, however, did not apparently match the president who said at the Saturday night meeting: “I tell you, this was a really bad speech of the body.
Maybe not, but it was the worst speech of the body I've ever seen.”
In the defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, which was accused by three women of inappropriate sexual behaviour, the President implied that the democrats were abused for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain their power with all possible means.
You have seen evil, disgusting, they don't care who they are affected and whom they need to be driven to be struck to power and control," the president should say after the reporting of the Mediaite website.

The air traffic controller allowed several hundred people to escape from the earthquake by his death.
The air traffic controller in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he sacrificed his life so that a plane with a hundred people could fly safely.
In the Friday earthquake on the island of Sulavesa, followed by tsunami, more than 800 people died, and many missing.
The area continues to stress strong earthquakes, and many people are captured in the ruins of the city of Palo.
Although the colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung did not leave his job in a strongly rigging control tower at the airport of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He remained in it that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the flightway, could have gone safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower because he thought he was scattering.
He died later in the hospital.
The representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have solved several hundred lives, reported the Australian media house ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter to move him from Ballipapan in Calimantan to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palo.
"We have a heart market when we hear this," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of death victims could reach thousands, as the State Disaster Reduction Agency said access to towns in Dongha, Sigia and Boutonga was limited.
“The number of dead should still increase because there were many bodies under the ruins, but many could not be achieved” said the representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The Pall, where the massive funeral would take place on Sunday, was destroyed by waves of up to six meters.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing assistance and care.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said to Sky News: “Each minute, the saving vehicle brings the body.
He's got clean water.
Minimarkets are exhausted everywhere.’
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, which can become much worse.”
On Sunday, the President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palo, instructing the national army: “I ask all of you to work the night and day to fulfill all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?” After CNN report.
Indonesia was affected by earthquakes in Lombok at the beginning of this year, in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesian aircraft: Air Niugini airlines now say that, after the lagoon's smashing aircraft, one man is missing.
The airline that managed the flights that had been scattered in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now says that one person was missing after the initial message was reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the flooding plane.
The Air Niugini announced on Saturday afternoon that the lack of a male sex passenger is missing.
In the airline, they have been told that they are cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in search of the missing one.
The invitation to more information about a passenger, such as his age or nationality, has not responded immediately.
The local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane struck along the water, trying to land on the island of Chuuk.
The officials said that seven people were taken to the hospital on Friday.
In the airline, it was said that there were eight passengers left in the hospital on Saturday, who were all in a stable state.
The cause of scarceness and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airlines and the American Navy have reported that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the road.
Some witnesses said the plane missed the plane.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was very low.
“This is extremely good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to beat the water to the belt up to the reinforcement exits on a flooding plane.
He said that the stewards had a panic and screamed, and he suffered a smaller head injury.
The American Navy said that the sailors, who were nearby repairing the sail, also embarked on the help of the sailing boat that had been transferred to the land before the plane drowned in approximately 30 metres (100 shoes) deep water.
The Air Safety Network shows that in the last two decades, 111 people died in Papua New Guinea, but this was the first accident that happened to Air Niugini.
The analyst has determined the time of the night when a woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution presented its evidence in the retrial to a man who was accused of burning a woman from Mississippi live in 2014.
The analyst of the US Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used the phone recordings to determine the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, at the night of her death.
Rowlett said that he received data on the location from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers at the night of her death, which opposed to his previous claims, the Officer Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone at Chambers was at the time he said he was with Michael Sanford's friend, the police contacted Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was at Sanford's truck that night, he said that he “lied because he was my truck in Nashville. ”
The second inconsistent was that Tellis said Chambers knew about two weeks when she died.
The videos on the cell phone show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis wiped out Chambers's texts, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He removed it from his life, ” Hale said.
The defense should present the final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said that the jury should judge the trial later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hipop?

The High Breed Group of Bristol claims that the hyphop was distant from the original political and social engagement.
They want to return to his roots and make a conscious hipop popular again.
Artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have recently experienced a rerish with artists like Akala and Lowkey in the United Kingdom.
Another black?
The New York Nanny sues a couple because they forgive her for the "racist" message
The New York Nanny sues a couple because they discriminatoryly forgived her after receiving the wrong message of the mother who complained that she was “one black woman. ”
A couple denies the racist behavior and the lawsuit compared to “forcement”.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment in 2016 when Giselle Maurice found that she was a black woman when she arrived.
“NEEEEEEEEEE JOHN THAT'S MONTH,” she wrote to her husband in her message, Plasco-Flaxman.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After finding her undermining, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt “uncomfortable”, she forgived Mr. Maurice, saying that her departing nanny, who was the African American, was doing a bad job, so she wanted to hire Philippinko, reports Officer New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a payment for one day of work, and then she was sent home with Uber.
Maurice now requests compensation from a couple in the court, at the same time at 350 USD a day for the period of six months for the work for which it was first hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them, you know, that's not what she's doing," she said about Post on Friday, and she added: "I know this is discrimination."
The couple responded to racism accusations by claiming that Maurice's forgiveness was reasonable because they feared that they would no longer be able to trust her after regret.
“Women sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said Joel Plasco's husband about Post.
"Would you be willing to trust your children to someone whom you were indecent, even if this happened wrong?
Your newborn?
Come on.
In comparison with the complaint with “removal”, Plasco said that his wife had born a child only two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
“Are you going to deal with someone like this?
This is not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the court's proceedings are still under way, the court of public opinion on social networks has quickly condemned it because of its behaviour and thinking.
The advocates of Paddington's stories were afraid that the readers would not connect to the speaking bear, a new letter revealed.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said: “It was hard to fit into the skin of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to learn that now that Paddington has become an extraordinary success.”
She said that her father, who first worked as a camera for BBC before he received inspirations to write a child's book about a little bear of toys, was upset when she rejected her work, added that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book “Grenko-Sweet”.
Regarding the bear Paddington, described as “a very important member of our family, ” she said that his father was very proud of his final success.
“It was a man who didn't like to praise, ” she said.
“But since the bear Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something: You are proud of him, even though you don't really do it on your own.
I think the Bear Paddington's succeeded in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, the success has always attributed the bear to Paddington himself.”
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
At the landing, her daughter was transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nica, where doctors tried to preserve her life for nothing.
“Nad regularly called to say that she really feels bad, that she didn't expect that this to happen”, said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got Nada's call, and he told me she was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicinal products given to her doctors to continue pushing her heart were slowly receiving and leaving her system.
She's been dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing it all happens.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a position that surrounded my family and people.
I really had to endure."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, who was already grieving about losing her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers, not conscious of the trial she passed.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I had my head off, and my faces were tearing.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this strong feeling of compassion to hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he loved it."
Woman's regrettable posters for suicide prevention on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved person because of suicide are trying to disturb others to take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Valian bridge, you stick the posters with inspiring messages and phone numbers to which people can contact for support.
Mrs. Tyler's son was 13 when he was depressed, and he killed himself when he was 18 years old.
“I don't want any parents to feel like me every day, ” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old living in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infinite smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would light every room."
However, he stopped working before his death because he was “in a real dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found a cousin when he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I am constantly concerned that the domine effect will be activated. ”
Mrs. Davis made posters, “to let others know that there are people you can turn to and talk to them, even if it is a friend.
Don't sit in silence – you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Davies’ friend for several years, lost Marka, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He did not say that he felt depressed, depressed or otherwise,” she said.
“Now a few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On the Christmas day, he was completely on the ground. When the children opened the gifts, he did not have an eye contact with them or anything else.”
She said that his death was a severe trauma for them, but they had to process it: “She cut a hole into the whole family.
She smashed us.
However, we must continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is hanging at the start of the FBI investigation in the air
"I thought that if we could actually carry out what he asked for -- after the duration and extent of the limited investigation, this might make us united," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, and he added that he feared that the world would be “depleted” because of the consolidated cliential detention.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Their resistance is the result of the time the investigation would take place.
Until the intermediate elections that will take place on November 6 are only five weeks – if the Republicans are expected to cut badly, this will make them very weakened when they try to elect a desired person to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has repeatedly called the Senators to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who was working in the White House for Mr. Bush, and presented to his current wife, Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI agency prepares a report?
The Senate, currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will take place in a vote.
It's still not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh in the Senate can gather at least 50 votes, which would bring a stroke to Mike Pence, the vice president, and the election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has decreased under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since seven years ago, Kim Jong Un, said the South Korean messenger.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to the data of the South Korean Ministry of Communities, said that 1127 people ran away last year, compared to 2706 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were more strict border control between North Korea and China and the increase in the price required by human traffickers.
Pjongjang hasn't commented publicly yet.
The majority of refugees from North Korea finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seul says that the border since the end of Korean war in 1953 was illegally crossed over 30,000 North Koreans.
Most of them run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to reach as a strongly protected demilitarized area between both Koreans.
China counts refugees for illegal migrants, not for refugees and often repatriates them.
Relationships between North and South, which are technically still in war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pjongjang at the talks focused on the permanent denuclearisation negotiations.
This happened after the June historical meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed on the efforts for the Korean leaf without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho has declared a stop to American sanctions since then.
“Without confidence from the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, but in such circumstances we will not disarma ourselves unilaterally”, said Mr. Ri, in the invitation of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi named Brett Kavanaugh as "histerical" and says it is not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
The minor leader of the Presentation House, Nancy Pelosi, named the candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh as “histerical” and said that it was personally inappropriate for the work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosiova said so in the Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think of another thing as if a woman, if she knew so, was referred to as "histerical", Kavanaugh's fourth testimony before the Senate investigation committee commented on Pelosiev.
Kavanaugh denyed heavily the accusations that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford had attacked sexually when they were teenagers.
In the introduction statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and debating about his family and high school years of souls.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats in the Commission, and he referred charges against himself as “grotesque and coordinated mud” organised by the liberals, anger because Hillary Clinton lost her elections in 2016.
Pelosiova said that it felt that Kavanaugh's testimony had proved that he should not be appointed as the Supreme Judge, since it showed that he was constrained to democrats.
"I believe that he discredited himself with such statements and the way Clintons and Democrats began to start," she said.
Pelosiova is about whether she will try to file a constitutional accusation against Kavanaugh, if it is confirmed, and the democrats will receive the majority in the representation home for a moment.
"I will say this -- if the Congress or the FBI does not tell the truth, it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court on which he is now," Pelosieva said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Justice in Washington.
Pelosiova said that it was democraticly concerned by the possible Kavanaugh's decision against the Law of Availability of Health or the case of Roa v. Wade, as it applies to a Conservative Judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided the question whether he would dismiss some decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It is not the time to go to court with a hysterical, foreign person and expect us to say, Isn't it wonderful?” Pelosius said.
And the woman's got to be screwed up.
This is a fair end, after months and years of anger, and it cannot be expressed without crying.
“ We cry when we are angry, ” she told me 45 years later.
"That doesn't seem rare to me, what do you think?"
She continued: “The woman who was somewhere in the way she was crying when she was mad, but she developed a technique, when she was mad and crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘ I may feel sad to you because I cry.
I'm angry.'
Then she just continued.
It seemed great to me.”
The tears are partially permitted because people understand them wrong.
One of my most powerful memories from the early career, when I worked in the office in which a man was overwhelmed, and I once found myself crying in an unreasonable anger, was the event when an old woman grabbed me for my neck — a cold leader, who always had a few fears that pulled me on the stairs.
“Don't ever let them see you crying,” she said.
"They won't understand you're angry.
They will think that you are sad, and they will rejoice that they have touched you.”
Patricia Schroeder, former Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart with his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was detected in a boat jumping over the fence called Monkey Business and had to get out of the game, Mrs. Schroeder found that there was no reason why she could not run for the president alone.
“It was not a well-reasoned decision,” she told me 30 years later.
"Seven other candidates have been involved in the competition, and another was the last necessary thing at that time.
Someone then named the game ‘Snowker and Seven Inches’.’
Since the campaign has joined the last, it remained in the collection of funds, so she decided not to enter the competition unless she gathered 2 million USD.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave the men $1,000, gave it only 250 USD.
“Do they think I'll get a discount? ” she was wondering.
When she noted in the conversation that no official campaign would start, the emotions — the appreciation of the people who supported it, the displeasure of the system that made her so difficult to gather money and focus on the voters instead of the delegates, and the anger for sexism — was so overwhelmed that she began to breathe.
"We would think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder remembered the media reactions.
"We would think my official sponsor is Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my tomb.
‘Is she crying?’
How the war between the United States and China could benefit Peking
The initial trading wars between the United States and China were deaf, and although the battle has not been finished for a long time, experts say that the breakdown between countries could benefit Peking.
Donald Trump, US President, launched the first warning in the beginning of the year by taxing key Chinese export articles, including sunboards, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new goods tariffs of 200 billion USD (150 billion GBP), which effectively means taxing half of the whole goods coming from China.
Beijing has been revenged each time with equivalent reimbursement measures, last with tariffs of 5 to 10 per cent per US goods of 60 billion USD.
China, the second largest economy in the world, has pledged to move an eye for the eye with the United States and will probably not be mixed soon.
In order to resign Washington, China should agree on its demands, but the public removal of the United States for Chinese President Shi Jinping would be too shameful.
Experts, however, say that if Peking knows how to pull the right moves, US pressures in trade war can have a long-term positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Peking could create conditions to initiate a economic shock in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have ever thought," said Abigail Grace, a professional colleague who focused on Asia with the brain trust of the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is “prepared” to return to refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says she is ready to voluntary return to refugees and asks for help in renewal of the country destructed in more than seven years of war.
In the invitation of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moulem said that the situation in the country has improved.
“The situation in the field today is more stable and safer because of the fight against terrorism”, he said.
The government continues to sanish areas destroyed by terrorists to re-establish a normal condition.
All the conditions are now met to return voluntarily to the country, which had to be abandoned because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures directed against their daily life and survival.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped from the country since the start of the 2011 war.
Other six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al Moulem said that the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the renewal of the deserted country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept the conditional aid or aid from the countries who sponsored rebels.
