White walk on f3, black walk to e6, white walk on g4, black fries on h4-mat! In chess circles, they call it a foolish mat.
White: a1, walk to b6, king per c8. Black: walks on a7 and b7, king per a8, elephant to b8. Whites put a contest in the position of acute, putting a 6, then only two options left: take a 6 or move the elephant to any other field of b8-h2. In the first case, the whites move a walk from b6 to b7 and put the mat. In second case, the white chest takes a black walk to a7 with the same result.
