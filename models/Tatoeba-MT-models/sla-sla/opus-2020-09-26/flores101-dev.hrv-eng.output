Stars emit light and warmth because of the energy that comes from when hydrogen atoms are connected (or merged) into heavy elements.
Scientists are working on creating reactors that can create energy in the same way.
However, the problem is difficult to find a solution and it will take many years before the beneficial fusion reactors are built.
Steel needle float on the surface of the water due to surface tension.
The surface tension comes because the molecules water on the surface are strongly attracted to each other, more than they are attracted by air molecules above.
The molecules of water create an invisible tail on the surface of the water that allows things like needle to float on the water.
The sharp on modern slippers has a double edge with a concave depth between. Two edges enable better ice slippery, even when scrolling.
Since the bottom of the blade is mildly curved, when the blade scrolls on one or the other side, the edge that touches the ice is also curved.
If the slider scrolles to the right, the slider turns right, and if he scrolls to the left, he turns left.
In order to return to the previous level of energy, additional energy that they have received from light must be eliminated.
"That's the show of a tiny particle of light called "foton."
"Scientists call this process a stimulated radiation show," because a bright light triggers atoms, which causes the photons of light, and light is a kind of radiation."
The next picture shows atoms that emit photos. Of course, the photos are actually much smaller than the picture.
Photons are even smaller than the substances that make atoms!
After a hundred hours of work, the burning thread in the lamp at the end burns, and the lamp is no longer working.
Then you need to replace the lamp. It's important to be careful when you replace the lamps.
The switch for the lighting body or the cable is to be connected first.
It is because the electricity that affects the throat in the place where the metal part of the lamp is drawn may have a severe power strike if you touch the inside of the throat or the metal bottom of the lamp while the part of the lamp is still in the throat.
The main body of the blood system is the heart, whose role is blood pumping.
The blood from the heart flows to the pipes called arteries and returns to the heart of the pipes called veins. The least pipes are called capillars.
Triceratops teeth could not only cut off leaves but also very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists think the triceratops ate cycadines, a kind of plant that was common in Kreda.
These plants look like small palms with a crush full of a sharp bowling leaves.
Triceratops may have used a strong bowl to crack the leaves before he ate the tree.
Other scientists argue that these plants are very poisonous, so it is unlikely that dinosaurs ate them today, even though lennies and other animals such as popes (dinosaurs) can eat poison leaves or fruits.
In what way would the gravity force of the month attract me? If you were standing on the surface of the month Io, you would strive less than on Earth.
A person with 90 kg (200 pounds) on Earth would have 16 kg (36 pounds) on the Lji. So gravity is weaker than on Earth.
The sun has no corrosion on which it can stand as Earth has, and the sun makes gases, fire and plasma.
The gas becomes more rare to get away from the center of the sun.
"The outside part we see when we look at the sun is called the photosphere, which means the lightball."
About three thousands later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope and noticed that Venus has phases just like the moon.
The changes are happening because only the side of Venus (or the moon) has been brightened. Venera's names are attached to the Kopernikov theory that the planets are moving around the sun.

When the fight for France ended, Germany began preparations for the attack on Britain.
"The German operation called the "Operation of the Sea Lion." Most of the heavy weapons and weapons of the British army were lost during the evacuation from Dunkirk so the army was quite weak."
"But the Royal Navy was stronger than the German" "Kriegsmare" and could destroy every fleet that would fall into the English channel."
However, very few ships of the Royal Navy were located near the possible directions of attacks because they feared that ships would flood in a German air attack.
"Let's start by explaining Italy's plans.
She had a weaker army and the Navy, although there was four new ships built in the early war.
The Italian main goal was African countries, and to capture these countries, they should have troops to fly the Mediterranean and win Africa.
In order to achieve this, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt.
As for Japan, it's an island country, just like Great Britain.
The submarines are designed for movement and longer detention underwater.
The submarines were used in the I and II World War, and then they were very slow and had a limited range of fire.
At the beginning of the war, most of them were vessels above the surface of the sea, but as the radar developed and became more precise, the submarines were forced to go under the surface so they could not be seen.
The German submarines were known as U-Boot. The Germans were very good in the management of submarines.
Because of the success of the submarines, it is not desirable that the Germans have a large number of submarines in the after-war period.

Creating interactive media requires common and traditional skills, as well as tools that are controlled in interactive continuation (illustrated drafts, editing audio records and video records, comparison etc.)
Interactive design means reviewing its own assumptions on the creation of media content and exercise of thinking in a non-linear manner.
In an interactive design, parts of the project need to be linked to each other, but also to make sense alone.
The lack of a zooming objection is that the complexity of the focus and number of elements of the objective is needed for the range of the spring length much greater than in the basic objects.
This is no longer such a problem because manufacturers have more standards in the production of lens.
This has enabled the use of an incremental image-making object to compare quality with the achieved objects with the fixed spring length.
The second lack of the elevation lens is that the largest dimension (speed) of the lenses is usually lower.
Therefore, cheap zooming objects are hardly used in the conditions of weak lighting without a flashlight.
One of the most frequent problems in trying to turn film into DVD format is excessive scanning.
Most of the TVs were made in a way to satisfy the general population.
That's why everything you're watching on TV has cut uppers, bottom and side edges.
It's done for the picture to cover the whole screen and it's called scratch.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, his edges will probably be cut off, and if the subscriptions were too low, they will not be fully displayed.
The traditional Mediterranean Castle has long been engaging in imagination and charming the scenes of fighting, banket and knightship from Arthur's legend.
Even while you stand in the middle of the thousands of ruins, you can easily imagine the sounds and smells of battles from the past times and nearly hear the noise of coppers in the caldry and feel the fear that rises from underground dungeons.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why are the castles even built? How are they designed and built?
Kirby Muxloe Castle is a more well-based house than a real castle, which is typical for that period.
Big windows left and thin walls could not resist a decisive attack for long.
In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings started the construction, the country was relatively calm and it was to be protected from only small groups of wandering robbers.
The balance of force was a system in which the European nations sought to maintain national sovereignty in all European countries.
The concept was that all European nations had to try to prevent one nation from becoming too powerful and therefore governments often changed allies to maintain balance.
The Spanish heritage war was the first war that was primarily about the balance of power.
It was an important turn because the European forces after that had no excuse for religious wars, so the Thirty - year war will be the last so - called religious war.
The temple of Artemid in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356, B.C.E., due to the palest that Herostat committed.
According to the story, he was willing to do everything to become famous, and the Ephesians were so angry that they ordered Herostrath's name never to be written.
The Greek historian Strabo later recorded the name and we are familiar today. The temple was destroyed the night when Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, as King, offered to pay for the rebuilding of the temple, but the offer was rejected.

The civilization in the Indian Valley belonged to the bronch age and lived in the northwest Indian subcontinent, covering the majority of modern Pakistan and certain areas in northwest India and northeastern Afghanistan.
The civilization, as it only says, was wandering in the valley of the River India.
However, some scientists argue that the civilization should be called Ind-Saraswat because there was also in the left of the dried river Saraswati.
Militarism of the Roman Empire has contributed to the development of medicine.
The Emperor August began to recruit doctors and even formed the first Roman medical force to use after the battle.
The surgeons knew about various sedatives such as morphine from the extract of mac seeds and scopolamine from the seeds of the bunnique.
They managed the amputation method that saved the lives of a gangren patients, and used the trailers and the arteries to stop the blood flow.
During the centuries in the Roman Empire, there have been great discoveries in the field of medicine and knowledge that we are familiar today.
Pureland origami style is an origami with only one set, more complicated sets such as the reverses are not allowed, and all the sets must be equal.
This technique was developed by John Smith in the 1970s as helping unexperienced complicators or those with limited engineering skills.
Children have developed awareness of race and racial stereotypes pretty early, and these racial stereotypes affect behavior.
For example, children belonging to a racial minority who, according to stereotypes, do not achieve good academic results usually discount in school when they find out about a stereotype associated with their race.
MySpace is the third most popular web site in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
Web sites have attracted great attention, especially in educational systems.
Such websites also have positive pages, including the easyness of setting a class page, which can include blogs, video records, photographs and other elements.
The site can be easily accessed by one web address, so to students with difficulty using a keyboard or spell, it is easier to remember and write it to the browser.
The site is easily adapted to easy reading and can be reduced or increased colors.
"The disturbance of attention is a neurologic syndrome that defines a classic triade of symptoms that include impulsiveness, disadvantage and hyperactiveness or excessive energy."
"It's not the inability of learning, it's a disturbance in learning. "There's 3 to 5 percent of all children, maybe even 2 million American children."
Children with disturbances of attention are difficult to focus on things such as school tasks, but they can focus on what makes them enjoy, such as playing games, watching favorite pictures or writing sentences without interpunktion.
"These children often get into trouble because they're getting into risky behaviour, fighting and provoking authority" to stimulate their brains, which cannot be stimulated by common methods."
ADD affects relationships with peers because the rest of the children cannot understand why children who suffer from ADD are acting in a certain way or why they write in a certain way as well as that their maturity is different from others.
Since the ability to acquire knowledge and learning has changed in the way described above, the basic acquisition of knowledge has also changed.
The access to information received was different. No more pressure on individual memory, but focused on the ability to remember the text.
Renaissance has actually made a significant change in access to learning and enlargement of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominides no longer use hands to move, relieve or sneak through tree crops.
Chimpanzees have hands and feet of similar size and length, which is the result of the use of hands to wear weight when walking through the wrists of the hand.
The human hand is shorter than the leg and has more flat articles.
The fossil remnants of the hands of two to three million years indicate a movement from starting to manipulation.
Some people believe that experienceing more artificially caused lucid dreams, if happens enough often, can be very exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that lucid dreams extend the period between REM phases.
If you have less REM phases at night, the condition in which you really sleep and the body recovers becomes uncommon enough to be a problem.
It's as exhausting as if you wake up every twenty to thirty minutes to watch TV.
The result depends on how often in the night your brain is trying to dream luciously.
In the middle of the week after Italy declared the war on June 10, 1940, the British 11th Husar Colonel took capuzo fort in Libya.

Sports are mainly played in duel format, one machete fights the other.
Golf is a game where players use sticks to hit the holes with balls.
Usually, 18 holes are played, and the players usually start in the first hole in the field and end at the eighteenth.
The winner is a player who performs at least hits or waves with a stick to finish the game in the field.
The game takes place on the grass, and the grass around the hole is cossing so that it is shorter and calls "Green".
Probably the most widest kind of tourism is the one that most people link to travel: recreational tourism.
Then people go to a place that is different from their daily days to relax and entertain.
Beaches, thematic parks and camps often represent places that tourist recreatives most visit.
If the goal of visiting a area is to know the history and culture of this area, then we talk about cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different signs in a country or simply devote themselves to one area.
After the colonists noticed that activity, they called for reinforcement.
The troops that strengthened the front positions were also 1 and 3 Colonel New Hampshire with 200 soldiers led by Colonels John Stark and James Reed (they both later became generals).
Stark's people have taken positions along the North Wall of Colonists.
When the sequence made me along the Mystic River in the northeast of the Peninsula, they quickly extended the fence with a stone wall to the north to the small beach on the coast.
Gridley or Stark put a 100-foot cake in front of the fence and ordered no one to shoot until the ordinary soldiers pass.
The American plan relied on launching coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalader had to perform a diverzant attack against the British Garrison in Bordentown to block reinforcements.
General James Ewing should have led 700 troops across the river in Trenton Ferry, blocked the bridge through the Assunpink stream and prevented the escape of enemy troops.
The main chase unit consisting of 2400 soldiers was to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and then split into two groups, one under Green and the other under Sullivan's command, to start the attack before the dawn.
With changing the length of the race from a quarter mile to a mile, speed becomes much less important, and endurance becomes absolute need.
Of course, the first-class runner at 800 m, which can run in two minutes, must be pretty fast, but in any case he has to work on endurance.
A little cross running winter in combination with the upper part of the body in the gym is the best preparation for the race season.
The correct food habits themselves cannot create high performances, but they can significantly affect the general health of young sportsmen.
Maintenance of healthy and balanced energy inputs, effective fluid entry habits and knowledge of various aspects of taking substitute food for sports can enable better implementation and greater enjoyment of sports.
Running at medium distances is relatively cheap sport. However, there are many mistakes about several parts of the equipment necessary to participate.
Products can be purchased if necessary, but most of them have a small or no impact on the performance.
The sports may believe that they prefer some product even if it does not benefit.
Atom can be considered one of the basic construction elements of all substances.
This is a very complex entity that, according to the Bohrov model, consists of the central core around which the electrons turn, similar to planets turning around the sun, see picture 1.1.
The core consists of two particles: neutrone and protons.
The protons have a positive electric charge while the neutrons have no charges.
Before you examine the victim, make sure you're safe.
You must be careful where the victim is at when you approach and notice any alarming details.
If you hurt yourself trying to help, you'll only make the situation worse.
Studies have found that depression, fear and disaster experience are intermediaries between pain and cruelty in crosses.
Only the effects of catastrophic, not depression and fear, depended on regular weeks of structured physical activity.
Those participating in regular activities demanded greater support for the negative experience of pain with the notion of the difference between chronic pain and the uncomfortable feeling caused by normal physical movements.
The vision, or visual ability, depends on the sensitive organs of the visual system, or eyes.
There are many different eyes structures whose complexity depends on the needs of the organism.
Different structures have different capacity, sensitive to different wave lengths and have different degrees of sharpness; they also require different methods of processing when interpreting the entry and different values for optimum work.
The population is a group of the same species that inhabits a specific geographical area.
In case all individuals in the population are identical in view of the specific phenotopic characteristics, they are called monomorphs.
If the individuals have several versions of certain properties, we think they're polymorphical.
The colonies of war ants also walk, and they go in different phases.
At the nomad stage, the war ants march at night, and the day calm.
The colony begins a nomad phase when food supplies are reduced. During this phase the colony builds temporary ants that are replaced every day.
Each such nomad walk takes about 17 days.
"What's the station?" The word of the station comes from the Latin word "cella" which means "little room" and the first one is a microscopie who was watching the structure of a floating patch."
The station is the basic unit of all living beings, and all the organisms consist of one or more cells.
"The stations are so important and crucial to study life that they are often called "the building units of life."
The nervous system maintains homeostase by sending nervous impulses through the body so that the blood flows can be maintained inconsistently.
These nervous impulses can be sent through the body very quickly that helps the body to be safe of possible danger.
Tornado appears in a small area compared to other strong storms, but he can destroy everything on his way.
The Tornado destroys trees, drops the boards from buildings and air cars, and two percent of the most violent tornados lasted more than three hours.
These monstrous storms bring wind speeds up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
For thousands of years, people produce and use lenses to increase.
However, the first real telescopes were made in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lens to seem closer and larger.
The greed and selfishness will never disappear, and the nature of collaboration is that when most benefits, it means that the individual will be paid more in a short term to act selfishly.
Hopefully, most people will realize that working with others is a long-term improvement.
Many dream about the day when people will be able to travel to other stars and explore other worlds, some wondering what there is in the universe, and some believe that aliens or other forms of life may live on another planet.
"But if that ever happens, it's probably not going to happen much longer, the stars are so far from each other that "neighbours" stars share billions of miles."
Perhaps one day your grandchildren will stand at the top of the alien world thinking about their ancestors?
Animals consist of many cells, eat food and spend it inside the body, most animals move.
Only animals have brains (because they don't have everything; e.g. meduses don't have brains).
Animals live all over the world digging underground, swimming to the oceans and flying through the sky.
The station is the least structural and functional unit of living organisms.
The station comes from the Latin word of the whole, which means a small room.
If you look at living creatures under the microscope, you will see that they consist of squares or balls.
The English biologist Robert Hooke microscope saw small squares in the float.
They looked like rooms, he was the first one who saw dead cells.
Elements and connections can go from one state to another without change.
The nitrogen in gas condition has the same properties as the liquid acid. The current state is more dense, but the molecules are still the same.
The molecule of water makes two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure either in gas, liquid or cruel condition.
Although her physical condition can change, the chemical condition remains the same.
Time is something that surrounds us and affects us, and it is hard to understand.
Religious, philosophy and scientific scholars have studied the time for thousands of years.
We see time as a sequence of events that move from the future through the present in the past.
The time is also to compare the duration of events.
A period of time you can mark yourself by observing repeating cyclic occurrences. The cyclic occurrence is something that is repeated regularly.
Today's computers are used to manipulate images and video recordings.
Computers can create sophisticated animations that are increasingly used on TV and in movies.
Music is often recorded on advanced computers used for processing and mixing the sound.
During the 19th and twentieth century, the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Maori hunting giant birds called mine.
Theory then set up the idea that Maori migrated from Polynesia by the Great Fleet and took New Zealand from Morior and established agriculture.
However, new evidence indicates that Moriori were a group of landmakers who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands and developed their recognized, peaceful culture.
There was another tribe of Maor that moved from New Zealand on the island of Chatham.
They were called Moriori, and there were several disturbances, and Moriori were finally destroyed.
The individuals involved in a few decades have helped us to understand our stronger sides and passions and sincerely assess the shortcomings or even failures.
While listening to individuals and their personal, family, and business stories, we have gained a significant perception of history and some of the personalities that have affected the culture of the organization in a good or bad sense.
Although knowledge of his own history does not mean knowledge of culture, it helps people get a sense of their own place in the history of the organization.
While assessing successes and awareness of failures, individuals and all participants reveal deeper values, mission and movement forces of the organization.
In this case, memories of previous cases of entrepreneurship and success that followed then have enabled people to be open for new changes and new direction of the local church.
Such stories of success have reduced fear of change and at the same time created positive tendencies to change in the future.
The convergence method of thinking implies ways to solve problems that integrate different ideas and areas in search of solutions.
In the focus of this way of thinking, the speed, logic and accurateness and the recognition of facts, the application of existing techniques and the collection of information.
The most important factor in this metal compound: there is only one exact answer, you think of two answers, which are right or wrong.
This kind of thinking is linked to certain scientific or standard practices.
Persons with this way of thinking think logically, can remember samples, solve problems and work on scientific research.
People are the most talented species when it comes to reading thoughts of others.
That means we can successfully predict what other human beings observe, intend, believe, know or want.
Understanding the intentions of other people is the most important of these capacities that allows us to better understand the physical practices of others.
For example, if you saw someone breaking the car window, you would probably assume he was trying to steal the car.
He should be judged otherwise if he lost the car keys or tried to break into his own car.
The MRI is based on a physical phenomenon called a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered by Felix Bloch from Stanford University and Edward Purcell from Harvard University in 1930.
At this resonation, atoms in magnetic fields and radials release tiny radio frequency signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a doctor and researcher, discovered the basis for the use of a magnetic resonance recording as a tool for setting medical diagnosis.
Four years later, the patent was assigned and it was the first patent in the world which was assigned to the magnetic resonance field.
Dr. Damadian finished the first magnetic resonance scan for the whole body, called "Indomitable".
Asincro communication gives time to think and react.
It allows students to work by their own pace and to manage the rhythm of educational information.
Furthermore, there are fewer limitations with the possibility of flexible working time. (Bremer, 1998)
Use of Internet and World Wide Web allows students to access information at any time.
Students can also send questions to the instructor at any time of the day and receive reasonably quick answers instead of waiting for the next meeting in four eyes.
The postmoderary approach to learning offers freedom from absolute values. There is no good way of learning.
Moreover, there's nothing you need to learn, learning comes from the interaction of students with knowledge presented.
Our experience with television shows based on the principle “work alone”, representing information and learning support this attitude.
Most of us are watching television shows that inform us of the process or experience in which we will never participate or will ever apply this knowledge.
We'll never overcome the car, build a fountain in the courtyard, travel to Peru for research in ancient ruins, or change the house of our neighbor.
Thanks to the submarine cable links with Europe and the widespread satellite, Grenland is well connected and 93% of the population has access to the Internet.
Hotel or host (if you stay in a holiday or private house) will probably have a computer connected to wi-fi or Internet, and all settlements have a Internet cafe or a similar location with a publicly available wi-fi network.
"As already mentioned, although the word "Eskim" is still acceptable in the United States, many nations of the non-American Arctic consider it rude, especially in Canada."
Although you could hear that Greenland's nationals use that word, strangers should avoid it.
The locals of Greenland in Canada are called Inuitima and Kalaalleq (public Kalaallit) in Grenland.
"The crimes and bad intentions directed towards strangers are generally almost unknown in Greenland, even in the cities there are no "debt areas".
The cold time is probably the only real danger that will happen to those unprepared.
If you visit Grenland during the cold months (see that the climate is colder than you travel northernly), you need to take enough warm clothes.
The duration of the summer may cause the failure to sleep and associated health problems.
During the summer, the Nordic mosquitoes should be watched. Although they are not transmitters of disease, they can be irritating.

The journey to Walt Disney World is a great pilgrimage for many American families.
Typical visit includes a flight to the International Airport Orlando, a bus drive to Disney's hotel at the spot, stay for a week without leaving Disney's property and returning home.
"It's possible for the endless variations on that subject, but that's what people still think about when they talk about "the visit to Disney World."
A number of tickets that are sold online through auction web sites such as eBay or Craigslist partially used tickets for multiple visits to parks.
Although it's a very common activity, Disney prohibits it: tickets are not transmitting.

Victoria Falls is a city in the west part of Zimbabwe, across the border near Livingstone in Zambia and near Botswana.
The city is located right next to the floods, and they are the greatest attraction, but this popular tourist attraction to those in search of adventure and visitors provides many opportunities for longer stay.
In the rain season (from November to March), the quantity of water is greater, so the floods look dramatic.
You will surely get wet if you cross the bridge or walk the paths near the waterfall.
On the other hand, due to the great amount of water in that period, you will not be able to see the waters well because you will be disturbed... water!
The Tutankamon's tomb (KV62). KV62 is probably the most famous tomb in the Valley and the scene is the discovery of a nearly untouched place of the sanctuary of the young king discovered by Howard Carter in 1922.
In comparison with most royal tombs, Tutankamon is barely worth visiting because he is much smaller and has little decorations.

Make sure that the agent through which you booked is an expert for Galapagos and is well aware of many types of ships.
This will guarantee the choice of the most appropriate ship in accordance with your specific interests and/or limitations.
Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, Northern Chile ruled Inks while the Araukanci (Mapuce) autochtons were accommodating central and southern Chile.
The Mapuche tribe was also one of the latest independent American residence communities that did not fully accept Spanish to declare Chile's independence.

This provides almost four times more resolution than 35-millimeter negative (3136 mm2 compared to 864).
The wild nature is among the most challenged motives for the photographer and it requires a combination of happiness, patience, experience and good equipment.
The photograph of the wildlife is often taken healthy to be done, but like the photograph generally, the picture is worth a thousand words.
For photographs of wild nature, a long telefoto objective is often needed, although the objects such as birds or small creatures are needed by other objects.
Many exotic animals are difficult to find, and in parks sometimes there are rules for photographing for commercial purposes.
Wild animals can be shy or aggressive. The environment can be cold, hot or otherwise unavailable.

Several thousand employees live here in the summer of 20 bases mainly in this area; a smaller number remains over the winter.
The inside of Antarctica is depleted with the ice-fat of 2-3 km.
The occasional specialized air surveys are going into the inside, for mountaining or visiting the South Pole, on which a large base is located.
South Pole Traverse (or Highway) is a 1600 km long path leading from McMurdo station at Ross' sea to half.
It consists of a compounded snow with filled cracks and tags. This road can only travel with specialized tractors and wool salons with fuel and supplies.
These vehicles aren't very rotating, so the trails are long around the Transantactical Mountains to reach the vertical.
The most common cause of accidents in winter are roads, trailers, and especially stairs.
