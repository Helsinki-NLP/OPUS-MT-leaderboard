It would mean to me if you could do that to me.
You're sad.
Tom worked hard to finish his job in time.
I gave them some food.
You disappointed me.
That's not a big deal.
How much do I receive?
I'm kidding you.
If you talk to a man in the language he understands, it goes into his head, and if you speak with him in his language, it goes to his heart.
We're not done yet.
I want to see you behind the bars.
Let's go to the bar now.
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.

Let me help you avoid some problems.
I've never tried to do this before.
Did I miss it?
Mary can't stand Tom's boss because she's a male shovinist pig.

It's a safe lie.
What would I get with this?

I went to bed yesterday without washing my teeth.

Think about it again.

You're somewhat right.
Although I told Tom not to open the door, he opened them.
Go straight.
It's just like a beans.
I'm doing a lot of things good.

I'll leave school.

Try this.
There are no consequences.

He's a man with tradition.
Do you have a paper on which I can write?
Is it true that Tom won the race?
Can I hear another one?
I'd really like to see you again.
Let's sit down for five minutes.
What a question!
You're very brave, aren't you?
Tom looked mad.
I've never noticed that before.
Probably better not eat after seven nights.
I'm sure Tom is proud.
Are they in love?
Help me.
Which way are you going?
I like sleeping on a soft bed.
Stay positive.
It's all right with my hearing.
I just want to get home.

Enough, Tom.

Come in.
You won!
That's what they both like.
Tommy said I shouldn't talk to Mary.
I keep saying that.
Most scientists rejected the theory of moving continents, because it was so hard to imagine that the movements of the panels were at all possible.
How did I miss that?
What did you say to Tom?

Give them as much food as they need every day.
Tom's gonna change.
I reacted instinctfully.
You have to do that somewhere else.
Don't push.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
How often do you get the tapes on YouTube?
Do you know who Tom killed?

Say hello to your friends.
What do you think this sentence means?
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Can I take a look at your ticket?
I'm sorry, I didn't escort.
Tom knows the procedure.
If a man advances himself in front of a woman - it is called favorism. If she is promoted, in front of a man, it is called equality.
Are you dyslexic?
Come back in an hour.
Tom often uses that word.
Tom was staring at his feet.

He's a biologist.
That was a little weird.
Shut up that dirty mouth.
Show me the papers.

I thought I'd have another chance for that.
He'll understand.
I'm not here for that.
I assumed you were busy.
She finally fell asleep.
Tom's laughing at Mary.
It's almost half three.
I don't know if that'll be enough money for me.
Can you get the curtains?
Have you ever tried?
That seems unhuman to me.
Did you have lunch?
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What's that, little cat, would you like some cream?
We didn't mean this for you.
We've never played football before.
How did you like Boston?

I wish I knew.
We have a good chance of winning.
Tom's not in the shape.
I don't have enough time to explain that detailedly.

I'll call her tonight.
It was a crazy year.
Get out of here, Tom.
It's impossible to say with security.

Would you like some more tea?
Exer broke the tire.

Just tell Tom I called.
We could use some help.
Tom's still frustrated.
Tom made it clear that he wouldn't do it.
Infrared and ultrafial airs are kinds of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit down for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
"Learn from your mistakes" and "Experience is the best teacher," they say, but on long ways even the best teacher is angry if he or she has too much to teach in a little time.
Share the tickets, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
You really don't have to do that.
I hope it'll be a dry time.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunch tomorrow?
I know him well.
Are they in love?
No one knows what's going on behind that door.
How could I resist?
I bought a lot of things.
I'm just not very happy.
Let's see you, Tom.

I need your help.
I'm a responsible person.
Add more water.
What Tom suggests could save time to all of us.
Beautiful!
He's pretty busy now.
We're not proud of it.
It's a Cuban cigarette.
Tom cooks potatoes to make potato salad.
Everybody else.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what that is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Anyway, you're wrong.
It's hard to give up long-term love of one.
Tom likes extreme sports.
The strong commitment to the environment is not compatible with large investments in oil and gas.
I have a white horse.
Let's talk about this during lunch.
Say hello to your friends.
How did I miss that?

Tom hates strangers.
We need to respect our personal rights.
What's that thing and your right hand?
Can I call you about 2:30?
Anybody in Disneyland with me?
Why is the picture of trains so interesting?
I don't usually write such songs.
It's really so simple.
That was a funny mistake.
What are you even eating?
Don't talk.
Call him whatever you want.
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do that, but he failed.
Jumi will be a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother is Yugoslav.
There must be a better way to do this.

He loves me tomorrow!
It's too loud for me here.
I'm glad Tom won.
There's no one like you.
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
Tom wrote a long letter to Mary, but he didn't send it to her.

I believe you're honest.
Come play with us.
Do you know Tom ever lied?
Mary's a Catholic, but her boyfriend is an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you are.
Tom arrived this morning.
He's pretty busy now.
Here's some good news.
I'm proud of my family.

Tom never asked why.
Come here.
Tom will know.

Did I ask you?
I've seen a lot for now.
Turn around!
It took four pounds of gold to get the winning medals.
Give me the sword.
He's not smart enough to collect numbers in his head.
Watch out for me, and I'll take care of you.
You have to trust me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you familiar with the man concerned?
Would you like to talk to Tom about me?
We have to act now.
I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of dying.
Everybody says that.
Speak clearly.
We're here to play golf.
Actually, I've never met Tom.
Don't yell.
This one is unique.
I'm too old for something like this.
We're just gonna follow you.
Knowing yourself is very hard.
Save energy, you'll need it later.
Tom's in the garage, working on his bike.
You're just shot.
My income decreased by ten percent.
It can be hard to visit an unknown territory.
They're ready to talk about the problem.
Finally!
Tom appreciates modern art.
After a long consideration, I finally randomly did things.
It's good.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen often?
We're reducing.
Can you talk to me?
Reduce the TV.
I'm wearing my shirts on my short sleeves.
Old people often talk to themselves.
Tom was hoping to become a famous writer.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
Tom showed me the poems he wrote when he was a teenager.
Where's Avis Shatter?
Tom could tell us how to do that.
I'm just leaving.
She spends three dollars a day for lunch and dinner.
I'll see you in your dreams.
Come in here.
I'll be home tomorrow.
I think you're stupid for that.
I've seen a lot for now.
I feel bad because I lied.
They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom will remember.
Why doesn't he just tell Tom?
If there's no porn with that, the porn will be made with it.
Canada is a hockey country on the ice.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean up your room?
Tom's saving so he could go abroad.
I don't intend to change.
I want to go to Bali.
You can do it if you try it.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
This is no doubt an extremely uncomfortable situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She's jumping every morning before breakfast.
This time it leads to town.
I'm not happy with that.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.

Don't talk.
We had a bad fight.
Stop watching TV and start learning.
We don't know our neighbors.
The police found the money stolen.
I've never seen that before.
I arrived here a few minutes before you.
I didn't do that either.
How much is the bottle of beer?
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
That's a shame!
I'm sick of arguing.
I've got enough space.
Don't yell.
I can't stop thinking about stolen money.
That train's over you.
Come see us.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not angry with anyone.
They need each other.
I'm trying to be careful.
Check this out.
Come fast!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of the painful memories.
I'm convinced.
The music is important to me.
Do you have your favorite?
Please come.
Take it easy!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
My friend got 95 points on the mathematics test.
Tom didn't let anyone else in the room.
Better sweet than forced.
You're in trouble.
In Russian, there is no word "free."
I thought you'd be busy.
Could that be true?
Quiet, Tom.
I hope Tom's safe.
We talked about it all night.
What are you gonna do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's get away.
That must have been hard.
I'll call her tonight.
I had to make some hard decisions.
Ammonia is a base.
Check it again.
Are you honest?
That made sense to me.
Tell me what I have to do.
Nothing's been told to me.
Tom didn't make friends as easy as Mary.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Bad time stopped me from leaving.
Tom bought the papers.
And that's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
The black smoke came out of the chimney.
I know a gentleman.
You'll never catch me alive!
I was honest and honest.
It's time to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for a book.
What's this?
Tom fell asleep again.
Don't move!
Tom's only talking to Mary.
The first lesson is easy.
You've been so fast.
Tom's gonna work.
I got off the train.
I'm pretty good at doing more things at the same time.
No one is as fast as you are.
I agreed to buy that.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please be honest with me.
Are you sarcastic?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove that?
You can't get in that room.
It's all here.
Tom and Mary were wrong about it.
I'm not as tall as you are.
How many years have you been since I last saw you?
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I should never get involved in your stupid business.
We cooperated.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's saving to buy a yacht.
Everyone except Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
I had nothing to do with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
The new branch towards Haugesund will become the main effective road link to Oslo and East Norway for the entire Western region.
You failed me.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom suspects Mary and I have something to do.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your age.
Tom managed to find Mary's house without trouble.
It's not easy sport.
I'm just not gonna do that.
You shouldn't have bought that.
It's their right to vote.
Tell me where you are.
Are we going to see Tom again?
My mother cooks for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
The woman's eating bread.
I listened to music.
Are you involved in this?
I must have eaten something bad.
We're leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Avoid the addicts on the color dilutor.
I liked that one.
Do you like roller-costers?
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
Can you laugh at Tom?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend a meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did that.
How many people were there?
I'm sure Tom's gonna miss me so much.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were kidding her.
I don't think anyone knows.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom was turning around the room, not able to calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I found an empty cage.
Rest, Tom.
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come in sometime?
She wonders how it's possible.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You chose a beautiful one.
Look at how much she is!
Mary's a wedding planer.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to interfere?
I have difficulty talking about my feelings.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were kidding her.
I'm not sure when Tom will be here.
You should come home.
Alice was smiling.
We can look at Tom in a suit, behind a black big piano with dramatic finger moves, creating a very pleasant music that is very pleasant to listen.
The strong winds broke a lot of tree branches last night.
Shouldn't you be preparing for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
The way to a man's heart leads over his stomach.
It's time to get up.
The house is built with a brick.
I didn't write this.
I can't without feeling partially responsible.
People were good to me.
Tom's out of the vision now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary will leave today.
Have you ever tried?
I could go with you.
Take a little.
Come in.
You really don't have to do that.
I wonder what Tom is planning to do.
You need to know how to read the notes in order to extend the choir.
Tom's drowned.
They wanted an apology.
Where was I wrong?
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you later.
Why me?
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in the house.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
The zoo is closed on Monday.
That's the point.
Knowing foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It's very natural for human beings to always take advantage of the interests of others.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I've got a lot of things planned for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
Why are you still awake?
I was attending school yesterday.
Tom's doing what he's told.
I'm still working.
Desperate, insensitive children can sometimes grow up in sociopates.
I'd like it to be with you.
The police's job is to stop and investigate crime.
Can you give me the remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
We all work too hard.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom's learning very quickly.
You're different.
She's not aware of the hatred of others.
This will make our job much easier.
He loves football.
The monks were able to play tennis in the monasteries.
No one trusts him anymore.
Keep the kids away from the drugs.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I was wondering if I might have a dream.
Everything's changing in time.
No one's going anywhere.
Drive to work from an hour and a half.
It's right.
Your time will come soon.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do that.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorce.
He's here.
I'll come up with something.
Play it again, Sam.
Some of us think that such views are just crazy.
Someone could be hurt.
Tom didn't write any letter to Mary while he wasn't there.
We're sick of you.
We all know Tom was guilty.
We need to be reasonable.
I'll be back.
Look at these.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom pulled the thicker end.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a mild torment.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's okay.
I've read about a hundred books before.
Come play with us.
And that was just with great pain.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Did you write the number?
That's not a reason for panic.
I only got 20 points on the mathematics test.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I married.
Explore this.
My future is in your hands.
He's a liar, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him a day earlier.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
That's so sad.
How clever!
Shortly speaking, I disagree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not having fun with anyone, are you?
I've been playing piano a long time ago, so I can still do a little bit.
Is this your glass, or your sisters?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter represented two generations.
He drew himself to work in the garden for two hours a day.
Apples and circuits are presented, not gold and green forests.
I'm resting my legs.
I really like to practice.
I'm really proud of it.
We were in the last place.
I've contributed.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Isn't that black?
You're absolutely right.
Come sit next to me.
Let's not talk about this now.
It's time to break up.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
The meeting statement is ready.
She looks good for her age.
What's this?
What are you even eating?
I don't like being convicted.
I have an appointment tonight.
A man hopes as long as he's alive.
Be careful.
Let's discuss options.
That was a funny movie.
Bitkoin is a crypto.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom's gonna take care of this.
Go check it out.
Some of us hate that.
"This came for you." "Oh..." "Oh, do you remember the one she sent to you when you asked her to give you the pictures of the Eplexe's brother?" "Yes." And then she told you to write the criticism of Mac's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent the criticism of Mac." "Yes." "What did you tell her that you learned from it?" "I realized that Philips' s scratch is persuasive, but not deceptive; and that Rerity is a cruel charge of things that I think she should do as a friend."
I always liked horror-films.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I overlook that?
I'm only going to church for respect for my mother.
It's better to live one day like a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
You don't have to eat right before you get to bed.
Tom's gonna wait.
The students didn't know how to answer.
I'm not a nightbird.
Tom bought me a VIP ticket.
I'm the one who should do that.
Tom's gonna call.
He fired the torch before he got into the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a very good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom quit college.
Why do you hate me so much?
Tom will understand.
Those girls are very busy.
Give us some room.
There's the truth about what Tom says.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your screaming.
Get out!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make way.
The horse must have screwed up and the knight fell off the horse.
I'm looking into it right now.
She has achieved her goal.
Tom can do what he wants, for me.
Tom said he needed money.
Tom was pretty good.
He couldn't understand much of what they said to each other.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what both of them like.
We've been sitting together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He's never going on the train.
Two sides will make speeches this week.
I plan to give my son a computer at the end of the month.
Why did you shave your beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
I've never noticed that before.
We know who he is.
I need a cab.
I saw the cat.
I'm in the gips.
Mom just went to shopping.
I'm always nervous about passport control.
That needs help.
Protect yourself.
He got a cab to the hospital.
Do you know how to jongle?
Don't touch the lion while he's sleeping.
Tom's unpleasant.
Could it be alive?
Did you just meet him?
Honestly to be, I don't know.
It's your choices.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.
I saw the dogs.
Maybe she has other plans?
The patient's breathing.
Thank you all for that.
I don't see anything suspicious.
Am I so different?
Whose manuscript is this?
It feels good.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Let's have lunch here.
I'll find the money somehow.
I shot a bear.
I'm sad to leave.
The eagle is the eagle of birds.
The fire took the first floor.
Tom was very happy when his team won.
They decided to get married.
What did you two do?
I'm afraid you understood this wrong.
I'm adopted.
We have direct access to the information.
I'm punished.
The cat was lying out all the lengths of the sunlight that was stretching through the window.
You're going to school with a pedestrian or a bike?
Tom's not much happier.
Am I the only one to go to the party?
I'm proud of our team.
Only Tom and Mary were saved.
I'm done.
I wasn't very impressed with that.
I left Tom 2013.
Mary knows that her main weapons, a beautiful face and a young body, the past values.
I saw the mouse.
He's trying.
Two countries negotiated a peace agreement.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Answer me now.
It seemed like they knew what they were looking for.
You tried.
We're just gonna follow you.
I'd better go with Tom.
Let's try it.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Tom really knows a lot.
That needs a dream.
That's what I have to tell Tom.
I don't live in that city.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
Tom's no longer a child.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm vegetarian.
It's my habit to do that.
I have a sharp knife.
Tom asked me if he could use my computer.
That's very nice of you.
I've heard this joke before.
I think I missed something.
Send Tom in.
Tom asked me some questions about what just happened.
I'll let you know.
I reacted instinctively.
The answer to this question is simple.
I'll make sure that Tom has everything he needs.
He was naked and boss.
She's just out of my league.
What are we actually looking for?
Why are you all in shock?
Schools and roads are services paid by taxes.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Don't push.
Looks like we're just the two of us.
Things are very different today.
I couldn't stop crying.
Some religious people can be very convincing.
I'm really sick of this.
Tom did it in an old way.
Where's Teheran?
Let's take a look at it again.
It sounds like betrayal to me.
It needs to be exercised.
Why are you all shocked?
It's part of my responsibility.
Underneath the drawing, he wrote, "Grab the virchels!"
Drive slowly.
What a man you are!
Measure twice, cut once!
How long did Tom have it?
We can save some time if we do what Tom suggests.
If you want to talk to a lot of people, you should learn Esperanto. Why is this language? Because it is beautiful and stimulating our learning at the same time. The international language is very important because there are so many people from different countries around the world. Besides, Esperanto is not only useful but also easy to learn. If you learn Esperanto, you can travel to many countries. Come and learn!
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
Did you sleep?
I'll take you to Tom.
Could that be Tom?
I have three beautiful grandchildren.
Don't argue.
She got her fingers on the table.
I'm learning a few languages.
I shouldn't have said that.
I wanted to write to you, but I forgot.
You're good to everyone.
Tom showed him to heaven.
I didn't care.
That's not true, is it?
Tom said he didn't see anything weird.
You never arrived in time.
That sounds like betrayal to me.
I'll try not to disturb you while you're studying.
Life is short.
They'll know.
All the participants gathered in the main hall.
Don't exaggerate.
Hey, relax.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Tom's going to move forward.
Tom was totally scared.
Whose guitar is this?
This won't hurt anywhere.
We have to run away.
We can't stop Tom from doing that.
I'm not selective.
That's what I used to do.
Tom's still at work.
You better think when you close.
Are we all here?
I'm turning around.
Tom stood in pain.
Anything or nothing.
Do they love each other?
I've contributed.
I'll sign it.
Shame him.
Exactly.
We hope you like it.
Will the future be like scientific fantastic?
It just happened again.
How long have you been here?
Tom's rich and free.
My mother bought two bottles of orange juice.
That's not exactly my job.
I turned around.
To be honest, I don't know.
I hope she'll be fine.
The wind calmed down.
In my bedroom, I have a mirror from the floor to the ceiling.
I wish I had remembered that.
Don't sound like that.
What can you do?
Get out of there.
The Festival was held in Latvia.
We're what we are.
Where did you get that idea?
She let me go.
You didn't answer the question.
We're in.
No one's coming to save you.
I don't want to do that.
Tom always bothers me.
Are you ready?
She's proud of her talent.
You can start right now.
You need one of these.
I'm impressed with you.
I can't decide where to park.
Cool!
How's this your fault?
Security has been increased in the city.
Cheers!
Tom will stay.
That boy's talking like he's an adult.
The carrots cost three dollars.
My bike is new.
Tom told me today he loved me.
I doubt Tom knows that.
Can I escort you home?
I've already tried that.
Go upstairs.
There's no parking allowed.
I'm running early.
Tom thinks the same way.
It's so important.
How long have you stayed?
Tom's a passionate bike.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
Let's take a look.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom's family used to move.
We liked food, especially fish.
And they lived happy for the rest of their life.
Tom's too poor to hire a lawyer.
Don't be disgusting.
I'm interested.
What's the problem?
He's not a doctor.
Tom was accidentally made.
Is he a handsome man of Arab or Hindi?
Let's meet you for a drink.
I'm forgetting where I leave my hat.
He screwed up again.
I want to see the ocean, too.
Don't even write!
Who's not doing this?
Tom does it sometimes.
God knows.
Tom loved Mary.
What do you say I do that?
Let's discuss your idea.
Tom said he was innocent.
All girls love Tom.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Cover your mouth while you cough, rain or yell.
Tom bites nails.
He was a man who never hesitated to resist.
Probably a periodic appearance of rage comes because ice floating from Siberia can wear polar foxes on them.
I hear you're not eating meat.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I have a memory problem lately.
I'm a Canadian.
I'll try.
Am I ever wrong?
What's the name of that restaurant?
It's official business.
Their friendship has gradually turned into love.
Is he your new boyfriend?
Forget it.
I agreed to buy it.
What do the papers say?
The temperature of the sun's surface is about 6000°C.
He asked himself a lot of questions about Islam
If we leave right now, we'll get to Boston by 2:30.
What did you two do?
Where's Tom going to sleep?
Why would Tom want that?
It's hard to figure out what really happened.
She passed her fingers through her hair.
Tom's working hard to stand up with his family.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Tom says he has four houses in five different countries.
Let's see what Tom says.
I'm hungry.
Don't argue.
Come here.
Just tell me you're okay.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I'm not afraid of getting old.
I don't fully agree with you.
There are many possible answers to that question.
Let's eat ice cream right now, before it's soaked.
I'm just doing my duty.
I made my first step.
I like to watch you play.
It's hard for what we said to apply in practice.
How long has your head been hurting?
Ole, the oldest eagle in the world, just died, he was about 150 years old.
Come on for a meeting.
I'm proud of this team.
I was asleep.
Your mother put a collision on the top shelf.
Have you seen anyone there?
My father's so old he can't work.
He got what he wanted.
What if I'm right?
I'd like to know how to paint like that.
I'll try to find them.
I had trouble dealing with this problem.
I don't know what it's not, yet or just before, it was good, but several times when I was trying to make a role on the site today, I couldn't do it.
Do I usually seem happy?
I went there with my will.
You think better when you close your eyes.
They really meant that.
Have you ever been here?
Do you really think I'm selfish?
They're all here.
We're almost done.
Maybe they need something to eat.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm adaptive.
The prison fugitive was quickly caught again.
Everything seemed possible at that time.
I sent a map to Tom on fax.

Tom may not arrive for a meeting.
Tom died almost the same moment.
The judge slammed a hammer.
They also discovered that the same wrong assessment was made in some other cases.
Try to stay cool, Tom.
We need to find Tom.
I hope this never happens again.
Please be honest with me.
Tom stayed a few days.
Tom could be here.
I'll do everything for you.
I didn't understand the question.
It was just a matter of time.
Don't mess up.
You should be able to change.
Does Tom have a cable?
Those who want to stay can stay.
If the rental period is extended beyond the contracted period, the proportionate rent supplement shall be calculated.
Why should I tell Tom?
Let your imagination go.

Tom's keeping over 80% of what he's earned.
Are we safe now?
We're what we are.
He's not honest at all.
That's wonderful!
That's great!
Tom knows what he likes.
I'm discreet.
You helped me a lot.
Identify yourself.
I'm really happy about that.
It just has to be like that.
I'll come when I can.
Don't get dressed.

Are we all here?
We need to focus on our virtues.
How fast!
Vera can run mountains.
I'm not giving up!

It's treason.
I'm not late, am I?
Let's go get Tom.
Tell me where you live.
You don't remember anything?
Tom's drinking a lot.
I'm not here.
Tom was sitting on the grass under the coconut tree.
Everybody laughed.

I don't want you to see me naked.
Can I go?
Tom doesn't like to do that.
Do you have a copy?
Come help me.
I barely got out of the house when she started raining.
Tom likes to be busy.
First of all.
Tom's just lazy.
I'm a little bothered.
Does that mean you love me?
Check this out.
Is there any proof?
You have to be strong!
Are you ready for more?
Tom's turned the blink on.
Tom always makes me laugh.
She rarely, perhaps never, goes to bed 11 hours ago.
Are they all crazy?
What are you even eating?
How weird he is.
I'm pulling the line here.
Attention to school rules.
Keep digging.
What school did you go to?
Can I hear another one?
Everybody got away.
I've already written to Tom.
Tom had to rewrite the composition.
You want to get involved?
I knew I shouldn't get involved in your scratched business.
Tom asked me for permission to use my computer.
Did I really be so happy?
Tell me what this says.
I'm not upset anymore.
Did Tom change his mind?
Get out of here.
Do you think what she said was a lie?
His younger brother is a famous footballer.
I was too busy.
I already ordered it.
How does that work?
Will we see Tom again?
You're different.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
That's my job, not Tom's.
Tell me what that is.
Tell him I'm innocent.
I'd like to help.
It would be hard.
She's making his meals.
Where did you learn English?

Tom's playing piano very well.
Tom managed to escape the dark in time.
I don't know anything about her.
You're just shot.
I'm here for you.
I'm not rich enough.
Seniors should pay their hats and dresses.
Does she see me?
Don't move!
Tom was guilty of everything.
I've been training for months.
What was the plan at all?
You need to be here at half an hour later.
Tom said no one was hurt.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I pretended I didn't know Tom.
I saw a Nile horse in the zoo.
I think about Tom sometimes.
Are you both drunk?
Please be honest with me.
Don't go out tonight.
It's not easy to entertain Tom.
He's a man of word.
I'll see if Tom can help us.
It broke into two parts.
Muriel's 20.
Have you eaten anything?
Did you go to see Tom?
Tom's gonna make it.
Why are you acting like a child?
That's exactly what the doctor ordered.
Could you read it?
It's a window from the glass.
Are you done yet?
Does Tom have the key?
Don't talk.
Don't stop.
Are you sure this is safe?
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know.
You'll be better in a few days.
That's what Tom would like us to do.
Tom said I should ask you.
Just tell me the truth.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not upset at all.
Tom's a book mole.
I changed my mind.
The problem is, it's too expensive.
Many would love to be motivated, creative, thoughtful creatures, only if they could get that chance.
You sound tired.
Tom was wrong about that.
Tom always makes a mess of things.
That's not the right thing.
Please record everything I say.
I wish you could sleep.
Maybe you can't hear me.
We're barbecue.
I thought you were married.
I'll find the money somehow.
I assumed you were busy.
I hear Tom's interested.
We should move forward.
What are your ambitions?
I don't like eating a white bowl in the morning.
I think Tom is very smart.
Do you really want to learn another language?
I think I'm fat.
I think we were lucky.
Don't talk.
Come get a drink with me.
Stop screaming.
It's Saturday.
They were evacuated to the American Polish Hospital.
We'll run in the park.
You can't sit next to me.
I'm not happy about that.
Could you read it?
We need to call Tom.
Tom's not strong enough.
Tell me what he says here.
I'm staying.
I know Tom let you down.
Tom was severely hurt.
If you need help, tell me.
I did my first step.
I'm still a little tired.
I'm sure there's a better way to do that.
First leaves at 17:30 and at 20:25.
That was a little weird.
Does that read and write Japanese?
Tom put a ticket on his desk.
It was just an accident.
Tom never even saw us.
I don't intend to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
It usually works.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
And now the word from our sponsor.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him as a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad to be here.
I'm armed.
Tom can't stop.
It's time to sleep.
Tom wanted to have a more beautiful cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.
Did you bring a phenomenon?
I already ordered it.
We'll never know the reason.
How are you feeling?
Bitcoin and etherium are virtual currency.
It's all very cheap.
Anything you remember can help.
Many predictions are not realized.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm still wrong.
Turns out it's true.
I'm sick.
Tom likes a good party.
I don't care what he says.
Mary knows all about the latest fashion trends.
He's a man with many talents.
Where's the smoke, there's a fire.
Tom was Mary's first love.
The proposal was implemented by voting hands up.
Tom may have to stay here for a few days.
My father doesn't like football.
This hat is from Australia.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Go take a look.
I thought food was great.
I'm deaf and nomine while I eat.
You look fat.
You have to learn English a step by step.
That's better now than he was before.
Tom and Mary are different as heaven and the earth.
Tom asked me about the opinion of who will win the race.
Man has a lot of desires that he does not really wish to fulfill and would even be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only wishes, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment for him. One of these desires is and the desire for everlasting life. If it was fulfilled, a man would become completely sick of everlasting life, and would want to die.
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car alone.
She's taking care of her old mother.
Tom had the same problem.
Don't laugh.
Tom and I just wrote a few books together.
There's news.
No one really wants us.
Everyone paid for it.
Be careful.
I'm alone.
Don't drink water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
The price of gold is changing every day.
Tom married.
I could come with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
You have no permission to enter that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is it interesting to paint trains?
I hope you like it.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a screw.
What are you planning to do this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Betoven wrote nine symphonys.
I'll hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
Do you like costumes?
I saw Marcus' house.
It's really pretty bad.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't follow us.
The house in which Atturk was born in thessalonic.
People are wrong.
He has two cars.
That was three months ago.
Let's hear your excuse.
They formed a swim team.
Tom took the package to the orphanage.
Keep digging.
Tom jumped up and down.
Tom's dog was lying.
Don't talk.
This information is confidential.
Nope.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
Don't exaggerate.
I can't approve this project.
Are you sending a message to Mary?
I'll keep your place in the first row.
Mary's pushing her kids to play football.
Are they here yet?
Don't forget to give me my pen back.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
What have you concluded?
I prayed for you.
The bathroom's upstairs.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom cheated on you.
It's just a few minutes from here.
What do you know about me?
I got off the bus.
You're average students.
In a childhood, many violent criminals have tortured animals insensitively.
How long are you gonna be angry and yelling at us?
How much does that really matter?
Do we want aperitive?
If you want, I'll teach you to play ukuleles.
I'm already used to it.
It's not that bad.
I like to play the music that my friends wrote.
Tom admitted that.
It's hard to work with you.
Tom's got a pinch.
I'm guilty.
Don't answer.
Bring some wine.
Things aren't always the way they seem.
Show me the photos!
It's necessary to destroy a few old houses.
What were you doing?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom sneaked into the party.
Tom's very careful.
When are you going to go?
This report has not been written very well.
She stresses that this last move of the government has a multiplied meaning.
Tom arrived this morning.
It took about a year.
How did I miss that?
It could be a trick.
Don't forget to smash yourself with the sunshine.
Tom didn't try to deny Mary's judgment.
Tell me what this is.
His hair was covering his face almost all over.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh country in the world by size.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clean the snow off the roof?
I'll pay you back.
A student from Oslo who fake his diploma to enter college was convicted to prison.
Tom knows it's over.
I wish that had come to my mind.
Tom made vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You were really nice to me.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the vessels?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I normally look happy?
It's not the issue of the essay itself, but all these tormental questions and the explanations of the words make me crazy!
He's here on the weekend.
Looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
That was a lucky shot.
I thought Tom was incredible.
I've never seen anything like that before.
I'm buying a lot of things in that store.
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
Clean up a little.
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people love chicken.
I didn't do that either.
Let's take a look again.
The last time I went to the beach, I burned hard.
Stand back.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Watch out here, Tom.
We've fixed some damage caused by spraying stones on your car.
His girlfriend didn't provide support.
Do you doubt me?
Luckily, Tom didn't hurt himself seriously.
Tom's gonna cry.
We need your help.
I think we've eaten enough.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try in your way.
How could I resist?
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car alone.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I married.
Don't let anyone in!
We're not going into that.
Hold on, Tom.
Tom definitely pulled out the thicker end.
He's not equal.
It's all right with me.
Obviously Tom's sick.
I started learning English when I was twelve, and then I was interested in languages, but not in that measure. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; so, it's time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember that song.
I need a honest girl.
She's a starter.
Are they still here?
I'm sure Tom's gonna miss me so much.
Tom won't run away.
I'd go.
Get down!
Tom couldn't stand it.
Anything you remember can help.
It's not something to worry about.
I understand they're a trunk in the eye of those like you, but this is just poor.
Tom's gonna make it.
There's no free lunch.
Please leave this place clean as long as you wish to find it.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
We can only do that.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
That's your life.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I sympathize.
Stop regretting yourself.
Learn yourself by doing it.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
They won't take it.
There's no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
I'm doing my job.
It's all quiet again.
I didn't make it.
Tom's going to a graphical design school.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always unsatisfied.
You should face reality.
We managed to escape right in time.
I'm tired of it.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
I want to talk to Tom about it.
It should work.
She hated him.
I could talk to Tom.
It just happens.
Take a little.
He talks about others so he'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused that he didn't even know which question to ask.
Find Tom.
It seems okay to me.
Whatever you think?
You changed my life.
Reaction is not always the best way to act.
I'm not going to tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to take him to the airport.
The Committee recommends that those who have complained should be compensated with a proportionate part of the annual compensation for interest.
Tom was buying time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of overreal.
In theory, it's possible, but in practice it's very difficult.
It was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
Tom's upset.
Remember the file names before attempting to reproduce the deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom ran down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.
I wasn't nervous about it.
Tom said he wouldn't be waiting for us.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
We won't let you die.
Many things go out of my hand.
Tom wants to teach his children the importance of work.
Tom was always a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Tom is one of the best attorneys in Boston.
How much am I gonna get?
How many close friends do you have?
It's happening.
How long do you think Tom was preparing for an exam?
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You don't have to be hit by stones in the glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
I tried to get Tom home.
I'd get involved.
Don't be a screw-up.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
I'm probably not watching TV tonight.
Did Tom pull out the thicker end?
Give me all the money.
Mer was very supportive.
The girl's seeing a boy.
It's very hard, almost impossible to find an apartment in Oslo.
My French still isn't very good.
It happened right here.
I don't know well Latin.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I'm waiting for my turn.
I've been shaken by a lot of news.
You're not the one who died.
Would you rather tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom asked for help.
They know you.
I've done every test.
There's no point just to wait for something to happen; you have to do something right away.
It's a area with a lot of new houses.
I can't believe all this.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
The snow was falling yesterday.
We walked through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid one backup key in his garden.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I went out to the wrong bus station.
I wrote this song only for you.
Have you read the Holy Bible?
And if I was rich, I wouldn't give him the money.
Are we safe now?
Are you going to send this as a mail shipment?
What are you suggesting?
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Watch out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
Come on, give me that.
Are you blaming me?
I wish I was beautiful.
For some strange people, the knowledge of some language is kept secret.
I don't intend to change.
They slowly moved forward.
I survived.
Do you know how this machine is used?
Don't be distracted.
Blue stands for you.
Come visit us soon.
Have you been in an accident?
Tom's worried about what could happen.
He was a honourable man.
My father doesn't like football.
We're all out of alcohol.
Card, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
Something was lying on the ground.
My friend lives to God behind his feet.
Do you think Tom would like to go fishing with us next weekend?
What are you gonna do today?
Tom looks like a banker.
That's Tom.
Tom still looks worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary's a very shy girl.
Tom doesn't have any such problems.
You can't hide secrets from me.
It just happened again.
There's a hard day waiting for you.
It's good.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I'm not going to participate.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be fully satisfied.
I'm so fat.
Let's stay in there tonight.
I thought Tom was incredible.
People don't always act rational.
I didn't do that either.
Did you pass the exams?
I sincerely support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Did we agree?
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Tom went that way.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom was afraid of me before.
Tom whispered something to Mary and she smiled.
Can I take a look at your ticket?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
It's clean.
Today's your daughter's birthday.
Will anyone tell me what to do?
Obviously it's a knocking error.
Your book is double bigger than mine.
We're both not rich as much as we want.
Tom wouldn't be pleased.
Tom has a nice garden.
The cup of coffee cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom's got a disgusting hair.
I've seen enough for now.
That's what I hate.
We'll miss you so much if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's going to happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom's gonna take a look.
Here's what I think.
I could go with you.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you deactivate the bomb?
I need five more minutes.
I bet you know who told me that.
Mary used the apples that Tom gave her to make an apple butter.
How many songs did you write?
We're glad to have you here.
You can write in any language, all the languages in Tataeba are equal.
How can we manage others when we can't manage ourselves?
Don't rush.
You can learn, no matter how old.
He devoted his life to a vision of what he wanted to create for himself and others.
Did you give it to Tom?
Who have you helped in recently?
Just close your eyes.
Tom's a little worried.
How is this your fault?
How did I overlook this?
What do I write here?
My father bought me a book.
I'm adaptive.
Citizenship is a prerequisite for voting.
How many times have you been here?
He's fixing electronic devices.
You're losing.
I'm ready, bro.
Please push as strong as you can.
This fish is big.
Send me some sugar, please.
It's nice to be needed.
I hope we figure this out.
We all have to resist this.
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our manager came to a good idea and we made a great plan.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired that I can barely keep my eyes open.
Bring me some sugar, please.
Come quickly!
Where did you find the keys?
Did you ever hang a video on YouTube?
I was very interested in building a more intense academic programming plan.
Just give me the money.
She's pregnant.
Don't let Tom find out.
I can't wait for Monday.
Have you been here before?
Does Tom have any experience?
I don't understand.
Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
I could kill you now.
Mary used walking sticks that helped her climbing up and falling in the journey.
The compass indicates north.
Don't talk.

Whose initiative is this done?
Finish this.
Which one should I take?
I like cable meals.
Where's your friend?
When do we start eating?
The Queen and the King have reunited their powers.
I don't know why my head hurts.
I suppose you already know the answer to that.
Flowers have been fully introduced.
"How old are you?" "Sixteen."
I like this book at least.
Blue looks good for you.
Tom wasn't as handsome as Marie said she would be.
Give me that other box.
Tom has an older brother John.
I'd accept it.
They'll know what to do.
Why did you keep quiet all the time?
He took off.
It was fun celebrating together.
I'm afraid I dislocated my right shoulder.
You really need to take a shower.
What is the purpose of life?
Drive a lace.
I got my right hand stabbed.
I don't know much about you.
Did you do anything?
You should probably talk a little slower.
I need a beer.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.
Does that happen often?
A bird told me.
I couldn't see who it was.
Crazy!
You're paying me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You should talk to me.
It just wasn't our day.
Take everything.
I've resigned.
Everything's wrong.
It's all ruined.
Marriage between the same half is now legal in 20 countries, including Ireland since yesterday.
Take this home with you.
She bought bread.
We'll try in your way.
Use yourself.
You deserve to congratulate you.
Since the message was in French, I read it easily.
Finish this.
Tom tried to answer Mary about that.
Can you give me some water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
Everybody's gone.
I'll learn more hard.
I'm hurt.
I bought them to you.
None of us saw Tom do that.
And you're wondering why we can't stand your company?
You wrote my name wrong.
You're different.
Shame her.
I have two cats.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
His girlfriend didn't provide support.
I didn't care about that.
Some of them were and are still in constant danger because of political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I still don't think the Internet is a place for children.
That was hard for me.
What did you find?
You're made for me.
He needs it.
Apparently, it's a typefiller.
Are we done?
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom got into Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a little bitch.
Control yourself.
Tell her.
I'd accept it.
You're my luck.
I'm waiting for a bus.
Bad things will happen.
A few trees fell during the storm in our environment.
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere before.
Everybody smiles.
I didn't know you were so rich.
He refused to comment.
We're trying.
I'm giving up.
Tom looked mad.
Don't exaggerate.
I'll have work tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
I'm sure they need you.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think my writing's doing very well.
Tom's no longer a member of this club.
That helps us a lot.
I filled the glass.
I'm not selective.
How many aunts and uncles do you have?
That morning, Mary visited the entire village.
The rumor's rapidly spread.
Am I so different?
Tom pulled the keys and opened the door.
I just arrived.
What Tom did has helped a lot.
I've never noticed that before.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not worried.
It's helping.
Dima slept with 25 men during one night and then he killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I didn't think you could do that.
We're just gonna follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we arriving soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I hope I'm not the only one who's gonna be there.
Are you angry about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This makes me very uncomfortable.
The costs will grow soon.
Did I really be so happy?
Tom might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar to me.
I'll go to the sea tomorrow if it's nice.
Tom's gonna call.
I had dinner with her.
You see everything in black.
My car wasn't good enough.
Do they suspect me?
What do you have to do?
Tom likes to drive.
They couldn't travel because there was a problem.
Winter's over, spring's over.
It's really so simple.
Since these newspapers were written about no farmer wanting to work as a buyer in Westfold, the interests have rapidly increased.
I'm punished.
I have to get in there.
We're a little busy here.
Get on the board.
It's really surprising.
Have you ever seen UFO?
You're standing in my way.
It's become dark.
What's the big secret?
I'm being chased by the police.
I did my first step.
I hope Tom will remember this.
We ask the teacher questions every day.
What kind of food do you usually cook?
If the world wasn't in the state he is now, I could trust anyone.
Three wounded, for which they are currently instantly in what state they are, were evacuated to the US Poland Hospital.
I prayed for you.
Etherium and bitcoin are cryptolutes.
Hello, can you hear me?
We live on the sixth floor.
I'm not afraid of you.
Every time I see you, my heart tells me I'm in love.
Are you all right, folks?
Will you help me?
It didn't get so much worse.
Tom took his chairs to the next room.
I'm destroyed.
I respect such people.
Did you see it work?
Is that yes or not?
Don't laugh.
I'm not a bad student.
We're done for today.
He's a complete monarch.
Since the consequences are potentially serious, there is a general precautionary measure to avoid infections in this type of patient.
I'm a free man.
I don't like screwed people.
The room was dark.
He's going home.
That could be a weapon.
I can't fix the car alone.
I'd better go with Tom.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
Shouldn't you be preparing for school?
I want to feel important.
A second later, his lips screwed into a vicious smile.
My mother was an alcoholic.
Mary's enthusiasm for course fell down when her favorite lecturer moved away.
I don't want to be rude.
I guess you already know the answer to that.
Tom was nervous when he started a new job.
Help me.
The U.S. dropped the atomic bomb in Hiroshim 1945.
You read something interesting?
Smoking here is not allowed.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom's always very nice.
I barely closed my eye.
Was Tom here when we arrived?
Was I really so happy?
I took off my wig.
Tom won't be happy to hear that.
Tom was called by his father.
Did he really commit suicide with that?
I'm going to get some sleep.
What was I supposed to do?
Don't approach my wife.
They'll know what to do.
Do you have a copy?
I wasn't really a friend, I was just pretending.
Did I drop that?
I just want to get out of here.
Why do you think that?
Little kids like to touch everything.
She screwed her hair to the papylots.
He was released from military service.
My right blood is bleeding.
I'm motivated.
Knowledge frees us and makes us better people.
I didn't mean to drag you in.
Are we safe now?
Which one of your friends will come?
Can you explain them to me?
I've seen Tom dancing a lot of times.
You tried.
I'm taking you to dance.
Tom might try to convince Mary to do that.
She's making elephant mosquito.
You told me not to lie.
He used to be a member of the social elite than a representative of wide mass.
I'm scared.
Help us reach our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't hurry.
Give me the pen.
Just tell Tom I called.
There's no answer to the question what's best, because it's always individual and depends on the situation.
Tom thought Mary was cute.
Be careful.
You look like a very smart person.
I have the same desire to go abroad for a year to perfection.
The house burned up to the ground before the firefighters arrived.
The most rain months are May, June, July and August.
Do I usually seem happy?
I've already written a part of the report.
I was ready for that.
Show me the papers.
It's about...
It can be hard about passion, maybe it's just sex.
Are you done washing the courts?
I'm the only one here who can do that.
Tom's gonna pay.
The money season's over.
I like cable kitchen.
I'll start with a beer.
Thank God.
That gives me an idea.
Is Tom around?
I'm motivated.
What a tragedy!
We're here.
Knowledge makes us free and better people.
Don't talk.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
I'm almost never home during the day.
The best parents of all are those who let their children follow their birth talents.
I would've gone.
You're very inappropriate.
You failed me.
There's snow all year on this mountain.
I think you shouldn't be impulsive with anything these days.
What's in nature forever, when everything's so passing?
The engine's warming.
I'll see you later!
Without you, I feel lost.
I have to plan everything.
This may not be enough.
You've got that nicely.
Everything you have will have you one day.
Whatever Tom is busy, he never forgets our e-mail to his shirt at least once a week.
The dog's dead.
This is life.
Do we have any of these?
Is this your suitcase?
Tom stopped for a second.
Because of the bad time, the plane's late.
Explore them.
I'm in a better shape than you.
I'm not so worried.
Come on, get up, Tom.
I think it's possible to do that.
I'm going to get some time off.
I'm pretty happy now.
He first did a preliminary test with a new electronic alcohol test before he was sent to laboratory testing.
We were walking through the park.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Look around.
It was a stressful day.
Is it clear?
Are these your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom was looking closely.
Let us help you.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom doesn't know French.
What's your job?
Let's continue the debate.
How much do I get?
I want to be with you.
This was prefined and depicted in the personality of so strange, cruel and stubborn that little one dared to cooperate closely with him.
She's pregnant.
Don't move!
I could get there by 2:30.
Merauke is the east city of Indonesia.
Tom used to come here as a student.
We'll take the next one.
Did you do homework?
Check everyone.
Tell us a story about ghosts.
Check everyone.
The session's over.
I have a lot planned for tomorrow.
We need to follow Tom.
Tom saved $300.
How does she look?
I'm pathetic.
I can't wait till Monday.
Come with us.
Tom's on his way here.
Tom wasn't fat.
That's crystally clear.
I'm trapped.
Cut cheese on thin pieces or small cubes.
Have you ever experienced a car accident?
I'd like to start.
I didn't wear impairable clothes.
I'm fascinated.
Just serious questions, please.
Man, that sentence has caused a real confusion.
Give food to the homeless.
I've translated the song as much as I could.
He went out a few minutes ago.
I believe you're honest.
Tom wanted a bigger house than his neighbor.
Tom has an eye infection.
I'm glad we were there.
Although I was sick, I did my best.
Big boys don't cry.
I could go there now.
I need to write ten pages for next Monday.
The situation was extremely dangerous; it was a matter of life and death.
I've never noticed that before.
I need to sleep.
Tom usually comes to school before any other student in the department.
I'm touched.
And if I was rich, I wouldn't give him the money.
Why?
"Where should I sit?" "Whereever."
Wise is needed to understand wisdom: music does not exist for deaf audience.
I don't want to play this game.
I knew you couldn't do that.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
The troubled children are often without any guilt feelings.
I feel bad because I lied.
I invited him.
Maybe they quit.
That's why I liked Tom.
Tom got red.
Tell him.
How do you get rid of the mole in the garden?
It's Saturn.
My aunt gave me flowers.
I hope that's not true.
Don't stop.
I don't like working at home.
Of course, Tom loves his kids.
Where are you now?
It's very likely that FIFA was rotten to the heart.
She gave me a contradictorial answer.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
He's wearing a golden chain around his neck.
I'm very proud of it.
Atturk was born 1881, in Thessalonic.
At least Tom's honest.
I want to answer the last question first.
Did you tell Tom this?
We don't know our neighbors.
It's only five in the morning, and it's already a light outside.
I hate mathematics.
What's your aunt doing?
If there is, the crossover with that will happen sometime.
Tom does well French.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
I know this is weird.
He never overcome his son's death.
I'm just doing my duty.
Everybody's been sitting.
If you don't have anything else to do, then the Greek island number.
She's always wearing wooden clothes.
Will that almost solve the matter?
Mary put the ring on her finger.
We've already decided not to do that.
I'm really proud of Tom.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Tom seemed older and mature than the other boys.
It'll take forever.
The top of that mountain is flat.
She smiled.
The gifts of Vishnua are called the Vishnuan; the gifts of Shiva are the Shivans.
Tom would like to know if you'd like to come to this party.
You're grown up.
I totally lost the flow of my thoughts.
I've never regretted that I did it.
I'm convinced.
Do you speak Roma?
Tom came to see me yesterday noon.
Hello, buddy!
Tom's still at work.
Did you sleep enough last night?
This must be a place.
If you don't be a good girl, you won't get a birthday present.
They must have known all the time.
"I think the ending is ugly," he said. "Well, somewhere in the things that people make I want to see scars, failure, mess, distortion."
Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I refused Tom.
I'm not 100% sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
I'd buy that one.
This overcomes all the borders.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
Obviously, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
It wasn't too hot.
I almost forgot my passport.
Tom reads a lot.
I hope you're not talking about me.
You're good to everyone.
I'm usually not so busy on Monday.
Both of my sisters are teachers.
Looks like it works.
I don't live to eat, I eat to live.
Tom seemed very confused.
I thought you couldn't do that.
Just tell Tom I called.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "if not Q, then not P."
My wedding must be perfect.
Move it.
We should learn.
We don't have another choice.
When this is time, it's best that you sit home and don't go out.
I think Tom's hiding something.
Tom, I need your help.
During the observation power experiment, Tom couldn't describe any picture from the wall of his living room, even though he lived there for two years.
She's pretty good.
I definitely had luck.
Everybody kept their breath.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
I called him.
How many calories does that sandwich have?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
I like to watch you work.
I hope we'll visit Peking, too.
You're my inspiration.
This time I abstained from commenting my loved friend.
I agree.
Be careful.
Did anyone call me?
We'll have lunch together at half one.
I'm still a little tired.
That he seeks to maximize his own interest, happiness or security seem very natural for one human being.
I can do it like a joke.
I'm not singing.
It's weird that no one knows the victim.
We're out of here for five minutes.
Sorry I'm late.
Translation is not as easy as many people think.
Tom would never admit that.
It was just the beginning.
Did you finish your homework?
Is everything okay between us?
I've never camped.
I thought food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the years on the tree we broke and discovered it was 30 years old.
See you later, Tom.
Do you want some fruit juice?
Let's schedule a meeting.
I pissed him off.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
Tom still looks shaken.
Boston is a great city.
We hope people will like it.
Maybe they're leaving tomorrow.
Come here, I want to show you something.
I'm remodeling.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That's interesting.
They're afraid of me.
I was happy yesterday.
I really liked Tom, too.
He loves rituals.
No one helped us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you been living here?
Get help.
I didn't ask you to do that.
Tom writes a letter to his shirt every week.
He still has no experience in this job.
Can you help us?
Will you relax?
Tom encouraged Mary to write about his experiences.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
Who can't be proud of being Serbian, with their historical highest achievements - the slaughter of heads and genocides?
Do you know how to deactivate the bomb?
Where did I leave the keys?
I'm a big football fan.
She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your own brother.
Tom lost his feeling.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
Tom's gonna take a look.
I'm wondering if anyone could help me.
I'm surprised.
Everybody was smiling.
I've been playing golf with Tom a lot of times.
You underestimate me.
I don't have a guitar.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Tom said we should stay here.
We're close friends.
My friend can speak to Hindi liquidly.
Yeah, isn't it great?
Where can I find a tourist office?
I'm comfortable.
I've already written a part of the report.
Don't stop.
Please come see me tomorrow.
It was a little weird.
I really enjoyed it.
No one has died... yet.
Can we, people, cook grass and extract food ingredients from it?
Why don't you play with the others?
We have three dogs, one white and two black.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom wrote a stick on the ground.
Don't you want another glass of milk?
Enjoy yourself!
The chances are against me.
I'll quit.
He expects us to help her.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you understood me wrong.
That's good.
I don't want to bother you.
Tell me what's going to happen.
Tom's seen enough.
Are we leaving soon?
They're selling sugar in the store.
Tom and Mary were watching the sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does that sometimes.
Thank Tom for your help.
What did you both do?
Happy birthday!
Photos of nature and animals, painted in complete silence and calmness, are real artwork.
My mother died the day I married.
I'll never mention this again.
You don't have permission to get in that room.
We have two children.
I think Tom's careful.
The white family will come to Tokyo at 11:30.
What did you do to me?
Enjoy it.
Let me write your steps.
Tom's probably still hiding.
Mary looks sweet, whatever she wears.
Watch out!
Tom has failed to provide any evidence to support his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You have a bad nature.
I'm on my way.
I bought this yesterday.
I had a very bad day.
The whole country's talking about it!
I'm not a good swimmer.
Does he love me?
Tom made a omelet.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm disgusting.
I was happy yesterday.
The way Mary blew the door, Tom realized she was sad.
It's not the best time now.
He's no longer a child.
I'm trying to get a futon at least twice a week.
My education made me what I am.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Wherever I go, I'm there.
You want to join me?
Leave the book on the top shelf.
We could be happy here.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
Is that what it takes?
Take everything.
You tried.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
I just saw Ambassador Saudi Arabia resigned.
Be careful.
Maybe something's wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open that.
I've had trouble dealing with this problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
You're the most boring person I know.
Contact Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you such information.
I didn't do that.
I'll check it out.
Tom was shocked.
Just a second, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom still looks shaken.
That's what the doctor ordered.
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "(no P) and/or Q."
He speaks English.
I'm writing a message to Tom right now.
That's an exception.
Tom came here a little sooner than usual today.
I could eat a horse.
Actually, I never met Tom.
What's easier?
Tom asked for an increase.
I've never noticed that before.
This should work.
I always liked Tom more.
Where was Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought the papers and read them on the train on his way to work.
I have home ghosts.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cookie for Tom.
You're funny.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
Let me try the other one.
You work slowly.
I didn't do that either.
Stories of Snory Sturlusson talk about the spread of Christianity in Norway by violence.
Answer me right now.
Feel like home!
Students didn't know how to answer.
I'll try and convince Tom to do that.
Am I so different?
I'm screwed up.
I assumed you were busy.
That elegant, golden chain with hearts is a necklace that's gonna shake your world.
Everything happened by lightning speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
It's been raining.
There's milk in the fridge.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Take more.
You're irrational.
I'm angry.
The holiday dinner was held in the White House.
Planning should be left to me.
You can avoid a lot of trouble if you just do the right thing from the first time.
Mary jumped from the window to the river.
The doctor's on his way.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
We all have to die.
Who are we?
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm scared.
I'm great.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
John and Mary always walk with their hands.
Where was I wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I missed so many opportunities.
It helped me a lot.
Give me another case.
Tom still has a little time.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Tom was more than generous.
I just slipped it off.
I'm sure it wasn't intentionally.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
We've lost ourselves, haven't we?
We won't let you die.
Did you go to see Tom?
This is the beginning of a new era.
I don't have a ticket.
Nothing happened.
I baked an apple pie.
He has a good reputation.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Everything's different.
The truth has to be said.
Look at how much it is!
We need to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, he's working on his engine.
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted to have a bigger ship than his brother.
Tell me what that is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
For breakfast, I'm always eating fruits and eggs.
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom put it to us that he doesn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
We suggest that water quality be checked once a year in pipes, twice in the well.
Dear God, it's really hard for people to turn your attention to one or another thing about you, your attitudes or your appearance, for example.
What did you say?
Tom could have done better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I was thrown into a big nothing.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of the dogs who lay.
Are they still there?
Tom didn't write to Mary for a long time.
"Yes, orange juice, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.
Can I just interrupt you for a moment?
Students didn't know how to answer.
It's a good intention.
I've been thinking about it before.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
Girls were sleeping.
I'm just looking around.
Do you want to know something specific?
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
Interability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I have no idea.
Tom was seriously hurt in an accident.
Two-thirds of the students were at the meeting.
My mother's not like other mothers.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You're opening the door.
That's good.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Did you see my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.
I'm objective.
Nine of the ten voters believe that Mary is the most suitable candidate for a new leader, but Tom won't vote at these elections.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
I'm probably not gonna read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
Make a place.
Tom is also very famous in Australia.
Be careful.
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful with your wishes.
Tom's a third year student.
Who's going with us?
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
We were never separated.
I'm 30.
Give me my bottle back.
I'm really happy to be here.
At that moment, it exploded with a big blast.
That's exactly what I said that would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91 percent of the Norwegian population are free from drinking water from surface sources.
What's she drinking?
Tom's very rude.
Don't forget to write a date.
Clean this mess.
Could you read that?
It's totally normal.
It's said a new restaurant was built.
The price of this book is five dollars.
Can you keep secrets?
I assumed you were busy.
When the fire exploded, he slept greatly.
I never thought about it.
Quiet up there.
Tom explained the details, but I still don't understand.
That wouldn't like it.
I'm really curious.
Tom parked twice.
How are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
What are you gonna do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Tom signed the bill.
There are islands on the sea.
I've never had trouble sleeping.
I didn't see anything.
Any other possibilities?
The amount for the work done and interest in the investment capital was a few million.
I can't wait tomorrow.
Is the coffee good for you?
You never know what's going to happen tomorrow.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need a drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I disagree with you completely.
Do you keep this place for someone?
How are you these days?
Week is seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about it.
Will you come to Tom's and Mary's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
I'll be back late.
The sea's up, the sea of people.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he read.
There's no reason to panic.
He didn't even hear Tom hates us.
I don't want any beans.
It's been a long time since I sent a letter to anyone.
What's the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom turned off the engine.
I just thought about you.
Don't argue.
Did you write a report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he had no choice.
Can you leave, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
Tom works about nine hours persistently.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
Not everyone could hear what Tom said.
I'll take a shower.
We have four hours of French every week.
Let's start now.
I can't think about it while I'm doing it.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
It's our only hope.
I got up on my left leg today.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It was an audience presentation.
Let me show you why you don't have to do this.
Tom wasn't practicing.
Thank you very much!
Keep the remnant.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should do a test again.
Why would Tom surrender?
Europeans have gained advantage over other civilizations 500 years ago.
I'll pray for your family.
I can't remember what I was eating yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
That makes me very angry.
Is there still light outside?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
I assumed you were busy.
Do you agree?
I recognized him at first sight.
That's very nice of you.
I wish that had come to my mind.
Tom managed to get in the house through the window.
I saw the cat.
I saw the cat.
There's snow falling in Paris.
I hope Tom will be back safely.
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean up now.
You tried.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom's strict but fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us had a potato salad eating.
Come alone.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I promised.
It's not a simple sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be a Lezilebovic.
I eat a lot of meat.
Tom's a screwber.
The future looks dark for Edmond Dantes, since he became the victim of the conspiracy, he was convicted to betray and sent to jail for life.
You're irrational.
Mother chose this curtain.
We're both not rich as much as we want.
Can you let Tom know I came in?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
You need one of these.
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French myself.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Tom's thinking the same way.
That's his weak spot.
You're one of us.
She's in the grave with one leg
Tom just told me the opposite.
Louder!
I'm compassionate.
Tom's unsatisfied.
That would be a pleasure.
He's crazy like electricity.
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote.
That doesn't scare me at all.
How old are you really?
Tom asked me if I was sleeping at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Nice to meet you.
This place looks quite different from what it was before.
Why are the rabbit's ears big?
I'm a runner.
I want to help.
I know how to do that.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's really an idiot.
Come see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's the best thing to do in the walk.
This one's cool.
I just enjoyed it.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Cade.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
I'm sorry I tried at all.
That river looks tiny, isn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this composition.
We hate Tom.
This one's cool.
Tom cut the tape.
This isn't so funny.
That's a big secret.
Mary said she'd find out the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't increase her salary.
"Will you think?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
I'm cold.
Please wait a second.
I'm not gonna do that!
I'm tired of arguing.
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
She's a singer.
I like to watch you play.
I definitely had luck.
What first song have you ever written?
Tom could get upstairs.
I just want to get out of here.
Don't let her get you out of this good chance.
Be careful.
He's in the first year of college.
I looked for grape juice.
I meant my family.
Can you make Tom laugh?
My liquid knowledge of language is enough for many situations, but not to express my, often contradictive, emotions.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the shelf.
I often feel a heartbreak.
Tom's undercover.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of a snake.
I know that girl somewhere.
I slipped once.
I'm sorry I'm always interrupting you.
He's a man of power.
That's wonderful!
I'm lousy.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it in time?
It's weird that the mailman hasn't come yet.
How do we prevent that from happening?
I hope Tom will remember this.
Did I really be so happy?
Soon I'll buy a boat.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
Did you ever get a fast ride punishment?
I'll be right upstairs.
We have to go.
Tom's a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There's no girl on the Internet.
She tried.
As most of the 18-year-olds, Tom is not sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi wrote a lot of musical works for a fagot.
The Secretary of the United States, John Carrie, broke his right bone in a bicycle accident on Sunday in France.
Where is a lot of grandmothers, they're kids.
Sounds simple, I know.
Tom seemed very confused.
The results were incredible.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes have screwed up.
Have you completely recovered?
I'll listen.
Tom spoke very loud.
Don't move!
There was an accident recorded by the observer.
Did I miss that?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship has gradually turned into love.
It's in vain.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the dest side is in New York.
There are indications that the reception, which is known by its luxury meals, this year will be something more modest.
What's wrong with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom will do that.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which direction are you going?
I'm sorry if I disappointed you.
Violent criminals were often rapes in childhood.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who saves the words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to me for dinner yesterday.
Look what he's like!
Living truth.
You're very inappropriate.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now it's a great time to buy one like that.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom got out of it.
Tom's been involved in people who should never have been involved with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and write.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's the problem you have to solve on your own.
I was overwhelming.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom put the book down.
This should work.
You don't have to judge a man according to his appearance.
That's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thank you for your e-mail!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
They'll make speeches tomorrow.
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was going to be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as his weakest member.
I've been there before.
That's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
So what are your plans?
The kids are sleeping.
You need a temporary bridge.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
Tom closed the door.
I didn't have fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Tom worked very hard and broke a lot of money.
I don't like being socialized.
He lived a simple life.
We offered help.
It was a dark and storm night.
The first phase is over.
You'll be famous.
He's got a lot of money, even a surplus.
We're glad to have you here.
Tom was sure of himself.
I wonder how Tom feels.
You're the most boring person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I bought a dozen pens today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Does French learn in your school?
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom's gonna recover.
You're important to me.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't get into it.
I'm used to nobody likes me.
The brakes scratched.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
I'm a little worried now.
Do you have a stable relationship with the boy?
Tom still knows he's saying the song he wrote when he was 13 years old.
Did you see Tom leave?
Be careful.
How would you translate that to you?
I'm ready to pay you well to do that.
That was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
Many admire him.
I hope it'll be a good time tomorrow.
Let's sit down.
Come and look.
Tom really seems familiar.
Do your kids have their own rooms?
Tom kept all the letters that Mary sent to him.
Go swim with Tom.
He's safe.
Tom died in his dream.
The woman's shiffoner is not full without a small black dress.
Finish this.
Tom helped me save a penny by telling me about a cheaper place where it could be bought.
There's nothing else to do but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's been working his whole life.
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
Tom will live.
You won!
That's a bad sign.
I understood wrong.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really so happy?
I'm good with the kids.
I'll be late.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the road.
You should leave Tom a message.
You always lie to me.
Just in time!
Tom has a family now.
That doesn't surprise me.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
Can I call you in 20 minutes?
As little as we know about her origin, at least we can be sure it's the pilot Evangelion.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got into the bus.
Yelen's faster than stronger.
People used to write books to knocking machines.
I reacted instinctively.
It's a toilet.
Tom doesn't see anything wrong with letting Mary learn how to drive.
Are you coming back now?
I hope it's not.
How could I hate Tom?
Wear this.
How barbaric!
I've always known that.
Tom thought I was you.
I'm looking forward to your letter.

I've made my decision.
Do you have a copy?
We're going to the movie.
I wouldn't hurt her.
In this stage of world history, in America there is no such thing as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is no one who is daring to write his sincere opinion, and if he would have written it in advance, he would know that it will never appear in the press. I get regularly my wage to keep my sincere opinion out of the newspaper for which I work for. Many of you are also paid for less than 24 hours. The job of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to write what he honestly thinks, he would find himself out outside, looking for some other jobs. That I have allowed my right opinion to appear only in one publication of the newspapers for which I work for.
I'm not worried.
I could use some help.

I can't believe I forgot.
Open up.

That's right.
Let's be friends.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
You'll probably never see me again.
I could talk to Tom.
I thought you were happy here.
I thought Tom was doing fine.
I could come with you.
I'm excited.
I invited him.

It would be different.

Did you talk about me?

It doesn't play any role anymore.
Get help.

I was wrong this morning.
You can do better than that.
Is everything solved now?
Did you see my dogs?
I have a few friends.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom knew French.
I feel a sharp pain in my stomach.
You have to lie down.

What a nice car!
Are these bananas mature?
You're very rude.
I could kill you now.

That's a very unpleasant question.
Find out what happened.
I'll learn German.
Thank you so much for this information!
If I didn't know you well, I'd think you'd hide something.
Tom thought he had time.
He apologized, so I didn't want to give it a special significance.
Here, ask Tom.
You have to focus on your virtues.
Does Tom like it here?
Bring some wine.

Who broke the cup?
You're just wasting your time.

There are several reasons.
I'm really proud of it.
Stop worrying so much.
It didn't matter to me.
I'm really happy about that.
We missed Tom so much.
I'm not ashamed of that.

I saw the bus.
You're saying you've deliberately hid your good side?

I'm not getting into it.
Tell him.
Do you speak English?

He looks young for his age.
I'll always remember your advice.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
Who are you trying to cheat on?
I and all my brothers share the room.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Looks like that diamond is real.
What did you do now?
I'm sure you can do that.
You can't go in that room.
How old are you really?
You'd be crazy if you stayed.
You tried.
There was a new snow lave on the way to Eceskaret, Oda Municipality in Hordaland on Tuesday night, and it is not known whether anyone was trapped in the lave.

I can't fix the car on my own.
Zini!
Please hurry.
Tom swallowed his head.
Should we tell someone?
He's flooded from cold.
I'm getting better.
That's what Tom thought.
His memory loss is more mental than a physical problem.
He's breathing.
He started yelling.
Tom could have been better.
Tom was thick.
Spider took your car.
So what if that's true?
He was in front of his time.
Don't kidnap yourself.
That meant a lot to me.
The effect was a lot different from what we meant.
Are you not finished yet?
I'll have to think about that,
Tom was talking about music.
There were so many people in the train that I had to stand.
I don't have homework today.
Tom and Mary agree well.
When can Tom come home?
In the window glass I see the reflection of my face.
Go talk to Tom.
I meant my family.
You could have spared me if you told me that I shouldn't have been here today.
This will make a lot easier for us.
I've been gone too long.
Is it true you're going to study in Boston?
Tell me where you live.
Let's get it over again.
Whatever you do, don't leave the board up at the toilet.

That should save us some money.
He worked ten hours persistently.
This one's pretty cool.
How did you find out where Tom is?
Tom's probably gonna still be mad.
They can't recognize each other anymore.
I'm not falling on it.
That's a fake, isn't it?
I'd agree.
The price doesn't matter.
You deserve a reward.
She's very patient.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Will we see Tom again?
Just try to stay calm.
He accepted he was a monster.
Do you know how to cook?
Are we starting soon?
You can't get in that room.
You know I don't like balls.
Go ahead.
The first step is the hardest.
Mary read the entire instruction of 321 pages in the breath.
How old is this plane?
I just arrived.
What's the pain of your eye?
How old are you?
Did that work out for me?
It would take me forever to explain everything.
I haven't worked for many years.
What a nice house!
Can you take me home?
What do you have in mind?
It was dark.
Don't stop Tom in the way.

We should start over.
He has a great experience and his competence has spread into several areas.
Eh, that's enough now!
I bought a lot of things.
I'm broken.
I assumed you were busy.
It's clear.
Keep digging.
What are we doing with this mess?
Tom's confidence was broken when the boss took him off in front of his colleagues.
I'm not worried.
We have a problem.
Tom knew all that.
Will you do that to me?
I'm probably not gonna watch this.
Come in.
Did I call you?
Most are afraid to set a great goal for themselves because of fear that they will never reach it.
I'm disgusted.
I know.
That's all I'm worried about.

It's the third city, by size, in Serbia.
What year was your car made?
Sit down.
He's a tall boy.
I'm the one who solved the problem.
Where are they going?
Does Tom know about this?
What am I supposed to tell them?
I can't sleep at all.
They haven't been able to go on like that in the second halftime.
Just give him some time.
How did I get here?
He's learning hard.
It takes a lot of imagination when you're trying to add a new sentence here.
Things might be better if you didn't go there.
I checked it out.
Finish this.
He came to visit you yesterday.
Tom's got a bad day.
Don't answer.
Did red rose bloom?
I'd like to leave.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
The pride aims to become pride, which is the nearest kind of madness.
How long will Tom last?
The rain season begins June.
Who knows what's going to happen tomorrow?
I changed my schedule.
I wish I could take a picture like that.
Tom was waiting for me.
Shut up!
Tom says this is absurd.
I've never repented.
We're limiting the luggage to ten pounds per piece.
We'll never get back there.
It's been years.
They have established the Joint Air Command where the director and head of the headquarters were, respectfully, from the Navy and the Army.
Tom took his ucullets and started singing.
Will we see Tom again?
Let's consider the worst thing that can happen.
Walk slowly.
Let's try.
There's a chaos here.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
Tell me what you wrote.
Tom left this morning without finishing his breakfast.
You don't even know his name, do you?
I'm so sorry, Tom.
That's a state of things that can't be tolerate.
We've never played football before.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom doesn't know French.
It's just light.
When's the meeting?
I could go there now.
I'm stubborn.
Because of the lies, he got into trouble when his boss learned the truth.
Looks good for your age.
I really love members of my team.
What did you both do?
We're in trouble now.
It seemed so delicious.
I have a stone in my shoe.
Can you give me a sign?
Tell me what I missed.
He asked me to help him.
Tom has a younger sister Mary.
I could have used that.
I was very excited.
Don't yell.
I didn't tell him you were here.
I saw Tom die.
You're in a better shape than I am.
How so?
I'll try to find them.
I can lose my license.
Tom told me what to do.
I know exactly what I have to do.
Tom's on a trip.
We'll let you know as soon as we find out.
She told me everything last night.
What can I do?
Was I really so happy?
It's overpowered.
I can't resist anymore.
I could lose my retirement.
Tom knows knocking very fast.
She sometimes writes to her son.
Don't talk.
It happened right here.
I'm not too upset anymore.
Tom's worried he's gonna get lost.
I think it's best to be kind.
Africa is a human rainbow.
Tom has high moral standards.
My favorite teacher was Jackson.
I'm not the only one who didn't like that movie.
Don't you remember the question?
I like it when it's cold.
Don't jump!
I didn't know.
This one's pretty cool.
We did everything we could.
We just need one chance.
I think Tom likes baseball.
What are your ambitions?
I'm compassionate.
Tom used to be afraid of me.
I was surprised by Tom's answer.
Do you speak Greek?
Am I a suspect?
Tom's a little bitch, isn't he?
Better kiss in the woods than ten in hand.
You have no permission to enter that room.
You need to speak louder.
Tom lost his job.
Tom's thrilled.
Did you have lunch?
How much will this cost me?
I'm a hero.
There's a woman's version for every man.
Are you talking about us?
Mary felt hurt when her children couldn't try to contact her for March 8th.
Tom saved money to buy a car.
I'm not surprised at all.
How much money do we need?
This model can be combined with any color.
Today is June 18th and Muriel's birthday.
I just arrived.
You just need to practice.
I've been so busy with Tattabe again that I almost dehydrated.
We have to do it.
I know I'm not perfect.
Mary sat on the grass, playing ukulele.
Before this decision gets into force, no one's going to move a finger to solve this.
Do you have anything to report?
I always hated to do that.
Tom's not a baby anymore.
Welcome to your new home.
Tom must have known that Mary wouldn't want to do that.
Tom's gonna talk.
It wasn't easy for me.
He's accelerated.
Tom tried to help us.
Don't exaggerate.
Look at that.
I've got a habit to do that.
It's not the right choice.
It's all in the report.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
I've met some wonderful people.
I had lunch with him.
Are you coming, Tom?
Try it.
Think about it again.
How's Tom at work?
That needs a doctor.
I want to be a man again one day.
Why is that so complicated?
What am I doing here?
Tom often wears black.
Do you want to come in?
Maybe I miss something here.
Check around.
Our school was founded in 1990.
You can sit next to me.
There's a danger behind every corner.
Are you sure this is safe?
No one agrees with you.
Tom's selling cars.
Anybody for a beer?
My father gave me a lot of money.
I'm not used to it.
I'm glad you answered.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
I have an idea.
Tom bought a hulahop.
They'll know what to do.
You're definitely crazy.
Are we ready to go?
I'm free.
Three times five is fifteen.
Mom planted flowers in the garden.
Tom's not confused.
I have an impression that he's pretty arrogant.
Tell him I'm innocent.
It's not a new problem.
Have you ever used any of these?
Her disertation must be written in English.
Now I have to go.
How hard would it be to do that?
Find yourself a place.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
After she got her on the lottery, she went out to the shopping game.
It's getting harder to concentrate.
Show me the pictures!
I think she's from Austria.
Please wait until I'm ready.
It's always like that.
I'm interested.
Again, please.
Can you talk to Tom about me?
Get Tom out of here.
Sleep for a few hours.
What happened?
An intelligence satellite is capable of monitoring many activities on the ground, listening to communication lines, registering the working frequency of the radar systems...
I asked you last night.
You're very beautiful.
I doubt it will be hard for you to get a driver's license.
It's a depressed story.
You don't look so good.
I'm glad you're back.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Tom and Mary are playing chess with a set of manually cut chess figures allegedly from an elephant.
If a warrant already exists, it will function the system you can receive and send an email.
Go talk to Tom.
I'm confident.
Why don't you take your coat off?
I'm really proud of it.
I think we should focus on other things.
Did your girl like flowers?
I'm a little new in this.
This should work.
Nancy's from London.
I'll call you.
It's a third city in Serbia.

We've got enough here.
We expelled him out of the country.
Tom left his key on the table, as he often does.
I'm homeless.
I thought I was stabbed.
I'm just thinking out loud.
I thought you were going to Boston bus.
Why tell Tom anything?
I could have used that.
I hope I can write two or three songs in the weekend.
You don't know me.
How are Tom and Mary?
It doesn't mean something's a good idea just because it's possible.
He opened the door.
I hope Tom will return safely.
I like what you wrote.
Don't blur.
Where did you find this knife?
They need you to help them.
Do you have anything to report?
We want a complete sentence.
Get your ass in here!
I'm not the owner.
I sincerely hope that Tom's predictions will come true.
If we had arrived here earlier, maybe we could save Tom.
Why are you leaving?
It's gold in green forests.
I'm afraid.
You met my sister, didn't you?
How many years have it been since I last saw you?
Tom's books were translated into many languages.
Who left the door open?
I can't live without a television.
Tom was sitting very quietly.
Norway has plenty of old empty bars.
She worked so hard that she eventually got sick.
I'm not the guy who's tracking the fashion.
I can't forget her eyes.
Show me your documents!
I've never tried to do this before.

I can't believe you lied to me.
Tom's writing nice.

What day is tomorrow?
Tom postponed his drinks.
Maybe he'll come to see us tonight.
The air conditioning device is broken.
I'm not like anyone else.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
Get out.
I thought you wouldn't want that.
Would you like more pire potatoes?
And then something amazing happened.
Such a project, of course, required rebalance of the budget.
I'm not sure where Tom is.
I had no idea what to write.
I can write very fast.
Don't worry, I can do it.
Swiming makes your feet stronger.
I forgot to pay the rent.
I didn't do that either.
The guard's in front.
I'll be in my quarter.
We'll get over it again.
I didn't get nervous about it.
It's fun.
Girls like to play houses.
I wish I hadn't done that.
The train arrived in time today, as always.
Will you talk to Tom instead of me?
Norway is my new homeland.
It's stuck.
You'll never catch me alive!
Tom's the youngest.
Did anyone tell Tom about this before?
Did you wash the vessels?
Come closer.
Tom's not a real man for that job.
Tom took the kids to the park.
Please stop here.
Tom really looks familiar.
I'm just kidding you.
I'm not ready to go.
How can anyone sleep with all this confusion?
Tom could convince Mary to do that.
Was I really so happy?
Are we safe now?
He made her happy.
What were you doing today?
How much do I receive?
She was the only one who understood me.
You can't just eat one.
Be careful.
Dogs are smart.
I give you what you want.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'll leave early today.
How adventure!
Tell me what that is.
Did you finish your homework?
Get out of here!
Who's knocking?
I'm really happy to be here.
Please don't yell.
Why are you acting childish?
We could only save Tom if we had arrived a few minutes earlier.
I know this is weird.
I'm glad we were there.
Do you have anything to say?
Why did you do that?
Tom was very nice.
I need to buy a new coat because my old man licked out.
The trolova wall is the highest European vertical mountain wall of 1700 meters to the bottom, of which 1,000 meters is a vertical cliff.
I'd like to introduce you to Tom.
There are little doubts that cutting in the already shaved system will have dramatic consequences for industry and municipalities in rural areas.
You were offended for that, even though it didn't mean it at all, and it was supposed to be something funny on my side, but you didn't see it like that.
Who has time for this?
I'm still asleep.
Tom's a dai-trader.
My stomach hurts.
We calculated that we could get to that place within two weeks.
I've done all the tests.
Mary works as a waitress in the nearby café.
Let me explain.
I forgot the baby's surveillance device.
She responded to it.
I'm naked.

So, what's your secret?
This one's pretty cool.
Just be quiet, please.
I don't understand what the teacher says.
Have a good week!
Doping is not compatible with my ideological views of sport.
I'm coming to save you!

I'm scared to death.
There was only one little problem.
I'm all alone right now.
That was awful.
I wasn't sure at all.
Never say never.
I took part in the competition.
Did you eat anything?
France is in Western Europe.
I hope Tom stays here.
The aircraft are landing at the airports.
That's all your wisdom!
Tom was wearing a black hat.
You did what you had to do.
Tom always looks unsatisfied.
We're out of money.
I think everyone's overeathing.
I'm very happy about that.
Tom turned around to leave.
I'll never mention this again.
Let me show you where to put that.
Why didn't you let Tommy talk to Mary?
Wake up at seven in the morning.
What would I do without you?
I think Tom will be able to help us overcome this.
I'm already paid.
They're all screwed up.
Did I call you?
Come on Tuesday, if possible.
We need to be realistic.
Don't look.
They accidentally heard some suspicious activity in the squirrel that indicates that the bear smelled their food.
I was everywhere in Europe.
Can I help you, sir?
Don't look at it.

How is this your fault?
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Come to my neighborhood.
I don't want to live with you.
I'm ruined.
Tom's in constant pain.
Other girls in Mary's department were laughing at her for clothes.
Everybody's been through it or they're going through it.
I'll get on it right away.

Tom and Mary enjoy walking along the way of pilgrimage in France.
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
Can you help me translate these sentences to Chinese?
Have you watched?
Are you busy here?
I'm choosing between two options.
We have what we need.
Everything else is irrelevant.
Did you look well?
Tom asked me to wake him in half seven.
We didn't do that.
Did you wash the vessels?
Please, give me these.
How does Tom work?
Be careful.
Do you have a paper on which I can write?
He was walking the street.
Do you agree with that?
We just had dinner.
I'm sure they need you.
That's good.
You're one of us.
Do you have a dog?
I saw the cat.
I've been there before.
Tom's book is at the top of the Christmas selling books, and it's hard to get some books out of her position.
Tom's working for Mary now.
I'm armed.
Is it necessary to make such a noise?
Did you wash the vessels?
Give me another reason.
Let's have a drink!
I assumed you were busy.
Are you dyslexic?
I wish I knew.
Change your clothes.
That's all I could find.
A large group of people gathered.
I'm working on my project.
Everything is well prepared ahead.
I'm not counting on that.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
They gave water to their horses.
I'll give you everything you want.
Girls wore grass skirts and had flowers around their neck.

No one believed her.
Detectives are still investigating.
Tom was pretty nice.
This sad story was written when Tom was exile.
Tom's not like the other boys.
We'll take the stairs.
I'm sure I'll win on that tennis match.
Do you have anything to say?
Get changed.
We should have brought another bottle of wine.
Men want to feel desirable.
She tried.
You don't mind, do you?
How would you feel if your wife left you?
Can you prove that?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's easy to write with this pen.
Are you ready for more?
This pen's not working.
Did you see me dancing?
I'd rather not be involved in that right now.
Tom closed the fence.
I had dinner with him.
I really hope I'm wrong.
Are you busy here?
Tom used to play a guitar.
I'm actually a nice guy.
That's what both of them like.
It must have been awful.
I'll borrow you a workbox if you promise me you won't write anything on it.
My friends live in the same house as I do.
There's a lot of bad people in the world.
Did Tom find him?
Are they in love?
Where do we meet tomorrow?
Tom saved Mary.
Latin is the language of the future!
I think they're all ready.
You'll see her.

Have you had anything to eat?
Let's make it clear.
Stiglić is a very interesting bird.

Are you coming soon?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
The working group dealing with data transfers, managed by Ben Manny, will hold a meeting on January 14, 1999.
Some say if you hit the rain slide, it'll start raining.
At my beginning, it's my end.
I just arrived.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
What should I see?
Did you decide what you're going to do?
Tom knows knocking very fast.
Are we all here?
I'll be right back with your order.
My sister's playing with dolls.
Identify yourself.
Take the money.
I'm saving to buy a new saxophone.
Don't give up just like that.
I give you what you want.
Who did you write a letter to?
Maybe I'll need help.
Does this mean you don't love me anymore?
I'm not a specialist.
I'm bigger than I look.
No one's here.
Tom's youngest daughter is his favorite.
Tom bought the papers and read them in the train.
I won't be home next week.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
That would be okay.
What do you call it?
How does Tom know French?
I like to watch you work.
Answer me now.
There's no politics established.
Write what I tell you.
The rain finally stops.
I live in an old house.
Do you love your mother?
It was a big explosion.
Tom blinked.
I didn't walk out today.
Did they tell you the reason?
Can you spell my name?
Look at this.
She was saving her alive head.
I think we should call a doctor.
You're awfully early today.
We caught Tom at work.
We need to be realistic.
She took off her clothes.
Tom's house is for sale.
Tom wasn't satisfied with the results.
I hid under the table.
They keep me hostage.
Maybe Tom wasn't hungry.
I've been there before.
Tom asked Mary how she liked a new job.
I'm a big football fan.
What are you going to do with all this?
Mary's making money for life sewing.
Can you give me some water, please?
Where's your friend?
I don't know what to think about this.
I don't like it.
Tom's used to winning.
Elementary, my dear Watson.
Tom's not sure what he wants to do with his life.
We're here to get you.
I'm intrigued.
What do you want?
The medication should not be mixed mostly with alcohol.
Did you see who it was?
When I woke up, snow fell.
Some people, no matter what time they are, don't lose their beauty.
I played golf with Tom a lot of times.
Don't talk.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
That's pretty extraordinary.
There's gonna be bad things going to happen.
Why would Tom come now?
I panicked.
Come on, try it now.
We'd better get in there.
Actually, I'm not sure.
Explore her.
She was dressed in red.
What does the Sovietologist study?
It's all a big joke.
Tom was talking about music.
Have you completely recovered?

It seemed to me that Tom didn't do what he was supposed to do.
I'm not lying to you.
Did you see me dancing?
Did you eat anything?
Tom's not in any danger.
It's too easy.
All men are the same.
Is it clean?
They haven't wake up yet.
It's all free.
Welcome.
We don't have another choice.
I've never really been anywhere.
He's always losing his cell phone.
I'm angry.
I'm thinking about going to Australia, too.
I'm sure Tom will win.
Are the Americans really so individual?
You can go play with your friends when you're done cleaning the house.
That's my problem, not yours.
What's your specialization?
I'm twice older than Tom.
You're the love of my life.
Tom couldn't talk to Mary, and he couldn't influence it.
And now, when I remember everything I've experienced, I really learned a lot of things.
I wasn't too surprised.
The team is as strong as his weakest member.
I've never camped.
There's a lot of unfair people in the world.
Don't yell.
When was the last time you heard from Tom?
Hungarian's not easy, but he's beautiful.
I think so.
I prefer a tent with a storm cover, along with the crossed sticks for stability on the wind and snow nails, and this has to be a two-style tent.
Tell Tom I'll say hello.
I can't be something I'm not.
Where are we going to meet?
Do you think what she said was a lie?
Tom didn't do that.
I'm touched.
Tom's fired.
Do you plan to go to Tom's and Mary's wedding?
This candidate is much better than his precedent.
Don't call me while I'm in the office.
Thank you for loving me.
The doctor's questioning the patient.
Tom put his drinks down.
This is a clutch of justice.
I could lose my retirement.
She's a bad mood.
I always knew that.
Don't beat.
Every communication is a translation.
I'm trying to be careful.
I'm really happy about that.
I've never been to camping.
They believe in God.
Everyone's the boss in his own house.
Let's hope you're right.
We broke up at the corner.
Are you angry about that?
I baked my tongue.
You tried.
I thought I could trust Tom.
When there's no news, that's good news.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Did that work out for me?
Did you sleep?
They've been sued hard in court.
Is there a reason why you're keeping these old bottles?
We've been talking for a while.
Now I have to go.
Can I take your dictionary?
No one else was hurt.
We have to try.
That fabric isn't from India, is it?
I'll buy what I need tomorrow.
Maybe I'm an antisocial, but that doesn't mean I'm not talking to people.
I believe you're honest.
I didn't choose anything.
Let's try something.
Are you in Paris?
Don't leave me alone.
Tom started learning French last year.
Tom was sitting on the bench all day writing cards.
Don't you eat anything?
It's abandoned.
Don't move!
I've already thought about it.
The money's talking.
I hope Tom will remember this.
Tom told me his father died.
We have to spend less!
I parked twice.
I've never noticed that before.
Do you want to live in Mumbai?
Tom broke something again.
Tell me where you live.
You have to teach me these days.
I love this store.
I'm just about to come looking for you.
He leads a burdenous life.
I'm not a rich man.
I really like your music.
That's what I'm used to.
Tom's got a real attitude.
The anatomic breast implants, however, can also lead to the deformation of breast forms if they rotate on the side.
Where did you find the keys?
I'm not going to tell anyone you did it.
She tried.
Tom was a little freaked out.
I saw the bus.
Tom's smart enough to do something like that.
I've brought these reports to see them more closely.
I'm not as rich as we would like.
Get on the ground.
Tom's still mad.
Why are you still awake?
Please don't make me eat that.
I think your work is very good.
Tom helped Mary wear her coat.
Have fun while you can.
The Internet is not your personal army.
I could go with you.
Unfortunately, he has passed from the Almighty God to become a powerless, dirty, small and unsignificant man in the corner of the small province in the huge empire.

I saw the snake.
It's useless.
What planet are you from?
Are you listening?
Am I in love?
Wait, wait, don't go yet.
Did you eat anything?
Give me another reason.
What did you two do?
Is this your first exam?
Life goes on!
Tom's already here, but Mary's not here yet.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
Okay, we agreed.
Let's not be emotional.
Tom is very patient.
Everything's changing.
Tom knows where the wind blows.
Women are the most beautiful thing in a man's life.
When you get your phone, the battery is advanced.
Tom knows that now.
I volunteered.
Shut up!
Tom likes it most.
Tom's driving me crazy.
This famous actress was also a fashion icon.
I'm not moving to Boston.
I'm impatient.
I finished my esperant study yesterday in Duoling.

Am I safe now?
We'll get to work right away.
I did what I could for him.
I'll just say, you're beautiful.
Are you allergic to some food?
Tom's listening because he's persuasive.
My suitcase isn't packed yet.
Did you sleep?
Readers were in pain, waiting for at least three months before they got the answer.
Do you know someone who passed the exam last year?
Mary took her off for her trip.
They live on their high leg.
Tom got out of the limo.
I'm sure I've seen that guy somewhere before.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
I'm buying a lot of things in that store.
You don't really support me much.
What's he drinking?
You'll see her.
He's everything, he's just not fair.
I'll call her tonight.
The police asked the criminal to surrender his gun.
It's human to sin, to forgive is divine.
I've done all the tests.
It just took me a while.
I have to go.
Please be honest with me.
Tom knows it's hopeless.
What's that?
A man snows, God determines.
Tom was wearing black farmers.
Must have been fun.
What do you have to say?
That gives me an idea.
Did you just meet them?
It's more art than science.
Is this place busy?
It was just like that.
Add more water.
Tom's counting the piece.
All parking places are full.
This is my brother, Tom.

Tom's still harvesting.
You're getting unreasonable.
No, don't do that.
I had a dog when I was a kid.
Tom was with the girl, but he couldn't see who he was.
I won't ask Tom to do that.
Everybody was standing.
I pretended I didn't understand.
Would you talk to Tom?
Can you give me the remote?
Why are you leaving?
Now it's time to enjoy it.
Did he fulfill his goals?
I just want to go home.
Tom's upset about this.
Did you see my dogs?
I have a book.
What do your kids usually breakfast?
Am I so different?
We had a terrible fight.
And Tom is a seller.
I'm twice older than Tom.
That's exactly what I said that would happen.

Tell Tom I'm ready.
I'll apologize.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
Tom wants to pay off the money he owes.
All things have to go through.
Come on in the truck.
I've never seen that before.
I have no desire for that.
I think Tom was great.
I've got a headache.
Tom looks a little gross.
I loved my wife cooking.
I'm proud of my family.
Men have approximately seven or eight times more testosterone than women.
I have to go.
It was a good hat.
The door's stuck for something.
Tom's gone right away.
I had lunch with her.
You've taught me so much.
What's bigger, the sun or the Earth?
We'll get you one.
No doubt!
Looks like you're down ten pounds.
You disappointed me.
We'll get on it right away.
May I ask why?
I bought this yesterday.
You did a great job.
The security's out of fire.
Are we safe now?

Otherwise, what's your address?
This one's uncomfortable.

It's a multifactory process.
I think you were very generous.
Tom could have something to do with it.
Are you dyslexic?
It doesn't work on me.
The congregation is dissolved.
Tell me what you wrote.
I never thought someone's gonna invent something like that.
Tom was friendly attentive to me.
I can't agree with you.
My father fixed a broken chair.
Let's move the closet.
Tom dumped me to the airport.
You know, don't you?
I'm trying.

That's all I needed.
Let me try.
I paid for it.
I bought a new hat in the store.
I wouldn't hurt him.
I have complete confidence in you.
Have you ever listened to such a good music?
It's okay.
I think you'll be able to do that.
Stop it, will you?
He threw the ball in the naked!
It's a big day, son!
We were filled with joyful expectations.
It's just a personal attitude.
I'm really sorry, Tom.
Did you tell Tom this?
My older sister is very talented to sing.
I'll forgive you, but I won't forget.
I always thought it was weird.
Clear your lips with the salvet.

Did you tell Tom that Mary did this?
They gave water to their horses.
My father gave me a lot of money.
You can talk to Tom.
Is it all solved now?
Nothing's free.

I predicted this would happen months ago.
Did you write a report?
Tom put the heating on.
I want to know the reason.
We'll reach you.
I usually don't buy anything from the Internet.
Someone was here.
Did you write to the doll today?
That's the best thing I've ever heard.
Do you know someone that's talking to Urd?
Tom was shot three times.

Why are you angry with me?
I didn't see anything.
We all have received a blessing for the blessing of her almighty mercy.
No matter how much I've been considering, I still don't understand.

That was kind of weird.
I don't have a lot of friends.
My children rely on me.
I beg you to think about it again.
It can be treated.
Don't screw up.
When they experienced the French revolution, citizens became free people, free tradition and church, praising freedom, equality and brotherhood.
I thought it wasn't appropriate.
Tom offered to help when it seemed that everything went completely wrong.
Translate or not is a moral choice of translators. Things sometimes sound better if they remain such as they are in the language in which they are created.
Look at what I grew up!
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
It's necessary.
What have you done now?
I'm poor.
How long have you been living here?
Do you think the situation will improve?

The keys are in the code.
That's all we can do.
Are these new shoes?
What's the name?
Why don't you take your coat off?
Where the hell have you been before?
She was smiling.
Tom just couldn't do that.
I thought you were married.
I'll go if you go.
Well, I have some news.
The chances were against me.
I want to be with her.
What I saw was embarrassing.
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this?
You tried.
Thank you for loving me.
I'm a big football fan.
You're making Tom nervous.
Keep working.
There's a lot of bad people in the world.
I thought you were happy here.
I'm natural.
I don't feel like dancing.
Don't forget to send this letter.
Nothing happens if he doesn't have a dream.
I was trying to be nice.
Tell him I'm innocent.
Tom is very well imitating the way Mary speaks.
Can you solve this problem?
Some of my friends smoke.
You're my princess.
You'll miss everything.
Come on, sit down.
Tom's gonna wait.
Looks like Tom thinks so.
Don't let Tommy sleep.
Come down here.
Excuse me?
Everyone's changing.
Do you want more apple juice?
We can't lose hope.
Let's sit down.
Buy a liter of milk, and if they have eggs, buy twelve eggs.
Tom wants to know if you're planning to come to his party.
Did you see me dancing?
Why would Tom want that?
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
Tom's very idiotic.
I'm hurt.
Keep digging.
I don't want any evil.
I was the only man in the tourist group, and the rest of them were the Arabs who lived in Istanbul.
Explore it.
Tom's not the right person to work.
We need to get better.
They demanded an increase in the salary.
Let me see your prescription.
Tom approached to help.
Sometimes they squash between families spread through generations.
It's all wrong with him.
Tom thinks fast.
The comments must be about the subject.
Don't go away.
The programme sets the conditions for the development and implementation of projects.
We should go again.
Do you feel okay today?
We won.
Give me the spoon.
Can I find you on Face?
I was trying to be kind.
It would be confusing.
We're here.
You can sit next to me.
It pulled the hand.
Tom was a great manager.
Everybody's screwing.
You just need to practice.
Have you ever slipped the cow?
There's a lot of orange fishermen on the river.
You just need to write a few sentences about what you did yesterday.

Can you please turn off the radio for me?
Come again.
She's walking.
Why are you still awake?
Tom was a scout.
What are we doing with this mess?
Tom counted the piece.
I studied hard while I was at school.
I refused the Tom.
Should we tell someone?
After five hours on the hot sand, he saw something on the horizon that looked like a desert fatamorgan.
When are you coming to the station?
Are you honest?
We'll try in your way.
Are you a maniac?
I'll be better now.
And that's it!
I've made an apple pie.
Are you a prisoner?
No one's watched.
If you have to be somewhere right now, it's definitely here!
Tom could lie.
Good luck.
I've never repented for that.
Tom was mad as a rice.
Tom could have a point.
Am I welcome here?
What did you both do?
Don't yell.
What a experience!
Tom's learning to program.
Are we done?
Tom's a little eccentric.
Mary came back from the school in tears because her friends were kidding her.
I trusted you with my secret and you betrayed me.
I'm writing very fast.
We all did that.
Maybe you're wrong.
I'm sure you'll understand.
I have to pay the debt.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
His speech was, mildly said, a catastrophe.
We need to save money to buy a new car.
Bad things will happen.
I thought you already took care of it.
What year is your car?
You have to believe it's possible that it's going to change.
She translated her sentence.
Did you ever ask Tom to use it?
I could go there now.
Everyone was cheering.
Tom said you were cool.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'm glad you answered.
Drive carefully.
Let's see.
Do you have a perfume?
Don't play a monkey!
Mary's a little attractive.
Makes such a grimas to wish you hit him.
Be careful.
You understand me.
Tom wanted to know what we're doing.
When the screaming doesn't help, shout louder!
I think you should talk to Tom about it.
Tom arrived in time despite the storm.
Something wasn't right.
Tom said I was unkind.
Tom wanted to take Mary's phone number, but she refused to give it to him.
I beach someone to do it instead of me.
You're still inexperienced.
We'll have a great time.
It's not bad.
He asked me to help him.
It's so hot here.
Have you completely recovered?
Tom was wearing black farmers and a white shirt.
The book cost five bucks.
Is it so simple?
Tom's not like the other guys.
Listen to this.
How much is that worth?
I was lucky to survive the accident.
No one I know is going there anymore because there's a big crowd.
I'm teaching Korean.
I'm losing.
I don't want to see him again.
I'm glad Tom left.
I'm buying a lot of things in that store.
Drive slowly.
Tom must have had the key.
Why is that interesting?
Are you involved in this?
I'm sure Tom didn't intend to hurt your feelings.
You're the reason I came here for.
Tom probably hates me, too.
You can sit with me.
Oh, gray cat, please don't pass it.
Just give me a chance.
What's your smile?
How many people were there?
They're all quiet.
Send me some sugar, please.
I'm stunned.
I want the sword!
Don't talk.
Excellent!
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom got into Harvard.
Tom had a little help.
Tom was more than ready.
I'm not thinking about that.
You're average students.
Tom's as old as Mary.
Why don't you come over sometime?
We all did that.
What did you do now?
Answer me right now.
Why are you angry with me?
Don't forget we should do homework.
It would be nice to wait for me.
They were sitting in the circle.
I want to meet Tom.
We've arrived in time.
Norwegian prisons are the most luxurious in the world.
Maybe something's wrong with you.
It happened.
You need a hobby.
Keep working.

We need to get another bottle of wine.
Where did you find this knife?
The west came like a thunder from the wind of the sky.
Now I have to go.

I'm not married to Tom.
It was a little weird.
What does this word mean?
I'm bluffing.
Tom promises Scotts hills and valleys.
I'm not sure when Tom will be here.
It's not connected.
Tom used to be afraid of dogs.
Finally, we have all the names of the fields in Norwegian and that will be of great help to our users.
Tom's gonna talk.
I want to see you!
It's on your left.
Where's the bathroom?
That doesn't look like you.
I'll call her tonight.
This will make our job much easier.
Tom interfered with people who had a very bad influence on him.
Where did I leave the keys?
I got 100 points on the mathematics test.
Am I in love?
How do you know so much?
I'm substitute.
It's your choice.
The World Network was invented in 1989 by Tom Berners Lee.
Maybe Tom will agree to do that.
Don't put the elbows on the table.
It's not over until it's over.
It's a big day, son!
Tell me what you wrote.
Keep an eye on him.
Be home by half seven.
That's not all we have.
Stay where you are, Tom.
I recommend that you visit the British War Museum in London.
He got a cat's lucky colleague on his birthday.

Are you free on Sunday?
That's a fake, isn't it?
Thank you!
I can't just give up.
Do you like it or not?
Life continues!
"Do you like costumes?" "I hate costumes!"
I liked that one.
It must be scary.
Men want to feel significant.
Can we just start over?
Do you know what this sentence means?
Looks like he lives in Britain.
But the-but is an example of the ideophon.
You're paying me well.
Tom said okay.
I don't want to discuss this right now.
Tom opened a new restaurant, but he couldn't make money from him for the first twelve months.
Tom's right this time.
You're losing.
Lots of things have happened.
Bergen is the second largest city in Norway.
I'm giving up.
What's in your mind?
I gave them an anniversary present.
This isn't drinking water.
Tom showed me how to read.
Was I really so happy?
Is that what I'm talking about?
That's how I realized.
Tom wrote several hundred articles and several books.
Come on.
What do you mean?
Tom wrote Mary's phone number.
There's a good chance we're gonna win.
The meeting took an hour.
I can walk only about three miles.
You told me not to lie.
Tom was a garbage.
Beer's good.
Don't you ever do this again.
Tell Tom what Mary did.
I'm naked.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Don't be scared.

We will live like kings.
I didn't write this.
I'm not ready to go.
You have to stay with me.
I'm glad you answered.

Does Tom have any experience?
That's really beautiful.

Can you give me the remote?
Her name was Maria.
Tom was probably born in Australia.
Tom's screwed up.
If you don't understand, you have to say that.
My parents died.
It's really nice.
I'll yell.
Don't cheat.
You're the other one!
Tom broke something again.
It's not that simple.
Do you want to keep it?
We'll take the next one.
I don't need instructions.
Go upstairs.
That doesn't matter.
I'll teach you to write.
Mile depends on the conditions on the road.
Don't fight.
What have you done now?
The sun shineed, and it was cold.
Maybe it's not possible.
Tom will remember.
Tom could get lost.
He asked me to help him.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom doesn't know French.
I write awful.
Tom used to be a footballer.
I owe you an apology.
I pissed him off.
Tom's gonna go.
Tom was speaking in a strong voice.

Just stay away from this.

I was laughing.
Just give Tom a second.
I gave them an anniversary present.
I saw Tom play a lot of times.
Everybody tells me I'm weird.
I'll take a rice for my collision.
I'm very proud of it.
What did you say to Tom?
We strongly recommend that you use one of the three advanced regimes to achieve optimum results.
That's encouraging news.
You shouldn't go out now, it's almost 11:00.
I didn't have fun, so I went home early.
Have you ever written a computer program?
Such projects never end.
I prefer orange apples.
Here's a secret.
Could it be true?
Don't let him get in your head.
I really want to find something to eat.
What's your old car?
You're absolutely right.
I apologize to those among you who are eventually injured; that was not my intention.
I told you it was gonna work.
I'm tired.
Nothing can stop me.
Criminals must be punished.
Who knows what that was?
It's been a long time.
Tom seems a little gross.
I shot a bear.
I've been looking for you.
Tom's been severely beaten.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote myself.
You didn't commit a serious offence.
I don't like writing.
You're asking me questions that you already know the answers.
I didn't see anything.
We get a few men mad at Tom in the bar and Tom told them he wasn't afraid to face them.
Did Tom really want Mary to do that?
Tom has failed to provide any evidence that would support his statement.
I'm not so happy.
Anybody want a beer?
If something sounds too good to be true, it's probably true.
I'm not going to say anything.
You're good to everyone.
Come see me after work.
How do I call a cab?
Tom signed Mary as a mercenary waiting.
Open up.
Tom's very sophisticated.
When you start, you'll never stop.
That's really nice.
I can't either.
Do you like roller costers?
It'll be all right in the end, if it's not okay, then it's not the end.
Move, people.
Are you sarcastic?
Where did you find this knife?
Speak for yourself, Tom.
We shouldn't be laughing at others.
Have you completely recovered?
I'm proud of it.
Where did I put my keys?
There's an obvious difference between the good and the best.
I don't sing.
Am I ever wrong?
Watch your own business!
She licked the spoon.
What did you find?
We know that's not true.
We're all gonna die.
Tom has two children.
Is that far from here?
I'm very happy about that.
Tom had no choice but to smile and tolerate.
The cigarettes cost two Marks.
I know I'm not perfect.
That's how it was supposed to be.
Tom was nervous about you.
What's wrong with you?
We haven't met yet.
I'm not old.
Can I take your dictionary?
Tom ate the whole box of chocolate himself.
Can we do this later?
The truth must be said.
Do you like the costumes?
Didn't you do enough?
What do you know about me?
I think he's very smart with that.
Does that mean you love me?
This will never end.
We have a serious problem.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Explain it with simple words.
Tom just drinks coffee without caffeine.
Tom pulled the smoker out of the bottle.
We need to get another bottle of wine.
Now we need the truth.
Tom's been sleeping all the time.
I really like your music.
This is Kopakabana!
I'm learning a few languages.
When you hurt others, you hurt yourself.
You're dead.
You can't make us leave.
Tom said I could stay.
Who else uses this room?
You'll save time if you listen carefully to my instructions.
He's tired of reading.
Can we order now?
We can't stop here.
Tom didn't think of trying to convince Mary to do it for a minute.
Hey, give me a chance.
There is also an ethical question that has been asked about this.
It just happened again.
Everyone survived.
It's gonna happen bad things.
Do you love your mother?
I'm really proud of it.
This is my third marriage.
What did you do here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's a little worried.
I totally disagree with that.
It's a routine thing.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will anyone tell me what to do?
Tom's writing better than me.
I don't have anything on my hand today.
I'm responsible.
You're doing good.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom pressed the switch.
I need my children.
The teacher wrote something on the board, but I couldn't read because it was too small.
I didn't wash my hair.
Are you hungry?
Tom's still frustrated.
If you try, you'll make it.
We have enough seats for everyone.
That was a fake alarm.
Tom's learning programming.
Everybody can get waxes.
Tom didn't let me answer Mary's question.
Every time I find something I like, it's always too expensive.
It's a cat.
I want Tom to leave by noon.
Tom seemed amazed.
Tom wasn't very energy.
It won't help you if you're worried.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
Did you go to see Tom?
I've been looking for you.
I'll go with the car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know what question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.
I'm taking my day off.
Are you blaming me?
That broke the mood at the table yesterday.
I thought you were going to Boston bus.
Tom still has a little time.
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
Just waste your time.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
How many pairs do you have?
I've never had trouble sleeping.
It's locked.
I'll figure something out.
A honest man can't do that.
Take care of yourself!
I won't try to predict the future.
What are you doing at this time?
I'm early.
Are they all strong?
Is everything solved now?
Please send me the doctor's account.
What's this about?
Have a good day, Tom.
Are you going to Tom's and Mary's wedding?
I'm a little new in this.
I improvised.
"Do you know what's going on?" "No, what's the matter?"
That's what both of them like.
You and I need to talk.
You spyed on me.
The pen that I write belongs to Tom.
Where did you see Tom?
It's time.
What's this gonna buy me?
Wake up!
We're helping each other.
Tom and Mary remained good friends.
How did you do that?
I won't tell anyone else.
How do you know so much?
Tom suffocated his smile.
I'm afraid.
What's the name?
Is Tom really a student here?
Tom's the one who wrote this story.
Everybody's going.
I didn't spend anything.
It's a area with a lot of new houses.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom seemed pretty nervous.
Tom likes sports.
Tom took off his wig.
It turns out I was right.
Her name was unknown.
I'll get Tom ready.
Stay away from my girlfriend.
I'm sorry I tried at all.
I'm not upset at all.
Jumi is one of my friends.
It just took him a while.
I thought you wouldn't do that.
I'm sorry I'm so late.
Maria started taking off.
It's worse, it's downstairs.
Life without love doesn't make any sense.
I'm sure there's a better way to do that.
I'm hard against this.
You underestimate me.
Tom almost never makes mistakes when he writes in French.
The police didn't dismiss the possibility of suicide.
This was on the list.
She dreamed of being a nurse.
Come here, young man.
This should work.
The hard work was worth it.
Tom asked me if she should help Mary or not.
I was just thinking about you.
Signal lamps are used to transmit Morse's alphabet.
It's not going away from the Main Street, but there you can get number 31.
The worst is just coming.
I was home last night.
Men talk about women all the time.
Many people already hate you.
If I knew your e-mail address, I'd have written to you.
Tom could beat anyone.
I'm trying as hard as I can here.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
The government's down.
Tom drank a swallow of wine.
This will last forever.
I'm so excited.
I'm here to play baseball.
I'll tell you everything I know.
Don't stop.
Close the window.
Tom missed the target.
I totally disagree with you.
Refreshed.
Let me do that again.
They live there.
This book will help you write effectively.
Don't talk.
Tom made a fool of himself when he was drunk last night.
I work in Milan.
Come back in one day.
It had a lot different effect than the intention.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
Everybody laughs.
I liked to go to the beach.
Where's your father?
I'd agree.
It's all over.
The book is selled.
Tom almost died trying to save me.
That needs the truth.
I liked going to the beach.
At first, it looks easy.
It's time to say goodbye.
You should've been my friend!
People should stop hatred.
I don't doubt he'll succeed.
I never advised you to do that.
I don't intend to change.
Tom started the car.
My grandmother enjoys a tea ceremony.
She smiled.
They deceived everything.
Are you coming back now?
Tom kept it a secret.
We went to school together.
We're doing this wrong.
We'll get you one.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
In accordance with our rules, all participants must show legitimacy, registration papers and license in the inspection.
Tom looks like a girl.
Do we have any of these?
How does that be compiled?
We don't agree well with our neighbors.
Do you like writing?
They decided to marry.
What's Tom drinking?
Practice is very useful.
That's what the scholars are arguing about.
He's trying.
Tom told me his father died.
Tom told me I should stay home.
It's too loud for me here.
I want to be more cute.
Tom has a strong German accent.
Tom asked Mary to fry him on a part of his back that he couldn't reach.
It's over there.
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
Just stay with me.
I forgot to write my name on the exam.
Does Tom have the key?
Tom's prepared.
You always do.
There are situations in chess that are worth sacrifice of a figure to acquire a long-term advantage.
Young children should learn to compassionate animals.
You're not finished yet?
You're not the one who died.
It's hard to imagine.
Are you sarcastic?
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
She's walking.
My mother loves music.
Would that be possible?
What did you two do?
Draw a drawing of your house.
Tom postponed his drinks.
I'm pretty shocked with this.
Spitz's empty.
Tom decided to "protect."
I'm grateful.
I couldn't do this without your help.
Don't answer.
If you would do that for me, it would be very helpful.
He was naked and bosoned.
Tom might be honest.
Can you explain how to get to the airport?
Look again.
The first step is always the hardest.
They have to drink water.
I'm a little worried now.
What's in there, Tom?
Use yourself.
I'm totally out of money.
Tom hates Mary.
Can I borrow your pen for a while?
Don't let him get in your head.
My right hand was stuck.
Eh, that's enough now!
I'm selling coffee.
Tom once worked with me.
Stop it!
Tom jumped into the water, and he didn't take off his clothes.
I'm a little crazy.
I'd like to agree.
Every bird's flying to his belt.
Do you want to see the total darkness of the sun that will leave Svalbard in dark 20 March 2015?
I'm sleeping firmly.
Did you eat anything?
Emma was very impressive at the party.
What did you just write in the briefcase?
I know it's illegal.
I've been studying hard while I was at school.
They wanted to punish me.
Don't talk.
You look fat.
Do you live there?
I'm kidding.
Why am I here?
They differ as heaven and the earth.
Tom was totally alone.
The cavalry's here.
Everybody's asleep.
Tom begged Mary not to tell his parents anything.
Would you like to come with me?
Tom's family lives in Boston.
I liked that one.
Al lived in the Soviet Alliance, the great and multinational, in the large Tver region, at a size of a few English countries.
Tom can be dangerous.
Are these your bags?
What did you do to me?
Don't jump!
When he was six years old, he learned how to knock on a writing machine, and told his teacher that he shouldn't learn to write with his hand.
I was practicing.
That doesn't sound very convincing, but I trust you.
I think I'll go out and eat.
Can we talk outside?
You have good instincts.
I thought I played well.
Am I safe now?
Please write.
We didn't have this plan for you.
Tom's selling cars.
He started screaming.
Tom was apparently shaken.
Did you see who it was?
I didn't know you were so rich.
I'll never see her again.
Everybody down!
I could talk to Tom.
Do you believe in God?
We were kissing last night.
Was I really so happy?
Tom never had to do that.
You don't hear often someone bought a hat for a thousand dollars.
Come here.
That's what I'm used to.
Do you doubt me?
Tom's been working his whole life.
What language do they speak in Mexico?
That's what both of them like.
There's something coming up.
Help!
I already ordered it.
I'm sure Tom's gonna miss me so much.
What's your name?
Where did you get that?
Tom's a really nice kid.
I can't concentrate on this confusion.
I'm sure I'll win on that tennis match.
Swimming is a kind of exercise.
The government fell after the vote in parliament.
I want to be a swimmer.
Shall we see Tom again?
When did you have time to do that?
I don't have a lot of friends.
We don't know what brings tomorrow.
What first instrument did you learn to play?
I'm amazed.
There's nothing left.
Have you ever written a computer program?
I'm not losing hope.
I have a plan, don't worry.
You took my place.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
Do you think Tom would like to go with us to camp next weekend?
Did you decide what you're going to do?
Drive carefully.
Did I ask you?
How long has Tom stayed?
People tell me things.
To the bullets!
Tom's in the pyjama.
Did Tom believe you in a story?
I was very tired so I went to sleep early.
It's hard.
Tom thought I was lying.
I don't want anything from you.
How's it going?
Don't argue with me.
Tom is also a seller.
I want to feel important.
We'd give everything that could not happen.
I think Tom needs help.
Switzerland needs better apples.
Are you involved in this?
Everybody stands.
I pretended I didn't know Tom.
The shit can never be golded so it doesn't smell.
Don't rush.
No one can know everything.
I'm objective.
I'll leave early today.
Are my red ears?
He's not a doctor.
That's enough.
How many tools do you know how to play?
Employees can be motivated by good, fair wages, chances to work in a good team or on exciting tasks, and with clear economic incentives such as bonuss and chances of progress.
I doubt I'm the only one who noticed it.
That's encouraging news.
Give me sugar, please.
I'm really sorry about this.
You're funny.
Happy Christmas!
Have you ever seen one?
We had a lot to drink.
It's too loud for me here.
I doubt it will be hard for you to get a driver's license.
Did you manage to do it on your own?
Is everything solved now?
How can it be that mathematics, which is still just a product of human thought independent of experience, are so incredibly adapted to objects in reality?
Look at that.
Looks like Tom's a honest person.
I didn't know you were so rich.
Look at this.
The code is Muriel.
I had a quick lunch.
He risked it.
His wife put his shirt in.
Someone told me about it.
Swallow pride!
To change the red meat, I cooked peanut breasts in a mushroom sauce for tonight.
I'm always creepy.
Tom's fighting like crazy.
I always liked horror movies.
Something just came up.
I couldn't stop crying.
You've been incorporated.
They're not mine.
I double the prices.
Could you do that?
A video of interviews was made and published across the Internet.
Tom was drunk and drowned his sadness, after that one night of drunk.
Why don't we take a little rest?
Go check it out.
Tom just wanted to say something.
It's over.
Is it true that Tom killed himself?
I'm here to play baseball.
Do you think so?
I didn't do that either.
Do you have anything to report?
I say that all the time.
Don't lie.
Will you take that?
I just got there.
Is Tom coming back?
You're smart.
How did I get here?
Why?
Tom dropped a drowned breath.
There's a lot of work I need to do before I can go home.
By the way, where do you live?
Do you have any questions?
It's hard for me to understand French when you speak fast.
It'll be half three soon.
They'll know.
Tom bought a few black shoes yesterday.
I have a lot of friends.
Cirich is considered one of the large financial centres.
That's very rare.
Tom wanted to be good.
I'm just not hurrying.
Don't look.
How desperate are you?
Let's not get outta here.
It's not getting worse.
Answer me.
I'm still making mistakes.
Tom's got a hard job.
I'm glad we won.
You can't go in that room.
"Do you feel better?" "No, I'm worse."
It's all passing, but the beautiful memories are alive.
I was in the mountains.
It's hard.
What's easier?
Did you wash the vessels?
We argued a lot.
It was a drop that poured the glass.
He doesn't like us.
We'd save time if we went down Park Street.
The cop arrested him for driving in a drunk state.
We're going to be crazy.
That would be great.
The knife's not sharp.
We hope people will like it.
We all have a price.
That gave him an idea.
I got lucky.
No one knows me in Boston.
Tom thinks something's wrong with some politicians.
Where's Teheran?
Get over any obstacles with this truck monster!
Mary spends a lot of time on her phone, sending messages and emails to her friends.
He always wears dark clothes.
Lucky was on our side.
Tom's working for his father's company.
I want to help you.
We never lose hope.
Men stay children all their life.
Now we need the truth.
I should be here all afternoon.
Didn't I teach you anything?
Why do you ask?
It's big.
Which is fast, it's too short.
Come sit next to me.
I found his book.
I barely managed to hide my anger for her anger.
Butter's made of milk.
There's nothing we can do about that.
It's getting better.
Do you want to see something specific?
I miss her.
I've passed the exam!
Let us help you.
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
Please, don't scream.
Does he still have a temperature?
Tom was crazy, you know.
Tom put a map on the table.
Who are you running from?
What did you do to me?
I'll talk to Tom about this.
I'm still a little tired.
We can't go back.
We'll visit you from time to time.
Tom had no courage to do what he wanted.
His comment is easy to understand in the wrong way.
Are we meeting tonight?
