Where have you been all afternoon?
You found a nice guy.
He did it for jealousy.
She washed her dirty hands before the meal.
I didn't talk to anyone about it.
Don't get too used to it.
I'm thinking about taking a few days off.
Tom never speaks French to me.
Tom left high drinks on the table.
There's no beer over the glass after all day's work.
She doesn't know any of us.
I'm still satisfied with my work.
Do you really need help?
Being you, I'll ask him.
Leave them for us.
Here's the map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting even when I was invited.
Are you still here?
I thought you were dating Tom.
I have to go to the next station.
That dream was a mystery to me.
I'm sure you paid a lot for it.
Tom obviously lies.
So straight and right and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the refrigerator?
It was just an accident.
I'll have to call you back.
Tom says he'd like to win.
Tom's gonna be 13 tomorrow.
Cut the meat on thin plates.
I can't watch him ruin his life.
Do everything with reason.
I only buy a soft toilet paper.
Yeah, you have to.
We got up to the top of the Fuji Mountain.
I and my wife want to go with you to Boston.
Remember what she was like?
That belt's too tight for me.
Playing fagot is not easy.
She took the job just to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom was hesitating to mention the subject.
We're drinking a lot of beers in our place.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it to Tom.
You shouldn't behave selfish.
Ancient customs die quickly today.
Tom's still got a lot to do.
You'd better go now.
Tom's homeless.
I love reading.
We cut the rope.
I just came to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train must have stopped because it was a fallen tree on the railways.
What did Tom yell at the crowd?
He's a perfect husband for me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a party in the 17th-century costumes.
Are you satisfied with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?

With great effort, he crawled up on the tree.
Translate the Czech text is very difficult.
Tom is probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom was standing, too.
We already know that, Tom.
I'm glad you noticed me.
I missed breakfast.
You lied to me.
It's a beautiful language.
I'm not home a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager about noise in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skills qualify him for the job.
They're falling.
She was alone in the dark.
Tom didn't dare tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
You got a pen?
They don't help.
I like the tie.
We weren't doing as good as we wanted.
Please close the door when you leave.
I'll be back tonight.
Have you had a fight with Joanna?
You don't owe me anything.
You scared me.
The girls I met today were students.

I need it more than you.
You bought a car.
I'm afraid I'll stay here forever.
Tom's got a slister.
What should I do in this situation?
You're driving a train to school?
Tom won't be at school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who will Tom visit?
It's Tom, not Mary.
Why don't you ask me a drink?
Why doesn't Tom answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer that question.
I don't know exactly what Tom bought.
There's another question.
I'm not surprised if that happens.
He's free.
People don't normally say that.
Ask your mother.
Tom washed his legs carefully.
Did you breakfast this morning?
Johna was as happy as a bleach when she got the recording contract.
I wish you'd come with us.
She spends a lot of time at her computer.
We wouldn't be in this crush if you helped us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He'll visit his uncle.
Everybody's out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary did.

Tom doesn't like working.
My heart is French, but my ass is international.
If you have a problem, I want to know what.
Tom caught Mary's hand.
I'm totally happy myself.
You did what you had to do.
We need to understand that we're still learning.
Tell Tom I'm not there.
Tom was playing with Mary tennis yesterday.
What's your dad's name?
There were half a broken walls.
I talked to him English and found out I could make a deal.
Tom must have run.
I see the book.
Did any of you ever talk to Tom?
You should apologize.
The fence is freshly burned.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you'll regret it.
You're fat.
We should win.
All answers must be written according to instructions.
Answer my questions.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and didn't come back.
Did you bring the book?
I don't dare open my mouth.
Their father is Czech, and their mother comes from Hungary.
I'm thinking about getting divorced with her.
I bought one bag.
Do you know where your father came from?
Who are you?
Did you do that?
There were no doubts.
I don't want anyone else to read it.
If I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything wrong about Tom.
Stand up there and you'll see it better.
He's old enough to stand up on his own.
As soon as we saw what Tom was wearing, we got a ridiculous attack.
Tom's wrong, isn't he?
Better to be dead than to live red.
They agreed they'd put the wedding down.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It would be great if you did it for me.

The wedding was last week.
I'm still eating.
The horse's scratching.
I borrowed Tom's hive.
I'm boring.
I write my will.
I'm not like that anymore.
You won't believe what Tom just told me.
Mary doesn't have anyone to talk to, but she doesn't feel lonely.
If it's not raining tomorrow, we'll go to the ball.
Try talking to the police.
You like elephants.
I don't want to change anything.
Bartender, I'll have a drink.
Do you like strawberries?
She used to be bigger.
I suppose he's gone home.
I was in the forest.
Tom's drunk.
He asked me to wait there before he came back.
I made a terrible decision.
I'd rather get back inside.
She doesn't have to do it.
I know she's nice.
I don't go to school Sunday.
He has his own house.
I don't usually do it tonight.

I was expecting them to tell the truth.
Put it under the corner.
I'm so glad you're here.
She's hungry.
Tom didn't want to lose Mary.
Tom's home.
Drop the balloon to Tom.
I'm insulting her.
Was the police involved in this?
We love kids.
I wish I could be a better man.

Tom's got to get involved.
You should consult your attorney first.
You're a good journalist.

My father's running a restaurant.
You're really boring.
I like German movies.
This works.

I know you're still not happy.
Can the news be true?
It's easy to gain, it's easy to get rid of it.
Do you remember seeing me before?
I want to help, but I'm busy right now.
Without her help, I would never put the test on.
