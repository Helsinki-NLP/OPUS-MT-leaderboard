Welsh members do not want to go to the maps
Some members of the National Assembly are displeased by the proposal to accept the MWP abbreviation (from the Welsh Parliament member of Wales).
The problem solution is about plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this abbreviation.
One of the layborists, expressing his views, expressed concern about the rhythm of the new abbreviation of Twp and Pwp.
For our readers, not from Wales: in Valley twp, it means "bullshit" and pwp is "cacacaka".
According to a member of the Assembly from the Wales Party, his organization has “as generally dissatisfied” and has proposed other options.
The representatives of the Conservative Party “do not object” to the new abbreviation but note that the MWP is close to the word Muppet (mappet).
In this context, the letter w in the valley language is referred to as a letter u in the yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, currently developing a draft name change law, made the following statement: “The final decision on how the members of the Assembly will be appointed will, of course, remain behind them.”
The Wales National Assembly of 2017 has been authorized to change its name by the Wales Law.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public opinion survey on the proposed options, according to which Wales' option instead of the Assembly found wide support among the local population.
With regard to the appointment of the members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the option “Members of Parliament of Wales” (Welsh Parliament Members, or WMP), while the option of the IWP received the highest public support.
The members of the Assembly appeared to offer other options, but the Chairman, Elena Jones, would be difficult to find a proper solution for all, and recall that the draft amendment law should be submitted within a few weeks.
The reform laws will include other modifications of the work process of the Assembly, including new rules on disqualifications of members of the Assembly and the Committee ' s system.
Members of the Assembly shall vote for the final version of their appointment during the debate on the draft law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change of the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians vote to rename the country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The universal vote is aimed at addressing a multi-annual dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its province of Macedonia.
The Government of Greece has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims to the Greek province, and has repeatedly been opposed to the entry of its northern neighbour to the European Union and NATO.
President of Macedonia, Georgie Ivanov, opposed to the referendum on the change in the name, said that it was not going to acknowledge its results.
However, referendum members, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that the change of the country's name is the total price of EU and NATO entry.
The crisis in the harlematic income: St. Martin’s Bell has been silent forever
“The guards of the area I had been in contact with were told that there was a bar and a church earlier at each corner, ” says Adams.
“There is none of them left.”
The extinction of bars can still be understood:
The communication format has changed.
“Bar has ceased to be a routine of the entire area where they regularly visited.”
However, as regards the churches, it is anxious that the funds obtained from the sale of assets are not long enough, no matter what their leaders have trusted. “Every time they will remain with nothing.”
In the place of the church, he added, there will be a multi-party house whose residents would hardly support those stored in the area of arrival.
“The majority of buyers of these apartments will be white,” says Adams. “ This will near the day that such churches will finally close, because new neighbours will never become their households.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black area: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church was 10 years later.
The first member of the Methodist Church left arrival in the 30th century.
Their building was redeemed by a black arrival located in the neighbourhood.
When the Church of St. Martina came into the hands of the black community, it was headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of stores on the 125th street, the main trading artery of Harlem, where it was refused to be taken to work or to increase black people.
In 1939 the building was significantly damaged, and during reconstruction work, the father Johnson was ordered to install a carilion.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father, who changed him in the head of St. Martin’s church, proudly called the carillion “the colonels for the poor. ”
However, the expert who tested the carilion in July has otherwise called it “cultural heritage” and“ unique historical instrument”.
The Expert from the University of Michigan Tiffany Ng also noted that the Caryllon of St. Martin was the first tool in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. 18 years ago, he was invited to play a larger carilion in the Riverside Church.
According to Merriwezer, St. Martin's church has not yet been replaced.
The last few months around St. Martin’s church had a complicated situation with architects and contractors, some of which were invited by the world leaders of the Church, others — the episcopal Church.
The meeting, the arrival body in which the world leaders belonged, expressed in July concern that the eryphia “treats to translate the value of work” to the congregation, although the latest had nothing to do with the choice of architects and contractors directed by the eparchy.
Some visitors expressed displeasure from the lack of transparency by the Ephrase.
In California, the shark wounded a 13-year-old diver who was indulging lobsters
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster hunting season, a 13-year-old diver in California was attacked by the shark and received body damage.
The attack occurred about 7 a.m. close to the Beacon Beach Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel said in the KSWB-TV interview, Saint Diego, he roamed with his friends on Saturday morning and heard about half an hour after he heard the boy's screams of help, and he and his friends flew on the boat to the place of attack and pulled the teenager out of the water.
Hummel said that he first decided that the boy was excited to catch the lobster, but quickly “pronounced that he screamed“ I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
Hammel observed that “he had the skin totally broken around the key. ”
"I shouted that everyone would get out of the water, "There is the shark!"
The boy was transported to the Child Hospital Redi (San Diego); his condition was considered critical.
The type of shark attacked by a teenager is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Gyles reported that a shark was observed several weeks ago, but was not taken to dangerous species.
Heils also added that the victim of the attack had been injured in the upper part of the tower.
The authorities have closed the beach zone from Ponto in Casablada to the Swami beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
Heils noticed that there are 135 sharks in this area, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Seinesbury plans to conquer the UK parfum and cosmetic market
Sainsbury is going to establish cosmetic and parfumery offices in Boots, Superdrags and Debenhams with cosmetic consultants, on Luxury Universities Models.
The perfume and cosmetic market of Great Britain is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds of sterlings and continues to expand, while the fashion and sales sectors are declined, and a significant share of this desired market as an experiment in 11 shops across the country will be presented by space cosmetics and parfumeries, and in the event of success in the next year will be expected in many other shops.
The supermarket owners are looking for a way to fill the poles that were previously put under TVs, microwave bakers, house-to-house goods, and the investments in the parchment and cosmetic market are a good solution.
According to the representatives of Sainsbury, it is planned to double the assortment of cosmetic goods to 3,000 names; the first time marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will be proposed.
The existing assortment from L'Oreal, Mogelline and Burt's Bees will be presented in a larger extent, in specially selected places, in the type of goods in Boots shops.
Furthermore, the company's cosmetic-butic-free ambulance will be reorganized with a transfer to vegan products to satisfy the requests of young buyers.
Two Sejnsbury shops will be presented by the parrot producers of Fragrance Shop: the first one has already been opened in Croidon in southern London last week, and the second opening is expected in Sally Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Internet trade and trends in buying small foods every day in small shops near the house have led supermarkets to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, President of Sainsbury, said that the outlets would gradually become universities, and the network of his supermarkets fought for buyers in competitive fighting cheap shops, such as Aldi and Lidle, offering more services and non-food goods.
A hundred supermarkets of Sainsbury are located in Argos, and some of them can now find Habitats shops since the network acquired both brands two years ago, which has resulted in a growing sale of food goods and supplies from these acquisitions.
The previous attempts of the supermarket to give new life to their cosmetic and pharmaceutical offices were not successful.
In the early 2000s, a joint company of Sainsbury and Boots had been organized, but further disagreements had occurred in the issue of the separation of income from sales of medicinal products in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury's sale (all 281 store) company Selesio, the owner of the Lloyds Farmasi network, for 125 million pounds of sterlings three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the plan by adding a broad luxury line of care for the skin of La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director Seinesbury, says: “We have fully transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our parchment and cosmetic departments to create a more favourable environment for our buyers.
We also invited specially trained consultants who will always be willing to help the Council.
Our decoration for any taste, pleasant design and comfortable shops will attract many visitors to search for cosmetic and parfumery. This will be a completely new concept of shop walking.”
Peter Jones "angerly" responded to Holly Willowby's exit from the 11 million pounds of sterlings.
The Dragon Logo Star Peter Jones is "angered" by the exit of Holly Willowby from the 11 million pounds of sterlings, which she expected to conclude with the Leifstein Brand Peter, but instead preferred new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willowby doesn't have time for their joint brand of household clothing and axes of Truly.
The business of the couple was compared to the Goop actors of Guinet Peltrow.
The 37-year-old leading programme “This morning” announced its decision in Instagram.
The decision of Holly Willowby to leave their profitable Lyfstyle Brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV, led Peter Jones, the star of the Dragon Log.
According to our sources, Jones was “angered ” when a television fan during the tensioned meeting held on Tuesday in his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that after the new contracts were concluded, it would not have enough time for their common mark of household clothing and axes of Truly.
Their mark was compared with the child's actress Guinet Peltrow mark Goop, and its sales were expected to double increase the state of Willowby, estimated by 11 million pounds of sterlings.
The 37-year-old woman announced her care in Instagram, and Jones left Britain on a private plane towards one of its villas.
According to one source, “The Truly Mark was Holly’s primary priority.
This was a long-term contribution that would provide her with care for the next few decades.
Its decision led to the step of all parties to the agreement.
Everyone was remarked on Tuesday, since the mark remained many weeks before the start of the mark.
In the headquarters in Marlow, a whole storage filled with goods ready to sell."
Experts believe that the carriage of the leader of this morning, one of the most popular stars of Great Britain, could cost the company millions of pounds of sterlings due to significant contributions to the goods: from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as the potential delay of running the line.
It is also a breakdown of ancient friendships.
The three children who raised Willowby and her husband Dan Baldwin were friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willowby created a Truly mark with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, led the company in March.
Both pairs often spend their vacation together, and also Jones belongs to 40 per cent of the company's television company.
Willowby will be the ambassador of the M&S mark and will replace Anthony Mcpartlin as the leading ITV transmission "I am a celebrity".
The source of the nearby surroundings of Jones said yesterday: “We cannot comment on his commercial affairs.”
The complicated negotiations, and then we loved each other.
He jokeed about the criticism that the media would be confronted with because of the “indecent President” of the commentary and positive assessment of the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Tramp give up so many claims?
Said Tramp by imitating the voice of the leading news.
“I did not renounce anything.”
He noted that Kim Chen Yen was interested in a reunion, after Tramp called them the first summit held in Singapore in June, a significant step towards the reduction of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations have been incredible.
Three months after the June Summit in Singapore, the high-level North Korean diplomat Lee Jon Ho spoke to the world leaders at the UN General Assembly meeting on Saturday with a statement that North Korea is still waiting for “responsive action” from the United States after the initial disarmament measures of the CNDR.
Instead, the United States noted, the diplomat continues to use sanctions as a pressure turbulence.
During the meeting of his representatives, President Tramp expressed a much more optimistic assessment.
“The case is great with North Korea,” he said. “
"We were at the border of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
And now we have a great relationship."
Tramp said that his efforts to make relations with Kim Chen Yin had brought its fruits: the missile tests had been ended, hostages were released, and the remaining in the UNDR were also returned to their homeland.
Speaking of his relationship with Kim Chen Yen, Tramp stressed that there was nothing strange in his unusual approach to diplomacy.
“Let the president know that it's so easy, but instead of 10,000 people on the streets who strike into this entirely scattered hall, there would be only 200 people," Tramp said, pointing to the crowd gathered before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: catastrophic destructions are identified, victims are calculated by hundreds of
In the first days of the earthquake in Lomboc, the foreign NGO said that there was no need to be.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lomboc population have lost a roof over its head, the Government did not find it necessary to declare national natural disaster, which is a mandatory condition for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they did not need international support, so it was difficult," said Selina Sambung.
The Rescue of Children is preparing the team to be sent to Palo, but we still don't know if a foreign group can work in place.
According to the statement of Mr. Sutopo, the official representative of the National Office for the Elimination of the Effects of Natural Disaster, Indonesia ' s leadership conducted an assessment of the situation in Palo to identify the appropriateness of attraction of international organizations.
Given the continuous seismic instability in Indonesia, the country is still terribly unprepared for natural disasters.
Although concealed hiding from tsunamis in Acheha, it is rarely possible to meet them on other coast lines.
Despite the prejudice to the threat of tsunami, there was no siren in Palo to inform the population, which would likely lead to so many victims.
Transport report between many Indonesian islands is quite difficult even in good weather.
Scientific disasters make logistics more difficult.
The swimming hospital, previously bound in Lomboc to assist victims of earthquake, is directed to Palo, but the road to the location of the new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joco Vidodo has strengthened Indonesia's large infrastructure as the main item of his pre-electoral campaign and has spent the means of improving roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Jocco, which argues for a new time next year, has been dissolved with financing problems.
The President was also criticised for the expansion of interfaith enmity between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
More than a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands have lost blood due to conflicts between Christians and Muslims, armed machete, arrows and other guns.

The monument of Cromwell before the building of the parliament called for a severe discussion on the “Rewriting of History”
Cromwell ' s exile would be an earned reimbursement for barbaric destruction of many cultural and religious artifacts of England by his followers, Puritan fanatici.
However, Mr. Cromwell's memory community called Mr. Creek ' s proposal ' s " madness " and " trying to overwrite history " .
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Memorial Society, said: “In the continuing debate on historical monuments, the statue of Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Palace was inevitable.
Cromwell has nothing to do with the icon-border movement during English civil wars.
Probably Oliver Cromwell suffered for the sins of his ancestor Thomas, who lived for a century earlier.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell of Sir William Hamo Tonicroft authorship reflects the view of his contemporary in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man, which many still consider respectable.
The Sunday Telegraph John Goldsmith interviewed: “Mnogi people, especially at the end of the 19th century, considered Cromwell a parliamentary protection against external pressure, in his case monarchy.
Is that historically precise, the debate of experts remains a matter of debate.
But it can be confident that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has influenced the future development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical person representing one side of that section.
His achievements as a Protector also deserve high assessment and respect."
The Chinese farmer had a murder killer.
In one of the Southwest China markets, a farmer became a victim of pig, reports local media.
The bleeding body of the victim (in the media only is mentioned by his name, Yuan), with a broken arteries, was found near the berth on the market in the Guyjou Province of Lupania in South China, which was reported on Sunday.
The pig is preparing to introduce pigs in the pig farm, 30 May 2005, the Sinin of the Chinese Province of Cinhai.
Juan and his cousin arrived from the neighbouring province of Junenan on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs to sale.
The next morning, the cousin discovered Juan’s breathless body, and the door to the neighbouring pig was opened.
There was a huge scratch in the pig.
During the medical expertise, it was found that the pig weighted 250 kilos of a farmer had been bite.
“My brother's legs were bleeding and crushed”, said Guiyang Evening News Woo, a relative of the dead.
The surveillance video showed that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The pig-killer didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the Evening News newspaper that the pig was isolated in a separate team during the investigation, in avoiding repeated attacks.
It is reported that the Yuan family has negotiated with the market administration on compensation for the death of a farmer.
The attacks of pigs on people are uncommon.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband at the farm in the United States of Massachusetts, severely traumatizing a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogramm animal put a Valley farmer into the tractor and released it, only fearing a peed woman.
In 2012, a farmer from the state of Oregon in the United States had been eaten by its own pigs. As told to CBC News, a Canadian farmer, pigs are usually not aggressive, but the blood taste can act on their hidden aggression as a “lamp mechanism”.
"The pigs of the games,
They are tasteful and very curious, but they have no purpose to offend you.
You should simply bring your animals to the sense of measure and respect," he explained.

In certain Southwest United States areas, mostly in the majority of the Arizona Territory, up to 5 to 10 cm is expected.
There is no risk of sudden rapidly developed floods due to the unbalanced distribution of tropical rains.
In the existing risk of the tropical leunder, walking in the desert is serious.

Senate hearings on Judge Brett Cavano looked at more than 20 million viewers
The statements of Brett Cavano and Christine Blazi Ford, who accused Cavano of attempting to rape in 1980, attached attention to more than 20 million viewers of six television channels on Thursday.
The political opposition to the approve of Cavano's candidacy has received an unexpected continuation. The press was in an emergency report on Friday: the Republican Jeff Flake has provided the condition for the prosecution of a lawyer to investigate the FBI for a week.
As Ford stated at the hearings before the Legal Committee of the Senate, she was 100 per cent convinced that Cavano had attacked her in a state of drunkness and tried to discharge her at the school party.
Cavano made emotional testimony, claiming that it was 100 per cent convinced that it was not.
According to the research agency Nelsen, the Friday debate was over 20.4 million viewers.
The Agency took into account average data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Data on the number of other channels such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network are not yet available.
Furthermore, Nelsen’s rating does not always take into account the viewers watching the television at work.
For comparison, it is a medium audience watching the American football match in the playoff or the Oskar's ceremony.
The largest audience was in the Fox News Channel, whose leaders were hotly supported by Cavano's appointment: the senate hearings that lasted all day were viewed in an average of 5,69 million viewers, reported Nelsen.
Secondly, ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS audit was 3.1 million, NBC - 2.94 million, the MSNBC viewed 2.89 million observers, while the CNN had 2.2 million reviews, reported Nelsen.
After hearing, there was no weak interest in the case.
There was a real drama on Friday with Jeff Flake.
After the Senator of Arizona, who was considered a moderate republican, he reported his intention to support Cavano, CNN and CBS television channels were able to seal on the camera, like on Friday morning on his way to the meeting of the Legal Committee, Flake encountered in an elevator with a group of activists who violated the criticism of the senator.
The whole world saw him slipping off his eyes, getting annoyed women in a direct CNN air.
“I am standing before you, ” said one of them.
"Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?"
“Their strength, while so many women are inpowerable, ” they tried to explain their position.
Flake replied to the activists that his office had already made a statement and would speak on this topic at the meeting of the Committee, and the elevator's doors closed by hiding the senator from everywhere.
When a few hours later the Legal Committee was prepared to approve Cavano ' s candidacy for the post of the judge and to send it to the Senatu for a general vote, all television channels translated the meeting in direct air.
Flake, however, set up one condition — to investigate the FBI on these charges against the candidate by the next week, as aimed at the democratic minority.
Flake claims that he has changed his views by the intervention of a friend, a senator from the democrats of Chris Kuns.
He made a final decision by talking to Kuns and several other senators.
Flake's decision has taken effect, as it was obvious that the Republicans lacked votes to approve Cavano without investigation.
By order of President Tramp, the FBI opened an investigation of charges on Cavano.

The Division is grateful to the Office of Criminal Dissemination of the Police of Louisiana, State Criminal Police Laboratory, Southern University Police and local residents who assisted in the operational search activities that led to detention.
Joe Alleva, director for sports at the University of Louisiana, thanked the forces of the rule of law for their “honest work on the capture of a criminal”.
Sims was only 20 years old.
The two-fourth Forward was the harvester of Baton Rouge; his father Wayne also played at the University of Louisiana.
In the past season, Simms collected 5.6 points and made 2.6 choices in average for the match.
The trainer of the team Will Wade made a statement on Friday morning, saying that Wade Simms' tragic death caused a "shock" and "real grief" to all players.
“That's what I've always been afraid of, ” added the coach.

On Saturday, the National Centre for Prevention of Natural Disaster recommended that the population do not approach the volcano: the activity has been registered in its crater and has been produced 183 peripheral emissions per day.
The Centre observed that near the volcano was frequently blowing and trembling.
In some areas of Mexico, such as Socimilko, social network users published photos of the foreheads of cars covered by a thin layer of ashes.
Following the earthquake of 7,1 Mw, which was amazed by the Central of Mexico in September 2017, geophysics detected the participating volcanic activity 72 km south-east of the capital.
Vulcan Popocatepetl (or, for his own, Don Goyo) is an active volcano since 1994.

After the police released the debs to stop the crowd, the riots regained with the new force.
During a few hours, the independence officers scanded: ‘We will not forget, not forgive!’ and their opponents replied to them with a slozzong: ‘Hello to Spain!’
According to the local press, fourteen shareholders were in the hospital with light wounds.
A referendum on the exit of Catalonia from Spain was held on 1 October last year, and it was recognized as an illegal Spanish Government, but became important for separatists, and a year later, the sovereignty of the region remained tension.
Catalonia voted in favour of the exit from Spain, but the phenomenon was low because the exit opponents had boiled the referendum.
According to the Catalan official sources, in the past year attempting the police to block a referendum in the country's elections in severe conflicts, almost 1,000 people were injured.
On Friday, the separatists stayed on the declared road of the demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent it from being conducted.
The demonstration was still in progress, but it went the other way.
The 68-year-old electrician Narciss Termes, who visited the separatists in his wife's company, sees that the hope of acquiring the Catalonia sovereignty becomes increasing.
“It was one of the most important events in our life last year.
My parents cried for happiness by having the opportunity to vote in a referendum and today we are in a hungry state," he said.
At the recent December elections in the local authorities of the Catalonic Party, who acted as separated from Spain, have received a vital victory, although with a small breakdown, but this year their movement loses the stakeholders because many of the known leaders of the movement are either in refugees or in detention, waiting for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent announcement of independence.
Hoan Potch, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a telephone meeting in support of the police, said that the conflict was warmed by both sides of the political spectrum.
“Increases tension”, he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junkeras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalonic Separatists, since the end of the last year in the preliminary prison cell, said that their intention was to vote to the European Parliament next year.
“The participation in the regular elections in the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish Government,” he said.

Livingstone victory over Rangers thanks to the bullet naked Mengi
The first goal of Dolly Mengi has brought a guaranteed victory to the Levingston team
Thanks to the Livingstone ball, he won a sudden victory over the Rangers. For the chief coach of the Scotland Club, Steven Gerard, it was only a second defeat for 18 games.
The exact hit of Dolly Mengi equipped Gary Holt's team with the Hybernian club at the table in which they share the second place.
The Gerard Club has lost its victory in the season of the Premier League, and in Sunday, they are meeting with the leaders of the group, Harts, from which Rangers stand for eight points.
On Thursday, Rangers will take a European League match with the Austrian Rapid Club (Vina).
The Livingstone Club continues its vague series in the Division, playing six matches and no defeat since Holt changed Kenny Miller as the chief coach of the team.
Missed moments for Livingstone in struggling guests
Coach of Coach Holt was supposed to be accounting from the beginning, and “Rangers” clearly did not work hard on them.
Scott Robinson has been able to break through the defense line, but the naked of his weak attempt, and then Alan Litgow's protector, waving too wide, couldn't interfere with the ball of Caig Halkett.
The accepting party allowed Rangers to play in front of their defense line, relying on dangerous moments when resuming the game.
That's exactly how they missed this important goal.
The Rangers retired, and Livingstone used the possibility: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made a transfer to Menga, which had been derived from the central position.
The Rangers had the superiority of the ball at that time, but the administering team was intact, so Liam Kelly's gateway was not concerned.
The second time continued in the same scheme, although Kelly had to turn away from Alfredo Morelos.
The Rangers gateman Allan McGregor slipped the ball from Scott Pittman, and Litgow made a broad supply from the standard situation.
The balls were constantly hit by the Livingstone penalty, but all the attacks were reflected, and the two tools requirements were one for the provocation of Glenn Midlton Halkett and the second behind the game of hand were not satisfied.
The phenomenal Livingstone game — Analysis
By BBC Scotland — Alasder Lamont, reporting with the stadium Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal game and the excellent result for the Livingstone team.
All the players were brilliant, and the next time they had overcome all the expectations, continuing their rising up to the soccer Olympus.
Their game style and composition have almost not changed since they risen up to the top rates of the rating, and the greatest value of Coach Holt is that he has mobilized this team from the beginning.
There were many real heroes in his team.
Captain Halkett led greatly organized protection, and Menga did not let Connor Goldson and Joe Warralle relax.
The Rangers could never get into the rhythm.
Although they had good games with Coach Gerard, this time they did not justify our expectations.
In the last few minutes, they lacked the ownership of the ball, but they only once made it possible to protect the administering team. The Rangers, which have fallen down in the middle of the table, have something to think about.
Erdogan's cold acceptance during the visit to Keln
On Saturday, on 29 September, when Turkish and Germany leaders met at breakfast, there was a great weather, and both higher people were in great mood.
This was the last day of the visit of President Erdogan to Germany in order to establish a relationship between the two NATO parties, a visit, and any other conflict.
The heads of countries have not been able to find understanding of human rights, freedom of printing and the entry into the EU of Turkey.
After that, Erdogan went to Kelne to participate in the ceremony of opening a huge new machete.
The largest Turkish diaspora outside Turkey is in Kelne.
For security reasons, the police did not allow a 25,000 crowd to enter the mosquito, but many of Erdogan's representatives were nearby to see their president.
In the same place, the opponents of the Erdogan regime, including the courses, were gathered to condemn, in full, both the Erdogan policy and the decision of the German Government, to invite him to visit Germany.
The presence of radically opposite points of view at the meeting reflects the unequivocal substance of the figure: many Germans with Turkish roots are devoted to Erdogan, while others consider it a tyrant.

In the meantime, roads were closed and buses were changed, the cars were asked not to arrive in the area.
Conflicts in Long Lartin: Six police officers injured
According to Long Lartin's administration, six police officers were injured during disorders committed in a male prison of a severe regime.
In the male prison of a strict regime of Long Lartin (Wustershire) since Sunday, disorders connected around 09:30 by local time continue.
A group of Tornado has been called to suppress the disorder in which eight prisoners are participating from one wing.

According to the statement of the official prison, “for the authorization of an incident in the Long Lartin Correction Institute, specially trained staff were attracted.
Six of them were injured.
We have categorically denied the use of the physical force in our institution, and it is obvious that the perpetrators will be transferred to the police and their intersection measures may be changed for a longer term."
In Long Lartin, more than 500 prisoners are currently held, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager was in the hospital by attacking one of the prisoners.
In October last year, the leadership of the prison was forced to attract the units of special appointment to calm the explosive prisoners throwing billard balls into overseers.
Uragan Rosa can flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit dry territories)
Arizona rarely falls into the intense tropical cycle zone, but this time she was “happy”: in early next week, hurricane Rosa, with the last rival, should go over the desert part of the Southwest and take the risk of floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned about the threat of lion floods on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona and the south and eastern part of Nevada, in the southeast of California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that the hurricane of Rosa will go straight over Phoenix on Tuesday and be poured on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service Bureau in Phoenix reported in Twitter that “the only ten tropical cyclones had maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the radius of 320 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Uragan Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 km from the Arizona border."
According to the recent prognosis of the National Meteorological Service, it will fall from 5 to 10 cm, reaching the places at the arison plate of Mogollon-Rim.
Other desert regions of South-West, such as Central Rocky Mountains and Big Basein, may fall up to 2,5 to 5 cm, landing may reach 10 cm.
For zones whose lion flows will go across the side, the rain brought by the hurricane of Rosa may be a real blessing, since the region has long suffered from drought.
Although the floods may be dangerous, rich rains can facilitate the dry season not in the Southwest of the United States.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor maps, more than 40% of the Arizona Territory is at least a strong drought (second by weight)”, stated the weather.com website.
At first, the hurricane of Rosa will crash to the State of the Lower California.
As at Sunday morning, the hurricane, the maximum speed of 137 km/h, is 360 km south of Punta Euchenia (Mexico) and is moving north with 19 km/h.
Uragan was in a colder zone on the Pacific coast and thus lost its strength.
In the afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico as a tropical storm.
It is expected that there will be plenty of floods in Mexico.
“In the Territory from Low California to Northwest Sonora, it may fall up to 7 to 10 cm, by places up to 25 cm”, states the Weather.com website.
Next, hurricane Rosa will go north through Mexico and in the early morning will reach the border with Arizona in the tropical cycle. From Arizona it will come to the southern part of Utah state by Tuesday.
“The main potential risk of the hurricane of Rosa and its remains is related to strong limbs in Low California, Northwestern Sonora and the desert regions of Southwest of the United States,” reports the National Meteorological Service.
The landing is expected to cause dangerous leather floods, dirty stone streams in the desert and possible landing in mountain areas.

Donald Tramp: "In Cavano all hatred, all the evil of democrats"
"The voting for Judge Cavano is a voice against the ruthless and oppressive tactic used by democrats," said Tramp at the meeting of his colleagues in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trampa believes that the Cavano nomination for the candidate has been “with all the hatred, all evil” of the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Cavano testified in the United States Congress, in his emotional treatment, categorically rejecting the accusation of Christine Blazi Ford that he had sexually persecuted her over 30 years ago when both were adolescents.
Dr. Ford also made a testimony during the hearing on her accusation.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that that day “the American people saw a brilliant mind, class and courage”.
"The vote for the approval of Judge Cavano is a vote for the approval of one of the most excellent lawyers of our time, with an uninterrupted public service list," the President announced the crowd of his colleagues in the West Virginia State.
In his speech, the President indirectly raised the question of the nomination of Cavano, referring to the importance of the Republicans ' phenomenon for elections in Congress and the House of Representatives.
“To the most important choices in our life, only five weeks remain.
I am not participating in them, but I participate in the race in another way," he said.
"I am wearing like a burn and fighting for our excellent candidates."
Tramp believes that the democrats have set up the task of “with all their powers to resist us”.
Under the Regulation, the first key vote in the Senate for the approval of the Cavano candidate should take place not later than Friday, said the assistant of the High Representative of the Republican Party.
The earthquake in Indonesia has taken hundreds of lives and the total number of victims continues to grow
On Saturday, Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people were killed, many of them were taken by giant waves captured by the beaches of the Indonésian island of Sulavesi, which had been deployed by the incredible force of tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims of the season were hundreds of visitors of the beach festival in Palo, and on Friday, at the sunset, the waves reached nearly six meters high, which dared all of them on their way and led to the immediate death of many attendees.
Tsunami followed the earthquake of 7.5 by Richter's scale.
“When storm warning was announced yesterday, people continued their beach rest instead of running into hiding immediately and lost their lives,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, official representative of the Indonesian National Office for the Elimination of natural disasters during the press conference held in Jacquart.
“The tsunami didn't come, there were cars, brews, whole houses, the season destroyed everything in its way”, explained Nugroho, adding that tsunami crossed the ocean with a speed of 497 km/h, and all of its strength to the coast.
Some of the present ones came to the trees, which saved their lives.
Approximately 16,700 local people were evacuated into 24 asylums in Palo.
At the aircraft of the control of disasters, there are devastated houses, shops that crashed bridges and flooded scents.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still underground.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the territory of 2.4 million people.
The statement of the Agency for Assessment and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) indicates that the energy emission caused by the earthquake was approximately 200 times higher than the explosion of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hirosim.
Tsunami may have been stronger than it was expected by the geographical situation of the city located at the end of a long narrow bay.
Nugroho called the damage “max”, adding that thousands of houses, hospitals, trade centres and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of the dead were found under the ruins of the ruined buildings; total injuries were received by 540 people, and 29 remained missing.
Nugrocho added that victims and destruction could be even more significant along the coast of 300 km from Palo, in the Dungala place, which was closer to the earthquake epicentre.
Communications with Dungala were “without complete destruction, no information has been provided”.
The International Committee of the Red Cross, whose staff and volunteers have already been sent to the disaster zone, reports: “In the area of Dungala there are over 300 thousand people,” the International Committee of the Red Cross.
“The tragedy has occurred, but it is not yet a limit,” the report states.
On Saturday, the Office has been criticized because it has not reported tsunami to Palo, but the authorities believe that the waves reached the coast at the time the initial warning was still in force.
The social networks had a lover video in which a man at the top of the building shouted about the coming tsunami, desperately trying to attract attention to people on the street.
A few minutes later, the wall of water will be smashed, bringing all the houses and cars to the shore.
The Reuters agency has not yet been able to confirm the authorization of this film.
The earthquake and tsunami have led to a major electrolysis, which has led to a lack of communication in Palo, which made the rescue operations very difficult.
The Jacarda and other cities were sent with humanitarian assistance by military aircraft, but the evacuated population still lacks food and items of first need, reports government sources.
The city airport was only opened for humanitarian assistance; it would be closed for other flights until October.
On Sunday, the evacuation centres in Palo will be visited by President Joco Vido.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
The volunteers of the World Vision's charitable organization have arrived safely from Dungala to Palo, where the staff found a hiding place in the bench tents broken in the courtyard of their office building.
“They saw a huge crowd of devastated houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
The charitable organizations began to provide humanitarian assistance mechanisms, but many complain that the international NCO experts were unable to reach Palo.
The Indonesian legislation authorizes funding, humanitarian assistance and foreign organizations only after the announcement of the place where the natural disaster was hit by the national disaster zone.
That's not what happened yet.
“It is considered to be a local disaster”, said Aulia Ariani, press secretary of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government declares the natural disaster to the national, we will be able to receive foreign assistance, but yet the status remains unchanged”.
On the second day after the natural disaster, the Palo, the friends and relatives of the missing people are still hoping for their marvelous salvation, which will restore faith to the people of the best.
On Saturday, a little boy fell into the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescueers pulled out of the declines of the building a woman who spent two days there next to her mother's breathless body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the National Indonesian College on Paraplanerism, prepared two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian games in Indonesia.
Among other people who were trapped in the Roa Roa Roa hotel were his disciples, including Mandagi.
“I am not the last person in this sport, and it is emotionally difficult to survive, ” he said.
Gendon recalls how, after Roa Roa Roa was acquired by other paraplanerists, he desperately tried to contact whatsApp with his colleagues from Palo at the beach festival in the next hours.
His messages were, however, shown with one grey barn, not two blue ones.
“This means that the communications have not been delivered” he believed.

Canyo West: Reper has changed the name on Ye
The Rapper Canye West has come up with a new name: Ye.
He announced this on Saturday in Twitter: “The personality known earlier as Kanie West.”
41-year-old West has been wearing this alias for a long time and even put it in the name of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The news of this appeared in the predecession of Canya in Saturday Night Live, where he plans to introduce his new Yandhi album.
Canye West will speak to companions instead of the Ariana singing, who canceled its participation for “emotional experiences”, said the transmission author.
West previously stated that the alias was not only a short version of his name but also a religious sense.
“Ye is the most frequent word in the Bible, it means you, you, ” so West explained the name of his album in one of the recent interviews to the Big Battle Radio.
"It's me, it's you, it's us.
At first, it was Kanie, which means “one”, and now I am just Ye, that is the reflection of all good, bad, unacceptable in us, just at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are."
Canier is not the first known rapper who decided to change the name.
Sean Combs, known earlier as Paff Deddy, P. Deedy or just Diddy, asked this year to call himself Love (Love) or Brasa Lav.
He also changed his name several times with West repper Jay-Ze, with deficit and without, proper letters or shorts.
President of Mexico promised not to use military forces against civilians
President of Mexico, Andreas Manuel Lopez, oathed that he had never fled against civilians in the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration ending with a bleeding struggle.
Speaking on Saturday at the Tlatellolco Square, President Lopez Obradore promised “without ever helping the army to suppress the Mexican people”.
At this point, on 2 October 1968, during the peaceful demonstration of students, the first shots in the crowd began, which took 300 lives, which was in the background of the strengthening of the left student movements in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador also promised the support of Mexican youths as a monthly scholarship for training and opening a larger number of free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of prospects of education lead young people directly into a criminal world.
USD needs to double the financing of II developments
China should not underestimate its efforts in the field of artificial intellect (II) — the United States must double its investments in scientific developments, Lee Kaifu, investor and entrepreneur in the field of II development with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
A number of American ministries have previously made statements on I.I, although in the general of the United States, there is no clear strategy for I.I. development.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its goal was to be the first innovation by 2030.
“Increasing the II research budget would be a good beginning twice, given that all other countries are far away from the United States, and we expect the next breakdown in the field of II”, said Lee.
The increase in funding could double the chances that the next major achievement of II will be achieved in the United States, said Li CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Super-State art intellectual intelligence: China, the Cremne Valley and the new world order” was published in this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the Director-General of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most excellent I.I. companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s at Carnegi Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intellectual intellectual, which exceeded the highest player in the U.S. Otello, and then was the leader of Microsoft Research and the President of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee mentioned the previous US Government Technology Competition, such as Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects, and wondered when the next contest will take place to help find people with non-traditional thinking.
Lee said that researchers in the United States often have a lot of work to receive government grants.
“China does not absorb academic leaders but corporates,” convinced Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have recently rented lights from universities to work on artificial intellect.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to develop artificial intellectual intelligence.
"I think the Green cards should be automatically offered to artificial intellectual candidates," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published an artificial intellectual development plan for the next generation.
China's National Natural Science Fund allocates funding to scientists similar to how the National Scientific Fund and other government organizations allocate money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China below, Lee endorses.
Earlier this year, the United States Ministry of Defence established the United Nations Centre for Art Intellectual Intellect, which must be part of industrial and scientific partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intellectual Intellect.
During this month, DARPA announced the investment of 2 billion dollars in a programme called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, it currently invests more than 100 million dollars a year in the II study.
In the meantime, the U.S. legislation, which has endeavoured to establish the Commission for National Security on Artificial Intellectual Intelligence, has not taken any measures in this direction for several months.
Macedonians voted at the referendum on whether the country's name should be changed
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday on a referendum on whether the name of their country should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would allow a multi-annual dispute with Greece, which blocked its requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, consisting of the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of her north neighbour is a claim to its territory, and put veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments concluded an agreement based on the proposal for a new name, but the opponents of the nationalists claim that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonian population.
President Georgie Ivanov said that he would not vote at the referendum, and the boycot campaign questioned whether the phenomenon of the voters would correspond to the minimum of 50 per cent necessary for the referendum.
The referendum issue was as follows: “Do you support membership in NATO and the EU under the conditions of adoption of a treaty with Greece?”
Participants of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries emerging after the fall of Yugoslavia, is worth paying the price for entering organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that she could live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska, resident of Skopje.
The sufficient number of members of the parliament stated that they would follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive, although it has no binding legal force.
The change in the name will require a majority of two thirds of the votes of the Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violation reports had been received by 13:00.
However, the phenomenon was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters were voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, a voter from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško voted for a referendum in Macedonia on a change in the name of the country that would open the way for its entry into NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Before the building of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Cavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage, laying chairs in front of the tents established by those citizens who are going to bojcot the referendum.
"We are for membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join with a highly raised head, rather than robbing the thresholds of official offices," said Kavadarkov.
"Yes, we are citizens of the poor country, but we also have a sense of dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can contact other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would contribute to Macedonia, which was so needed for this country, where the unemployment level was more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the oppressive majority will be for, because more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that the positive response will be “the bet of our safe future.”
A survey published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research of Macedonia showed that 30 to 43 per cent of the voters would participate in the referendum, but it was below the required phenomenon.
During the second survey conducted by the Macedonian Telecom-TV channel, 57 per cent of respondents were planned to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of this quantity claim to vote positively.
In order to make a referendum, the phenomenon should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious impact on the policy of the Western Government since it came to power in May last year.
See: Serhio Aguero from Manchester City is looking around the protection of the Brayton to slap the goal.
Serhio Aguero and Rahim Sterling debated Brayton's protection, leading Manchester City to win on Saturday at the Tihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero hit the goal for the 65th minute, it seemed like it didn't make him work.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker received a passage in the center of the field.
He was walking between the three Brighton Protectors before exploding into the open space.
Aguero was surrounded by four opponents in green shirts.
He circled over one protector and circled a few more on the edge of the Briton fine zone.
Next, he handed the ball to Sterling on the left.
The English attacker, who was in the fine zone, returned Aguero's ball, who smashed the Brayton gateway at the right corner of the gate.
"Aguero has some problems with his legs," said coach of Manchester City, Pep Guardiola, journalists.
"We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We have been lucky that he has stuck the goal at that point."
But Sterling has given the original advantage of the Prime Minister of League.
That goal was stuck in 29 minutes.
In this game, Aguero received the balls deeply in Briton.
He gave an excellent cut-off on the left flag on Leroy Sana.
Sane made a few touches before delivering Sterling to a further stang.
The Sky-Blue attacker stabbed the ball to the gate right before flying outside the field.
Manchester City struggled with Hoffenheim at the League of Championships on Tuesday 12:55 at Rein Nekkar-Aren, Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer is going to take the glasses from Colorado Rockies.
After Washington Nashionals had risen from the playoff battle, there was no reason to force events.
But the unfatigue Sherzer hopes to conquer the fight against Colorado Rokis on Sunday, but only if Rokis has one game in Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division, there will be problems in the playoff.
The victory of 5-2 over Nashionals on Friday night, Rokis, has already won at least 7 or 8 places, but they are still hoping to ensure the title in the first division.
"Although we play just so, but at least we can keep the positions, knowing the enormous significance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of the observers and the other team, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss this?"
Nashionals have not announced a drinker on Sunday, but, according to the latest, they are inclined to put Sherzer on this role.
Sherzer, who was going to go out on the 34th game, thursday he threw a ball on the pitcher square, and on Sunday, on his weekend, he'll be a picher.

Tramp runs a pre-electoral race in Western Virginia
Speaking of the importance of the Republicans at the intermediate elections, the President indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Cavano, the candidacy made by the President to the Supreme Court.
"All we have done is on the map in November.
Five weeks remained to one of the most important choices in our life.
This is very, very important. I am not running, although I really run, fighting for good candidates everywhere," he said.
Tramp continued: "You see this horrible, horrible, radical group of democrats, you see that this is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their powers using all the necessary means, and we see uglyness and uglyness.
They don't care whom they will insult, whom they must cross, to receive power and control, and that is what they want, the power and control, but we are not going to give them.”
Democrats, he claims, have aimed to “continue and obstacle”.
"And you have seen this in the last four days," he said, "the democrats called "the wicked, the wicked, the cruel and the liar."
He referred to the Senate Legal Committee, mentioning the Democratic Senator Diane Finstein, which led to loud voices from the hall.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow the leak of this document?
Mmm... mmm... what document?
No, no, the tongue of the body has issued it, and I have never seen the language of the body to distort so much.”
The Layborist Party is no longer a organization that follows different views.
It does not show tolerance to those who express their views
When the activists of Momentum in my local party made a proposal for misunderfaith to me, it was no surprise.
Finally, I am the last member of the parliament from the Laborist Party who has not yet been said that we are not welcomed for expressing our views.
Similar attitude to my colleague in parliament Joan Ryan, because it was strongly expressed against antisemitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe is ironic to fate issues that Jeremie did not agree with previous leaders.
The Notification of the Nottingham East Laborist Assembly on Friday said that “we want the congregations to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of the eight years of my stay at a local member of Parliament from the Laborist Party, the Friday GC meetings were like that.
Unfortunately, today's tone does not match the many meetings, but the promise of “human and soft” policy has long been forgotten if it has ever been.
The fact that the Laborist Party does not distinguish its views has become more and more obvious, and each opinion is assessed on whether it is acceptable for the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; the colleagues whose political perspective I had previously considered similar to my own began to expect me to change my views and take places that I would never agree with — whether the national security or the EU single market is concerned.
Each time after my public statement, it doesn't matter what I'm saying, and the social networks have a tide of insults calling for annulment of the elections condemning the centre policy, or claiming that I should not be a member of the Laborist Party.
And that's not what happens to me.
Indeed, I know that I have been more lucky than some of my colleagues, since the comments on my address have a tendency to be political.
I admire professionalism and the determination of my colleagues who face sexual or racist attacks every day but never retreat.
Most of all in this policy is disappointed in the fact that such insults have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin stated that the Leiborist Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the "wide church" and with every vosum of untrusting or changing the rules of choice of the party, it is now.
In the past two years, I received many recommendations that encourage me to sit quietly and cut out and then I will be fine.
But I'm not in politics for that.
Since I joined the Laborists 32 years ago, as a student of the school, disturbed by the disregardful attitude of the Government of Tatcher, which has literally broken down my school class, I have been trying to stand up to the highest standard of public services for those who need more than anything — whether the work of the local deputy or the government minister.
I never hid my political views, I didn't do it in the past elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have interpreted my political positions and spheres in which I disagree with the current leadership.
For those who supported this vosum on Friday, I would like to say this: our country is working to Brexit, which guarantees that it will cause an economic, industrial and public damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to waste their time and strength on my loyalty to the leader of the Laborist Party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to speak to is not Nottingham Momentum, but my voters, whether they are laybackers or not: I am proud of serving you, and I promise that no threats to dismissal of the results of the elections or political advantage will prevent me from acting as I think necessary in your interests.

Er 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible E.R.
Two late attempts, perhaps, have struck a few final outcomes, but no doubt the E.R. deserves a triumph in this incredibly interesting premier League game of Tenenta.
They are now heading the table, the only invincible team of dozens.
After all, thanks to their excellent protection, as well as the ability to choose the right time, which gave the host team and coach Peter Merci full right to be satisfied.
"The whole time we were checked for strength, and we are still invincible, so I have no reason to be sad," said Peter Merchie.
Robin Christy, Melrose: "They're standing to give the estimation of the E.R., they've done better than us."
The attempt of Grant Anderson for 14 minutes, which was done by Fraser Climo, led the ER forward, but the yellow card released for the game Voriors to the Scotch player Rory Hughes allowed the Melrose to move forward, and Jason Baggott caught up for an unreasoned attempt.
Climo increased the er gap from the penalty before, directly in the middle of the game, earned the point, and then made a single attempt in the interruption by making an account of 17-5 for the benefit of the E.R..
But Melrose started the second half well, and the attempt of Patrick Anderson, which was done by Baggot, decreased to five points.
Thereafter there was a long break due to the serious injury of Ruarid Knott, who had been re-exited, and after re-exit, the E.R. continued with the attempt of Stafford McDowell, the Climo.
The active captain Blair McFerson then received a yellow card, and again Melrose forced the rivals to pay the next player for the unreasoned attempt of Bruce Colvin at the end of the rage pressure period.
Nevertheless, the masters returned, and when Struan Hatchinson received a yellow card for Climo's capture without a ball from the fine line, McFerson made a tachdown behind the E.R. beach.
Climo realized the advantage, without delaying from the very re-exit, after Kyle Row got hit by David Armstrong and sent the extreme attacking Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the masters.
The Still Game Star is going to start a new career in a restaurant business
The Still Game Ford Kyran is going to work in the hotel industry: it was known that it was appointed Director of the Licensed Restaurant Company.
A 56-year-old actor performs the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, the scenario he wrote to, and is taken off with a long comedian partner Greg Hamphill.
Duet announced that the forthcoming ninth series would be the last in the show, and it seems Kirnan is planning life after Craiglang.
In official information, he is Director Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this information, although the source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan plans to participate in the “prosperous restaurant” in Glasgo.
The sea of ours: no way to the sea of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
The seamen patrol military headquarters in La Pass.
Blue flags are hanged in public buildings.
The maritime bases from the lake of Titicaca to Amazon are drawn by the slogan: “Way is our right.
Return it is our duty."
Without the sea, Bolivia remains alive in memory of the coastal line lost for Chile as a result of the 19th century ' s bloodshed conflict; it is live and desired to swim again across the Pacific.
These hopes may have become the braveest in the past decades, since Bolivia expects a decision of the international court, which will take place on 1 October in the course of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has energy, spirit of unity and mental balance, and, of course, there is a positive outcome," said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadillia.
Many of the Bolivians will observe the decision-making process in the International Court on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will support the statement of Bolivia that after decades of tens of tens of tense negotiations, Chile is obligated to negotiate the provision of the sovereign exit of Bolivia to the Sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of the Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia, who is leading a difficult battle for re-election next year, is also awaiting the decision that will be made on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court would hardly decide in favour of Bolivia, and if that happens, it would not change much.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no power to order the Chilean territory and has already stated that it would not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The decision of the International Court was made only six months after the recent arguments were heard, said that the case was not "complicated", said Pas Zarate, Chilean expert on international law.
For the past four years, the case of Bolivia has not been progressing, but the whole time has been delayed.
“The current Bolivian administration has been using access to the sea for criminal purposes," Zarate said.
She said that the Morales military rhetoric destroyed the last Chile's kindness.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but then it will be very difficult to discuss.
These two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodrigues Welce, representative of Bolivia in Hague, did not agree that the decision of the court was taken too quickly.
The Monday will bring Bolivia a “exclusive opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the chance to“ end 139 disagreements with both benefits”, he said.
Caldadillia also disagrees that Morales, still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, uses a maritime problem as a political cosier.
“Bolivia will never refuse its right to access the Pacific”, he said.
"The decision of the court is an opportunity to make sure that we have to cross our past."
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not be available until it can trust the United States
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yeong Ho, stated that his country would never go to the destruction of its nuclear weapons unless he could trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at the UN Genassembly meeting.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made at the Singapore Summit among its leaders.
His comments shall take place as the Secretary-General of the United States, Mike Pompeo, gradually returns to the path of renewal of the tupic nuclear diplomacy for more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Chen Yin.
Ri claims that the dream that long sanctions and the opposition of the United States against the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever put North on the knees is a drown.
Washington fears to endorse this declaration if Pyñan takes significant disarmament steps before.
And Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Tramp, want to take the second summit.
However, scepticism that Phenyan seriously refers to the denial of the arsenal, which the country is likely to consider as the only way to guarantee its security, is widely widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyan next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Tramp.
Paris Fashion Shows show the latest line of massive main suits that promised to appear in mass sales, and will be wearing them right next to you.
If you want to add a hat to your collection or fully protect you from sunlights, there is no need to look for anything else.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a mass of unusual main clothing, part of their SS19 collection and blind fashion visitors in Paris.
This summer, extremely unpractical hats gained the popularity of the signatories of Instagram, and designers decided to send their snoosy creations to the floor.
The Valentino copie: the main beach suit decorated by broad fields similar to feathers had adorned on the heads of the models.
Other massive axesoares included precious stones of orbus, a hat of a wizard, and even ananas, but all these main clothings are not intended to warm their head up in cold weather.
Tom Brown also revealed the world’s collection of creepy masks, which had to be very much before Halloween.
Many of these sharp masks were sewed up with their mouth, and they were more like Hannibal Lector's portrait than the creation of a boxer.
One of the copies reminded of the ice cream swimming equipment with a pipe and protective glasses, and the other was a distended ice cream.
If you're a high-fashioned fan, you're lucky.
Fashion criticism predicts that these huge hats have all the chances of breaking into mass sales right to you.
The hats of the huge size go on the "La Bomba" fifth, a hat with two feet wide, which was wearing all, from Rianna to Emily Ratakovski.
The Cultural Label, which produced this extremely unpraktic hat, evolving such a widespread popularity in social networks, gave birth and sent a walk on the floor another huge axesour — a sacred beach bag, almost as large as dressed in a bathing model.
The orange bag of a burned rafia with a white skin handle and a rafia canvas became a bright copie of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection on the week of fashion in Paris.
The selebrity-stylist Luke Armitage tells the F. J.S.A.: “I think the large hats and beach bags will appear in mass sales next summer. Since the designer has produced such a furor by his works, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge axessuares.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance for citizens of the world
Independent schools of Scotland continue the tradition of brilliant education, which has been reaffirmed in 2018: Excellent results showed individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other public-significant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scotland Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland are trained, and they seek to provide a higher level of services for students and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further acquisition of a higher education chosen by their career and for the status of citizens of the world.
As part of the educational sector responsible for the development and implementation of the individual school programme, we see that modern languages continue to remain popular and desirable to choose in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in the language he understands, you call to his mind.
If you speak with him in his own language, then you turn to his heart."
This is a convincing evidence that we cannot rely on English only if we want to build relations with citizens of other countries and know how to trust them.
According to the recent tests this year, we see that languages take leadership positions in the league tables and have the highest score on the results of independent school examinations.
In general, 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages received a higher evaluation of A.
The data received by 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of the students received “A” in the mandarin language, while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of Spanish and 63 per cent of Spanish students, also received “A”.
This proves that in the independent schools of Scotland foreign languages are definitely vital for children and young people in the future.
Language objects are now as demanded by natural sciences, technologies, engineering and mathematics in independent schools and other educational institutions.
A study conducted by the United Kingdom Employment and Employment Commission in 2014 showed that 17 per cent had to have lack of language skills among the reasons that had caused employers to be difficult to fill in vacant jobs.
Thus, language skills are increasingly a guarantee for the successful future career for young people.
Given that more prospective jobs require language knowledge, these skills are needed in the globalized world.
No matter what profession a student chooses if he learns the second language, he will in the future receive a real advantage by gaining another additional skill that he will benefit for his entire life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages, competitive advantages.
According to the YouGov survey, in which more than 4,000 adult British participated in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak in a foreign language enough to support the conversation, and the French was the only language with bi-quantity - 15 per cent of respondents.
That is why investing in language education is so important now.
Knowing several languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children more chances to find good jobs.
In Scotland schools there is a fairly large disturbance in languages that are trained — each school has a set of languages.
A number of schools are concentrated on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important to Britain in the light of the future development of the country until 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, independent schools will always be the choice of several languages with the teachership, whose members are experts in these languages.
Independent schools of Scotland strive to create an environment that will prepare children and arm them with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of their future.
At present, it is not possible to deny that in the global business environment the languages remain vital in the future development of the country, so it should be reflected in education accordingly.
In fact, modern languages really need to be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to propose that choice that provides diversity and benefits for youths of Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards, Director of the Board of Independent Schools of Scotland
Lebron debuts Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The anticipated expectation of the fans to see Lebron James speak to Los Angeles Laukers for the first time.
The Lekers Trainer Luke Walton announced that James would play a seasonal Sunday match against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
But there is still time to find out how much time he has to play.
“More than one and less forty-eight,” Walton replied on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudelle wrote on Twitter that James would probably play a limited time.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games in the Lakers schedule.
“In this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare for the season,” the player answers.
Trampa race in Western Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Tramp is starting the wave of the pre-electoral meetings tonight in Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned Tramp meetings next week, including the friendlyly-designed Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on the candidacy proposed by the Supreme Judge was delayed, Tramp seeks to provide support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans risk to lose control of the Congress if the vote takes place in November.
When will the Tramp meeting in West Virginia be held tonight, and how can you view it online?
The meeting with Tramp in Wiling, West Virginia, will take place today, on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see Tramp's meeting with the Western Virginia electorals online on direct YouTube.
The Tramp will probably speak in the hearings that took place this week for his candidate, Brett Cavano, to be a Supreme Judge. The proposal by the candidate Trampo caused a mass of negative responses, since Cavano was accused of sexual harassment, and the vote that had to take place in the Senate would be delayed until the week before the FBI was investigated.
However, the main goal of this action is to help the Republicans to make the elections of November.
Thus, the campaign of President Tramp aims to enable the five meetings to be held next week to “activate the activities of volunteers and stakeholders, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and Palace of Representatives,” says Reuters.
“The control of the Congress is so important for its agenda that the President should visit as many states as possible, since we are entering the season of pre-electoral agitation,” said the Press Secretary of the Trampa Pre-electoral Campaign, who refused to be called Reuters.
The action planned at Wesbanco Arena today in Wiling can attract participants from "...Ohajo and Pennsylvania" and attract the attention of the Media Pittsburgh," said West Virginia Metro News.
The visit to the Trampo of West Virginia this Saturday is the second visit of this state in the last month, because it has received the advantage of more than 40 per cent in 2016.
Tramp is trying to help a candidate from the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisi, who is postponing surveys.
“It is the fact that in order for Morrisi to initiate survey competitors, the president should come, it is a bad sign for Morrisi itself," said Simon Heather, a politician from the West Virginia University (Reuters quota).
Rider's cup 2018: The United States Assembly demonstrates the readiness to combat and hopes by sending forward on Sunday to couple competitions
After three unilateral sessions, the Saturday game two by two may have been exactly what the Rider Cube needed.
The transitional initiative is an exclusive sports concept, but it is believed by players, and it is very strongly expressed in such competitions.
So who has an initiative?
"They had a six-point advantage, and now four, so I believe it's a small initiative for us," Jordan Speath said leaving.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage and another twelve on the line.
The Americans believe that the Speak feels “the wind in sails”, and they have reasons to keep the spirit high, not in the latest due to the form of Speed and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each can praise three of the four.
Sleep was undisturbed from you to the grin, as it was a personal example.
The victorious voices were growing as the round continued, chasing the decisive ball into the hole, closing the match when Thomas and I retreated two by two.
His strike, which gave them victory in the game on the 15th hole, was met by a similar voice, one of those who said his faith in the opportunity for the American team.
“We need to gather with all the powers and focus only on your game”, commented Speak.
That's all the players have left now.
Go through 18 holes and become winners.
The only players who have earned more scores in the last two days than Speak and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, who have certainly entered the history of the Rider Cube.
A strange but charming couple from Europe exploded four of the four, and they don't seem to know any mistakes.
Mollywood was the only pair of no Godgy on Saturday day, but they also avoided the godgs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and again Friday morning.
Such a series and how their energy seems to circulate between them and non-speakers, strengthens the belief that they will not be defeated on Sunday, and when the sun hides behind the Le Golf National field, there will be no more famous player that boosts the potential victory of Europe than Flitwood or Molinari.
It would be great if they were both on different holes at the same time.
However, to speak about the glory of Europe yet early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had a quick deal with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four balls when he was in a couple with Alex Norren.
Godgy and two double godgs in the first nine holes dug the Spanish and the hole that they could never get out of.
So on Sunday no one will help you get out of your jam.
It is so interesting to observe the game in four balls and four players because of the interaction between couples, the councils they exchange and which deliberately silence and how the strategy can change into one moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and has made a significant progress on the last day, but the fourth session also showed that the United States Assembly has all the powers to combat, in which some, especially in America, doubted.
On the final day, the Rider Cube of Europe leads with 10-6 accounts
Europe will receive the remarkable advantage on the final day of the Rider Cube after the end of the Saturday matches in four balls and fours with the advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight against the two victory of the fighting Tyger Woods to make the account of Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wished to restore the lost trophy in Hazeltin two years ago, had dominated the error of the American team in the morning's games in four balls, winning with account 3-1.
The United States had made more resistance in the fourths by winning two matches, but they could not reduce the breakdown in the account.
Jim Ferrick's team takes eight points from the 12th Sunday matches to save the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European new man who won four points in a sequence, while he and Molinari who received the name Mollywood after the sensible weekends were only the second couple who won four points in the first four matches in the history of the Rider Cube.
Destroying Woods and Patrick Reed into four balls, they then marvelously joined them to win the fallen spirit Woods and the American new Brison Decebmo with even more decisive 5/4.
Woods, the two Saturday matches, showed periodic brightness, but now he lost 19 out of 29 matches in four balls, and the four seven in a seven.
Justin Rose, resting in front of the morning game in four balls, returned to Henry Stanson's partner in fourth, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kapka with the account of 2/1 of the first and third places in the world.
For Europe, however, the game was not a easy and pleasant walk that refreshed the day to the southwest of Paris.
The three-time champion Jordan Speath and Justin Thomas made two points on Saturday for the Americans.
They earned a decisive victory with the account of 2/1 of the Spanish John Ram and Ian Polter in the game in four balls and returned later to win Paulter and Rory Macilroy with 4/3 in the fourths, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Rider Cube, the team was pulled out of departure to four points, leaving alone, taking into account that Ferrick's team, as the owners, had to play downstairs to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of detention of the second seat, the counteract appears to be beyond their capabilities on Sunday.
North Korea said that “category” would not be disarmed unilaterally without trust
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated in the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions strengthened the lack of confidence in the United States, and that his country would, under no circumstances, reject its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yon Ho stated to the General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant measures of goodwill” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, nuclear polygon demolition and the obligation to not build nuclear weapons stocks and not develop nuclear technology.
“The same symmetrical response from the United States is not observed,” he said.
" Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, we will not be able to take unanimous action on disarmament. "
While Ree had repeated the North Korean complaints on Washington ' s opposition ' s " phased " approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, his statement seemed important in the sense that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization without control, as Phenyan had done in the past.
Ree refered to the joint statement made by Kim Yen and Donald Tramp at the first in history between the current President of the United States and the North Korean leader held in Singapore on 12 June; then Kim promised to start a movement towards the “Danaclearization of the Korean Peninsula”, and Tramp promised North Korea the security guarantee.
North Korea has attempted to formally complete the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States claims that Phenyan should first reject its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes calls for severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“United States insist that “the dayclearization must be made” and increase the pressure level through sanctions in order to force their goal and even object to the “conclusion of war”,” said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can put us on the knees is a utopian dream of people who don't know us.
But the real problem is that the ongoing sanctions strengthen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Tramp, mentioned by the United Nations leader at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister focused on three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Mun Jaye In, who had been in the past five months, and added: “If the question of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a foolish way.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech was sharply different from the last year, when he said in the UN Genassemble that the targeting of North Korea's missiles on the U.S. land was inevitable after Mr. Zlo’s President Tramp called Kim “the Semi-Somicide Raket.”
This year, in the UN Tramp, who threatened the “destruction” of the North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said that there is much more to do and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea is disarmaed.
On Wednesday, Tramp said that it did not mean any timetable for the process: “Whether this would take two years, three or five months, it doesn't matter.”
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should encourage Phenyan for the steps that have been taken.
However, US Secretary Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: “The introduction of the Security Council of sanctions must continue actively and mandatoryly until we see the full, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006, endeavouring to terminate the financing of Phenjan programmes on nuclear and ballist missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN Genassamble summit and reported after this meeting that he would visit Phenyan again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he left Phenyan, saying that progress has been made, but within a few hours after that, the North Korea visit condemned him for “bandit requirements”.
North Korea promised that the meeting of Moon will be held this month to unmount the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States would take the “suitable measures”.
He said Kim told him that the “relevant measures” he had spoken were the security guarantees that Tramp promised in Singapore, as well as actions to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to rest in special courses
The new course introduced at the Harvard University this year has helped all students from the starting courses to learn more to sleep and to combat the Shovinist culture of continuous consumption of caffeine in order to awake “night in the spring”.
One of the academics found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to care for themselves.
Charles Chaseler, a doctor for sleep at the Harvard Medical School and a specialist in Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believes to be the first in his own kind in the United States.
After its discovery, he was excited with the idea of introducing such a course, priorly reporting on the impact of the lack of sleep on the learning processes.
“ At the end of my report, a girl came to me and said, “I'm very sorry that I've learned about this only now that I'm almost finished my training. ”
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep -- what surprised me," said The Telegraph.
The course, first invitated to students this year, tells us how the healthy sleep habit contributes to academic and sports success and how it improves human general self-consciousness.
Paul Barreyra, professor of the Harvard Medical School Psychiatric and Executive Director of the University Health Service, said that the university decided to introduce this course after it was discovered that students had a serious lack of sleep during the school week.
Students have been doing a number of interactive tasks for an hour.
One part of the class offers a picture of the room in the room where students, pressing on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books, receive information about how each of these actions and substances — coffee, lights that have a lack of sleep — affect sports results, and how important it is to get enough sleep daily.
In another section, participants will find out how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, infection, depression and cancer.
The interactive map of the campus encourages participants to think about their daily life.
"We understand that these classes will not change the behavior of students at once.
But we believe that they have the right to know, like any other person has the right to know about, for example, how the smoking affects his health," added Professor Chaseller.
He said that the false feeling of pride for the fact that a person can “smell all night ” is still quite widespread, and modern technologies, as the increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation becomes a problem.
He said that sufficient sleep of good quality is a “secret weapon” of a student to combat stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to combat too much weight, as the lack of sleep translates the brain into the famine regime, making him feel famine constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, has helped Professor Chasler to develop a course by attending one of his classes last year during his first year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread this information all over the campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all aspirants to take a similar training program before entering a competitive school.
Professor Chasler recommends that students set up a alarm that prevents us from sleeping and waking up, and remember the harmful impact of the blue light of the electronic screens and light lamps that violate the human bioritm and leads to sleeping problems.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga is winning Gerard's team
The Rangers have survived the next sad trip meeting, since the Dolly Menga goal led the unselfish team of Steven Gerard to defeat with the account of 1:0 in Livingstone.
The Ibrox team was hoping to win its first victory after the winning account of 4:1 in February in St. Johnstone, but the team of Gary Holt only defeated Gerard of 18 games, leaving his team at eight points behind, giving a light victory to the Harts team, the leaders of the Scotland Prime League.
Menga screwed up seven minutes before the break, and the composition of the Rangers, who lost the power of the spirit, seemed to not to equate the account.
While the Rangers now descended to the sixth place, Livingstone rose to the third place, and only Hibernian resigned on the ratio of the heads slaughtered.
And the Rangers may have additional problems after a linear judge, Calum Spence, had to heal a head wound after a object was abandoned from the guest sector.
Gerard made eight replacements in the team that passed through the E.R. in a half-final for the Scotland League Cube.
In turn, Holt went with the same Levi Strategy 11, which has increased the breakdown with Harts last week, and he would be happy to see how his well-related composition of opponents was tightening at each step.
The Rangers may have lied with the sword, but Livingstone has squeezed a lot more when the ball hit them.
They were to be stabbed in only two minutes when the first transfer of Meng Scott Pittman stopped Allan McGregor, but the semi-protector used the chance.
Kigan Jacobs had a fine attack on the captain of Craig Halkett, but his defence partner, Alan Litgou, had only been able to send the ball to the side of the ball.
The Rangers took over control, but in the last third, there appeared to be more hope than their faith in the game.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he and Steven Lawles had to be punished for forty-fifth minutes, but Judge Steven Thompson disagreed with the Colombian statement.
The Rangers had only two hits in the first time, but the former Aibrox gateman, Liam Kelly, was barely concerned about Lassana Culibali's head, and the weak impact of Ovi Edżaria.
Although the first goal of Livi, which was lost at the 34th minute, may not match the game, no one can deny that they deserved it exclusively by their own work.
But again, the Rangers failed to manage Jacobs' standard play.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallacher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, trying to get the ball to Mang to finish.
Gerard began to act at the break when he replaced Culibali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement was almost immediately when the extreme semi-defenseer gave the pass to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly was running out of his line for capture.
But Livingstone continued to involve guests in a game designed by Litgou and Halkett, continuing to make long transfers.
The Holt team tried to increase the concluding stages, but McGregor was able to block Jacobs before Litgou gave the transfer from the corner of the field.
The reservation Rangers player, Glenn Middlton, once again required a punishment after he struck Jacobs, but Thompson refused again.
Almanah: Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now the page of our almanach "Amazing morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Gans Geiger was born in Germany.
Gaiger has developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactiveness — an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as Geiger's calculator.
As a core of science, Gaiger's calculator also became a foundation of popular culture, which was reflected in the 1950s Coronado film, with cowboy Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, which would not seem like scientists in the main roles:
A man: "What is this thing?"
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s computer, used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you wear these ears, you can really hear the influence of atoms caused by radioactiveness in minerals."
Evans: "Here, I'm sure I can hear it now!"
“Gans” Geiger died in 1945, not experienced only a few days before his 63-year-old.
But his invention, named by his author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” anonymous cells
A new anti-arcade vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” anonymously growing cells and kill them
Part of the vaccine treatment is to teach the immune system to identify anonymous cells
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and to change them in laboratory conditions
As a result of this changes, cells are able to “see” the type of protein characterized for many cancers, then the cells must be reconstituted again.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
One patient who has entered this vaccine and whose immune system has learned to recognise anonymous cells, the cancer of eggs has been in remission for over 18 months.
The method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and to change them in laboratory conditions, after which the modified cells may “see” HER2 proteins, characterized for many cancers, and then modified cells are reintroduced to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofski, U.S. Institute for Cancer Research, Vitez, Maryland, stated: “The results that we received are suggested have a very prospective vaccine”
Professor Berzofski explains: HER2 “improves the growth of several cancers”, including breast cancer, eggs, light and colorful cancer.
Such a method has been successfully used in the treatment of leukemia, and it was in the immune cells of patients and their “training”, as it should be affected by cancer cells.
Canyo West made a Tramp protection in the MAGA hat after his appearance in SNL.
It's gone bad.
Canye West was whistled in the studio during the Saturday concert on which he spoke to the protection of the President of the United States, Donald Tramp, claiming that he would take this post again in 2020.
After performing his third song called the City of Ghost, which he was carrying on the hat “Do America a great again”, the executor spoke against the democrats and supported Tramp.
"I talk to white people very often, and they ask me, "How can you support Tramp, he's racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America for a long time," the executor said.
The SNL channel made a parodial show with Matt Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood Star laughed at the testimony of Brett Cavano to the Senate for Statements of Christine Blacey Ford on sexual harassment.
There was no show on TV how the crowd was upset by West's statement, but this video was loaded into social networks by Chris Rock.
Now, I don't know if Rock was trying to ridicule West.
In addition, West complained to the public that his hat was laughed behind the towers.
“They were kidding me at the scene.
They say don't come out in that hat.
They were really kidding me!
Washington Examiner quotes his words: “They also said that my position was not cool.”
West continues: "Do you want to know what's not cool? Wear a superman's coat so that no one can tell you what to do. Do you want the world to continue to grow?
Then you need love."
His comments, at least twice, had drawn the attention of the audience, the members of the SNL acting seemed distracted, and one person said to the publication: “All the studio has fallen in silence.”
West was invited to replace Ariana Grande's singer at the last moment, whose former boy, Reper McMiller, died a few days before that.
Many were confused by the implementation of the West of the song "I Love It" in the bottle costume.
West was supported by the Chief of the Conservative Group of TPUSA, Candice Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “One of the most brave people: WHATING FOR MNOGY.”
The leading show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was just "who he is, and that is absolutely great".
"Either way, I don't want to support anyone (buying his music, clothing or otherwise by supporting its creation), who, I think, shares and disseminates the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
Like us," she said.
Before the show started, he announced in Twitter that he changed his name, saying that he was now “formally known as Kanie West”.
He's not the first artist who changes his name and follows Deedy's footsteps, also known as Paff Daddy, Paffy and P. Deedy.
His colleague, the rapper Snoop Doga originally had the name Snoop Lyon, and as another example, it could certainly be brought to the executor who had recently become a legend, the Prince, who changed his name as a symbol and then to the name of the artist known earlier as Prince (Prince).
Trials for murder due to the surveillance in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempting a murder after one of his visitors died from knife wounds on Friday in one of the restaurants in Belfast east.
The incident happened in Ballihacamore, as the police reported.
The defendant is expected to be presented to the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the State Prosecutor.
Kit Harrington's throne Star attacks toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known as the sword of John Snow in the cruel medium-economic series of HBO The Game of Thrones.
However, a recently 31-year-old actor criticized the macho-hero stereotype, saying that such characters often induce the idea that youths have to be cruel to respect you.
In his interview, The Sunday Times Culture Kit said that he believed that “something went wrong” and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculine in the age #MeToo.
A Whale, who recently married his colleague on the "The Game of Throne" film, Rose Leslie, his peer, admitted that he was “a very unreasonable” to this problem.
“I personally take this question seriously: where did we go wrong with the perception of courage?” the actress asked.
"Why do we teach adults that we have this problem today?"
Keith believes that television can be partially guilty of toxic courage because of too much muscle characters.
The Actor continues: “What is inherited and acquired?
What are such teachings on TV and on the streets that make young men feel that they should only show one side of courage?
I think it's really one of the greatest problems today, and the question is, how can we change it?
Because today with young people, really, something's wrong.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be participating in any bullets or sikveles of the Games of thrones after the series ends the next summer, claiming that he had “finished with batalities and horses”.
Since November, Keith will play the main role in the Renewable True West Sam Shepherd, who is telling the film producer and his brother, the robber.
Actor recently announced that he believed that the meeting with Rose's wife was the best final of the Games of thrones for him.
“I met my wife at this series, so he gave me my family and the further life," the actor says.
Rose played the Igrist, the object of the passion of the character of Keith John Snow in the fantastic series of Emma's rewards.
The couple noted the wedding in June 2018 in the family of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent of new cases
China announced 14 per cent increase in the number of its HIV and AIDS citizens.
According to health representatives, more than 820,000 people in the country have these diseases.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were registered.
In a humiliating majority of new cases of disease, genuinely transmitted, which indicates that the trends of the past had changed.
Traditionally, HIV was rapidly distributed in certain areas of China as a result of transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of HIV infections was almost zero, representatives of Chinese health at the Yunnan Province Conference stated.
The number of people with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 per year.
Transfer of HIV in gender is a sharp problem in China's LGBT communities.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but the LGBT discrimination was still widespread.
Research confirms that, due to the conservative values of the country, 70 to 90 per cent of men who have sexual contacts with men, women are eventually married.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is responsible for insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised the universal access to HIV drugs as part of the efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied information on the leak of information on the guilt of the Republican Party, complaining of the “dangerous lies” and “theories of conspiracy”
Member of the US Parliament, Maxine Waters, rejected the charges on Saturday that one of its staff had provided personal information to the three United States Republican Senators on the Vikipedia of Legislatives.
The Democrat from L.A. claims that the lawsuits were falsified by ultrasist experts and websites.
“Lye, lie and even more bad lies,” Waters stated in his Twitter.
It is reported that the publication includes the home addresses and numbers of United States Senators' phones.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person in the Capitol Hill during the hearing by the Senate Commission on Objections against Sexual Distress, which was construed against the candidate to the Supreme Court of Bretta Cavano.
The escape took place a while after three senators were interrogated by Cavano.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of messages was linked to the Watters office and published information on Watters staff, said Hill.
“This unfounded claim is absolutely false,” warns Waters.
“Article of my personnel, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised by these fraud acts, was none of the responsibility for the leakage of this information.
This unreasonable claim is a complete lie."
The Watters statement immediately criticised on the Internet, including by the former press secretary of the White House of Ari Flasher.
“This is angerous denial,” says Flasher.
"That means that the author has a temperament that is unsuitable for work in Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why be mad?
And you don't have to be excused either.
Neither should the prosecutors dig into the motives.
We must remain calm and cold."
Flasher seemed to compare Waters' response to the criticism of democrats against Judge Cavano, who was accused of being too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republicans who balloted for Waters at intermediate elections, also expressed his thoughts in Twitter.
"If it is true, it is very important," he writes.
The Watters states that her office warned “the authorities and law enforcement authorities of these frauds.
“We shall make sure that criminals are found,” she writes, “and that they should be legally responsible for all their actions that may be destructive and dangerous to all and every of my staff.”
Johnny Englez hits again — a weak parody on a spy of Rowen Atkinson
Today it has become a tradition of searching for the meaning of Brexit in any new film in which Britain is represented in any way; this is also the new parodial spy franchise agent Johnny English, which started in 2003 and continued in 2011 with a reload film “Agent Johnny English.”
Will the self-ironic painting of the leitmotive be "of course we're all shit" of a new national export attempt?
In any case, the profane of Johnny Englez with a guinea face received its right to chaos for the second time — the name of Johnny Englez clearly implies that it represents a wide-screen comic design designed for the non-English kinematographic audience.
The hero, of course, is a stupid secret agent, who, despite his fabulous claims to the glymour, received a little Clouseau, Mr. Bean's characteristics and a portion of this guy who brought one note to the Chariots of Fire in London in 2012 at the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
The character was originally created on the basis of the identity of the traveller and the mysterious “international” Atkinson, once played in a forgotten Barclaycard television advertisement, in which the hero remains a full chaos.
There is one or two pleasant moments in this latest issue.
I really liked the scene when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medium - century armor, and his helmets climb on his helmet.
Yes, it demonstrates the gift of Atkins to the physical performance of the comedial scenes, but the humor itself seems quite weak and strangely excessive, especially because such "serious" movies, such as "Agent 007" and "Mission incomplete" are now confidently offering a comedy as a element.
It feels like a humour is counted on children, not adults, and I feel that the impressive offences of Johnny Inglisha are not as inventive and suitable as Atkinson's balls in the movies of Mr. Bine.
The permanent messenger is now that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker broke into the supersecret British network, revealing the identity of all British agents in the field, to the horrors of the servant, Kevin Eldon, who was unfortunately an episode.
This is the latest drop for the Prime Minister, an intense and persistent figure that is already suffering from enormous political inpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible for the quazi-Tereza-May character, but there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since each active spy was compromised, she had to get someone out of retirement.
And here, Johnny Englez, who is currently a school teacher in a pont establishment, is also aware of the informal lessons of secret operational work: there are several good jokes, since England offers a spy academy in the "ro" style.
English returns to Whitehall for emergency instructions and reconnects with his former unavoidable friend Buff, who is also played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now a married man who obeys the commander of the submarine boat, the role of “happy hockey sticks” in which Vickey Pepperdin is a little lost.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game because her Majesty's secret service has made terrible mistakes, and they face a beautiful year-old Ofelia Bullet in fulfilment of Olga Kurillenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is in a dangerous way at the charms of a charming charming of a charming technological billionaire, which claims that the British computer problems can be solved — a creepy Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff start with their folks jokes: masked under waitress, they burn the French restaurant; they create chaos, smuggling themselves on a luxury boat of Volta; English produces a full anarchy, trying to use the virtual reality wardrobe to meet the inside of the Volta house.
All these scenes, of course, are a nice and disgusting idea, but there's something really childish in all of this.
Very moderate things.
And as with Johnny Inglish's other movies, I couldn't have thought, can the British movie industry not give Rowen Atkinson a really proportionate role to his talent?
Laborists deny that they are developing the British working week reduction plan to four days for the fifteen-day salary
The Layborist Party of Jeremy Corbina is going to consider a radical plan that will give the British four days a week, but the payment will be paid in five days.
The Party reportedly wishes the company's managers to give savings to workers as a result of the revolution in artificial intellectual intelligence, giving them an extra weekend.
This would allow staff to enjoy the same salary for the three-day weekends.
The sources reported that the idea was “incorporated” in the economic agenda of the party and would help the population to become a worker.
The trade union convention approved a four-day working week to enable employees to benefit from the economies of changing economies.
The high source of the Laborist Party said the Sunday Times: The policy revision is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
“This will not happen at the same time, but the four-day working week is our goal, which corresponds to the approach of the Party to change the balance of economies for workers and the common industrial strategy of the Party.”
The Layborist Party is not the first to support the idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its pre-electoral campaign in 2017.
However, this desire is currently not approved by the majority of the Laborist Party.
The representative of the Leiborist Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy or is not considered by a party.”
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a conference of layborists last week to concrete his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to eradicate the powers of " no-like directors" and "speculants" of communal companies.
The shadow candidate plans also mean that the current shareholders of watercanals may not regain their entire shares, as the layborist Government can "recover" on the basis of alleged offences.
He also reaffirmed the workshops of the company directors and the establishment of Funds for Inclusive Ownership Funds in order to transfer 10 per cent of the private sector capital to workers who will be able to receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds of sterling.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy are telling "60 minutes" whether the FBI investigation on Cavano can change their views
The FBI investigation of charges on Judge Brett Cavano delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Judge for at least a week and asked whether the findings of the Agency could encourage any of the Republican Senators to support Cavano.
In the interview shown on Sunday, the correspondent of the 60 minutes, Scott Pelly, interviewed the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham, whether the FBI could find anything that would make them change their views.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy replied.
“ When I went to the meeting, I said that I spoke to Judge Cavano.
I called him after it happened, the information came up, and I asked, ‘ Did you do it? ’
His response was decisive, definite and unanimous."
But Graham's opinion remained unacceptable in the vote.
“I have been firmly determined about Brett Cavano, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments that are comparable with the dynamite” he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but one thing I'm sure is, Brett denied all of this firmly," Graham added, in turning to Christine Blacey Ford.
“None of the people she called as witnesses could also confirm these facts.
This story has been 36 years ago.
And I have not noticed anything new in it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and did it do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, in New York, will take place in the Global Citizen Festival, a annual musical event in which an impressive star composition with a not less impressive mission — the end of poverty throughout the world.
For the seventh year in the World Citizens Festival as tens of thousands of people are gathering for a large loaf of the Central Park, but not only to enjoy the performance of Janette Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, as well as to tell about the current goal of the event: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Festival of World Citizens, which was opened in 2012, was the continuation of a global project to combat poverty, which was held by an international human rights group to hope to end poverty, increasing the number of people who have actively fought it.
To get a free ticket for the event (if you are not ready to pay for VIP tickets), you had to participate in voluntary activities or send an email to the world leader, make a phone call or perform any other or other significant action to help raise awareness of your goal to end poverty.
But how successful has the festival of citizens of the world for 12 years in order to achieve its goal?
Is it the idea of a free visit to the concert to convince the constituents to call for action, or is it just another case of so-calctivism called “clictivity” when people believe that they make real changes by signing online petition or sending messages on Twitter?
Global Citizen organizers claim that more than 19 million “actions” have been registered in the festival since 2011, carried out by its participants who have pursued a variety of different goals.
It is recalled that the world leaders had promised to allocate funds for more than $37 billion, which should affect the life of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group had reported 390 commitments and declarations made by its action, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
According to the group, the funds provided direct assistance to almost 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most important commitments is the name of the Power of Nutrition: the British partnership of investors and investors and experts committed to “help their children fully to disclose their capacities”, promised Rwanda to provide 35 million dollars to help to end the district malnutrition. This was done after the receipt of more than 4700 Twitters from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the Government of Great Britain, donors, national governments and Global Citizens such as you, we can make social injustice regarding the lack of food of past history”, said Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracy Ullman during a live concert in London, held in April 2018.
The Panel also stated that after more than 5000 actions have been taken calling for the Great Britain to improve food for mothers and children, the Government announced the financing of the “Feed Force” project, which will cover 5 million women and children through activities to improve their nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival website: “Why do you think we can end with extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen’s organizers answer: “It will be a long and difficult way to spot and fall from time to time.
But as in the major movements of the fight against civil rights and against the apartheid, we will be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardie B, Janel Mone -- here are some of the artists that will play this year in New York, and his leaders will be Deborra Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
US can use the marine fleet to prevent the export of Russian energy: the Minister for Interior
The U.S. Minister Ryan Zinke stated that Washington could “as necessary” escape its maritime fleet to prevent the impact of Russian energymen on the market, including in the Middle East.
Zinke claims that the presence of Russia in Syria, especially where it acts on the invitation of the legitimate Government, is a suggestion for the study of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy as they do in Eastern Europe in southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are certain ways and means to address this problem.
“United States together with our fleet have the opportunity to ensure the openness of marine roads and, if necessary, the blockade to prevent their energy from entering the market”, said the Minister.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-commercial group, which is positioned as “the voice of energy consumer” in the United States.
He further compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually equal.
“Economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less effective in the use and replacement of fuel”, said the Minister, calling Russia “pony with one trick”, whose economy depends on the fuel that is dignified.
The statements were made because the Trampa administration had a task to increase its burned natural gas exports to Europe, replaceing Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the officials of Tramp's administration, including the US President himself, are trying to convince Germany to step out of the “inappropriate” project of the North Stream-2, which, according to Trampa, has made Berlin a “container” of Moscow.
In Moscow, it was repeatedly emphasized that the Northern Stream-2 project was worth 11 billion dollars, which should double the existing circuit skills up to 110 billion cubic metres, was a clean economic project.
Kreml claims that Washington's irregular resistance is due to economic reasons and is an example of inadequate competition.
“I emphasize that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to select suppliers”, said the Minister of Energy of Russia Alexander Novak after meeting the US Minister for Energy, Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States has caused a negative response to Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists in the face of the Federation of German industry (BDI) called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"When the third State interferes with our energy supply, it creates a serious problem," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after the recent meeting of the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator from the state of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine the possibilities of balloting for the President in 2020
The Senator of the state of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that it would be careful to examine the possibilities for the presidential post after the intermediate elections.
At the urban thought meeting in Hollioke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that it would consider participation in the pre-electoral race.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and "fix" our broken government, and that's what a woman needs upstairs," says Warren The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take careful consideration of the possibility of a presidential ballot."
Warren thus appreciated the activities of President Donald Tramp during the meeting: “The district is leading in the wrong direction”.
"I'm concerned about what Donald Tramp does to our democracy," she said.
Warren is an open criticism of both Tramp and his candidate for the position of Supreme Judge Brett Cavano.
In his Twitter on Friday Warren, she wrote: “Of course, we need to investigate the FBI before we vote.”
However, a study published on Thursday showed that most Warren's voters do not think that it should be voted in 2020.
According to the survey of the Centre for Political Research of the University of Saffolk/Boston Globe, fifty-eight per cent of the "probably" voters of Massachusetts stated that the senator should not ballot.
Thirty-two per cent of the respondents, on the contrary, supported its plans.
The survey showed that the population had more support for the former Governor of Deal Patrick: 38 per cent supported its possible participation in elections and 48 per cent opposed.
Other known names of democrats discussed in 2020, including the former Vice-President Joe Byden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden claims that he would take an official decision on January, said the Associated Press.
Sarah Paylin told the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Paylin at the meeting with the voters of Donald Tramp
Track Paylin, 26, joined the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
“My son, who returned home, is now experiencing the same experience as members of other families experienced the consequences of PTSR and injuries, and our soldiers are returning with injuries," she said at the meeting with Donald Tramp in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Paleen called him “the blade in the eye” and said about her son and other veterans of war: “They are already returning to other, scattered, asking, and whether their companions, soldiers, flyers and any other military they have shown their country the same respect.”
Track Paylin was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and was accused of domestic violence against a woman, interfering with violence and arms storage in alcoholic opium, according to Dan Bennett, representative of the Vasilla police department.
18 states, Colombia County, support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the district of Colombia support the legal dispute of the new U.S. policy, which prohibits the asylum of victims of refuge or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, the representatives of 18 states and district submitted analytical note from the Tribunal Consultant on the support of the asylum seeker.
The full name of the claimant, Grace v. Sessions, issued by the American Union of Civil Freedoms in August against Federal Policy, is not declared.
The woman claims that her civilian husband, “and his sons in a criminal group”, had been subjected to ill-treatment, but the US officials rejected her request for asylum on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
Attorneys supporting Grace say that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have made a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as countries faced with widespread criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy abolished the decision adopted by the Immigrant Appeals Council in 2014, which allowed immigrants without documents rescued from domestic violence to file a asylum.
The General Prosecutor of Colombia, Carl Rasin, stated in his statement on Friday that the new policy “is ignoring the decades of the application of public, federal and international law”.
“The Federal Law requires that all asylum applications be considered on the basis of concrete facts and circumstances of the claim, and that prohibition violate this principle”, states the judge's report.
Advocates also argue that immigrants are not allowed to enter into the economy, emphasizing that this category of citizens is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provides the necessary workforce”.
In June, the General Prosecutor Jeff Seshnes ordered immigration judges not to asylum to victims rescued from domestic or gang violence.
“The asylum will be provided to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or by political beliefs,” Sashance said in his statement dated 11 June.
This instrument has never been designed to address absolutely all problems, even the most serious problems people faced every day in the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Palo: the number of deaths is doubled in search for survivors
The situation has become increasingly difficult for survivors.
“Now it's very difficult,” said 35-year-old Reese Cussum, who comforted her sick child in the evacuation center of the destruction of the city of Palo.
"Each minute, an ambulance brings the wounded.
Clean water in a large deficit."
The inhabitants return to their destroyed homes, dig into wet things and try to save everything they can find.
hundreds of people have been wounded, and hospitals affected by the earthquake of 7.5 are overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Harris, who had broken the spine and shoulder, were rested at the army hospital of Palo, where patients were treated openly because they had to leave the room because of the continuing strong pressures.
He cried, remembering how a strong earthquake destroyed the hotel room on the fifth floor that he took off with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for salvation.
I think I was stuck in the shaft of the wall, ” says Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family arrived in the city for the wedding.
“ I heard my wife screaming, asking for help, and then the silence came.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they have saved and are all right now."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “the attacks” carried out through “propaganda advertising”
A week after one of the official Chinese newspapers published a daily American publication of the advertising on four pages describeing the mutual benefits of the United States and China, US Ambassador in China accused Peking of the use of the US press for promoting propaganda.
The President of the United States, Donald Tramp, last Wednesday, referred to the pay supplement of Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper issue of Iowa, to charge China with attempts to interfere with the United States Congress elections on 6 November.
Tramp's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere with the elections in the United States is confirming the fact that officials of the United States have informed the Reuters Agency: a new stage in the Washington's increasing pressure campaign is coming.
While foreign governments are the rule to place a commercial advertisement, Beijing and Washington are now in the state of trade war escalation, which is the result of which they equipped the tariffs to import their countries.
China's accountable tariffs at the beginning of the trade war had the task of affecting exporters in States like Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trampa, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador in China and former long-term Governor of Iowa, the large exporter of agricultural products to China, claims that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and business.
China, stated by Branstad in the article published in the Sunday Journal of Des Moines Register, “as now doubles this trauma by placing propaganda advertising in our own free press”.
“In dissemination of its propaganda, the Government of China enjoys the expensive American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, paying and posting advertising in Des Moines Register,” says Branstad.
"As in the newspaper kiosk here, in the streets of Beijing, you will hardly hear the different voices and you will not see the true diversity of views that the Chinese could learn from the worries of China's economic policy, since local media are under strict control of the Communist Party of China," he writes.
He also added that one of the most famous Chinese newspapers had been “familiarly baptized” from the proposal to publish its article, although it did not provide a precise name of the publication.
Analysts warn that the Republicans disturb the election women before the intermediate period
Many high-level Republicans prefer to stay side and defend the candidate of Supreme Judge Brett Cavano, despite several statements of sexual violence, and analysts warn that there is a negative response, especially by women that may affect the forthcoming interim elections.
The emotions around this situation have gone to extreme, and most Republicans have officially stated that they want to continue voting.
There is no way to return to such things afterwards, ” says Grant Rier, professor of Politology at Maxwell's School at the University of Syracuse, in his article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that the attempts of senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to investigate the FBI in the last minute would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, and they will not forget it tomorrow or in November”, said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the MoveOn Group to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters scanded “November ahead!” against the Senate, when the Republicans who control the Court of Justice decided to provoke Cavanaugh, despite the statements of Dr. Christine Blacey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will come beyond the limits”, stated on the news site the non-party politologist Stu Rotenberg.
“People say that the situation has already been accumulated enough, and it is true.
However, everything may become worse, especially in the predecessions and young voters, from 18 to 29 years, which, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford publicly testified against the candidate of the Supreme Court of Justice, accusing him of sexual harassment, the analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirm the movement, this step could cause a reaction.
"It is already a mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of the last week, reports NBC News.
“It is not only a vote in the committee or final vote, or whether Cavano sat on a chamber of accused, but also on how the Republicans deal with it,” said Guy Cesil, director of Priorities of the United States, a group that helps choosing democrats, a news channel.
Nevertheless, the Americans seemed to be a little divided on the question of whom to trust — Ford or Cavano, and they are slightly more inclined toward the last.
The new YouGov survey showed that 41 per cent of the respondents believed to Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said that they believed Cavano exactly or probably.
Furthermore, 38 per cent believed that Cavano had probably lied during his testimony, while 30 per cent had said the same about Ford.
Flake Flake is currently investigating the charges of Ford and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports the Guardian.
Last week, Ford, under the oath, witnessed at the Senatu Legal Committee that Cavano, in a state of drunkness, attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Judge showed her genitalia at the party during the Yale University in the 1980s.
The World Suite inventor plans to start a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Suite, launchs a startup that pretends to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technological legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open platform Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people to provide access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company Berners-Lee, the purpose of Inrupt was to obtain “the peaceful domination”.
"We must do this now," he says about his startup.
"It is a historical moment."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own online data storages.
It may contain lists of contacts, cases and calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools for data work.
The application is working on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify — everything can be used in the same browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal online data storage is that it is fully managed by a user who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “personal enlargement of rights and opportunities through data”.
According to the Director-General of John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company has provided resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several national developers with which the project contract was concluded and the volunteer community.
Since this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners Lee said that he and his team did not negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether his company should make cardinal changes, which made all their business models completely change into the same hour.
"We do not ask them permission."
In his post on the Medium published on Saturday, Berners Lee wrote that “the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid”.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusett Technology Institute.
In recent months, Berners-Lee's voice sounded quite influenced in the network's net neutrality debate.
Even by launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Fund and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet," says Berners Lee.
Bernard Van: A churchman rewarded by Victoria's cross during World War I
In the history of the Church of England, only one priest warrior was rewarded by Victoria's cross during World War I, and this event was observed in his home city 100 years later.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Wann was rewarded on 29 September 1918 for taking part in the attack on Belenglis and Löukur.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had received the highest British military prize.
The monument on the occasion was feastfully presented by two grandchildren at the parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “very symbolic” that the monument was opened 100 years after his grandfather received the reward.
According to the London newspaper of 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann conducted his battalion through the San Canten channel “in a very thick fog and under a strong fire of field weapons and guns”.
Later, he threw himself on the line of fire and led the group forward with “the greatest courage ” and then dropped the field gun with one hand, beating the three soldiers.
Colonel Wann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, a little more than a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old hero, Michael Wann, said that “he could hardly do the same heroic thing, but that is reassuring.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Wann, also put a vein on the end of the parade led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Vann said that “he had a great honour to participate in the parade” and added that“ the goodness of a true hero was confirmed by support that would be provided by many people.”
The MMA worshipers didn't sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but instead showed them Peppu's pig.
Imagine that you haven't slept all night to see the full Bellator 206, but you didn't see the main event.
The San José table contained 13 battles, including six main programmes fights, were transmitted all night in direct air on 5 channels of the British TV.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mussasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for a meeting, the British folks were shocked at the "Pep's Pig" screens.
Some cheerleaders weren't impressed because they weren't sleeping until the morning just to see the battles.
One of the Twitter fans called this change in the talk of the child's painting “some painful joke”.
“The State decision was made that this containment was inappropriate for 6 hours in the morning, so they had to switch into child programmes”, said Dave Schwartz, senior Vice-President Bellator on Marketing and Communications, when he was asked why this happened.
"Yes, "Pep's pig."
The President of Bellator Scott Cocker said that they planned to set up a schedule in a way that the battles could also be seen in the future in Britain.
"When it comes to a new show, I think we can solve this issue," said Coker.
“But there is Sunday, six hours in the morning, and we cannot solve this question until Sunday at our time, and it will be Monday for them.
But we'll make the maximum effort.
Trust me, when the broadcast was changed, there was a bunch of text messages, and all of them had no friendly nature.
We tried to solve this problem immediately, thought it was some kind of technical failure.
It turns out not, it was a matter of public importance.
I promise that next time that's not gonna happen.
We're going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans we're trying to increase this quantity, but it's overcome.
Yes, it didn't work well."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily experienced a sense of independence because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic Duber Tom Daily says he grew up feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old sportsman said that he had not understood that “not everyone like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking in the first program of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, which Lauren Lavern led, he said that he spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that the victory in the Olympiade became less concerned after he had a child.
The Permanent Multi-year Show of Kirstie Yang took a few months leave because of the disease.
Dailey, who served as a chief guest in the Lavern programme, said that he felt “wilder than any of his peers” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society both for boys and girls.
He explains: “To date, these feelings of inappropriateness and incompatibility were quite real, but they gave me strength, and I was able to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove that he was “so something” so that he would not disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
The two-fold bronze olympic medalist became a known LGBT activist and at his talk at the Association Games in Australia this year called on countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said that he expressed his view because he was lucky to live an open life without consequences and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that the feelings for a man, the American director, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, were “amazed”.
Last year Daily married the Oscar Laureate, who was 20 years older than him, but claims that the age difference was never a problem.
“If all this is happening in your life in such a young age, ” he went to his first Olympiada, aged 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, it is hard to find a peer who would have the same cardially opposite experience of life.
The couple became parents in June, and their son, Robert Ray Black Daily, was born, and Daley said that “all of his world understanding” had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would be all about "I need a gold medal," said the sportsman.
"But you know, there are things and more important gold olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years of cancer.
Daily said that his father did not want to deal with his death, and one of his latest requests was tickets to the first row of London 2012.
"I couldn't say to him, "Papa, you're no longer there, and you can't sit there in the first row," says Daily.
"I held him for my hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing, I finally realized that he was not invincible," said the sportsman.
Next year Daily participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I dreamed of all my life — to dive in front of the crowds of the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired him to choose the first favorite song — the proud by Heather Small — that helped him prepare for the Olympiade, and he still liked it so much.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 in English summer time.
Michaelson, who was not in the form, held the Rider Cube on the camp on Saturday.
The American Phil Michelson will set up a record on Sunday, playing his 47th Rider Cube, but he's gonna have to push the shape to avoid the unpleasant hatch.
Michaelson, who played the biennale on the record 12th time, was sent by Captain Jim Fürick to the chamber on Saturday for four balls and four balls.
Instead of being in the centre of events, as often happened in the United States, the five-fold major winner shared his day between monitoring the game and the work of his own game in the field in hope to correct what is concerned.
Never without the directest strike, even on his 48-year-old athlete is not the perfect candidate for the Le Golf National Road, where the long raff usually punishes incorrect strikes.
And if the course itself is not enough scary, Michaelson will meet the exact British Open Francesco Molinari champion on Sunday at the ninth match, who joined Tommy Flitwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who lost four points in the 12s lonely matches make a big start, Michaelson's match might be decisive.
Ferrick expressed confidence in his partner, although what else he could say.
“He fully understood the role that he was put on him today, he hugged me in his back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” commented Ferrick.
"He's pretty confident in himself.
He is the walking Hall of glory, and he has done so much for these commands in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two matches.
I was hoping for more, but it was, and that's how we decided to go.
He wants to be there, together with all."
On Sunday, Michaelson will beat Nick Faldo's record on the number of matches in the Rider Cube.
This could mark the end of the career in the Rider Cube, which never corresponded to the heights of its individual record.
Michelson has 18 victories, 20 injuries and seven people, although Ferrick said that his presence benefited the team.
"He's a funny, sarcastic, discreet, he likes to appoint people, and he's a great guy with whom it is interesting," he explained.
“I think this week the young players had fun with him, and it was interesting to see it.
His game is much more than just a game."
The captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that the great advantage may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, has experienced that significant leadership at the lonely level in the Rider Cube can easily turn into a disadvantaged side.
The Danish debutted in the 1997 match in Walderram, where the team headed by Northan Ballesteros had the advantage of five points over the Americans, but overwhelmed the final line only a little ahead with the least difference, winning with an account of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You continue to remind ourselves that we had a great advantage in Walderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Walderram where we won, but only yet," said Bjorn, sealed on the photograph, after reviewing the Class of 2018, by winning the Le Golf National field on both Friday and yesterday, which gave the account of 10-6.
So the story will prove to me and the whole team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow, you'll be full.
Go and do it right.
Until the glasses are set on the table, nothing is done.
We have a goal, and that's the chance to win the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I said not silent, focusing on 12 players of our team, but we do well know that we are against the greatest players of the world."
The satisfactory of how his players performed in an uncomfortable golf field for them, Bjorn added: “I would never have overcome myself in this.
We've got another test tomorrow.
Tomorrow, individual talks start, and this is a whole different case.
It's always nice to be close to a partner when things go well, but when you're alone, you're testing all your professional golfist powers.
That's what the players need to think about tomorrow.
The partner is now behind, and he should also make all its efforts."
Unlike Bjorn, his competitor, Jim Ferrick, believes that his players will act better individually than with partners, except Jordan Speath and Justin Thomas, who took three points from four.
Ferrick himself went through all this carusel of the last days, being part of a victory team in Brooklyn, before to lose the final time Europe spent the Wonder in Medina.
"I remember every damn word about it," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, joined his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to finish this as in Brooklyn as in Medina.
When the initiative moves in one direction, it is a major pressure on the game in the middle.
We have built our game plan accordingly and set up the boys as we thought to be right, you know? tomorrow we will try to create a miracle."
Thomas was given an assignment to try to lead the resistance by meeting Rory Macilroe at the top game with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Iyan Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament table.
"I have chosen a group of boys like this, and in this order, because I believe that they will cover all possible shortcomings," said Bjorn, commenting on their choice of individual players.
Introduction of a new military ship of Germany has been renewed
The latest fregate of the German fleet was to be invoked in 2014 to replace the older military ships of the Cold War, but this would not occur at least next year because of incorrect systems and lavino-like cost growth, reports local media.
Introduction to the operation of Reinland-Pfaltz, the main ship of the totally new fregates of Buden-Vurtemberg class, is now deferred to the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit with reference to a military representative.
The ship had to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that occurred after delivery had complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
Four ships of Buden-Vurtemberg class, ordered by the Marine Marine Flood in 2007, will be replaced by the older fregates of the Bremen class.
As far as it is known, they will have a powerful rifle, a variety of zienic and anti-carbon missiles, as well as some Stels technology, such as reduced radiolocation, infrared and acustical signs.
Other important features include longer service periods — the possibility of deploying the latest fregates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the continuous deferration of the introduction to the operation means that the most modern military ships that are said to allow Germany to spread their powers outside the country are already overwhelming until they enter arms, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 accidental fregate has reached the news titles last year when the German marine fleet officially denied the introduction of the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss portfolio in Hamburg.
This was the first case when the fleet returned the ship to the ship after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for return, but the German media referred to a number of critical “programme and hardware defects” that made the military ship useless.
Software deficiencies were particularly critical because the Baden-Vurtemberg class courts would be exploited by a crew of approximately 120 seamen — only half of the workforce on the old fregates of the Bremen class.
Furthermore, it was found that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its productivity and limited the ability of the WMF to implement updates in the future.
It is considered that the 7000-tonne Reinland-Pfaltz is twice the harder ships of the same class that were used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the incorrect equipment, the cost of the project, including the training of the team, is also a problem.
It was said that it had achieved an incredible EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) compared to the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of retention at the corridor of the latest fregates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of Germany's maritime power.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, admitted that the military forces are actually “continuing the stock of ships capable of deployment”.
The official said that the problem had elaborated with time because the old ships were expelled from operation, but they had not been placed to replace them.
He visited that none of the Baden-Wurthamberg class fregates could ever be taken to arms by the fleet.
National Trust listens to the secret life of flying mouses
A new study conducted in one of the places of the Scotland Mountain has the task of showing how smooth mouses use landscapes to look for food.
It should be hoped that the data received would allow new consideration of the behavior of unique winged sycerers and to help further work to maintain the species.
Study organized by Scientists of the National Fund of Scotland will be studied by ordinary netopyres, soprano netopyrs, and brown long-style flying mouses and nights of Dobanton, inhabitants of Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special registrators will be established in some places around the place to monitor the action of flying mouses throughout the season.
The NHS and volunteers will also carry out mobile field surveys using manual detectors.
The expert audio analysis of all records will determine the frequency of screaming, as well as the types of activities responsible for various groups of these animals.
The map of the living environment will then be drawn up and a report will be prepared to create a detailed picture of their behavior as a landscape.
Rob Duar, a NTS Adviser for Nature Conservation, hopes that these results will show the most important places of living for flying mouses and how they are used by each type.
This information will help to identify the main areas of the management of the living environment, such as the formation of lungs, as well as how to maintain forest massive state, optimum for flying mouses and other related species.
The population of flying mouses in Scotland and all over Britain has been significantly reduced in the last century.
They are under threat of disappearance because of construction and girlship work that affects their residentship and the loss of the environment.
Veterinary turbines and lighting installations may be dangerous, as well as flying tape, chemical processing of construction materials and hunting home cats.
In fact, the flying mouses are not blind.
However, their night hunting habits are so useful that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching.
They use a complex echo-location technique to define the obstacles in the flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of the earth throughout the country, is very serious about the population of flying mouses.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, travel checks and sometimes rescue work.
The organization even created the first and only reservation of flying mouses in the Threave Area in Damfris and Hallowee, where eight of the ten types of Scottish flying mouses live.
The real estate manager David Thompson said that property was a perfect territory for them.
"There, in Threave, is a great place for flying mouses," he says.
“There are old buildings, many old trees and all the elements of the good environment.
But much about flying mouses remains unknown, so the work we are doing here and in other places will help us better understand what they need to make for a safe existence.”
It recalls the importance of verifying the existence of flying mouses before carrying out technical services within private property, since unintended destruction of one nest can lead to death to 400 females and young persons, and perhaps even to destroy the entire local population.
Flying mouses are protected by law, their destruction, trawling or destruction of their residential places is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scotland's Foundation for the Storage of Flying Mice, calls on the public to help.
She says: “We have a lot to learn about our flying mouses, and we just don't know how many individual species live.”
Ronaldu denys the charges of rape, and his lawyers are going to court the German magazine
Cristian Ronald denies the charges against him for rape, calling them “fake news”, and claiming that people simply want to “propapier” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German News Journal of Spigel, issued accusations against a footballist.
The Forward of Portugal and Yuventus was accused of rape by a American woman named Catherine Mayorga, who was probably in the hotel room for Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, said Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in the Instagram video, in which 142 million subscribers had 142 million subscribers, a few hours after the complaint report, the 33-year-old Ronald called this information "fake news " .
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is all the fairy news," says the five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or on the camera.
“They just want to get out of my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous, saying my name, but it's just part of their work.
I am a happy person, and I'm fine,” adds a smiling sportsman.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue the Spiegel for the charges they called “inadmissible information on confidentiality suspicions”, according to Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Sherc stated that the player intends to require compensation for “moral damage to the severity of legal violations, which is likely one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
It is argued that the alleged incident occurred in the hotel Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
Meeting at the nightclub, Ronald and Mayorg seemed to have returned to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her in analogue form, according to the documents submitted in the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronald fell on her knees and told her that he was a “99% good guy, but he had fallen by one per cent”.
The documents claim that Ronald confirmed that a couple had sex, but that was on both consents.
Mayorga also claims that she had turned to the police and the hospital had taken pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement, because she felt “the fear of revenge” and was afraid of public humiliation.
A 34-year-old woman said that she was trying to change the place of residence, as she continued to experience traumatic feelings resulting from the alleged incident.
Ronald was going to join the Real Madrid from Manchester United during the expected attack, but this summer he moved to the Italian Giants of Yuve in a 100m euro agreement.
Brexit: Great Britain “regrets the autoproducers lost forever”
The Business and Entrepreneurship Minister Greg Clark stated that Britain would “regret it forever” if after Brexit lost its status of a world leader in the field of car production.
He also commented on the fact that Toyota UK reported BBC that, if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernastone, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese autoproducer stated that the effects of delays on the border in the absence of the Brexit contract could result in the loss of jobs.
Toyota Auris and Avensis was produced in Bernastone and released nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 per cent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernastone.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concerns about the EU's exit without an international trade agreement, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, states that Mini's production factory in Oxford will be closed within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to the manufacturers, the Brexit supply chain will be highly risked in the absence of contracts.
The Toyota's production line is launched "right in time" and the details for the vehicles made for order are delivered to British and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If 29 March of the United Kingdom leaves the EU without a deal, there may be collapse on the border which, according to the representatives of the industry, can lead to delays and lack of particles.
According to the company, Toyota would not be able to store stocks in its factory in Derbishire for more than one day and therefore the production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that the Teresa May plan in Checkers on future relations with the EU was “calibrated in order to avoid these verifications on the border”.
“We need a deal, and we want to conclude a better agreement that will allow, repeat, not only to achieve success in the present, but also to use this opportunity in the future,” he said in the broadcast of the BBC Radio 4, “Day”.
“Not only Toyota but also other producers argue that we should be absolutely able to continue successful supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to clarify the duration of the production, but in a longer-term perspective, she warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and, eventually, would result in reducing jobs.
Peter Cuvallaris, who has worked in Bernastone for 24 years, says that the concerns of the members of the organization are increasing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we can't get them back.”
The representative of the Government said: “We have developed a precise and reliable plan of our future relations with the EU.”
Tramp meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, on the information of the White House
The responsible meeting of Donald Tramp with the Deputy Prosecutor-General, Rod Rosenstein, could be " transferred to another week", as the fight for Brett Cavano for the Supreme Court of Justice continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is the chief of the work of a special advisor Robert Muller, investigating Russia ' s involvement in elections, links between Trampa and Russia and potential obstacles to justice by the President.
If Tramp quit the Deputy General Prosecutor's position, he has threatened Muller's independence, in Washington has been a number of guesses for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the use of a tube to record Tramp talks and the possibility of the President's impichment by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein objects to this information.
However, on Monday, he probably went to the White House to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Tramp was announced on Thursday, which was then at the United Nations in New York.
Tramp said that he would not prefer to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid conflicts with the Senate Court Committee, on which Cavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blacey Ford, were testifying.
On Friday, Tramp ordered a weekly investigation of the FBI complaints in Cavano, which further delayed the full vote in the Senate.
Press Secretary Trampa, Sarah Sanders, spoke to Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of this meeting has not yet been appointed, possibly this week, but it may be delayed for another week, taking into account all other events in the Supreme Court.”
But we will see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed."
Some journalists contested this claim: Sanders did not conduct briefings in the White House since 10 September.
The leading Chris Wallace wondered why.
Sanders said that the absence of briefings was not caused by “regard to the community” of television journalists, although she added:“I will not deny that they play public.”
It proposed to increase the number of direct contacts between Tramp and the press.
“The President holds more meetings, answering journalists than any other president before it,” she added, but without the exact figures, “We have these numbers”.
Sanders assured that the briefings will continue to go, but “if the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, it is much better than to talk to me”.
We try to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we have spent in the last few weeks, and if you can speak directly with the President of the United States, this is a worthy replacement of press briefings."
Tramp regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, participating in open meetings or press conferences with high-level persons.
The press conference is very rare.
The frevolent, and sometimes the strange behavior of the president against the gathered journalists this week in New York may be the answer why.
The Minister for Health addresses the workers of the EU in Scotland with a letter on the concerns of Brexit
The Minister for Health asked EU staff working in Scotland to express his appreciation from the name of the country and wish them to remain at their posts after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, SME, addressed this letter to staff less than six months before the exit of Britain from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already undertaken to cover the value of a statement of status for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman said: “The negotiations between Britain and the EU continued on the issue of exit, and that autumn must be a expected solution.
However, the Government of Great Britain has also strengthened the preparation for a possible scenario with no contracts.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
So now I want to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff, regardless of its nationality.
Colleagues from all of the EU and outside have a valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombi carried an emergency operation on head trauma
Michael The Tennessee Authority reported that the Tennessee State Tigers semi-protector Christian Abercromby carried out an emergency operation by getting a head trauma on Saturday after the defeat of 31-27 in a game with Vanderbilt Commodores.
The Chief Coach of Tennessee Rod Reed announced to journalists that the injury was received shortly before the break.
“ He went to the sideline and just fell there, ” said Reid.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombi oxygen on a sideline before putting it on their noses and medical surveys.
The official of the Tennessee state told Chris Harris from WSMV, Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombi was operational in Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that “without details on type/degree of injury”, and in Tennessee, they are trying to find out when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombi, only on second course, it was the first season in Tennessee State after the relocation of Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully captured five balls, which amounted to 18 balls per season.

The increased herb collection will be taken from those who do not pay the tax in Britain
The penalty expects it to gather up to 120 million pounds per year for homeless
Foreign customers will be collected by a higher herb collection in the purchase of real estate in Great Britain, and additional funds will be used to help homeless people, today Teresa May will announce.
This step would no longer result in the Corbin's attempts to attract young voters who promised to make the housing more accessible and to increase citizens' income.
The increase in herb collection will be taken from physical persons and companies not paying taxes in Britain, and the additional funds provided thus should stimulate Government efforts to assist homeless citizens.
The supplementary to the existing herb collection, including an increase introduced two years ago in acquisition of secondary housing and rental housing, may be up to three per cent.
The penalty expects that this step will allow up to 120 million sterling pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the new London real estate are not purchased by British inhabitants, leading to price growth and complicating the objective of buyers who acquire their first housing to improve their housing conditions.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “grounds of ghosts” because of a large number of foreign buyers who have spent most of their time here outside the country.
A new policy was developed several weeks later after Boris Johnson called on to reduce the herb collection to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction firms of acquiring real estate prices, but in fact not using them, and called on Ms. May to give up quotas to available housing in order to correct the “happiness of housing” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include rent control and cease unfounded expulsion.
He also wished to give local self-government authorities more powers to build new homes.
Ms. May said: “Latest year I said that I devoted my prime ministership to the fulfillment of the British dream to make life better with every new generation.
This, inter alia, means a solution to our housing market.
Britain will always be open for people who want to live, work and build life here.
Nevertheless, it is unfair that the acquisition of real estate is as accessible to non-English citizens and foreign companies as well as to employees.
For too many, the dream of acquiring their own home has become too far, and the threat to some to get out of the street is too real.
Jack Ross: “My final goal is to manage Scotland”
The boss of the Sunderland Club, Jack Ross, said that his “final goal” was to become a Scotland manager at a certain stage.
The 42-year-old Scotch enjoys the restoration of the North-Eastern Club, which is currently third in the first league separated from the first three points.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after returning St. Mirren to Scotland Premier League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a hat B and all," said Ross Sportsound BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up when I was a child, watching my father behind Scotland in Hampden, and that always attracted me back.
However, this will only be possible if I can become a successful club manager."
Ross' predecessors, the Sunderland managers were also Dick Lawyers, David Moyes, Sam Allardyes, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keen, Gus Poith and Paulo Di Kanio.
Former director Alloa Athletic said he had not been thrilling before such credible names in such large clubs, renouncing Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals earlier.
"For me, success will depend on whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
The club is certainly part of the Prime League, according to its structure and opportunities," said the coach.
“To bring him there is a difficult task, but I will believe that I have done my job only if I can bring the club back.”
Ross has only been working for the manager for three years, first associate in Dumbarton, then spent 15 months in the Hearts Training Headquarters.
He then helped Alloa get up from the third level, and in the next season he led St Mirren from the lower positions to the winner of the championship.
Ross claims that today he feels more comfortable than ever during his game career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real cross," he recalled his responsibility for Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that the management was more suitable than a game.
That sounds strange because I did everything well, made good money in that position and made some success.
But the game is harder.
There are many things to be done every week.
I still feel stressed at work, but I feel good at the manager's position.
I always wanted to lead, and now, doing this, I feel as comfortable as a fish in the water throughout my adult life."

According to the survey, 17:30 is the perfect time for the beer pint
The summer heat has led to strengthening the sale of British pubs, but reduced sales in restaurants networks.
According to statistics, the sales in pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7 per cent and the restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from CGA's business consulting company, who received this statistics, said: “The continuous solar activity and more than it was expected, the participation of England in the world's championship means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when sales in pubs increased by 2.8 per cent, and in restaurants, on the contrary, significantly reduced”.
The June income declined by 1.8 per cent in the restaurant trade has also continued in July.
Pabs and bars selling alcohol have shown much higher results in restaurants.
The bars selling only food also suffered the sun’s heat, although not as much as the restaurants.
There is a feeling that people want to jump out of the street only to miss a glass.
Sales of drinks in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while foods were 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, a RSM analyst in the area of dust and hotel business, said: “These results continue the trend we see from the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sports activities remain critical when it comes to sales in an inherent market.
It is not surprising that restaurant networks continue to experience difficulties, even more that sales by 4.8 per cent in the annual calculation will be particularly painful because of the continuing price pressure.
The long hot summer has been as far as ever possible for food operators, and not yet the fact that august, a more moderate temperature, will give so much rest.”
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the newly open, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown of brands.
Industrial sales monitoring of Coffer Peach Tracker on the British Pabs, Bars and Restaurants collects and analyses data on the productivity of 47 networks with a total traffic of more than 9 billion pounds of sterlings and is a recognised growing shelter.
Every fifth child has secret accounts in social networks that he hides from his parents.
According to the survey, each fifth child — some of them only 11 — has secret accounts in social networks that he hides from parents and teachers.
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the growth of the pages of the Fake Insta.
This news has strengthened concerns about the content of sexual nature
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "base" account known by their parents.
However, every fifth child, some of them only 11 years, creates accounts in social networks that he hides from adults.
The survey of 20,000 students in high schools has shown a rapid increase in the number of "insty" fee accounts, i.e. Instagram, photo exchange site.
This news has strengthened concerns about the publications of sexual nature.
Twenty per cent of the students claimed that they had a basic, "clean" account to which their parents had access but also had secret accounts.
One mother, who randomly received access to her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, ran into a teenager who called on others to “force him”.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of independent school directors (HMC) showed that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 years of age have two profiles in social networks, and half of them recognized that one of them was generally secret.
HMC chapter Mike Buchanan says: “Mnogy teenagers seek to create online spaces that are not available to their parents and teachers, and this is an alarming fact.”
Alyd Doyle will become a Sportsman's voice of the Scottish Light Athletic
At the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body, Eilid Doyle was elected as director of the Scottish Light Athletic as a observer of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most pronounced Scotland sportsman in light athletics. President Yan Beatty claims that this step is a great opportunity for those who run sports, to take advantage of the extensive experience of international sportsmen in the past decade.
“Aylid has great respect in the Scotland, British and World Light Athletic community, and we are sure that its participation will bring a light athlete in Scotland great benefits,” said Bitty.
Doyle says: “I strive to become a voice of sportsmen, and I hope that I can actually contribute to the promotion of sports in Scotland.”
The American who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Games in Atlanta has four gold Olympic medals in general, and now works as a serial commentator on BBC, and has lost his ability to walk after the stroke transferred.
He writes in his Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I lost my ability to move.
The doctors said that only time would show me if I was well, and if I did, to what extent.
It was an exhaustive work, but I was fully healed, I learned to walk again, and today I exercise my skill!
Thank you very much for your support!"
The milk sugar advertisement that compared feeding mothers to cows shared the views of Internet users
The milk supplies company has caused disputes on the Internet by publishing a advertising in which feeding mothers are compared to breeding cows.
Publishing the market, Elvie said, “the first silver milk sauce in the world that can be worn on breasts, ” published an advertising music video showing the freedom that new milk supplies to feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a full shadow under a musical track, which says, "Yes, I feed with my own milk, but you will not see my tail," and "If you didn't notice, it's not my breast."
And further the choir: "We pursue, insecure, we feed our babies with breast milk, we persecute, we persecute."
This advertising film, published on Facebook's website, has caused disputes on the Internet.
77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments: the video has received a misunderstanding response from the viewers, and many say that it has been lighting on the " horror" of the breast industry.
“It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and born to produce milk, except that their children are taken from them for a few days after their birth,” says one user.
Molocoots Elvie is dressed directly under a special busthalter (Elvie/Mother)
The second comment: “It is obvious to be the same trauma for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise milk wax for mothers that leave their children?"
Another user adds: “The advertisement distracted from reality”.
Others were protecting the film, and one woman even wrote that the song was “great. ”
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was feeding the baby, I would have bought it.
Feeding my breasts really made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but that's how it feels.
A brilliant product," wrote one user.
And another comment: "A fun advertisement based on moms who feed their breasts (they often do it right in their jobs or in the toilets) and which, indeed, they feel a little bit like "cows."
This advertisement is not to praise or blame our breast industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women showed that they were all dancing with these unseen milk suits hidden under the busthalters.
The concept of this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many breast-feeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie's milk sauce is absolutely insensitive, has no gums or pipes, is freely placed in a feeding bullet, and is not noticed, providing women with the opportunity to move, hold children and even to go outside during feeding.
Anne Balarin, a partner and early child development expert, commented: “The Molocoots Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a courageous and provocative advertisement.
By carrying out a parallel between women and dormouse cows, we wanted to draw attention to the breast crushing and all its problems, demonstrating a jolly and funny way of demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that a new milk supplies gives.
This is not the first time Elvie's milk suffocacy is in the headlines of news.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared at the stage of Marta Jacobski designer, using this product for appointment.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a chamber camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained migrant children has rapidly increased, although the number of monthly crossings of the border remained relatively unchanged, partly because the strict rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trampa administration have made children difficult.
Most sponsors are usually the same immigrants with no documents and fear to threaten their stay in the country by taking the child's assignment.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential commissioners and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and that these data would be transferred to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a high-level Immigration and Customs Officer, testified in the Congress that the Agency arrested dozens of people who were requested to take care of the minors.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested were not judged before.
“Over 80 per cent of those who are either supervisors or members of their families are illegally in the country, and a major part of them are foreigners who have committed crime.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these persons," said Olbens.
With the words of the shelter workers, trying to accelerate the process of the establishment of children, the officials introduced new rules, according to which some of them should appear before the court within the month of detention, not within 60 days, as was previously.
In order to declare their legal status by the Immigration Judge, many of them are present on video contacts, not personally.
Those who are considered to have no right to help will be deported quickly.
According to shelter and information workers who have been in the system in recent months, the longer children remain in prison, the more likely that they have anxiety or depression, which may lead to violence or escape attempts.
Advocates say that these problems are enhancing in larger institutions, such as Tornello, where the signs of the child's difficulties will be ignored more likely because of the sizes of the agency.
They add that transporting children to camps without giving them time emotionally to prepare or to say goodbye to their friends may make many of them injuries worse.
Syria commands the “occupational forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to immediately withdraw troops
While speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Valid al-Mualem, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country for the eighth year.
Mualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were in Syrian land illegally, under the cause of counter-terrorism, and “will be considered accordingly”.
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions," he said to the gathered.
Mualem insisted that more than 360 000 people have died in Syria since 2011, and millions have been expelled from their homes, “the war against terrorism has almost completed”.
He said that Damascus would continue to “keep this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “every illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has placed about 2,000 troops in Syria, who primarily train and consult both Kurdish and Syrian Arabs speaking against President Bashar Assad.
The French contingent is more than 1,000 soldiers in a host country.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said that good conditions for their return had been established and accused “some Western countries” of “proliferation of irrational insurance” that encouraged refugees to stay outside the country.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to the return of citizens,” he said.
“They are politicizing what must be a clean humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be assisted in reconstruction until the political agreement to cease the war is reached between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the latest major rebel rebels of Idlib had created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian and Turkish agreement prevented the widespread attack of Syrian forces supported by Russia from a province where three million people live.
However, Mualem emphasized that the agreement had " clear deadlines " and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the Džihadists, including against the fighters of the Al-Qaida Front of Nusra, who would "be destroyed".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee will be convened soon, composed of representatives of Government and opposition, to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and make ways to elections.
Muallem presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that the work of the Commission should be limited to “constitutional consideration” and warned against intervention.
Why Tramp wins the second term
Following this logic, Mr. Tramp will win the re-election in 2020 if the impichment and scandal do not complete his presidency in advance, which is likely to be hoped for many liberal viewers.
And this will be the “the most dramatic final of presidency in all history!”
At present, there are no signs of tiredness of the viewers.
Since 2014, Prime Time ratings have increased more than twice, up to 1.05 million per CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million per MSNBC.
According to Nelsen, Fox News in the average 2,4 million Prime-Time viewers, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the MSNBC show "The Rachel Maddow Show" exceeded the cable channel ratings, collecting 3.5 million watchers at night during the show of the main news.
“This is the fire that people are drawn to, because it is beyond our understanding,” says Neal Barr, director of the ABC Drama “Appointed survivor”, on a member of the ministerial office, who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed as a result of the attack.
Nell Scowell, a long-term comedian writer and writer of the "It's just funny: a few unpleasant truths about the invasion of Hollywood boys Clubs" suggests another theory.
She recalls the ride of a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Tramp.
“Why? ” she asked.
He said, "Yes, because he's funny!"
There's something valuable in all this chaos — it's fun.
Of course, since, unlike all the other content translated on television, the historical lines on Washington developments can define the future by Row against Wade and respond to the possibility of reunification of the families of immigrants and the health of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, when you are six o'clock in order to see how the expert group discusses the use of Bob Woodward's "deep background" for his book "Strach" or for Paul Manafort's jacket for $15,000 from the strauss skin (awesome of pride," says Washington Post), or about the strict description of Story Daniels, let's say, Mr. Tramp's anatomy is already out of normal information.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario again with the same eyes.
"His work is partially to make us feel that the reality show is that he feeds you something every night," says Brent Montgomery, executive director Wheelhouse Entertainment and the developer of "Pawn Stars" about the changing actory of the Tramp show and the daily turning of the story (the drake from N.F.L., the praise of Kim Chen Yin).
You can't afford to miss any episode or you're unsure.
When I contacted Mr. Flace this week, there were 27 degrees of warmth on the northern coast of Kauai, the sunlight, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNBC during CNN record.
He could not get away from the screen, at least not when it was shown how Brett Cavano is representing the Senate Legal Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was decided.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows, people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Flace.
"Then I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outside funds are influencing into the biggest intermediate elections led by the White House
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives cash flow by changing the districts in the Congress, where two officials are participating in the race for the same place.
This suburban area of Pittsburgh, whose geography has not been changed so long, supports a democrat, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of Connor Lamb, who was held in another district at extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb speaks against another active official, the Republican of China Rothfus, who presents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is substantially crossing with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that, as a result of the pre-electoral machination, the old regions had been awarded to the Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district held a hot discussion on funding campaigns between the financial forces of the main party, the Committee of the Congress of the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
The name Lamba became known in Pennsylvania after a small difference in the special elections seen in March in the Congress in the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This place has been taken by the Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Tramp won the district with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give democrats a small advantage.
The United States punished El Salvador for the support of China, but then resigned
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which had caused a negative response from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Tramp held a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Karlos Varella, and he was also in Panama until the partners expelled the Trampa management team.
The representatives of the State Department decided to revoke US diplomatic mission leaders from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for “new decisions on the recognition of Taiwan”, said the press secretary of the Department of Heather Nauert at the beginning of this month.
However, the possibility of punishment was considered only for El Salvador, who received about 140 million US aid in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed penalties, including the reduction of financial assistance and visa limitations, would be painful for the country of Central America with its high level of unemployment and murder.
During the regular interior meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which had to be held for the outcome of a similar meeting, which took place last year as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migration in the United States.
However, by mid-September, the High Representatives of the Administration made it clear that they wanted the preparation of the conference to progress, and actually ceased the question of the punishment of El Salvador.
According to diplomats, the conference was scheduled in mid-October, and it would be presented by Vice-President Mike Pens in the sign that the administration attached the importance of this meeting.
Three American diplomatic representatives were safely returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, not taking with themselves any new strict letters or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues under anonymity.
Their reports were also confirmed by a foreign analyst in the circuit of the administration, but also expressed anonymity.
Study History
The next step could be the communication of the Special Adviser Robert Muller of the possible obstacle to Mr. Tramp of Justice, which is now very significant in public reports.
Mr. Mueller was also reported to investigate the facts that Tramp's contract with Russia and its attacks during the past elections.
If the Congress replaces the master, Mr. Tramp will be responsible in that body, just as he is preparing to speak to the voters again, and perhaps eventually before the jury members of his colleagues.
But there are many "if"; I don't want to say that the fall of Mr. Tramp is inevitable, as well as the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We'll all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will be the duration of the fight.
In 1938, the German officers were willing to set up a State revolt and demolish Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported the Czech Slovak troops in München.
However, we did not, and thus missed the possibility of avoiding the following years of bloodshed.
The history course is deployed at such points, and the unpleasant democracy march is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans have experienced some of these fractures now.
What will we do if Mr. Tramp fires the Deputy Prosecutor-General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of the investigation of Mr. Muller?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, he proposed secret records of the president's activities last year and considered his inconvenience to the post.
Mr. Rosenstein claimed that the Times had been incorrect.
"How will we react if the recent FBI investigation on Brett Cavano will not be complete or true, or if he is still approved by the Supreme Court of Justice despite the trusted accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
First of all, will we vote in the medium-term prospect for the Congress that will bring Mr. Tramp to responsibility?
If we do not pass these tests worthy, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we can go through them with the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Slovak Jew who was sent to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime, whose officials used to take care of the Ambassador home in which I lived years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later held me to burn sabbath candles on the table with a swastik symbol.

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic in the prediction of a football club vienna Rapid.
The Rangers are taking the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that the winning of Austrians, after the impressive one in Spain over “Williarreal” at the beginning of this month, will allow them to take strong positions in the Group of the League of Europe.
The trauma of the knee stopped the semi-protector Graham Dorrans for the first time in the season, with the account of 2:2 against Villiareal, but he believed that the Rangers could use the result as a trampling to achieve great results.
"It was a good time for us because "Williarreal" is a good team," said 31-year-old footballist.
"We went into a game, assuming we could get something and left with no one.
We may have finally managed to do so, but in general, it was probably a fair result.
They may have played better in the first time, and our success has come to the second time where we have shown ourselves better.
Another large European night will be held this Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but this will be a complicated game, because they have shown good results in their last game, but given the support of the cheerleaders, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year it was definitely hard, taking into account all my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but now there is a good factor in this place.
The composition is perfectly improved, and the boys really enjoy it; the training went to the "ure".
I hope we can move forward, leave behind the past season and make success."
Women lose their sleep because of fear of their pensions
Although the survey was clear about how they wanted to care for them, few talked about it to their family members.
About half of the people participating in the national study said that they discussed the value of long-term care with their spouses.
However, only 10 per cent said that they were talking about this with their children.
“People want to take care of them, but they do not try to discuss this subject,” said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Nationwide for Life Insurance.
And that's what we need to start with.
Talk to your husband and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t give up your wishes.
Talk to your consultant and family where and how you will receive medical assistance, as this choice may be an important factor in the cost.
Consult your financial advisor: he will help you develop the payment plan.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may be covered by a traditional insurance policy of long-term care or a mixed life insurance policy that will help to cover these expenditures or self-sustained assets provided you have money.
Set your legal documents to order: relieve yourself from legal batteries.
Stay confidential and appoint a trusted person who will control your health care and ensure that professionals fulfil your wishes if you can't communicate.
We also recommend that we consider the possibility of financial credibility.
A trusted person should be elected to help you make financial decisions and monitor the payment of your accounts if you are incapable.
Do not forget the little things: Imagine that your older parents needed immediate medical assistance, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Can you provide information about what drugs he takes and what he's allergic to?
Write all these details on the paper to be prepared for any case.
Martin adds: “It is important not only to have funding but also to choose doctors.”
"What drugs are you taking?
Who'll take care of your dog?
Draw and write this plan."
In Ilfracomba, a man shot a few times from a pneumatic rifle

The victim, in the breast, the stomach and the hand of the bullets, was 40 years old in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracomba, Devon.
The police described the shooting, which took place at approximately 02:30 in the English summer time as " random".
The victim hasn't seen the attacker.
The wounds are not dangerous for life, the police are now looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people were killed as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami crashed on the Indonezian city of Palo on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
As a result of the exit of communications, rescueers cannot get any information from Donghal, a region north of Palo, which is closer to the earthquake epicentre by 7.5 points.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palo as a result of natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palo and Donghal, located on the Sulavesian island:
Palo is the capital of the Central Sulaves province, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of Sulavesa, with the estimated population of 379 800 people (subscribed for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th year when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggal is a district stretching 300 km (180 km) of the coast line in the northwest of the Sulavesian island.
The district, the administrative area below the province, was 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the foundation of the provincial economy, Central Sulavesa, and in particular the coastal region of Donghal.
Nikel's production is also important to the province economy, but focused mainly on Morali, the opposite coast of Sulaves.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the Elimination of natural disasters, tsunami had been destroyed several times over the past 100 years in Palo and Donghal.
In 1938 tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donghal.
Tsunami also happened in the West of Donghal in 1996, as a result of nine people died.
Indonesia is on the Pacific volcanic fire ring and suffers from earthquakes regularly.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake in the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatra 26 December caused tsunami declined in 14 countries, which resulted in the death of 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Achea.
2005: The sequence of severe earthquakes crashed on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, near the Sumatra coast.
2006: The earthquake by the power of 6,8 has struck the Southern Java, the most inhabited island of Indonesia, causing tsunami declined on the southern coast, which resulted in some 700 deaths.
2009: The earthquake of 7.6 occurred in the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra Province.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: The earthquake of 7.5 points took place on one of the Mentawai islands in Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The weak earthquake has struck the district of Pidi Jaya in Acheha, causing destruction and panic, since people remembered the 2004 destructive earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died because of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes have struck into the tourist island of Lomboc, resulting in more than 500 deaths, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily under ruins.
Sarah Paylin's senior son was arrested for domestic violence.
Track Paylin, the senior son of the former Governor of Alaska and the Vice Candidate at the President of Sarah Paleen, was arrested for the charge of the attack.
The 29-year-old Paylin from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with domestic violence, and for resisting arrest, according to the statement published by the Alaska police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when one of his friends tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took the phone from her.
According to KTUU, Paylin is in the examination isolation of Mat-Su and will be bailed at $500.
He appeared in the court on Saturday, and when he was asked whether he was guilty, he declared his “one-significant innocence”.
Peylin is threatened to invoke three small crimes in class A, which means that he may be deprived of freedom for up to one year and punished by $250,000.
He was also accused of committing a crime of class B, punished by deprivation of liberty for up to one day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first case against Paleen's criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police by reporting the alleged attack.
The case is currently being reviewed by the Alaska veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, falsified family violence report and arms storage in the state of alcoholic alcoholic opium in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her face.
Sarah Paylin was criticized by the veteran groups in 2016 after explaining her son's cruel behavior by a post-traumatic stress disorder that appeared to be obtained from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of killed
At least 384 people were killed as a result of the earthquake on the island of Sulavezi in the Indonesian on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 points caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and in the coming days the number of victims will increase.
The earthquake took place near the central Sulavesa, which is north-east of the capital of Jacarda.
Social networks have video recordings of an incident.
There were hundreds of people at a beach festival in Palo when tsunami crashed to the shore.
The Federal Prosecutor wishes to bring a rare death sentence to the suspect in New York.
The Federal Prosecutor in New York seeks a death penalty for Saipullo Saipowa, suspected of the terror in New York, resulting in the death of eight people — a rare punishment for a federal crime that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30 years old, he seemed to have a carriage of Home Depot to attack a bikeway on the West Side road in the lower Manhattan, beating footsteps and bikeholders.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Sayip “intentionally” killed eight people and “intentionally” caused serious body damage, according to the notification of the intention of a death penalty imposed in the Southern County of New York.
According to the judicial document, both of these accusations may be sentenced to death.
Several weeks after the attack, the large federal jury read Saipo's 22 sentences of charge, which included eight charges for the murder of a racket used by the federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as the accusation of the use of violence and destruction of cars.
According to the prosecutors, the attack was “depthly planned and intentionally”, Saipov described it as“violent, cruel and criminal”.
“Saipullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lore Decatta, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Ernan Ferrucy, Hernan Diego Mendosa and Alejandro Damian Pagnukko,” said the announcement of the intentions.
Five died were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the prosecutor demanded a death penalty in the Southern County of New York.
In September 2009, the accused Halid Barnes was convicted for the murder of two drug dealers, but eventually sentenced to life.
The last time the death penalty on the federal case in New York was applied in 1953 in relation to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been executed for a conspiracy to spy on the benefit of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Rosenbergs were executed with the use of the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the case documents of Saipov, the descendant of Uzbekistan demonstrated the lack of repentance after his perfect attack.
According to the police, he said to investigators he was glad he did it.
According to the prosecutor's opinion, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the IHIL video on the phone.
He also requested the IHIL flag to be hanged in his hospital room, reports the police.
He denied his guilt on all 22 sentences of prosecution.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders speaking on the side of Saipov, said that they were " apparently disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty rather than to life imprisonment without the possibility of exemption will only reduce the pain of these events for all their participants," said Patton.
Saipov's protection had previously addressed prosecutors with a request not to pursue a death penalty.
Member of Parliament from Tori said that NAYGEL FARRAŽ should not be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during the protest at the Tori Nigel Faraz conference, he swore “mobilization of the People's Army”.
The former leader of Ukip said that politics should “sense” European skeptics, as one of the members of the Parliament of Teresa May assumed that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
The Conservatorial Party member Peter Bown said at the Birmingham meeting that Britain would have already been “under” if Mr. Faraz had been the Secretary of Brexit.
However, the problem facing Ms. May in trying to reconcile its deeply divided series is also aggravated by the fact that members of the Tori Party opposed to the EU are joining a separate protest against Brexit, which is being held in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to preserve its compromise plan in Checkers in the middle of the attacks by the participants of Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The allies insist that it continues to seek a deal with Brussels, despite the negative response, and thus to force European skeptics and layborists to choose between its package and the chaos.
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave "Exit means survival" in Solihall, that he wants to "conquer Checkers".
He proposed that Mr. Faraż be balanced and responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, we would have already gone, ” he said.
The Deputy Wellingboro added: “I will continue to speak for Brexit, but we must win Checkers.”
When he spoke against the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country."
Mr. Bone rejected the presumption that the public view had changed after the vote of 2016: “The idea that the British had changed their views and wished to remain was completely incompatible with the reality.”
The Brexit Party of Tori Andrea Jenkins was also at the meeting, giving journalists the following comment: “I say, Prime Minister, just listen to people.”
"Checkers are unpopular among the public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan; it is also unpopular to members of our party and our activists who actually strike the streets and choose us first.
Please put Checkers on the side and begin to listen to what they say to you."
In her sharp appeal to Ms. May, she added: “The Prime Ministers remain on their work if they remain faithful to their promises.”
Mr. Faraz said that if politicians were going to give up the decision taken at the 2016 referendum, they had to be forced to " feel nacal " .
"It is now a matter of confidence between us, people and our political class," he says.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say to them, "We're not going to drop it out of your hands."
Turning to the excited crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the edge of the Brexit trait, to feel nacal.
"We mobilize the People's Army of this country to win Brexit, and we will not calm down until we become independent, self-dependent and proud of the United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Brexit opponents went with the Birmingham demonstration and then held a two-hour meeting in the center of the city.
Several activists were waving the Tori versus Brexit on this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, a member of the Laborist Party, Lord Adonis criticised conservators for security problems in the mobile application of their party.
“And these people claim that they can configure Canada's IT systems and technology plus, for the border work, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
"This is one full farce.
There is no good Brexit in principle," he said.
Warren plans to " explore" the possibilities of participation in the presidential race
Member of the US Parliament, Senator Elizabeth Warren, said that after November's elections, she would “transview the possibilities of balloting in the President”.
The Boston Globe reports that a democrat from Massachusetts told her future at the meeting of the war in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent criticism of President Donald Tramp, ballotes in November for a re-election against a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Dill, who was a co-Chairman of the Trampa campaign in Massachusett in 2016.
There are talks that she had the chance to take Tramp post in 2020.
On Saturday, she held a regular meeting with the voters; since Tramp entered the post, it was its 36th meeting with the voters in the form of a council meeting.
One of the participants asked her whether she planned to be president.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and that would require a woman to be upstairs”.
As a result of the killing of Sims, the LSU player was arrested
The police of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that the suspect of the murder (shooting) of a basketballist LSU Wade Simms, which was held on Friday, was arrested.
At 11 a.m., at the press conference, the Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the police department published a video of the shooting requesting to help identify the person who was able to be taken on the video.
The 20-year-old Simms was shot at the South University campus on Friday morning.
“Wade Simms got a fire wound in the head, which resulted in the end of his death,” said the reporters on Saturday police chief Murphy J. Paul.
Wade went after his friend, and he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed that he was involved in the incident, had his weapons and shot at Wade Simms.
In the arrest of Simpson, he did not resist and was detained in the police office of East Baton Rouge County.
A young man raised 1 m 82 cm in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and acquired a average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 game selections.
Gran Pri Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after the command tactics gave him the victory of Sebastian Fettel
Since Valtery Bottas had qualified on Saturday by encouraging Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the Mercedes command tactics would play a great role in the race.
From the Pole-posin Bottas has already run well and practically hanged on Hamilton when he was protecting his position in the first two turns, and invited Fettel to attack his companion on the team.
The phetel first went to the pit stop, leaving Hamilton to the tail of the entire group, the choice that became a decisive.
Mercedes went to the pit stop one circle later, and then went behind the Fettel, but Hamilton, after a few fights of wheels, went forward, which led to the unwillingness of the Ferrari's internal space, risking to seal after a double movement to protect the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back of the network and was on the seventh end of the first circle.
Then he led a majority of the race, held on his own tyres, to quickly finish, moving Kimmy Rikconan to the fourth place.
As a result, he went to the 44th circle, but couldn't increase the rate of the remaining eight circles, as Raikkonen took the fourth seat.
The day seemed to be hard because Valtery did a fantastic work for the weekend and showed real nobleness by sharing it with me.
The team has done such exclusive work to have a few tricks in stock," said Hamilton.
Significance traitor
President Donald Tramp criticized Senator Diane Finstein at a meeting with the voters on Saturday for her allegation that she had not announced a letter to Christine Blacey Ford, accusing Bretta Cavano, a candidate for the Supreme Judge in sexual harassment.
Speaking at the meeting in Western Virginia, the President did not refer directly to the statements of Ford before the Senate Legal Committee, saying that the senate had shown that the participants of these events were “sucker, disgusting and liar people”.
“The only possible response to all of this, and what happens in the past few days in the Senatu is great, it is anger, anger, disgusting and lie”, he said.
"You see all these flows, and then they say, 'No, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Diane Finnstein, did you send the information?
Do you remember her answer... you've given the information of the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't spill.
Yeah, stop.
We're not swimming," he added with the intonation of the senator.
In July, Phinestein was sent a letter with a detailed statement of charges made by Ford against Cavano, and was illegally published in early September, but Phinestein denies that the escape had occurred in her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's statements, but I did not make it available," said Phinestein to the Committee, according to the Hill.
“She asked me to keep this information secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the manner in which she denyed the prosecution of the escape appears to be unliked by the president who commented on this during the Saturday meeting: “This is what I will tell you: I cheated her tongue of the body.
Maybe she didn't "float" but the tongue of the body was the worst I've ever seen."
By continuing to defend his candidate as a Supreme Judge, who was accused of sexual harassment, the President assumed that democrats used these accusations for his own purposes.
"They are definitely trying to restore their power in all available ways.
We observe the rudeness, the disgustingness, and they don't care who they will insult, whom they must intervene in order to receive power and control," the Mediaite quotes the president's words.
British elite Hockey League: Dandi Stars 5-3 Belfast Jayants
Patrick Duyer hit two naked, for "Jayants" in a game against Dundee
In the game of the Ellite Hockey League, Dandi Stars paid for the Friday defeat against Belfast Jayants, wining a responsive match on Saturday with 5-3 for the benefit of Dandi.
"Jayants" received early advantage in two goals thanks to Patrick Dwighter and Francis Boviler's hits.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney raised their home team level before Duyer brought Jayants into leaders.
François Bushar compared the Dundi account before the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Neilsen reinforced their victory.
For the people of Adam Kiff, who won the Dundi account of 2:1 in Belfast on Friday night, this was the third defeat in the Ellite League Season.
This was the fourth meeting between the parties in the season when Jayants won three previous matches.
The first goal of Dwighter came for the fourth minute at 3:35 after Kendall McFoll's goal with David Rezerford's support, and then Boviler doubled the advantage four minutes later.
During the starting period, Sullivan returned the masters to the game at 13:10 before Matt Markard adapted Coney to the account at 15:16.
The Dwighter found that the Jayants had taken the initiative in the first break when he took the second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The hosts regrouped, and Bouchar re-equalised the account, whispering the goal at 27:37.
Couni and Charles Corcoran were united to help Nelsen give the Dundi the first time for the game to take the lead at the end of the second period, and then he, together with his team, boosted the victories in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Jayants, the four of the last five matches, are now headed to Milton Caines for the next match that will take place on Friday.
Aviation controller died for hundreds of people on the plane to avoid earthquakes
The Indonezian Air Inspector had been given the hero ' s name after he was consciously killed so that the plane with hundreds of passengers could fly well.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared without news as a result of a severe earthquake on the Sulavesian island on Friday, which caused tsunami.
Many inhabitants of the city of Palo were still under a fracture of buildings.
Although his colleagues were rescued to escape their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in a terrible disrupting dispatch at the airport of Mutiara Sis Al Juffrey, the city of Palu.
He remained on his seat to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the time on the airline, was able to fly safely.
Then, when he seemed to have the tower crashed, he jumped out of it.
Later he died in the hospital.
The representative of the Indonesian airport, Johannes Syrait, stated that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian ABC News Agency.
We prepared a helicopter from Ballipapan in Calimantane to get him to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher was dead before the helicopter was able to sit in Palo.
"We regret this loss," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of victims of the earthquake could reach thousands because, according to the Agency for the Elimination of natural disasters, access to the towns of Donghal, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims is likely to grow, since a large number of people are still under fractures and many have not been able to get out of there” said the representative of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves of the height of six meters have desolated the city of Palo, where the mass buried the dead in Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering humanitarian assistance to the affected city.
Risa Kusumma, a 35-year-old mother, tells Sky News: “Emergency is bringing help to the victims every minute.
There's no clear water.
The mini-markets are robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, tells CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross workers are already in a hurry to help survivors, but we do not know that they will stay there.
The tragedy has already adopted quite serious scales, but it may be much worse."
The President of Indonesia Joco Vidodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and spoke to the armed forces of the country, in particular saying: “I ask all of you to work on day and night in order to fulfil all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?", said CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia suffered from the earthquake in Lomboc, which resulted in more than 550 deaths.
Air Niugini now reports that one person was missing after the crash of the Lagoon aircraft
Aviation company, which carried out a flight in the Pacific Lagoon, in Micronesia, now reports that one person was missing, while all 47 passengers and crew were said to leave the drowning plane safely.
The Air Niugini report states that as of Saturday the day, it has no information on one male passenger.
The airline stated that he cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and police, trying to find this person.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The local sailors helped to save other passengers and the aircraft team after he fell on the water, trying to land at the airport of the island Chuk.
On Friday, officials reported that seven were transferred to the hospital.
The airline also reported that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and all were stable.
The reasons for the aviation accident and the precise sequence of events remain unclear.
Airlines and MSCs claim that the plane landed in the lagoon near the airline.
Some witnesses argue that the plane could not land on the airline.
The American traveller Bill Janes said the plane was getting into the airline too low.
“ And this is very good, ” adds Janes.
Janes told me that he and other passengers had been able to get to an emergency exit on a drowning plane, since the water level was by the belt.
He also said that the stewardes paniced and screamed on board and that he had a light head trauma.
The U.S. reports that seamen who repaired the ports nearby also helped to save, using a boat on which they delivered people to the shore before the aircraft flooded about 30 feet (100 feet).
The Air Niugini Air Niugini Air Niugini safety network shows that 111 people died in the last two decades of aircraft accidents registered in PNG, but none of these catastrophes had anything to do with Air Niugini.
Intelligence analyst has been able to prove the fact that the combustion of a woman is alive
On Saturday, the accusation raised a case against a man accused of the combustion of the resident of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett presented a multi-hour testimony as an expert in the field of exploration.
He told the department how he used the cell phone records to make a common picture of action by 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year victim of Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said that he had received data on the location of these people from several mobile phones; according to this, Tellis spent time with Chambers, which was contrary to his previous testimony, reports the Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the information he received, his mobile phone was close to Chambers; when the circumstances found out, the police interrogated Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford stated that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford whether Tellis was telling the truth that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said that “it was a lie because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before she died.
However, according to telephone calls, they called for only one week.
Rowlett also showed that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed its text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He removed her from his life, ” says Hale.
Protection should come to the presentation of its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting the process to be transferred to the jury later the same day.

Another black?!
New York nanny courted a couple because of racist texts
The New York Nanny tried a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message from a woman complaining that the nanny was “one other black”, which the woman had wrongly sent to the nanny instead of her husband.
Wifes deny that they are racists, claiming that the lawsuit was filed with “the purpose of extortion”.
Lyncy Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed anxiety that the new nanny offered by the childkeeping service, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived in her family for her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEE, THAT'S NOT THERE, ONE ONE BLACK”, said Mrs. Plasco-Fleksman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending a message to her husband, Ms. Morris made it wrong twice.
Recognizing its absence, Plasco-Flexman fired Morris, saying in the service that the nanny, who was a African American, had done a bad job, and at all that they were expecting a Philippine rather than an African American, reported the New York Post.
Morris paid for one day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is suing the family couple and demands compensation for the exemption of $350 per day for six months, under the original oral arrangement, which, however, have not been established by any contract.
"I want them to understand: such things are inadmissible," she said, "And I know that this is discrimination."
Marriages disagree with the accusation of racism, and claim that the release of Morris could be considered a reasonable step, as if they had offended it, they would no longer be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her what she really didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racist," said Joe Plasco, the Post issue.
"But would you trust your children with someone whom you were rude, even if you were harsh, not wishing for yourself?
Would you trust your newborn child?
Come on!'
Plasco said that his wife had born a child just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation”.
“And are you willing to persecute a man who is in such a situation?
It is not very nice of you," added the bank worker specializing in investment.
The trial was still ongoing, but the public opinion had already condemned the social networks, accusing a couple of people of inadmissible behaviour and logical issues.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not understand the move with the speaking bear, says the new letter
The daughter of Bonda, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, replied on the letter: “It is hard to put yourself in place of someone who reads the article for the first time before it was published.
It is very fun to know that Paddington has a great success."
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a baby book on the bear, worked as an operator at the BBC, would have renounced the publication with optimism, and added that the 60-year anniversary of his book was “and joyful and bitter” because their author had not been here last year.
With regard to the Bear of Paddington, she speaks about him as a “very important member of our family, ” and that her father was so proud that his character eventually became famous.
“He was a quiet and modest man,” his daughter says.
“Paddington was so real to him, and for his father it was almost as if his own child had been successful: he was proud of him, although he did not really consider that success his own deserve.
I think that's how he treated Paddington's success.
The Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also had always given the good to the bear himself.”
I was forced to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After the plane, her daughter was delivered to Nicca Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad regularly called and said it was really bad, something went wrong," said Mrs. Ednan Laperuza.
"Then he called again and said that she would die in the next two minutes, and that we should say goodbye.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medicinal products that the doctors gave her, making her heart work, gradually stopped acting by leaving her body.
She died before it was expected.
I had to just sit and wait, knowing it's all coming to the end.
I couldn't cry, cry or cry, because there were other people, other families around me.
I had to hold myself firmly in my hands."
After all, Mrs. Ednan Laperuza, the grief of the loss of her daughter, sat on a plane with other passengers, reconciled with the huge loss she had just had to survive.
“No one around knew what happened,” she said.
“ My head was gone, I kept crying.
It's hard to explain, but it's just during the flight I experienced this absorbing feeling of compassion for Nada.
He needed my love and support so much.
I know how much he loved her."
Women surviving the loss of their loved ones prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones who have committed suicide are trying to prevent others from this step.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamphrey are placed on the Walsh Bridge with comforting words and phone numbers that people can contact for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler’s son was 13 when he was depressed, and at his age of 18, he killed himself.
“I don't want other parents to experience the same experience I experience every day, ” she says.
A 45-year-old Davis living in Lidney tells her son was a great cook and had a damn charming smile.
“Everyone loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he was smiling, the room was like lighting."
However, before his death, he left his job because he had experienced real terrible times.”
This happened in 2014, and Tyler, who killed himself, found his own brother, who was 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis said: “I am not stopping afraid of chain reaction.”
Mrs. Davis designed these cards, “to make people know that there is someone to whom you can contact and tell everything, even if it's your friend.
We cannot sit and keep silent, we need to talk to people."
Mrs. Hamfriz, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband, who was 15 years old with whom he was gone shortly after his mother died.
“He did not say that he felt depressed, upset or something like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed changes in his mood.
He has become particularly bad for Christmas; he has not even looked at children when they opened their gifts.”
She says that his death was a huge injury for them, but they have to go through it, this event shook our family.
It broke her apart.
But we must continue to live and fight."

The future of Bretta Cavano hangs on the hair: the FBI is initiating an investigation
"I thought that if we could get something like what he asked -- an investigation limited by time and volume, we could bring a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "disturbed" on the basis of a growing party chain response.
Why did Mr. Cavano and his representatives of the Republicans not want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the cause of their hesitation.
The intermediate elections will only take five weeks, 6 November, and if everything is expected to go bad for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to receive the man they want and to choose him as the Supreme Judge of the country.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbying the support of Mr. Cavano, who has worked at the White House at Mr. Bush, and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife, Ashley, who worked then as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI announces its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Cavano could receive at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pens to resolve the problem of equality of votes and to confirm his candidacy to the Supreme Court of Justice.
The number of refugees from North Korea decreased in Kim
Since Kim Chen Yen came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has decreased, the South Korean legislator stated.
The Bjon Seug Park, referring to the data of the Southern Ministry, stated that, compared to the 2706 cases of the fugitive in 2011, this figure had decreased to 1127 cases last year.
Mr. Park said that key factors have been the strengthening of border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher rates taken by smugglers.
Phenyan does not give public comments.
The subsequent majority of North Korean refugees is finally invited to nationalize South Korea.
Seul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most people run across China with the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a safely protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers the perpetrators as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often subjects them to forced repatriation.
Relationships between North and South, which are still in war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenjan to resume the negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the June historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Tramp and Kim Chen Yena, in Singapore, where they reached common agreements on the disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yoon Ho, accused the United States of impeding their sanctions to progress in this matter.
"If we don't have at least the smallest confidence in the United States, we will also not have confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be able to start disarmament unilaterally," said Mr. Ree in his statement at the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Cavano “historical” and claims that it is not suitable for work in the Supreme Court
The Leader of the Minority in the Palace of representatives of Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavano, a candidate for the Supreme Judge, “historical”, and said that he was inadmissible for work in the Supreme Court for his temperament.
Pelosi made this comment on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival at Mr. Austin, Texas.
"I cannot not think that if a woman had ever allowed herself to act like this, she would be called "history" immediately," Pelosi said to her response to Cavano's testimony in the Senatu Legal Committee on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally rejected Dr. Christine Blacey Ford's accusations of sexual harassment that seemed to have happened when they were both adolescents.
Cavano spoke quite emotionally, and sometimes even cried and drowned by telling about his family and school years.
He also condemned the democrats of the committee in no doubt, calling charges against it “grotesk and clearly planned murder of an active person” organized by the Liberals that Hillary Clinton had lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi also said that, in her view, Cavano only confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he had a predominant relationship with democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself by his allegations, as well as by how he strikes on Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi was upset when she was asked whether she would try to bring Cavano to responsibility if it was confirmed, and if the democrats received most representatives in the Palace.
"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth to the Congress or the FBI, it is not only suitable for the Supreme Court but also for the court on which he is now," said Pelosi.
Cavano is now a judge of the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Cavano on the Law on Available Medical Services or Row v. Wade, as it was considered representative of Conservative Justice.
At the hearings on his candidacy, Cavano addressed the question whether it would cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time to put a historical and predictable man into the position of the Supreme Judge and cry: "How great!", says Pelosi.
And women should own it.
It's just anger, months and years of rage, and she can't go through it without tears.
“When we're angry, we're crying, ” Miss Steinne told me 45 later.
"I don't think it's as unusual as you think it is?"
She continued: "I was very helped by a woman who worked on a leadership, and she said that she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique that she explained to her companion, "You may think I'm crying because I'm upset.
I'm really mad."
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed with this approach."
The tears are permitted as a way of anger, partly because they are incorrectly treated in the root.
One of my most painful memories of the first job in the office where the men were dominated: once I cried from anger, but I was caught by an old woman, a wretched manager that I always feared, and cried out on the staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They do not know that you cry from anger.
They think that you are upset, and they rejoice that they have finally brought you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Congressman from Democrats from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential elections.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in some nonsense and left the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there were no reasons to interfere with the president.
“This decision has not been considered properly,” she admitted to me with a smile of 30 years later.
“Seven other candidates were already involved in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called that case "The Snow and Seven Snows."
The campaign was already at the end, and it was highly restrained in the collection of funds, and therefore she swore that she would not be part of the race unless she gathered two million dollars.
It seemed to be a totally losing option.
She found that some of her advocates, who gave $1,000 to men, only offered 250.
“What am I for them, a blackmailed goods, am I? ” she wondered.
When she spoke and announced that she would not be conducting an official campaign, she was so emotionally affected by emotions — the thanks to the people who supported it, the disappointment of the system that made it so difficult to gather money and access to the voters, as well as the anger of sexual discrimination that it was suffocated.
"You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
“I thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I still thought, what would they write on my monument?
"She has no end of crying?"
How trade war with America can be useful for Beijing
Experts believe that the first trading wars between the United States and China were deaf and, although the battle was far from the end, the dissolution among countries could benefit Beijing in a long-term prospect.
Donald Tramp, President of the United States, made the first warning at the beginning of this year, taxing basic Chinese export goods, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week when new tariffs influenced the goods of 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), actually taxing half of all goods in China.
Beijing has been attached to equal responses in recent times by setting up $60 billion to 10 per cent of US goods.
China promised that responses against the United States would be equal every time, and the second largest world economy would hardly begin to experience at least the smallest difficulties in the nearest time.
Forceing Washington to retreat means resignation of the requirements, but the public resignation of the United States would be too shameful for the President of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing can play its maps properly, the pressure of the United States Trade War could provide long-term support to China, reduced the interdependence of two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to economic support in any of these countries is indeed much more dangerous than the observers previously recognized,” said Abigail Grace, a scientific officer of the Centre for New American Security (Center for New American Security), specialized in Asia.
Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was “prepared” to return to refugees
Syria claims that she is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is looking for assistance in the reconstruction of the country that was devastated by the war for more than seven years.
On speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Valid Al-Mualem, informed the country that the conditions were improved.
“The situation on the ground has become more stable and safe because of the success of terrorism," he said.
The Government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live peacefully there.
All the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily life are now being established.
UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since war in 2011.
Six more million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for helping to restore the ruined country.
But he emphasized that the country would not accept assistance under any conditions or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe strengthens the victory on the Rider Cube in Paris
The team of Europe won the Rider Cube 2018 by defeating the United States team with a summary of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in the European land, and the European Rider Cube has not won since 1993.
Europe returned the crown by the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, who had reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Michelson, who fought the majority of the tournament, made his first distant strike on the 16th hole of par-3, resisted his Francesko Molinari match.
The Italian golfist Molinari victored in all its rounds, with 1x4 players who had ever walked 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Speed was defeated by the 5:4 player with the lowest rating in the European team, Turbirn Olesen from Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, departed 2:1 Jan Polter from England, who may have been participating in the Rider Cube for the last time.
The Spanish Serchio Garcia, the veteran of eight Cubs of Ryder, became a winner of the tournament in the history of Europe with 25.5 points for career.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can't stand up today.
It was a complicated year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get a cup again.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help," says the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He transmits the torch to his co-made John Rem, who won the American golf legend on Sunday, Tiger Woods, accounting 2:1 in a single game.
“I am incredibly proud of this victory — I grew up watching the Tiger Woods game,” said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all his four matches in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These indicators are quite strange to one of the biggest players of all times winning 14 main titles, only Jack Niclaus.
The U.S. Congregation struggled all weekends, trying to successfully. The exemption was made by Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed a golf of the highest class during the whole tournament.
The U.S. Captain Jim Furic said after his team was uncomfortable: “I am proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we were able to slightly flip Europe.
It didn't work.
We're taking the hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played great.
We are regrouping, I will work with the PGA of America and our Committee of the Rider Cube, and we will move forward in achieving success.
I love all 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You need to know how to lose.
We have lost."
