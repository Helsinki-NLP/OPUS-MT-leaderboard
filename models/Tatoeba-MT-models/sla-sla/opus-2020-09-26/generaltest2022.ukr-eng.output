I'm sorry, I didn't have the Internet, and I couldn't send it faster.
Please tell me where to go to cleaning tomorrow, which code to the keys, and what hour will the guests leave tomorrow, and the new guests are settled?
Unfortunately, I have to give up your offer, because I've really found a job in this time.
I'm sorry, but I can't deny it.
Sometimes I feel that because of the translation, my thoughts in Czech are different from what I wrote in Ukrainian.
We promised that when you go to school, we'd bring you a surprise.
Good afternoon, I agree on course.
However, tell me if there's a time earlier.
Because I don't live in Prague, there may be difficulty with transportation.
If there are no options, I still agree.
Thank you in advance.
In Herson, people went back to the miting, and the Russians weren't able to squeeze
As told by the West Agency, the Hersonians were able to make a miting before they arrived for military rfs with techniques.
"We've arrived at the miting, and now there's a RF technique," said one of the West Participants.
Earlier, the migrants were traditionally gathered at the protests on the Freedom Square - near the ODA building and the fraud.
This area, as well as the building, is controlled by armed Russian troops using arms against mything participants and kidnapping people.
As reported in April 3, armed Russian occupants used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kahovca.
As Ucrinform reported, the people in Donetsk regularly carry out peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military uses the force and weapons against humans, are injured and detained.
Russia’s entrepreneurs are also kidnapping the inhabitants of the area.

God, let's make it good.
When you get here, call me on the phone.
It'd be better... we'd have to move because we don't financially drag European prices...
I need to look at the place and try where it hurts.
He wants to push on all my painful points now, he knows what.
But it doesn't have any effect on me.
I didn't want to talk to Misha about him and his drama yesterday.

Mother's going to live here in a bunch, because the pay is small for the bunch.
It's the only thing that I have where to live
Sasha was not at school today, and I wrote to the teacher on the mail.
Hello, I'm sick, so it's better to move our meeting next weekend, I'm sorry.
I know how to cook, mostly for a recipe, but I like to bake baking.
In Ukraine, it is traditional for the bowl, the barrels, the others.
I don't have my favorite food, I like to try different foods of different countries.
Do you like cooking?
I want to be busy.
Exactly there is a train, and there are no places
Sorry, we're a little late.
Lucia, can I be a helper in the kitchen?
It is very good that Julia will be able to go to work.
I went to their apartment last night.
It's very beautiful and convenient.
On Tuesday, Pablo will tell me if Nazar's work will be at the beer shop and when he has to come to make a meeting.
If Nazar works from 5:30, he can use any train:
Green: Mariopol is the heart of war, will stop fighting – we will have weak positions
The President Volodimir Greenski believes that fighting for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, by Mariopol, will determine the course of war — and if the FSF is defeated there, the Russians can abandon the negotiations and reoblish the participated territories.
The direct language, "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights, we fight, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have weaker positions.
They are people who have dragged a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariopol, the stronger our position will be in the east state, in the (ray) OOS, and if they are stronger, then the table of negotiations will be closer to us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, we may be unwilling to meet.
Because then Russia will do all these steps that can lead to returning even to the cities we have now shared.
They can go to that.
Then our situation in negotiations will be weaker and perhaps not even interested in the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we are.
We believe in our result, in our victory..."
Details: Greensky also said that negotiating after the torture of the Ukrainians is difficult, but "we should not lose the possibility of a diplomatic solution if they are in us."
The right language is, "The people will take peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
In our terms, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... each family has lost something -- and I don't think they'll be satisfied by any peace under any circumstances.
But if we speak not emotionally, the war must end with peace, or end with millions of victims.
And even where a million victims come to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight — but for life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing anymore, there's no people."
Good afternoon, do you still have rooms for the Czech course for adults from 7:00 on Tuesday?
If you want to meet your family in the Angle Mountain.

This procedure is continuous, is it necessary to order at the end?
In connection with the change in the estesis of the Ukrainian literature, new ideas were needed to describe its new quality state.
The metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature is the analysis of the state
The English poetical metaphor in modern literature allows to analyze the postmodernist context as one where metaphor plays the role of the axiological criterion

Why did you believe that you didn't need such experience?
Each situation is given for something.
It is most important that a person change, especially spiritually.

The head of the Department of Defence Department of Ukraine has published a list of Russian military officers involved in committing military crimes in Buch Kiev.
According to Ucrinform, the Main Intelligence Office of the Ministry of Defence reports in Facebook.
“Every Ukrainian should know their names!
HUR MO Ukraine has obtained a list of soldiers of 64 separate motor-shooting brigade who are directly involved in committing military crimes against the people of Ukraine in M. Buch," reports the report.
HUR MOU notes that all war criminals will be brought to justice for the crimes committed against the peaceful population of Ukraine.
The list can be viewed by a link.
According to Ukrinform, Irping, Buch, Hostomel, and the entire Kyev region were released from Russian entrepreneurs.
The free towns and villages have found mass murders by Russian military civilians.
On April 1, the city head of Buchi Anatoli Fedoruk reported that 280 people were buried in the brother’s graves.
The Prosecutor General Irina Venedictova stated that 410 bodies of the dead inhabitants were taken out of the territory of the region of Kiev from April 3rd of the Russian entrepreneurs.
On February 24th, the russian president, ruled a pathin, announced a full invasion into Ukraine.
Russian armies are shooting and destroying key infrastructure objects, massaged housing areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, reactive fire fire systems, balistic missiles, airbombs.
Good afternoon, I'm sorry, but I can't work at you because I'm going to go to Canada soon.
There are regular names right behind the slide, and there's a risk of slengy expressions in the brackets used on the hour schedule.
I don't want to bother you.
I've been watching the weather forecast, it's gonna be cold.
I don't need a brandy.
It's just a nice clothing at normal prices and to make the sizes.
We were at the railway station shop
Professions that offer. Is it possible without language knowledge?
It's important, if there's a tradition, I need to know how to prepare.)
I thought in a week, but we've got a lot of cheese.
Tomorrow may be a bad connection on the road.
I appreciate every person’s experience, even if it's painful.
I believe that I have experienced every situation for myself so that I can avoid repeating mistakes.
The directives are introduced in the form of numbered written supplements, which are part of this Regulation.
I'm sure it won't be a problem.
In Ukraine, many are celebrating the same week.
This depends on religion.
Is there a Greek Catholic or a Catholic man?
At first, you can try it for free.
Maybe you'll write us a payment algorithm, we'll pay for it.
We have the paper that the children get at the end of the school year is a table, and the witness is given when they were born and married.
Yeah, he's on it like an experienced driver, but I don't know if it's better.

I'll try to make it, because I'm still in the courtroom, sign the documents.
The wife is not angry that you're on the phone
In my daily prayers, I thank God and the Lordship for you.
Let them turn you around with their cover of love and warmth this night.
My heart belongs to you.
Do you mind if I come right after the war?
place, day and time will be clarified according to interests and opportunities
We promised that when you go to school, we'd bring you a surprise.
It would be great, I have the money for two months of rent, in Olomouca it doesn't matter, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my friends are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal abuse of civilian population north of Kiev.
The photographs of tortured and shot people confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people question each other, how could this happen in the 21st century?
It's just what I've been looking forward to.
I took my children and older parents out of Kiev to the second day of war.
Then a colleague with children, and only after that he returned to the capital of work.
Since 2014, the CEA was consistently helped and he had no doubt that in the case of occupation, Kiev would not spare my family.
Because there was and I'm absolutely sure that the substance of the rotten Communo-KDBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it can't exist, it's built on terror.
In 1937 one of my ancestors was shot in the city of Zitomir.
A few years ago, a copy of the predecessor’s shooting case was removed in the CBU: over a hundred pages, and the sentence to execution was very simple and even more scary.
The accused was unwritten, he denyed his guilt.
The ethnic Pole, the Catholic, had five children, was from free people, poor "one-door" path, never walked in the backs.
The fact that they lived on the crown and had several cows was sufficient to condemn the sheet and the child’s child’s child to be executed.
The parents didn’t even know about the place of the funeral.
Grandma said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village then and killed all other than two who agreed to give false witnesses.
There's a name for the Scarrier Share in the penalty case.
Our former speaker of the Supreme Council comes from the neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and I won't be surprised if his relative was a KGBist informant.
The apple from the apple is not far away, as we know, falls...
The ethnic Russians were the trinity that had been executed by the villagers.
In analysing the ancestor’s case, he was interested in various information resources.
There's great (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia like the "Back of Death", which soundly reminds the events of those years.
So, in today's Russia, the NKWDist descendants found ways to punish and destroy almost all those who were seriously investigating the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found massive graves of victims of stelinary reprises and publicly wrote the names of the killers — the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It's like the computer found the files with child pornography, they put her in jail, and he died there soon.
The KGBists are still killing those who are trying to learn the truth about the crimes of the past century.
Why do you suddenly surprise their actions now?
The most disgusting qualities of human nature are concentrated.
The surface of the millennium Ordinal Tradition was slavery and the Imperial Shovinism of the 16th-19th century.
And then, over what came out, an animal genetic experiment was made by cutting intelligence during several waves of red terror.
Look at the semi-frenz movie "Chequest" in 1992, that's what it was.
Zo, you saw my photo in the bathroom.
Can you ask my wife what I can buy from cough?
I'm sorry I don't have anyone to ask.
I still wanted to ask maybe you know where the kids went, because Gala can't know them.
Lovesh, Igor asks if you're comfortable tomorrow? (he's on the weekend and he can go because the car hasn't been watched at the station today).
We're very uncomfortable to bother you so much.
You're helping us so much, thank you!

She said if it could be another old blanket and a pillow.
But it's not necessarily necessary, only if it is, and I'm very grateful to you too.

"European Truth," says Welt with reference to sources in the government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the proposition was sent to the Ministry of Economy of Germany on Saturday.
The value of 100 haubics, including the training set and the spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As the goubians are also offered in BTR Boxer for 1.2 billion euros.
While the tanks in the battle have to go relatively close to the goals of the opponent, Panzerhaubitze 2000 can lead fire more than 30 miles [30 km] away.
According to the Ukrainian government circles with reference to KMW’s proposal, the supply of self - cowbits will be followed by a circular scheme.
In the shortest term, the Bundesver will give Kiev 100 of its goubs, and the gaps that were created will then be filled with industries at the second stage.
The first new goubians can be placed 30 months after the signing of the contract, earlier the second half of 2024.
The complete supply will not be completed until 2027.
And this is us on the first half of the day, or on the second half of the day together?
Thank you, we'll find a way of filling the rigged and nabercmo, and I'll write back to you.

I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, love, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I'm looking at it so that we're together, that we're a couple.
I'd say there'll be a lot of work to do after the war.
So I'm not afraid I can't find her there.
I can do a lot of things.
So I'm not afraid that I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know what's going on with the apartment.
I need to do a survey for the production of food license.
Can you please tell me about tomorrow for 5 guests to prepare a apartment?
Fifth place I understand that in the TV room?
Laying down and fixing the couch?

Write the Czech address, let's look at the map where this is from us.
I don't know how much free place there is, so I can't plan anything with the furniture she wants to finally look at that apartment and then understand what furniture I need.
I'm sorry that I answered so long, the working day, it's hard to adapt
Is that enough yet?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I finally want to be with you, have this opportunity to hug you.

Only I'll be a little later -- somewhere at 8:00.
I don't want any misunderstandings with you.
Because I'm worried that everything is fine!
Because we haven't even talked about this with these excarations!
I understand how important it is to you!
And for myself I'm silent. It's just the top that I can't reach!
How do you feel today?
Hey, I'm sorry, I just woke up, I didn't sleep well.
Sorry to bother you.
I was regretted that we had a bad start in translating the test yesterday.
I will ask whether Gregory Denissenka or maybe Jonascheka) to help me with some of the mathematical ideas.
Maybe I can be helpful to them.
If there's a possibility, I want to raise the mathematical terms on the weekend.
Geometry is hard at all, but we have to work with the Cole so that it's without mistakes.
Thank you for the test task
We too have a great hope for that
And so she is very pleased with any gift
Jab wanted to connect the Internet to her Czech number
Yesterday at the 402 bus station, I met Ukraine Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is herself... her eyes are full of tears and sorrows...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we agreed to be friends.
And yesterday night, thanking God for this little girl, because this is the first person in Ukraine where my heart felt mutuality.
The No29 branch is designed to provide and process requests for assistance
I found out I ordered a backup card
No, I'm just a person.
So she can't be scared that no one came.
I didn't go, I was hot, I could do that, but the main thing is that you taught me how to turn the sandwich on.
So you're leaving town for a long time?
Seven months ago, at the Memorial Centre of the Holocaust "Babin Yar" in Kiev, we admired 80 years of mass shooting by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babina Yar.
I had the honour to speak after three heads of the countries, including the president of Germany.
He spoke of “the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their way and life in the territorial integrity, peaceful and safe Europe.
This is the foundation we must protect -- that is also part of our responsibility related to our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in a new clothing," he said, "then for us, the Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The fight must last."
Today Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombs and kills thousands of peaceful inhabitants, hungers of the people blocked by its cities and allows them to die from sickness.
The Russian troops perform mass shootings by Ukraine, even visually resembles the shootings in Babi’s Yar.
For more than a month, the Germans see it in real time news.
Yes, Germany introduces sanctions, provides humanitarian assistance, as well as weapons that have not been imagined so long.
Germany withdraws the supply of heavy weapons required to Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to speak against swastika.
This means fighting all possible means against mass murders, genocide, war crimes and beliefs.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to overcome evil and to stop the beasts that are happening in Ukraine.
One song to you at night
We agree, make a deal for the trip, and write when to be gathered
All sick only Lydia didn't get sick had a micron new type of covido

Sergei Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has ended to be a far-reaching perspective
Nine years ago, the Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of the Ukrainians were against NATO entry and only 18% of the surveys were acting for.
After the revolution of the worthy, the escapes of Victor Janukovic, the Crime Anexia and the beginning of the war, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and the advocates, on the contrary, increased.
After the start of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists set up a record level of support for Ukraine’s introduction to NATO, more than 75% among Ukraine citizens.
Despite the support of Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO is carrying under war, there is now a lot of criticism on the Alliance and Ukraine memberships -- the inadequate supply of weapons, the refusal of closing the sky, the non-disciplination of Russia.
Furthermore, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to renounce the desire for membership in the Alliance because of the RF position, if it can stop war, and Ukraine will receive safe safe guarantees, including military.
In the new episode of the Damn Questions, together with the editor of the European Truth, we're talking about how to help Ukraine Alliance since Russian invasion, which NATO should be criticised, and why the Alliance criticizes why our prospects of membership in NATO are in vain why our prospect of membership in NATO is closer than ever in history and why safe guarantees discussed in the negotiations with Russia can become a second Budapest memorandum.
How do you think it's here?
I've got a volt partner marked that my statement is in the review.
I gave it through this mobile plugin
There is no visa, we need to go to the center of the Congress and find out how to do it, because it was formed in Poland, where visas were not given, but were given.
We're going to write to you!
Dennis went in a good mood today.
I agreed with a boy from Ukraine, who met yesterday, to meet at the school to show him everything.
So I hope he's all right.
'Cause I don't like this, I'm missing for a long time.
In Ukraine, it is reported that the Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks to Ukraine and marine fighting machines.
I'm going to leave my children alone for 3-4 years and I'm going home because I can't leave them anymore.
And take it with me for 6-7 hours in the morning.
Yes, it was a sick heart.
I had a sincere feeling for this man, but he did not very well, and I left him.
After a while, he came back and asked me to forgive me.
I refused him.
After a while, he called for his heart surgery.
I asked him to just talk to him, and I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost six months.
During that time, we had a lot of communication.
I had a parallel on my job.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual assistance.
And I was wondering, maybe we really need to look at it differently.
And he offered me to marry, and two days later he died.
So God himself decided our destiny.
What does it mean for you to marry?
And he speaks only in Czech
I wanted to say that I was able to find a place, and I'm very happy with it now I have where to live and where to be with my baby.
Did you have to remember me before?

You've raised my mood.
All right, take something else, and I'm not sleeping, I'm still sleeping, and I'm dreaming of bombing...
God is never late, all his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I understand the price of unqualified work, and I realize that the job I had at home in Kiev, I can't have the money I've earned at home, and I won't get it right now.
But I can't do anything, because all the bad thoughts are climbing in the head, so you have to do some kind of physical thing.
The airport forms documents from 7:00 to 7:00 a.m., and at the other time, you can just wait.
Vladimir returned at 4 a.m.
So we took them to our place.
We slept with Vika in the kitchen, and they were put in the bedroom.

To be in the pool, you need help
But that's my thought
My uncle handed her pictures and boards from her home, and she was riding them home, so that's what she's got.

The Russian army threatens to hit the Kyev missile: they say, "Don't have done this before."
The direct language of Konašenkov: "We see the attempts of diverssions and tasks of hits by the Ukrainian troops on objects in the RF.
If these experiences last, the RF armed forces will strike the decision-making centres, including in Kiev, and the Russian army has previously abstained."
The Russians have caused rocket attacks on Kiev since the first days of full invasion of occupational RF troops to Ukraine.
On February 25th, the remains of Russian missiles struck by the Ukrainian PPO system fell on a multiparty house on the capital Poznicks.
On February 26, the Russian missile struck into a multidimensional avenue at Valeria Lobanovski.
On March 1, the Russians hit a television on the Roadways near Babi’s yaro, resulting in the death of five passages.
On March 2, the Ukrainian PPO systems hit the South Railway Railway Rockets flying in the directions of the Defence Ministry.
On March 14, the fractures of a broken occupational missile broke the house and the trolejbus on the Cornwick in Kiev
On March 18, the Russian missile hit the housing mass in Vinograd, and one person died, another 19 were injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed the modern Retroville TRC in Vinograd, resulting in the death of at least four people.
Mayor Kyev Vitalij Kličko declared that the inhabitants of the capital were evacuated from the city until they were too early to return.
The soldiers explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still strike a missile attack on Kiev, and also in the area of the capital, there are many mines and unexploded ammunition.
The head of the Ministry of Defence Warned Ukraine that the Russians plan to first a series of terrors in the RF territory to accuse Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of Russian army against civilians.
April 1, near Belgorod in Russia, the oilbase exploded, as if due to an air attack of the Ukrainian helicopters.
In the early April, the local government of Belgorod stated that near the city, the “ukrainian missile ” appeared to have fallen.
Apparently, the elites in Washington and Berlin are throwing into a cold sweat from the thought that the natovers would be slain by Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Greenski doesn't talk to them as much as with their voters and society in general.
By speaking in parliaments and in front of many thousands in the largest cities of Europe, the Ukrainian leader does something that was not available to any of his predecessors.
Greenski does not convince European politicians to do anything for Ukraine; he convinces European nations that are chosen by politicians.
And these talks, this excellent stream of strength, touchingness, and times of despair, gradually reach their goal.
As long as the same Baiden is strongly against the closing of the sky, 70% of his companions have already supported this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against the rapid introduction of Ukraine, this process is ongoing.
I understand you, so I don't want us to be a fraud.
The cost that you gather is better to give to people more demanding.
I can come to you and we'll decide wherever we are.

The head of the Office of President Andrew Jermak told us that Russia is starting the "fake operation" on the weapons we're transferred by allies.
Jermack's direct language: "They understand that they're losing war, seeing their durability and trying to "free" the weapons supply by any method.
For example, one of the last fials is the destruction of Slovakia's C-300.
This information has already been reversed by the Prime Minister Edward Heger.
We know the Russian scenarios, and I'll call one of them.
They can run violents that the Ukrainian soldiers are bowling with allies' weapons, and it goes massively to the arms of the Russian army.
I'd like to warn these violins right away.
Because weapons in the hands of the S.U.S.S. soldiers are exclusively sending the enemy to that world.

The international community continues to express shock and resentment after the evidence that the Russian forces committed wildlife against the peaceful population in Ukraine, and Moscow rejected these messages as “provocation”.
"The report of the murdered, raped and severely wounded Russian troops of the Ukrainian peaceful inhabitants is worth the conviction," said Prime Minister of New Zealand Jasinda Ardern to journalists in Wellington on April 4th.
"Russia must answer the world for what they did," she added, noting that its government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kisida called the incidents “the violation of international law”.
The statements appeared after reports that hundreds of peaceful inhabitants were fired and thrown into brothers’s graves or left on the streets in the Kyev suburb, in Bucha by Russian troops who left this area for a few weeks after the occupation.
Photos that seemed to be pictured by the bodies of the lost civilians with tied hands were shocked by many and led to calls to strengthen sanctions against Russia and criminal persecution of the guilty.
France's president Emmanuel Macron stated in the radio interview on April 4th, that there are signs that Russian troops committed "military crimes" in Buchka.
"What happened in Buchka requires a new round of sanctions and very clear action," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be directed to Russian coal and oil exports.
Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez stated that Russian troops could go so far that they did "genocide" in Buch.
"We will do everything that we can to make those who committed these war crimes do not remain impunity," said Sanchez in Madrid.
By speaking on public television late April 3rd, the Russian ISS speaker, Maria Zaharov, rejected the charges as “provocation”.
Without evidence, she stated that the United States and NATO "procured" images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, I think the fact that these statements have been made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials has no doubt of who has ordered this story," Zaharov said.
Rather, Russia’s mino-defense also claimed that Boochi’s picture was “a second set of the kiev regime ” and that all Russian troops left the city until March 30th.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to gather up on April 4th to discuss what it called “provocation of the Ukrainian radicals ” in Buch.
The Russian Investigative Committee issued a statement on April 4th, in which he announced “investigation” for the proliferation of “fake information” by Ukraine on the actions of Russian troops in Buch.
The President of Ukraine, Vladimir Greenski, spoke on April 3th, accusing Russian troops of genocide in the city, and told the leaders of Kremlj that they had to come to Buchi to see what their military did.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are fulfilled," said Greensky in the video, crossing from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a common responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shots in the head," he said.
He stated that the Russian President Volodimir Putin and Russian military should be responsible for the operations of the military in Ukraine.
"When we find people with arms connected and unheaded, I don't understand," he said about the scenes of the victims thrown up in the streets of Buchi, the city of about 35 miles northwest of Kiev.
The correspondent of the Ukrainian Freedom Service, Radio Freedom, saw on the streets of the small city of the body as civilians.
Only in one place a correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw at least 21 people in Buchi’s various places.
The bodies of one group of nine people -- all in a civilian -- were divorced on the ground near the place that, according to locals, Russian forces used as a base.
The victims seemed to have been killed from a close distance.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities stated that at least 410 peaceful inhabitants were found in the area of Kiev, which was controlled by Russian troops by last week.
Thanks, everything's got, we bought it on the list.
"How the occupants were brought to Russia and Belarus.
Russian invasion to Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robbery, rape, murders, torture.
There is another point in this list, which is now much less information about — the delivery of local population to the territory of the enemy.
Approximately in the middle of March, Russian occupants evacuate Ukrainians from temporaryly occupied inhabitants to their territory and the area of Belarus, which the self - proclaimed President Lukašenko actually gave under the Russian military polygon.
The Ukrainian Truth has found the expelled Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" happens and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text have accepted voluntary evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and out of no way.
Fortunately, they're alive and maintain contact with their family.
However, in view of the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were transported to Russia and Belarus under strong force.
Thus, in Melitopoli, the Russians kidnapped the second home staff, took out children without parents, including a 12 - year - old Miroslava, a daughter of the Death Champion of Ukraine from Joseph Zacpensky swimming.
Alexander's family, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vale moved to Hostomel a few months before the war.
Alexandr just got a job at the Anthony airport, located two miles [5 km] from the village.
The family accommodated in a military city, although she was civilian.
As the true plastics, Dennis and Marina have gathered anxious bags in advance, but in the morning of February 24, they weren't able to evacuate.
They didn’t have their car, and the pregrad buses were no one else.
About 12 p.m. on February 24th, they saw helicopters with Latin letter V, followed by the first bullets.
One of them hit the neighborhood.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three weeks, until March 17th, until the Russian soldiers took them to Belarus.
Some 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to ride.
"At the 6th night of February, on February 24th, there were people who spoke not Russian and not Ukrainian.
They ask, "Who's there?" - I say yes.
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, whether there was a weapon.
All men were asked if they were serving in the army.
Women were told, "We have come to protect you according to Ramzan Cadirov's orders."
It was the Chechen OMON, not even the troops, the young boys aged 25 to 35.
They said, "Out in the war we were helped by the Ukrainian, Sasho White (commanded by UNA-UNSO's nationalist movement, Viking, who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Cheen war -- UP), now we are here to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we missed.
We say water, with it was a big problem.
They broke the store, took the goods out of there under "the Russians will take" and brought us six bottles.
There's still a video on the Internet where children thank Cadirov for the food.
So they brought a cowbas after the store robbery and they said, "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Ahmatovich."
No one wanted to speak especially, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child says, "You have seven days to give up our phones," they laughed.
They also kept separated themselves from the Russians.
They said that it was good that they came, because they didn't want wars, the Ukrainians supported, and they were good at all, "The path is a bastard, too, Cadirov, but we can't do anything, because there are our families."
And mostly, they didn't fight, but they were going to rob stores, and they were scattering.
The chickens were brought up, one was tied to one foot to a george tape, and the other was their white violin, and it was called a mutual.
In Ukraine, they were not prepared at all.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... when they were beaten in Booch, so they didn't even take the killers, they asked us, "You have artillery?"
Furthermore, we had a bunch of troops — the Chechens did not know each other; in the first days, they asked the passwords to find out whether they were their own or the stranger.
We had them until March 13th, and then the Russian OMON arrived and followed them by the Ome desant.
They put 30-40 units of techniques between houses -- ours were constantly in it from the Bayractors.
But they came and told us that the S.A.S.D. was gone, but there's Azov, and they said, "Azov" is so thousands of hundreds in Ukraine.
"Chiles have already surrendered" has been in progress since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian, or desant officer, or FSB representative, came to us and said there would be evacuation.
And we listened to the radio -- it was about Buch, Hostomel, thought maybe we were given a green corridor.
From the beginning, we handed our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we're told, "You're being transported to Belarus and then maybe to Rostov."
We're saying we don't want either there or there.
What they said, "Well, regret your child's psychic!"
As it worked, they chased us into the basement and started shooting from under the house -- or the city, or the minometers.
And then it arrived back... the neighborhoods just burned, some of them fell down.
There was a direct hit in our house on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promised to transmit to the foreigners and the Red Cross.
The part didn't go, saying it was for the traitors of the country -- he said, "You're being shot there, they're going to sell you into the organs."
We were driven through Chernobyl, and on both sides there were burns, broken techniques, although the white russians told us that the Russians were taking the technique to them immediately.
A lot of caponics, buried techniques and soldiers.
At the Belarusian space space, we passed improvized controls, many were at all without documents because they burned.
We were placed in the Red Cross tents, they gave us some tea.
And here we hear the shootings, the missile shoots, and there's a sign that Iskander worked on Kiev.
Although those from Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, these planes fly, they're flying on the border."
But we're from the aircraft, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we got loaded into the bus and drove us to the Chunky Sanatorium near Gomel.
His leader, Wanger Vasil Stepanovic, said, "Here, I'm hohol, I'm from Montenegro.
But I understand that Putin and Lucašenk will not stop until those thiefs are beaten.
Poor people suffer!
And we have Lucašenko so good!
Whatever he says, it will be."
They were offered to interview Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted.
The Sanatorium Administration said, "You're already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN representatives (at least they were called) spread the disinformation that men could not go to Poland.
Many believed it and feared to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents — the daughter had no foreign passport.
We had it on Monday, and the war began on Thursday.
In the Ukrainian consulate, there was nothing to do with us, and in Minsk at the station, they said that without passports, no one would take anyone to the bus.
I'll tell you here that the Belarus volunteers helped us very much.
We were moved to Minsk, and we were maintained.
They didn't hold forces in the sanatorium.
Our second group, the migration representative said that you could live here at least a week and a half because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who came to take us to Warsaw.
When we walked near Mosir (approximately 50 miles from the Ukrainian border) we saw balistic missile launches across Ukraine: the missiles first fly out, shine beautifully, and then turn out.
People who were sitting on the bus in Mozir told me that the Russians were constantly shooting out of the polygons.
But I can say that the white-russ don't want to fight at all.
The generals are released from the army.
One woman told us that she would break a son if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk does not believe at all.
They say, "You lie, we are a peaceful nation."
They do not see that their polygons are used to shoot Ukraine.
In Poland there were friends who took us to Estonia.
Now we're going to register, decide what we're going to do next.
In Estonia, the Ukrainian flags are probably as much as the Estonians."
Marina lived in a military city in Hostomel with her brother's family, his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
In the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to the basement of the next house.
Marina itself couldn’t come home, and in principle she couldn’t — no more house.
No one knew anything about evacuation.

On April 1, the city head of Buchi Anatoli Fedoruk announced a joyful message — the Ukrainian military of March 31 released the city from Russian entrepreneurs.
The next day the occupants were thrown out of the entire Kiev area.
However, the joy that the Ukrainian would have felt at this time was dark and hatred, for at the same time it was known that at least 280 peace - residents were shot in one butch.
They were killed on the street, some were tied up and shot in the head, some of the killers were minors.
Murdered and torture traces found the age of Motigin Olga Suhenko, her husband, Igor and Alexandr’s son, who were kidnapped on March 23th.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the brotherly grave, Igora, in the sewer.
Both of the road of 20 miles from Kiev found the bodies of several scratched women stuck in the blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.

President Volodimir Greenski stated that some weapons provided by Western partners were too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, which was published by the President's Office, "European Truth."
"All the equipment, everything they're sending, for some types of equipment it's done late.
So what if, for example, we talk about Mariopol when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100% support, that's true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you can see the price of these changes," said Greensky.
On the question, that's enough weapons got Ukraine to make a difference in the war, the president said, "No, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine was a member of NATO, there would be no war or she would have a different look.
"It would have been different, we'd have a shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I'm sure there would still be no war," he added.
Let's remind you, Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine a new military aid, which includes weapons and anti-ship weapons.

However, in the Plumka (cat - UP) on the bowl and the back paws, it may be a stress, changing feed, and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are removed, but stress is not on me, unfortunately.

Because Olga hears badly and spends most of her time in her room, her grandmother lived in an incognito apartment with her.
And on April 1st, 93-year-old Oxan Poleov first took arms in her life.
"I lived with her in the apartment for 33 days.
It was also hidden from war, and the fact that I was near it was formally coming as always for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend talked, I gave her the reception, she listened four hours, then two hours singing."
The radio was always at the bed.
Most of the time the sovereign spends in his room.

If I heard the sound of her walkers, she was hiding in my room.

The British, who defended Mariopol in the SSU labs, says that he was ready to turn himself in captivity to the Russians
The British, who is a soldier of the marine troops of Ukraine, who is participating in Mariopoli defence, told their friends and family that they would put arms and be captured by Russian occupants.
Source: The Twitter page of Aidyn Aislin, a British who served in the CELs from 2018, the BBC with reference to Aislin's family and friends, Atlas News, linked to the words of the friend Aislin, who spoke to him.
"We have received a message from him in literally, in 48 days, we have tried everything we could to protect Marioupole, but we have no choice but to be captured by Russian troops.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank everyone, I hope the war will be over soon."
Details: Aisleen served in the 36th separate Marine Marine Brigade, which participated in Marioupole's defence operation.
ABC journalists contacted Anne Wood's mother, and she confirmed that her son on the phone said that they were planning to seem captive.
A friend of the military Brennan Philips also confirmed journalists that Icelin in his last telephone conversation told them about the plans of their capitulation division.
He said that ammunition and food ended in the troops.
The journalists of Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that Eislin's division was intending to be captured by Russian units so that they could not go without weapons and bullets into the arms of so-called cateringers.
The socio - networks also broadcasting the audio recording of the telephone conversation, in which Aisleen seems to speak to her friend, a friend of America, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Acelin said that they tried to get out of town in a civil clothing, but they failed.
The British used to tell him that in Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Aislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he took part in the fight against terrorists called the Islamic Power in Syria.
In 2018, he officially entered the CSO lab and made a vow.
Ashley’s friends and close friends called Johnny, and in social networks he was more famous under the nichnamy of Cossack Gundi.

I am not afraid of work, as I was living in the village, so I can and I like working physically.
When You Can Bring Things
It's very interesting in your tradition, we're going like that for Christmas.
Last week, the Supreme Council adopted a draft law 7176, which is called "About monitoring of potential threats to national security of Ukraine in the field of economy."
It is surprising that the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the field of economy is... the place that members of the supervisory Board of Holding and Banks are meeting.
The legislative initiatives believe that the adoption of decisions by the supervisory council of holding in Kyev conditional could somehow address the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We know about a large number of new dangers for holding companies, but yet we don't know any company in which there was a need for a physical meeting of the supervisory Council at the location.
The potential threat of such a law understood is a great basis to "continue" all profits in the difficult reform of the states after the Revolution of the Reality, including independent supervisory councils, and then set up manual governance.
Such as was until 2015.
Why do they hold the supervisory council, and who should join them?
Besides, if one harmful bill flys under the patriotical voices, then the other can fly tomorrow -- for example, the proZorro system of pro-Zorro or NBU independence.
Many things can be written for war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the war and the law of 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this standard was added to the comparable table of the Act 5397.
In general, the desire for a supervisory council has been circulated among some national electeds for a long time.
Not for criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the law, we will consider the arguments that explained the need for acceptance.
And then we'll make our proposals to solve the issue of government management during the war.
The first Deputy Minister of Economy, Dennis Kudin, explained the need for this innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other communications, which would prevent the remote work of supervisory councils.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory council can't make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the company's work can be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will he be able to prevent the movement of members of the supervisory council to Ukraine?
Imagine a cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory council (which are most of all) put their personal security above the company’s interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.
Then, according to the law, they can be released.
And then, it's probably going to lose the quorum, the necessary supervisory council to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not quickly be possible to appoint new independent members of the supervisory Council because the law predicts the need for a competitive election, which is in the average of 3-4 months.
So the decision proposed by the draft law 7176 would probably not be able to save from losing the supervisory council to make decisions, rather than to make it possible!
The national deputy, the author of the law of Dmitro Natalucha, gives other arguments to his support.
Especially, he said, "a lots of businesses, including the defence-industrial complex (OPC), now need relocation," and so it's hard to imagine that people can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vienna to Zoom."
First, in Ukraine, there are almost no OPC companies that have supervisory councils.
The supervisory council is unless in the Ucroboronprom, which is essentially managed by almost all OPC states.
But even in the Ucroboronprom, according to the legislation, the supervisory Council has quite limited powers, and all its members are carrying out obligations not a free basis.
The full power in the Ucroboronrome belongs to the Director-General, who will, in fact, decide on the need for a relocation of an OPC company, which consists of a concrete component.
Furthermore, this argument does not endure the criticism because the law of 7176 does not make any changes in legislation that regulates the activities of OPC holdings.
Mr. Dmitro on his Facebook page also gives arguments that can be applied to the "emotional" category.
These arguments generally have nothing to do with the improvement of the efficiency of holding and holding banks, but let's try to figure out some of them, "respective foreign experts at the first word "war", leaving Ukraine in 2021, but they remain members of the supervisory councils in Ukraine's state enterprises with a full salary in several hundreds of thousands of funds, while Ukraine itself actually suffers from war."
First of all, this is manipulation -- most of these members of the supervisory councils never lived in Ukraine, and they only came here periodically.
So to say they leave Ukraine, softly speaking, unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of the supervisory council have been engaged in online meetings for a long time.
This tool is long widespread in the world’s practice, and in absolutely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
We should also not forget that membership in the supervisory council is not a full-time job.
These people usually have a different job, and they're just electronic communications helping them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims only to foreigners.
Interestingly, why does Mr. Dmitro not express identical claims to members of the supervisory councils that are Ukrainians?
Because they are not at the location of their companies.
Speaking, this is not the first populist attempt to remove the aliens from supervisory councils, and war is just a new convenient opportunity.
I'm in Ukraine looking for the possibilities of a temporary shelter in the family, with me two children.

In the Brovarski, Hightown and Buchan regions of the Kyev region, which were released from the occupants, a strong commentary hour will take for 2 hours.
Pavluk’s direct language: “In the inhabited places of Brovar, High City, and Buchan, which were under the Russian occupation and were released by the Ukrainian defence forces, the commanding hour has been strengthened!
In these cities and villages, restrictions will be operated from 21:00 2 April to 06:00, 5 April."
Details: The head of the robbery says that at this time it is categorically forbidden to stay on the streets of the inhabited sites and in other public places, to move by transport and walk.
The inhabitants can only go out to the street when the alarm signal is called to move into hiding.
Such limitations include to clear the consequences of Russian aggression — to clean and mine the territories.
Omelanjuk called on people who left these areas to keep away from returning home.
In the rest of the Kyevland, the commanding hour will last every day from 9:00 till 6:00.

I only added the explanation of the incaso below.
I've already got a bill, I did it in another bank, because I had to get a bill to work.
The Serbian defence budget has grown in geometric progress for several years.
Over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the update of military technology and the acquisition of modern systems, rising 22 places in the list of the most powerful military forces in the world.
After the full aggression of the RF against Ukraine, the Western countries took it very seriously to predict possible aggression in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian and Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.
If you don't mind, I'd be here.

If you're in Czech without driver's permissions, you're forbidden to drive a car.
Other frequent questions about driving rights:
I have a driver’s license in Ukraine, can I manage it in Czech Republic?
However, if you are in Czech Republic for more than one year, you should exchange it in the municipality for a Czech driver’s license.
The term of the driver’s rights is over, what do we do about it?
• The term of action ended after 1.1.2022 remains real.
• The term of action ended until 1.1.2022 - is unrealistic, and you should be tested,
I have a real Ukrainian driver's license, and I want to exchange it for the Czech:
• By staying in Czech Republic at least 185 days in the calendar year
• it may be replaced in the municipality according to the place of residence.

Lucašenk’s forces detained three white ruins 27 and 28 years of age, involved in the destruction of two relevance signal lockers under Osipovics, which provide railway trains.
Source: Radio Svoboda, Spring Protection Centre, head of the Criminal Police of IMS, Gennadius Kazakevic, quoted by the Belta Holding Office.
The IMS Belarus reported that the night on March 30, for force support, three Bobruisk inhabitants were arrested, one was injured.

At the end of March in Belarus, at least 40 railways were detained for diverssion.

The United States prohibits investment in RF and introduces sanctions against Putin’s daughters
The United States, together with G7 and the EU, are enforcing new sanctions against the daughters of the President of RF Putin, the largest banks of the RF Alpha Bank and the Sberbank, as well as the prohibition of all new investments in Russia.
This is the report on the White House website.
The Sberbank is the largest financial institution of Russia owned by the government, and Alpha Bank is the biggest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets relating to the U.S. financial system, and will prevent US citizens from taking business with them.
Furthermore, the States will take full ban on new investments to RF.
To this end, the President of the United States, Joe Byden, will sign a new order, which includes the ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens, regardless of their location.
"This step is based on more than 600 transnational companies' decision to get out of Russia.
The exit of the private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large separators, financial institutions, as well as other providers of services, such as legal and consulting firms," says the White House's statement.
The third step of the new sanctions from the United States was the restrictions against the large Russian state enterprises of critical sphere.
This will prevent US citizens from operating with these organizations and freeze their assets from the jurisdiction of the States.
The detailed list of Minphine will be published for the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the full blocking of the assets of Putina, wife and daughters of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Lavrov and members of the Security Council of Russia, including the exhibitor and Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev, and Prime Minister Michael Misustin
The sanctions disconnect them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.

Can I have Monday 25.04?
You can take the kids with you, the toys are enough :)
I guess about Daddy
I'm probably very naive or very in love, but I'm gonna figure something out with these money.
We'll do it sometime.
But as it will be paid, please, no credits.
Write me straight, and I'll help you.
We're your partner or I'm not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
You need to take the clothes you gave with me?
It's not my day today. It's broken in the living room, one in the morning.
Something came from you, I don't see that.
I am also very sad
Let me remind you of the invoice later
You're the only one who talks and understands Russian?
What day does a colleague want to clean up the house, and how many windows the house has?
I'm ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can't share with you.
I'm advising you to read Joe Dispense, he's researching on the effects of external factors and forming new link neurons.
Natalie Nagorn's journalist television channel 1+1 published a video from the 36th maritime troop from Mariopole in the morning.
The military says that they had no weapons left to participate in fighting, and the mountain of the wounded.
They said "the account goes for an hour."
Before that, on April 11, 36th, a separate marine brigade, which participates in Marioupole's defence, published an appeal to the Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement stated that 11 April could be the last fight for Marioupole Protectors, and the Ukrainian military command was not linked to the fighters for two weeks.
The social networks expressed a skepsis that was published in Russian.
The Chief Commander of the Ukraine's Armed Forces Valeries Fair assured that the connection of commanding with the defence forces in Mariopol is, and the details of the defence operation should not be a matter of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block the Ukrainian fighters in the Ausstalle factory in Marioupole and use chemical weapons against them.
At the evening of April 11, Russian occupants dropped the poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariopol.
According to the leader of Azav, Andrew Belecki, the RF army used chemical weapons over the Ausstal factory, which are held by the fighters of the Azov Polk.
Thank you, I'm going to be in line with you, that would be very good.
The same situation, so far we're staying here
2 hours of ride ) walks, mom and back shops !
It's not important.
She forgot what she's gonna do here.
The Czech drone squad has launched flights over Ukraine today.
Almost 50 professional coppers will be served for discovery, and some of them will be directly destroyed by the enemy enemy entrepreneur.
Two Zacarpatian and two Czech brothers “birds ” sent to Ukraine earlier yesterday by the deputation of the Mucacaev City Council, Volodimir Labutenka.
Today, they were brought by drones on their assignment with the head of the village council and the coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasil Szczur: they were received by special divisions of the Ukrainian troops in various cities where fighting is now ongoing.
For the most effective and safe use of the coppers, we're going to leave their dislocation places in secret.
Four friends who help the Czech army not to stop, say that in the nearest days to Ukraine, many other interesting gifts will be sent to the destruction of the Russian occupant and the saving of the lives of the Ukrainian heroes.
I don't care, it's okay, I love the sweet thing, but I can do it without it.
I'm worried that we can't make it.
I soon return to Ukraine, continue to work
If it's okay, I'll agree.
I'll try myself, but if there's a problem, I'll write you if I can?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally at the elderly lady in the village in Job, she saw me and that I was pregnant but I said there was no housing.
Maybe she'll be happy, and she'll get up in the mood
My phone was repaired today.
And I think I'm freezing today.
I've had drugs and tea, and I feel worse, but I'm not critical.
I am also sorry, but I'd better meet you when I'm healthy.
When you're gonna have a time, throw me the music you like.
I'm sure you're having musical improvements.
Mom and Dad need to listen
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's cart.
Today it was cooler and rain, and tomorrow it's got to be warm.
But it is not a pity for the devastated houses, for people who are abused by the occupants
In Herson, the occupants came from the Memorial of Slava Ukraine in Herson on the street of Prekop.
Details: It is noted that unknowns destroyed the flag of the European Union, broke the panels with the photos of the Sky hundred and the dead in the Russian and Ukrainian war.
The occupants destroyed the portraits of the heavenly hundred heroes and the dead participants of the Russian and Ukrainian war.
They took the flag.
Good morning, thanks to my children for Christmas, we don't have this custom, so we didn't know, give children just chocolate and cookies, maybe something else was needed to give.
In Czech, there's someone to talk, if anything.
Because I'm living a type of group by twelve people will be here, and then they're going to work.
Hey, it's a little better.
I've been in the yosles today.
I've been sleeping there even today.
So we have a great progress.
I'm sure I'll bring the cookers another time!
I don't have the power to do it.
Since I'm pushing away from days and time where there's a cleaning job after visitors, I can say about April, because I already have an approximate timetable for the cleaning of apartments.
In May, I can say about at the end of April or early May.
I just asked if you had anything to say about it.
Hey, I'm sorry I haven't been cooking dinner for a while and a little sleeping.
If you still mind, can I come today?)
or I'll meet you after you arrived.)
He's humble, he's been learning a lot lately, and he realized that he really needed it in his life.
It's been very good.
I was a little shocked that I worked with people in such a high position.
Today she had a lesson from the lady who is the director of the Economy Division of the edge of the height.
She was very pleased with my work.
It's a mistake in the jasles, acting well.
On Monday, I have to give a confirmation of the work and the cash paid for the yosles.
I'm lying on Friday
I do nothing but a lot of them and sleep (and drink a lot of water)
If they're going to the doctor tomorrow, I went with you, if you can.
I have to bring another analysis.
I don't have to go again.
It's a very bad work, it's bad, it's bad, you need a master, you need to fix it.
That's how it's enough.
Can you send me the right email address?
I want to send you invitations to the Czech course you've entered.
And are the children feeding there, or should they be brought with them?
And now, for a moment, there's one question to you.
If You Need Help Write
If I'm not wrong, you're celebrating the Passover today, right?
We didn't want you to gather money from the beginning, so that people don't think we're speculating about it!
But I didn't have two points to fill out online:
I'm going to bed resting, getting power and energy, thank you for today's present.
That's a great idea, I'm going to watch the video, and it's gonna be good, because the whole family's gonna draw.
The Karazine University invites workers and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, hearings and rumors.
Just be guided to official information.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who remained in Ukraine, also helps the army
I collected some work for the portfolio.
After the holidays, they have to run the Internet.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
How I'm counted the day that I wasn't at work is a passage
Headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Pridnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army can take the provocations in the Pridnestrove region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighbouring state.
In literal: "The Russian Federation of Provocational Actions in the Pridnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova is not exclusive to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighbouring State."
Details: The opponent continues to create the next army grouping for action in the Slobodian direction.
Probably in the nearest days, the occupants will try to restore the attack.
Furthermore, the enemy continues to prepare and dispatch a personal composition, weapons, and techniques to participate in fighting activities in Ukraine.
Weapons and military technique are being prepared in the station of the permanent dislocation of the 60th separate Motor-Shooting Brigade (Monastery) of the 5th Universal Army of the Eastern Military District.
Probably the specified weapons will be transferred to a temporaryly occupied area of the Donetsk Area.
Also, 29 of the General Army of the Eastern Military District is being held to renew the losses of the batalion Tactical Group of the 36th separate Motor Shooting Brigade (Borza, Zabaikalland) of the Universal Army of the Eastern Military County.
An enemy feels a particular problem when compiling the driver's positions and the drivers' mechanics.
The reimbursement of the selected personal component from the point of permanent dislocation is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Probably, in order to violate the delivery of goods to the places of fighting, it will continue to strike into transport infrastructure in the territory of Ukraine in order to destroy them or get them out of the system.
Determined forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks from the strengthening of the protection of the Ukrainian-Bilorus border in Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobodian direction, separate divisions from the sixth general army and the Northern fleet coastal troops continue to block the Harkov city, and the artillery arms of the city are undergoing.
In the Isuma direction, an air exploration of the area is ongoing to identify the positions of the Ukraine Armed Forces.
For this, the opponent uses the BPLA "Orlan-10".
With forces to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to invade in the inhabited places of Longeňke and Dmitrovka, had failed and left his previous positions.
In the Finnish direction, the opponent continues to focus on the control of the inhabitants of Popasna, Rubetne, Lower and Novobahmutka, as well as on the full control of the city of Mariopol.
The enemy tried to strike in the area of the Gold, and he had no success.
In the city of Marioupole, the occupants are going through the artillery and aircraft in the area of the Ausstalle factory and the maritime port.
Force of individual units, the enemy carried out the army positions of the Ukrainian troops in the areas of the inhabited places of High Piella, Employee and Marian.
There were four attacks of the enemy, five tanks, eight units armed, six units of car engineering and eight opponents.
Don't you understand your thoughts?
We'll usually try to make it, but I doubt it.
How can you sleep and I'll hold you?
You sure you don't mind if I come?
Maybe you just don't want to see you today, so tell me, I'll understand.
Thank you, we haven't watched TV at home, and so more than 1 plus 1, we don't have to set up :)
I'm going to turn on the TV only to listen to the Czech language.
I'm running out of a month's package of tariffs:
Can we do this on the phone today?
Buy tissue for sewing, canvas, threads to sew
I understand that I can prepare the material in this area.
I'll ask her, and I'm a little embarrassed to ask, and she's giving us so much pies.
I'll meet my father later, I'm sure.
I read the announcement in the Facebook, and it's probably Google wrote something in his own. I think the phone number's enough.
Good afternoon, we've got the things you brought, but are there things that we can get on us in 10 min?
I thought about work.
If the director's accommodation, I can start to work from the next week, because tomorrow afternoon, I'm going to go to the work office to give papers (if it's possible, because it's very big turns) and on Saturday rain:
I'm looking for a brigade at the beginning, it's a really nice chemistry school, I'm learning Czech to know perfectly, a dream of working on Tevi.
Friends of age and not much, friends that I don't know personally, friends of spirit and mind.
Now you too have come to a difficult time.
During the last month, I have been in contact with many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned from your feet to mind, as is the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are running from Russia.
And many of you have admitted that they feel guilty and ashamed because of the actions of your country in relation to your neighbors.
Because of why they're subjecting Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you, activists, have been threatened for a long time, and you have been preparing for a decisive strike.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Alexander Churchas, my very old friend from the Memorial.
So let me tell you a little later -- as usual, Sasha remarkably replied. — Now after the search, we're walking in ruins.
Others are actors of culture, artists, criticists, writers are impressed by the sudden crash of your weak world.
No one of you likes Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: except for very few of you -- those who worked at the Memorial, the New newspaper, the Echo of Moscow, the Meduza, the Naval Organization and the bunch of other places -- have many of you done anything to resist this regime?
Except the participation in mything when they're still on.
Also read the column of the Russian journalist "Late to hide, to keep quiet"
And if so, are you sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your lasting indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive cooperation, which may now be a great burden for your soul and heart?
It wasn't always.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you had freedom and democracy to a certain extent -- an irregular even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was not better than 1917.
Why is every time you finally have a revolution, you're finally covered by such a strong fear of embarrassment that you're looking for salvation behind the king, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
How many people he kills, you still feel safer with him.
Indeed, mistakes have been made.
Instead of capturing and publicizing the KGB's archives, like the Germans from the stase, you took your soul on the Dzerginsky monument -- and allowed KGB to sit down, update, transform and take power over the country.
When you were put before the country's robbery and the return of communists, you did not fight for the third option, and you humblely reconciled the robbery.
In 1998, your economy has fallen down, and that meant the end of the mass myths for the great social justice or against the war in Chechenny.
The main concern was survival.
A young, entrepreneurish, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Some of you have bought it, but you have voted for it either, or you prefer not to vote at all.
When he started to compare Chechnia with the earth again, most of you closed their eyes to it.
I remember well those years.
At that time, I worked in Chechnya, helping the people suffering from the pathenical anteterrorism surgery, and with my eyes, I saw the ruins of the Terrible, Katar-Jurta, Itum-Khale, and other cities.
Sometimes on the weekend, I went back to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We were drinking, dancing, and sometimes I was trying to tell you about the horrors I was witnessing: torture of peaceful people, the killed children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of their families.
You told me, "Brow, we're tired of your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.
In my answer, I was upset, "It's not my Chechnya, it's your Chechnya.
It's your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid stranger here.
This is your government bombing one of your cities, killing your companions."
But no, it was too hard, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then a economic rise in the middle of zero, caused by growing oil prices and willingly viewing that part of the money stolen remains in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you began to make good money, some made rich, and even the poorest of you bought a new home and found a better job.
The prices have grown, but is it a trouble?
Moscow celebrated and slipped from the shift.
When several opponents were killed — Jurij Čekochin, Anna Polytovski, Alexander Lithuanian, and others — many of you were shocked and horrified about what happened.
Nevertheless, it did not continue.
When after two terms, Putin transferred the post of President Medvedev, and he seated the premier's seat, I see you barely paid attention to that.
After a few months of the government of Medvedev Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored or silently silently.
How many of you have met in the next years on the mountain hills of Goodauri, in the Casbeagues or in the Café and in the Turkish Tbilisi baths until the part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we're hardly in the west doing a lot if we're doing anything.
A little anger, a little sanctions; but what was the point that Russia violently violates international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and internal market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the heavy 1990s, it was the most important thing.
But at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin again exchanged places with Medvedov and seated the presidential chair as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went to massive protests.
The Naval's name has become a transparency, you haven't walked out of the streets for six months, and the regime finally felt horrorly as if it was losing the ground under your feet.
Then he struck in reply.
At first, alternative acts were organized, then more reprising laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with humans.
Thousands were behind the nets.
Some have received huge terms.
"What could we do?"
I've heard that so often, and I can hear it so far.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by the Prorosian president, who deceived their European expectations, they once captured Midan and never left him.
They built a tent and prepared for strong defense.
When the police arrived and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, armatures, and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of running, the protesters went into an attack.
Many have died, but they have won.
An escaper became Yanukovic, and Ukrainians returned democracy, the right to choose leaders and to expel them if they do their own business badly.
Midan didn’t like Putin very much.
It was a bad example.
So, using the general confusion, he took Crime.
Some of you have been opposed, but the benefits of this are little.
And how many of you were excited!
As far as I know, 91% of the Russian citizens have supported the anexis.
From a suddenly new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his shakes suddenly returned to 180 degrees and began to worship him.
I have a problem finding the reason, because we have quit talking immediately after that.
Others who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you were hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogues and parks, just like new after the restaurant started by the Mayor of Moscow in 2012 -- with their benbecks, their generally accessible whiffy and the hipster coffee.
Indeed, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful, and it's just getting better.
You barely noticed Syria.
There were terrorists, weren't they?
Even the Moscow editor, who released my book about Syria, revealed it in an interview, because I didn't understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there, and I saw the streets of Homes shoot the state snipers cold-bloodedly at my children's peers.
Among all Russian citizens there were only your soldiers who started bombing thousands of peaceful inhabitants in 2015 through experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Nimeller:
"They first came for socialists, but I spoke-- because I'm not a socialist.
Then they came to pick up members of the branches, but I talked because I'm not a member of the sites.
Then they came for Jews, but I spoke because I wasn't Jewish.
Then they came after me, but there was no one left to say anything to my protection."
How many of you spoke of Chechen, Syrians, or Ukraine?
Some of you did that.
But the majority talked.
Some really say now -- like Dmitro Gluchovski, Michael Shishkin, Michael Zigar, Maxim Osip, and others.
Most are allowed to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Osenikov, risking to get into a new GULAG or to build a company to the Naval.
As for others, you know the best of the country in which you live.
So I'm sure you understand that when Putin gets to deal with the Ukrainians -- or that seems very likely, if he doesn't, he'll take you.
For all of you, my friends, for those who are courageous, but mostly alone went to protests, and has still been a small term, but soon he will get more serious.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed a disagreement in social networks (i.e. even black square in Instagram) or spoke in private conversations with workmates.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of deprivation were given just for an anecdote, they remained in this far past — and now they are very likely to wait for you in the future.
Who will then speak for you, and who will remain?
The example of Ukrainians -- even more than in 2014 -- scares the Patini regime: they prove that we can fight it.
And that intelligence, motivation and courage can stop it, whatever oppressive is his advantage on paper.
In view of everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that war is at all.
But you, my friends, know what's going on right now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends, or even relatives in Ukraine that you support.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You understand what it's going on.
Beautiful life in exchange for your silence came to the end.
Your choices are just homma, your laws, if you don't take into account repressives, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media are gone, your economy is ruining faster than I write, you don't have any credit cards to buy a plane on abroad, even if any flights are still left.
Now Putin will not satisfy your silence; he will require your consent, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can try or go somehow, or you'll be smashed.
I doubt you see another option.
Still, one remains.
Which will eventually collapse this regime.
And perhaps, in the conditions that have come together, you will need less than you think.
Consider it.
The spark will not explode from you: because of the economic collapse that moves to Russia, it will probably be burned in the province, in small cities.
When prices fly, and the salaries will not be paid, those who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will go out of the street.
Putin knows this and fears these people more than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is you, my friends.
But if every city comes out on my own, as it has been happening, it will not be difficult to suffocate them alone.
It'll be necessary to organize and coordinate, and the crowd will have to turn into a mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool -- the Internet that the mode can limit, but it's still working and which can be fixed almost under any circumstances.
The Naval organization was broken, but you can create other, more informal, more decentralized.
A lot of you, you millions.
Moscow police can handle 30,000 people in the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If it comes over 300 thousand, it's going to be shocked.
We have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to the case?
After everything he made them in Ukraine, what did he make them go through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will feel a clear fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be afraid if I were you.
In the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to ignore their owner, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really try to gain it.
But even if you don’t do anything, the lives of many will still be lost in vain.
Your son will put a joke in the computer game chat -- and he'll be arrested; your daughter will express annoyance on the Internet -- and she'll be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes -- and he'll die in a gray cell under police clubs.
This is what's been going on for years -- and it's going to continue to be increasing through increasing and increasing scales.
So you don't have a choice, and if you don't do anything, you know what this is gonna end.
Act cold - bloody, think strategicly, and make it real.
We were on Friday at the class, we were told that we could come on Monday.
We'll be home at night
What do you think I'm a secretary?
Vico, how often do you go to dinner at a expensive restaurant?
I'm going to dinner at a expensive restaurant.
I'll try to explain everything to her)
So we liked it very nice and we wanted something more, so that's the best option.
She was in a room where a lot of people were tired of energy.
I feel bad, cough, temperature, voice, weakness, and head turns
I have to go to that government of work
We already did it, but we said who registered in April will only get the money at the end of the month.
Thursday we need a leave, we go to the doctor with the children.
But at night, there was a lady who liked your work, and she would like something from you in her house.
I'm expecting her new news, and I'm sure I'll let her know.
When I worked in the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, spent a lot of time and strength.
I had a complicated psychological, responsible, mental work in which I was completely disappointed.
It's a very pity of the lost time, but it's life experience.
In my personal life, I’m communicable, but I’m serious about marriage.
There was one man I had to marry, but he died, a heart problems.
I believe that people must love, respect, trust each other in order to create a family.
I haven't met this one yet.
Good afternoon: Where can you buy forms in Yehead to bake the belt (paper or silicone)?
All right, thank you for the advice, I'll bring a testimony to the Vale right now.
She's got a DCP in bed, now she's got a knife broken in a hypse, a cart in a laying position, all the food is washed in a blender.
Mr. Reichard, I'm sorry to bother you at the unemployed time.
But I have an important question to you.
I went into the game room today to Natalie, to say hello to her.
She had a frustrating situation.
Because when the kids were going home, one mother refused to take a child because she said she came to look at things and put them in that room with clothes and Mr. Valeries opened our child room yesterday until 7:00.
Is that really possible?
It's a working time for the room until 4:00 p.m.
And eventually, it is our responsibility.
But I don't have a load to open a very weak web page
Good afternoon, we're all right) Cola works, they filled the invitations yesterday, and I was working with the elders before the high school examination.
It's the hardest thing to do with geometry.
On Saturday, Vladimir helped us.
Vika is studying universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
We are very grateful for the Housing
Yeah, but I thought you didn't fill out.
We'll try to get the sum up to the end of the week to calculate
Situation on Russian invasion – briefing of the advisor of the Office of President Alexia Arestovic (10.04.2022)
The president's leader's advisor told him about the heroic act of the senior officer of the Marioupole army - he was surrounded and injured, so he broke himself with the radio station so that it could not get to the opponent.
I have a very important question, if I can help put my granddaughter on the account of her five years (bronchyal astma) now she has a scream and a christmas...
We need a family doctor for her to understand a little Ukrainian or Russian.
The doctor’s consultation is urgently needed.
We live in Czech Doll Chabry. we need a doctor who is both here in the Lower Chabry or somewhere near maybe Brno but not far from the metro so we can get to.
The butterfly exhibition was very enjoyable.
The motels were sitting on their hands and feet.
How's your day?
I am so grateful to you, no words, thank you very much.
Mom's staying there since 4 a.m.
Perhaps the housekeeper will leave his phone for communication.
I think it's the best option for me for now in Prague-8.
The director didn't tell me anything about the possibility of a sponsorship payment for the baby's lunch.
They gave me these data to pay.
For a part of March and April, I already paid for food.
If you could help me pay May and June?
What am I supposed to do?
To contact Mr. School Director with this question?
Walk on Mondays or come better on Wednesday?
All your friends will know you're talking to me.
I don't know what to do with my home soon and there's no housing
Did you get out of your relationship first or were you left?

I was a manicure manicure and a friend of the manager.
But we do everything, and we're Ukraine, and what we don't know quickly)))
I want you to find a good assistant.
I thought it was Monday.
Can I ask you to take them with me when you're going home?
I need a tumboo, I can pay for the rent.
I don't know what to do.
We need to go to the embassy periodically, and I'm waiting for them to be able to rebuild the documents, and I'm going to ask. I'll still be looking here.
Besides, I'm interested in talking to you.
