Semilar v. prosecution: Cassation of the former Vice-Mer Tartu will be considered on 4 August
This means that the decision will probably be made at the beginning of September.
The courts of the two first instances to examine the case of Semilarska refused, but in April, the State Court adopted a касation complaint in the production of the State Court.
The Tartu Administrative Court returned a complaint to the complainant on 12 December 2019, as its authorization was not included in the administrative court.
The Court's decision indicated that the complaint had a requirement for reimbursement of the damage caused during criminal proceedings.
“Their issues should be regulated by the prosecutor and the leave court”, explained earlier to the ERR Press Secretary of the Tartu vessels, Anett Cratesmann.
She said that Valvo Semilarski appealed to this decision in the District Court, which on 5 February did not change the decision of the first instance court.
Now the Lord will have to say his word.
According to the defendant of Semilarska, jury lawyer Oliver Neess, his client had been unfoundedly suspected of bribes for about two years.
He now requires the prosecutor to reject the wrong claims in his address and reimburse it with moral damage.
The prosecutor's statements on the special cases of the Lyuna District Prosecutor, Margus Gross Gross, made to him in October 2017, when Semilarski, along with the other, was detained under suspicion of several crimes.
"Recall that when I was detained, the security and prosecution police immediately organized the press conference and informed the entire Estonian Republic that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most powerful local self-government bodies, were sold.
These public suspicions hanging in the air accompanied me for about two years.
Now that these allegations and suspicions have proved false, the prosecutor does not want to say anything about it," commented Semilarski at the beginning of August 2019.
According to Oliver Nees, the prosecutor was outside the legal framework at the press conference, in which the prosecutor should act.
"Affirmation of absorption and trafficking has proved false, but it is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, repeatedly emphasized in its rulings on Russia and in Lithuania that, at the stage of the investigation, the representatives of States should be careful in the choice of words that suspects would not be submitted as criminals before the sentence was issued.
The prosecutor is also obliged by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, had not been held in this case against Valvo Semilarski," said Nees.
"The public representation of Semilar as a serious offender and bribery in the circumstances where the facts under suspicion of bribery are still found unacceptable, which contradicts the presumption of innocence and injustice to the complainant," added the lawyer.
As rus.err.ee wrote, the former Vice-Mer Tartu Valvo Semilarski would not be responsible for bribe charges, the criminal offence in July was partially closed.
At the same time, the former official was accused of a conscious violation of anti-corruption legislation in dealing in particular large.
According to the prosecutor ' s opinion, in the period from 2015 to 2017, the former Deputy Mayor Tartu participated more than thirty times in the urban administration meetings in the decision-making of firms operating in Tartu, with owners or leaders whose Semilarski had actively communicated at the personal level at an outstanding time.
According to Gross, in all of these cases, Semiralska had personal interests and therefore had to be removed from the decision-making.
Previously, as rus.err.eee wrote, the prosecutor has suspected the Semilar receipt and violation of anti-corruption legislation in deals in particular large sizes.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained with another Deputy Mayor Artem Suvorov (Central Party).
The prosecutor and the Security Police then stated that there were strong evidence against both Vice-Mer.
The two officials were then retired.
Subsequently, the case of Suvorov came to court, which fully justified the politics.
The trial on the case of Valvo Semilarska is still ongoing.

How the Economy will affect the decision of the CB to reduce the key rate
The Russian Bank is expected to relieve the key rate.
It declined by another 0.25 per cent, to 4.25 per cent of the year, formally a regular historic minimum.
The regulator views the economic perspectives more optimistic than before, due to the return of a short step of reducing the rate, as well as the tone of the CB statements and the updated forecasts on the Russian economy.
This means that the current cycle of currency mitigation could soon be stopped.
"We continued to mitigate the currency policy, primarily considering that the risks of deviation of inflation remained from 4 per cent in 2021," said the head of the Bank of Russia, Elvir Nabiullin.
They are linked to a significant reduction in economic activity, internal and external demand.
The restoration of the economy, according to Nabiullin, will take over a half a year.
It noted, however, that after the removal of restrictions, the economic processes renewed: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand, the construction and delivery of consumer goods had increased, the annual rates of reducing transport traffic traffic, the promproduction.
According to the CB, in 2020 the reduction of the economy would be 4.5 to 5.5 per cent (up to 4 to 6 per cent), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 would be 3.5-4.5 per cent, in 2022 to 2.3.5 per cent.
Furthermore, the Russian Bank revised the annual oil price forecasts up to 38 and 40 dollars for Urals barrel in 2020 and 2021 accordingly.
Previously, the CB expected $27 and $35 for a barrel.
Finally, the Russian Inflation Bank's projection for 2020 was 3.7-4.2 per cent against previously expected 3.8-4.8 per cent.
The view of the Russian Bank on the situation in the economy becomes more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the mitigation cycle, the economies in Russia and CNG " Capital Renaissance" of Sofia Donec and Andrej Melastenko.
Thus, the Russian Bank has consequently reduced the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of the summer it has already dropped by 3.5 per cent.
And at the last meeting in June, the CCB immediately declined it to one per cent due to low rates of inflation in respect of the depressed demand and the need to stimulate the delayed pandemic and its limitations.
The prospects for re-establishing money-credit policy remain (the next meeting of 18 September and until the end of the year), but the limit is near, the main analyst of Rosbanka, Eugene Koshelev, agreed.
The combination of proinflational risks also indicates the closeness of a break in mitigation of the interest policy -- infringed supply chains, possible increases in costs due to the prevention of the epidemic and more rapid (up to expectations) the recovery of demand, he said.
Finally, the follow-up of the Russian Bank will require greater attention to inflation processes during the season of harvest and external volatility in the context of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev indicates.
In any event, the reduction of the key rate will lead to further reduction of the rates for the most reliable borrowers and, perhaps, in the mortgage, the senior analyst of the Bank's Analyst management, " Opening " Maxim Petronovic.
The correction of the rates will be less expressed than the reduction of the key rate, it clarifies.
The rates for consumption may fall by 0.3 to 0.6 per cent during the second half of the year, mortgage rates may end a year in range 6.2 to 7 per cent, not excluding the BXC Prime Minister Anton Pokatović.
The average contributions, he believed, will also fall, in the coming months, could fall to 4.2-4.5 per cent (now only 4.5 per cent).
Further, they may fall to 4% if the BC reduces the key rate of autumn, Pokatović considers.
