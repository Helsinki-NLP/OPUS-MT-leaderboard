What's he doing?
The new councils of the main city of the CSSD will, in general, have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old colleagues from ODS in Prague and representation.
The journal Currently.cz members of the new CSSD Council "tested", as they know the notorially introduced sang, which came up in the city during the last years when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The Coded Dictionary, which the Prague Political Rupee introduced during the previous era of Primator Paul Bém, describes some of the most famous figures, situations and causes in the metropolitan.
Surprisingly, the new council doesn't understand too much.
At least he says that.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I am in Prague's politics rather a new man," he responded to the test of the "kmotrovski" dictionary for the culture of Lukas Kauski.
And as far as the political veteran was concerned, the Councilman Karel Brezina responded similarly.
Like the term "golf hole."
"It's the only expression you're offering me that I use sometimes."
"I don't recognise the slang generally."
From a vocabulary published by the journal Currently.cz in June before the OS's election convention, she chose a edition of six examples, mostly those who are notoriously connected to the Prague magistrate.
Socialists were supposed to explain the words "Voldmort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "going to the sugarhouse", "boys' throats", "traitory of the capital" and "please".
The three of the councils agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who is to be head of the Prague school in the future - first promised the interview, but no longer answered the phone.
The fifth council Peter Dolinak immediately refused the test.
"I am not dealing with these things at all, and as civil democrats enjoy, I will not appreciate it."
"I am now dealing with how we will understand each other within our programs," he responded.
As it has already been said, Councilman Lukas Kauski would not have reportedly known in the title above that it was an influenced businesser and a friend of the exhibitor Bem Roman Janoušk.
"Voldmort" tells Kaucki nothing, and the only term that he evaluated correctly in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka Tunnel," says Kaucki, and immediately adds, "But I know it more from the newspaper."
"I'll have to pay some language course," she jokes.
The golf hole then, as the Blanka Tunnel, the administration decrypts not only Matador Karel Brezina but also the council for the environment, Luke Shy.
Both social democrats then know who the Voldemort really is, and Lukas Shyem is familiar with where to find this figure - they have the meaning of "going to the sugarhouse".
"I mean to go to some Prague business," is the Shy close to the divorce that it is about the seat of Janoushk's companies.
According to Brezina, he reminds him that his knowledge was more aware of the newspaper than to use such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to test frequents, there is no similar entries of sang expressions.
"I've been consulting with my colleagues, but it looks like we really don't have anything like that."
"We speak more names, sometimes use shorts and comony names," said Prague Chairman Peter Hulinski, whom the aliens named Huld.
"In school, I was called Breza, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," he admits to his own nickname Carl Brezina.
The journal Currently.ch tested the name and works.
The council Weinert is for the participants of Grandpa or less friendly Grandpa, a representative of Miroslav Poche, who warned the cheatings before the elections when sponsoring the party, has a name "Player" in some colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only thing social democrats accept in the interior speech.
Hulin Huldu is not pleased to hear, but Newly.cz also recorded another nickname of this Prague President.
"Doctor of the Owl Law" recalls that Peter Hulinski won his title Judr. to the Bratislav Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of the witches, published the brochure
Women declared in Burkina Faso as witches have several common signs.
It belongs rather to an older generation, they can't get involved in work for example, for health reasons, they are free, and they don't have children.
The witch that becomes, is sent to isolation to not threaten the rest of the village.
"The man will come very rarely to this fate."
"Young healthy women are not moving away because they are helping at work and born children," describes a regular sister who is old in Burkina Faso's capital in a special house for more than a hundred women, which their communities have been exploited from their orders.
The local government has now decided to move against the unusual social measures.
She published a brochure of information that should help hunting the witches to limit.
It's got a hook.
"More than 70 percent of the adults in Burkina Faso can't read," said Die Standard's Day.
Witch accusation is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, who is a neighbor with Burkina Faso, last week died 27-year-old Ammy Hemmah after three women and two men tortured her, poured with petrol and burned her.
The BBC server informed the case.
The perpetrators claim that it was an unfortunate coincidence.
The woman, according to their version, had a oil that was used for ritual anointed.
He said he burned after the group wanted a woman to expel evil spirit.
The isolation of "witches" supports people, regardless of the level of education achieved.
The Der Standard quoted a twenty-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "The eaters of human souls were always a danger," he said.
While the witch hunt in Burkina Faso is trying to be mild in the witch, the government in Gambia has been attended by the president himself in last year.
"Gambian President Jammiy, after his aunt's death, chased a large hunt on a witch who was supposed to share in her death and try to kill a black magic himself."
"To help, he called the shamans from the nearest Guinea, who, as accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the personal security of the president, randomly elected men and women from Gambian villages to the president's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in her report.
In the farm, people had to drink pigs from vegetables with halucination effects, which also caused abdominal and renal problems.
They didn't survive two prisons on the farm.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were released to freedom.
Bakal's satellite: He's drowning in stones, he signed a higher rent
The senior under-powered man steped from the door of the RPG customer's RPG centre Apartments "uglybarona" Zdenka Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried a file and in it a new rental contract for three apartments: his daughter, and his son, who is in the execution of the punishment.
All three just rented the deregulation.
Instead of 3500 per month, the son will pay for the apartment 2+1 second category 4100 crowns since the next year.
"And there is no warm water, and it must be drowned with petrama (stone for solid fuel, recognition red.)," shows a man with a finger in his son's new covenant, for which the signature is full of power.
"But I signed it," explains half angry and half resigned.
The Civil Association BytyOKD.cz, which new rental conditions referred to as "incorrect and immoral," advises the recipients not to sign and wait until 7 December to publish the instructions on how to proceed against them.
But a man just whispers his hand over it.
"One says it, the other one," clouds.
The island becomes a large lab of deregulation.
After the New Year, a large majority of apartments in the Czech Republic are still intact rent.
Currently.cz therefore decided to visit "Laboratory" in person.
The RPG Havirov waiting room is one of the four in Ostravska and on Tuesday at 9 a.m. is already full.
Right next to the door, there's a security security guard and a calling device.
"Pent of 2011", lights a special button on his touch display.
One knock and the machine leaves a paper with a number.
You can't even read "157" and your number is already on the big display under the ceiling.
You're on your turn in half a second.
The rent comes after a moment to ask an elderly married couple, but the haul in the waiting room apparently does not affect new rents.
Most people have come to deal with common problems like others - requests for repairs, insurance events, and so on.
Letters with new rental contracts receive in Ostravska in the mailbox most of 44,000 RPG portfolio portfolio from half the November.
The RPG Apartments suggest an increase in rent by 15 to 38 per cent in their letters.
The special transfer to new rent was opened at the customer center on November 18th.
"It runs over a week, so it's only in the race," the employees respond after a qualification after the client presents himself as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakal's former mining apartments are an exciting topic.
Before the elections, he was taken quite loudly by the Vice-President of Parliament and the island country of Lubomir Zaoralek from ČSSD, and is now full of local newspapers.
"Twenty years after them, I want a new floor."
"Annew, they didn't change my toilet board," the men mentioned in the introduction relieved.
Most importantly, the pensioners are coming to see if they get a discount from rent, if they sign in time, as the RPG promises in a special offer.
The half discount for February rent will also be received by other employees who will sign the new contract by 15 December.
The Havir's "deregulation" restraint, but the questions are definitely not swallowed.
"From yesterday, 360 clients here for 2011 rent, there were only about 40 to 50 people," estimates workers behind the crossroad.
RPG, while on the web and its walls, proposes individual negotiations where it is necessary.
However, if both parties do not agree on the rent, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"It's not a threat, it's information about the only possible and entirely legitimate legal procedure," RPG notes on its pages.
"There no one will judge," thinks one of RPG employees of the apartment and a man on the street in front of the client center gives her partly for the truth.
"I have 13,000 pensions and I have five thousand left for food, and I don't have to judge," he says.
But the employee's reinstatement is just a reality.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek tells them not to sign, so they probably wait," he thinks.
The rental regulation ends in the majority of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and, according to the RPG Apartment, their economic need is increased.
"The existing rental still does not reach even above the necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Paul Klimesh, director of the RPG Residence Portfolio of the RPG apartment, that just an upset rental is the main reason for renting.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG could invest four billion in apartments, for four years from 2011 to 2014, it should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging at the ceiling across the polstered seats of the havirovian waiting room has yet repeated several redly highlighted information.
"The rental increase in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, which is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be the most of 7.50 Kč per meter square and a month," it appears on the screen.
Only 400 apartments from RPG portfolio will be raised by 38 per cent.
"In these cases, it is an increase from extremely low amount of 19.66 CZK per metr square", RPG notes.
In 2600 apartments, rent will remain the same next year.
RPG The apartment promises that deregulation will not rent jumps, but will be distributed within four to eight years.
Furthermore, it adds another commitment: all the money from renting (see graph) will return to apartments, especially to warm savings - new windows and warming.
They should be primarily obtained by people who will sign an increase in rental agreement.
The offices belong to the school, they understood the architects
The Administrative Building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect to hide a mini-school with everything that belongs to it - with colorful walls, intelligent furniture, a bunch of toys, and even a miniature field on the outside terrace.
Since October last year, she may be visited by the children of Arch.Design employees.
The projective and architectural company Archie.Design, from whose athletes acquired a number of significant fireplace buildings, counted with a space for her company mini-school since the first graphs of the Avriopoint building.
Because she employs nearly 90 people mostly at the age of babeboom and cares for women designers and architects to be able to return to work quickly.
Together with the possibility of shortened jobs, the school is the benefit that Archie Design offers to its employees within the social programme.
Contributors and architects are thus able to boost difficult work with baby care.
The mini-school was designed by employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the leadership, they managed to obtain the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-school is financed from the funds of the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme of the Human Resources and Employment and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant funding (in the amount of 2.8 million CZK) they could buy equipment and equipment and provide qualified staff and operation for two years.
After the exhaustion of the financial grant (2 years) the Arch.Design is obliged to operate a mini-school for 3 years on its own costs.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and with a request for subsidy, the Economy Rating was substantially helped.
Careful care is provided by qualified personnel, a full - day nurse and teacher of the MS, so children can go to the school without an age limit, but most of them are three years older.
Because it's a mini-collet, there can be only five children at the same time, but there's more of them in the day.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the school, regardless of the hierarchy of positions in the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the programming package in the mini-school is comparable to the pre-school programme.
Children don't only play here, but they are also provided with quality learning - from basic recognition until after preparing to school cages, they learn English.
The class is equipped not only with toys, incentive games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children directly creates a friendly and positive environment in the company.
Parents can check their child at any time and drop the stress situation with a delayed pickup of children from schools away from their parents’ workplace.
This makes parents more productive.
It is no wonder that there is a naturally loyal relationship between employees - employer.
Arch.Design has thus joined Czech companies offering significant benefits in the collection of new employees are friendly to the family and through this programme he has strengthened the personal marketing.
The bone house is fascinating even after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of the right teacher, the stairs reminds the back of the dinosaur, and the balcony are open with fish mouth.
This is Casa Batlló's house in Barcelona from a catalan architect Antoni Gaudi.
From the local houses, his organic shapes gave him a nickname to the Bone House.
Organic forms, wild colors, unusual uses of stone, fractions of tiles and mosaic, fasada reminder of loops and everywhere available soft curves, all this is typical for Antoni Gaudi's session.
The frontier of the house plays dream lines, soft colors and textures resembled by nature and animals.
In detailed observation, geometry, rhythm and precisely thoughtful order can be seen.
At night, the whole fasada of home recognises even more dramaticly, it is brightened so that the impression of the brightness of colors is still strengthened.
The guilt and shape scrolling is also in the interior.
The wood in the waves copys window frames, branches, decorations of the doors, chickens and sheets.
The house of Batlló, which stands in the Eixample quarter on the disturbing Shopping Street of Passeig de Gracia No. 43, formed by restructuring the house of 1877 from an architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
Investor, a rich industrialist Joseph Batlló, originally insisted on the breakdown of the old building and building completely new, soon accepted Gaudi's idea of unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
Casa Batlló's luggage house, but Antoni Gaudi didn't suggest himself.
The architect Joseph Maria Jujol cooperated with him.
The decorations for the representation apartment of the property owner and the use of the mosaic on the fasade were just produced on his design board.
A number of other creators and artists worked on the fasada.
The joint work on Casa Batlló's home's procurement launched successful cooperation with Jujol with Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the building of Casa Mila’s house and the Güell Park, in which the next Gaudi work was included.
From the local house soon after completion, he earned his organic shapes of the name "Home from Bones".
Others, because of a specific window opening mechanism, began to call it "the house of receiving".
It is also said that the sword of St. Jiria, the patrona of Catalan, is characterized at the top of the building.
Hidden religious motives also contain other statues of building.
Gaudio designed a unique central heating system in his home for his time with rehearsal flows and typical chimneys.
The bizarre may seem their forty-five degree slope.
During the creation of Gaudi, he absolutely disrespected the construction rules of that day and did not allow to be bound by them.
At the beginning of the construction, he received a construction permit from the city, however, the data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, the city Council was refined and requested repair.
For example, the council disturbed the fact that the building involved the pillars in the public corridor.
On the contrary, only 15 days after the challenge of the city part Joseph Batlló requested (and successfully) permission to rent two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery in the second floor, there was a social hall and in the third floor of the bedroom and the private part of the apartment.
The floor was rented by jewelry.
The entire six - floor house is shaving the stairs that can go up to the roof terrace itself.
The main elements of the restructuring were the cancellation of all the right corners and direct lines and their replacement by the walls of curved.
Gaudi also worked with a modern concept of connecting space.
The social part can be fully connected by the opening of the salon doors and a larger company can communicate comfortably without maintaining privately needed for more intimate conversations.
The house from Gaudi’s restructuring was also obtained from a new fasada non-traditional accommodation and two additional floors.
It is also impressive to Gaudi's game with light, blue and white scarfed tiles, which are covered by the inner court, and lamps.
The game of two colors provides maximum lights in all floors of the house.
It was just to bet the principle that the white reflects the light more than the dark, which the sun’s lights absorb the opposite.
The house of Casa Batlo, which was included in the World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by everyone.
In the first floor of the house, the most universe and most honorable apartment is available to the public.
The owners decided for this step until in 2002, at the opportunity of celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They persisted in the examination because they found that it was a very advantageous business and that they extended explorations to common and underpowered spaces, including roof terrace.
The memories entered are definitely not negligible, representing 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have 20 per cent discount.
The sum significantly exceeds the price of entering other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the right atmosphere of the house with the dragon towers, you must quickly companion with one of the inhabitants of the queen and visit it directly home.
How to select mattress and rain: women have different requirements than men
Never a valuable bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface, that is, mattress and roast, give the foundation of a really good bed.
However, it must be harmoniously supplemented in order to meet the specific user.
When chosen, many things, from weight, height, age, health, and sex of the owner decides.
It is also important for the type of interior in which mattress and peanuts are acquired.
Typical example?
For example, on weekends where they don't drown regularly, latex mattress are not suitable because they're slower to warm up.
Furthermore, they have significantly higher weight than standard polyuretan mattress.
It is necessary to reverse regularly.
If they don't have many air channels in the core, and they are still lying on the hard board, they hold moisture: It could also appear under them.
He also decides when choosing.
Who has spent longer in abroad, where many high mattress are often used with a soft layer, it will hardly feel well at low and hard surface.
"Maybe all the hockeyists who came back from NHL complained that they didn't sleep here."
"Their disconnected shoulders, pats and sides needed mattress softening with a layer of lazy pen."
"Those are also recommended for people with diabetes who have nervous system disorders, so they are misconducted with “information” from the joints and skins," explains Sylva Hadamkik, who specializes for a collapsed furniture.
Many hockeyists, but also other customers, she was looking for a lion mattress years ago.
"It's all right today, a suitable mattress like Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be a NHL fighter to evaluate the lazy pen.
This miracle works simplely.
It optimizes its grief and shape according to an absorbed heat, or adapts to your warm body.
There's nothing to push you. You're not going to turn around at night like a hard fight.
You're just gonna get some sleep.
The lion foam also works as a protection against the leaks.
When selecting the size of the mattress to your height, add the length of the footstep, which is approximately 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm in a two-cm double, thus a total of 180 cm.
In separate beds, such as singlists, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For comfort and possible visit.
"And the rule for the width of bed is simple: when you lie on your back, you should have your hands comfortably slipped in the elbow," says Ing. Helena Prokopová, the carrier of the Challengers and decoraters, which has been dealing with healthy sleeping and ergonomy furniture for a number of years and preaching it in professional schools.
In the double bed, each own rain and mattress needs, but here's an eye on shopping in order to relieve the heights of mattress.
Otherwise, there will be nothing but mounting roofs into different heights, but you must not succeed in each bed frame.
Penny mattress should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spinal coster at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on the shape and kicking layer.
"When you touch your hands or sit on the mattress, you must definitely not smell the spray," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of squirrel.
The whole bed, when the mattress and the foundation are like growing siam twins, have nothing to do in the beds.
The mattress wind badly, they can't wash their stream, which is now common.
And since we usually sweat 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat in the night, it is clear that after five to seven years of mattress, one large (and twisted) network will be reminded of.
Therefore, experts reject advertising slogs on mattress up to 25 years, or even for life.
But everything has its own.
Therefore, the advice from sellers: in mattress with a width of 120 or 140 cm hygiene and work, do not give up a sensitive wool, but add a mattress protector that you can easily remove and wash.
Even if the mattress are usually produced today, they have scattered all over the circle, so we will get two parts (for washing and size washing very important!), however, manipulation with larger types (and in one person) can be reminded of a ring of lightweight ring.
Do you have a hard board in your bed?
Never!
Maximumly on bed for visits for one night.
However, you will decorate the board (if it has no longer) with wind holes and use a mattress with a barber and a height of at least 15 cm with stains in bags (with it.Taschenfederkern) and a kissing layer.
Polyuretan mattress does not belong to such a basis.
For non-looking lamel balls with 14 to 18 lamelamas will be suitable latex or sandwich matraces (use of the combination of latex and coconut), but you will always be paid with a larger number of lamels, 28 and more, where the lameles in the area of beder are doubled and can be regulated.
The lamel lamel batches do not belong to a mattress with a pump coster because they do not react to the position.
In addition to lamel's hardship, you can also welcome a so-called shoulder wheel.
It's a special lamel capture, which allows to push, or even slope the lamele to make the shoulder sleep pretty "clear."
For men who have "hands over their backs", it's definitely important.
Even the manufacturers of mattress who in "man" began using the soft zone right in the area of the shoulders are remembering it.
They also remember the women - they're a soft surface in the places of the bowls.
For the most aggravated customers, the wings or deskes with a so-called multitorse feathering are designed.
Pressure is diluted into several points and reduces tension.
However, as soon as you use the right mattress and raste the bad cushion (great and "duced"), most "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow is to fold its heads and tops only to the shoulders so that the arms can be released.
As appropriate size, 50 x 60 cm is recommended, for example, in Scandinavia.
When laying on the side, the pillow should compare the height of the shoulder (with the arm with the shoulder stain or the soft area in the mattress).
Modern mattress have only something to do with the original slams filled with grass.
Because their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least mixtures.
Trendem was just in the mattress.
Oil raw materials of which are produced polyuretan pens are replaced by natural oils, such as juice and soy.
The soy may be used by all the known producers.
"Byo in mattress means that the core is made from the material of clean natural origin," explains Peter Vaseček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress, one of the first was aloe faith.
But you can also welcome the microcaps to relax your fresh smell of forest or leandula.
There is also a division for men and women.
While a man "colds" plant extract from the belly to absorb the mattress heat and cold the body, women instead of drowns.
The extract from red peppers increases blood circulation, so it's a weaker sex warmer.

The matrace made of cold pen (with greater pores with a broken cell structure, is so far more profound than normal polyuretan and offers better flexibility.
The combination of various fragile cold pens and "lady" pens forms multi-zone mattress that know exactly where the head, belts and pats should be.
You will pay for the quality mattress from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those who meet health parameters have lower VAT rates are gates as medical aids.
First achieved in the Czech Republic on this advantage of Gumotex.
It's not easy to spend the mattress and the roast.
Sometimes, an action of manufacturers or sellers can be used, which offers two mattress at the price of one.
For example, Magniflex offers Duofreeze's mattress with all the memory pen Memory to the cover of 11,990 crowns.
But the second can be obtained for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastical pens with open cell structure and high density launched with "cosmic" temporal material Tempur.
It was originally a material for NASA because the astronauts were exposed to an enormous overload at the launches.
Temperature in the warmth is soft, in the cold, on the contrary.
The warm human body is so perfectly adapted and optimizedly disposed of its pressure.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of leagues, but also to increase the comfort in sleep.
Viscoelast pens are used not only for mattress but also for health products, such as special pillows under the legs that distract legs and veins.
For example, local producers use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver pen and similarly.
To watch people, they want more parents, so they want to watch their children.
The fear of its own child brings more people to think of watching through GPS.
The originally created system for car search may also monitor the movement of people, such as the disappearance of nine - year - old Anica Janatka.
The device is as big as a cheese box, but soon it can only be large as an hour.
A number of people frightened the case of the missing Anica, and they started peeing on the means to protect their children better.
Even at the price of disruption of their privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that it's not a spy, but another means to reduce the probability of some tragedy," said Peter Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices to the Czech market.
"I assume that in a certain case, there may be abuse of such devices, such as when they are put in a bag of someone who doesn't know about it, but we haven't met a case like that."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know what the purpose of the box is and how it is used in the emergency.
The child’s psychologist Dana Botchkov notes that if a child doesn't want to wear anything like that, he'll just get rid of it.
"And very small children show great creativeness in how to lose some things deliberately if they don't want to be under control."
"Great expectations have previously caused mobile mobiles in parents, however, that can be turned off as well as this tracking device," said Botchkov.
It also states that it is controversial whether such devices would really help in the event of attack.
"If it comes to a prepared kidnapping, the perpetrator will practically always ensure that the child doesn't have any electronic that can deliver his location."
"It's a phone now."
"When the tracking device begins to be expanded, they will also look for them, because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In that case, criminals will always be a step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, he admits that similar devices can help in the event of sudden attack by pedofiles.
According to Robert Čech from the RC Monitoring company, which offers monitoring services both for cars and for persons, even when it comes to an immediate destruction of the tracking device, his presence can help.
"The device can be configured to regularly send the location after a certain period of time."
"If his damage is damaged, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"The expensive devices have also embedded clonometers, so even if a person just slips and stays still lying, he will send a warning immediately with the position," says Czech.
He believes that a similar service can also lead smart mobile phones with navigation, where a special software can be downloaded.
The problem of current tracking units is either the devices similar to the size of a box of cheese or smaller mobile phones.
Their loss is always such a threat.
According to Pilin from Macro Weil, this is why it is now testing the device that looks like a normal digital clock.
"It will have the greatest advantage in the fact that any aggressor doesn't have to know the tracking device at all."
"Well, he will know them until after a while, and that can give the police more time," he adds.
Whether the tracking device develops into bracelets or trailers, they will still use the same technology as it is used to watch cars.
It is a combination of location detecting through the GPS system (which uses normal autonavigation) and the function of the mobile phone which the current position of the vehicle reports.
The army's got heat ropes to wrap the Czech Republic, but it'll only last two years.
The Czech Army bought 445 miles of ropes that burn the cracks.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence added cords to the storage of 224 miles.
That's how the army has supplies for 225 years.
The problem is that the duration of the rope is two, at least four years.
The army bought the burning ropes from the STV Group, and. s. for 40 million crowns.
The general headquarters in the reasons for the purchase of such a huge amount of fuel ropes of MF DNES reported that soldiers use 60 miles per year in training.
However, from the numbers of military pyrotechnics that the MF DNES addressed, it shows that there would be a very intense pyrotechnic training that would have to be carried out annually by all the generals, officers of the military, secretary or cleaning officers.
The Minister of Defence, Alexandra Vondru, and the Army Commander, Vlastimil Pick, is not unrecognizing.
It's the only way to justify the annual consumption of the army of 60 miles of lighting.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was, the army stock would be enough for more than ten years.
On the contrary, if it would apply to the basic education of each new professional is sufficient to at least two meters of the burning rope, as the experts say, so the army has secured fresh purchases - even with increased consumption of women or special units - supplies for those 225 years.
Soldiers of the Quick Seat Brigade, while Minister Vondrov recently complained personally that they had almost no bullets in hand weapons, so the guns are limited because of the need for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't think they're buying a lot of lighters from us again and again."
"But it's their decision, and they sure know what they're going to do."
"For us, the army is a good customer whom we are trying to meet as businessmen," said the STS Group manager Jan Children.
The speaker of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pajšek justifies hundreds of miles of shopped ropes even by having the army's supplies of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Kicki from the STV Group speaks only of the four-year life of the burner and police or military pyrotechnic even for two years.
"In the perfect storage it may be the four," says one of them, who, as a soldier, does not want to publish the name for the criticism of the army.
After life’s expiry, each ammunition must be carefully tested whether it is still reliable and threatens the soldiers of life.
However, these tests are not free and costs more money.
Another argument of the Ministry is the quantity discount of 445 miles of burning ropes.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's supplies two hundred and fourteen miles," interpreted speaker Peyszek's view of the procurement ministry of defence.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of fire cords of police pyrotechnics that eliminate ammunition from World War II or after the Soviet Army has not exceeded 1500 meters for several years.
And the police always order the quantities to consume this ammunition before life's expiry.
It has proved to her because of the safety of the pyrotechnicians, and it can also gain more flexiblely, and therefore more reliable types of ropes.
The Ministry of Defence has already a significant problem with the elimination of tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two-thousands Czechoslovak army were preparing for Ryn.
The Czech Pyrotechnics that the MF DNES addressed awaits the same problem in a few years: it will eliminate hundreds of miles of old burns that "lacino" buys today.
I'm still drawing from contacts that I got through the competition.
The victory place in the Year's Funny Competition helped Lucas Pytlon to sell his hotel franchise.
The winner of the last year's Competition Major of the year became an eighty-year-old entrepreneur Luke Pytloun from Liberce.
His story of success is like a movie.
Luke Pytloun liked to travel.
And in a foreign place, he realized that in Liberca, there is no quality accommodation for a reasonable price.
He bought a semi-disturbed house with five apartments from foreign brigs and a bank loan.
That he was a third-year-old student of high school at that time was a great courage.
"The current ratio between quality and price of accommodation not gave me to try not to do anything," Luke Pytloun says.
The first reconstructed apartment started renting foreign workers.
All profits were invested back to the house that gradually turned into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in seven years, he gradually managed to open four pensions in Liberca, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
But this year another, the same quality came to him.
"We have just signed a hotel contract in Tissea, where we sold our frenchizing concept and other interested in the French hotels Pytloun reports," said last year's animal number one.
"And on this selling of the hotel's license to operate, the winning of the Year's Animal Competition was very much involved," Pytloun recognised.
The victory brought him greater knowledge and popularity in Liberca and the area.
"People knew me on the streets, often congratulating me further and I have to say that it was pleasant," he recalls.
It definitely recommends participation in the competition to all those who seek something.
Not even necessary to win, every vision is good.
He says he's getting out of contacts and acquaintances that he might not have ever come to.
"Some people I met through the competition, I started working regularly."
The glory associated with the success he believed has affected as much as every employee.
And that he's got about 70s.
"I observe more loyalty and pride in them that they are participating in something that has gained universal recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of the good work of all of us together."
"Only my name is pushed in front," Luke Pytloun said today modestly.
I wish my successor a more calm year than we had in Farmet
The victory's eufories quickly addressed the impact of the crisis.
But because of the victory's goal, Farmet has worse times.
For the price of the first place in the last year's competition, Vodafone Firma's rental in the Slovak house, the owner of Farmet, Karel Ždžarski.
The jury then evaluated the efforts through which he built the company from a small toolshop in the Czech Scalica with the steady-million plants.
"I can say that the appreciation has encouraged not only me, but all my co-workers and has raised our self-contribution to the fight," the winner said today last year.
At the beginning of Farmet's history, it was a desire to do something useful.
So when the state offered to Karl Ždžarsky's father to rent a small workshop as compensation for communists taken property, he did not hesitate, he refused his career in the company where he worked, and with a few friends around his dad, they found a company on plastic baths.
Shortly later, they began to specialize for plant oil foxes.
After 18 years, they became the largest producer of automatic leathers in Central Europe.
Increased awareness even among the non-professional public has reached the company after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers began to see the Farmet mark significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate their collaboration with the company that has achieved greater success in their country," Karel Ždžarski said.
However, the last year, he was not in the Farmeth only in a sign of eufory from victory.
The evaluation was based on the economic results of the company until 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And just 2009 was the hardest year to sell machinery goods.
The top of the crisis that has not touched citizens so much, but companies have already stopped their investment projects and began to limit purchases of new machines and technologies.
"This situation, of course, didn't avoid us."
"The sales dropped by 40 percent, we had to limit production and there was a release," explained Karel Ždžarski.
Lifecapable company must know how to make such unpopular measures sometimes.
But the situation has been managed and the company has been kept profitable, even though less than before the crisis.
However, from what they did not relieve in the Farmet is investment in research and development.
"We have built research and training centres from funds, strengthened presentation on international veleters, obtained primary appreciation in home exhibitions," Ždžarski said.
It all suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The markets are growing again and with them also the number of new employees.
"I wish for the new winner a pleasant sense of victory, but in a quieter atmosphere," Karel Ždžarski tells.
A survey that removes irregular regulations
The Absurdit survey of the year is a fourth part of the business qualification.
Some irregular provisions have already been cancelled.
The unfamous winner of the next year's survey of Absurdita has become the obligation to carry documents to the Office which also are available to officials on the online.
She decided more than a third of less than four thousand voters.
For example, the management of social security required paper exit from the trade register, even if the official could obtain it with two clicks of the mouse.
The survey will change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will not require exemption from the commercial register for insurance checks," said the speaker of the Czech Republic, Jan Burañ.
To devote to all the provisions and regulations that companies and businessmen in Czech Republic must fulfil, and those insensitively discontinued are the sense of Absurdity of the year.
This is the fourth part of the business qualification held by the Economic newspapers and the public is looking forward to increasing popularity.
If about three thousand voters attended the voting, there were no more than four thousand votes this year.
And no wonder, the different legal obligations that only serve to keep business is still enough and enough.
"Eh, in the number of leasters for tax recognition we are in the world's front places," Karel Haviček of the Association of Small and Central Business and Animals of the CRC notes.
The simplification of business has become an advertising goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improved.
According to the World Bank, Czech Republic has positioned at 74th position, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the year was first announced in 2006 and it is held annually according to the same scenario.
Administrative and bureaucratic nonsense can be logged in each year from April to the end of September when the competence is completed.
The Internet address www.firmaroku.cz Then the competition director chooses seven candidates in "anticen" and allows the public to vote on the websites of www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.echned.cz during October.
Absurdity that gets the most voices wins.
More than a hundred, over 105 regulations and regulations of lacking sense have been reported to the survey this year.
The tips were sent by businessmen, but also professional unions and journalists.
Among the "finalists" competition, for example, there was a requirement for cars for road maintenance and speed roads to pay mine, or for businesses with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets to draw every two years.
The list of this year's seven proposals is published on the pages of competition.
The announcement of the competition that is always held at the beginning of November in the Vaclava Square in Prague is part of the hapening which is regularly involved in the personality of political and social life.
For example, this year, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Central Business and Animals, or Peter Kugel, President of the Czech Economic Chamber.
"Economic prosperity can't work where it stands throwing sticks to businessmen under my feet, so my goal is to cancel at least three dozens of paragraphs that are only complicating business today," said Martin Kocourek's Minister for Industries and Trade.
The attempt to disrupt irregular regulation does not recognise in vain.
In 2007, the responsibility of the businessmen was most disturbed to report three days ahead to the animal office in the place where the permanent operational office is located, the intention of traveling with an exhibition or leak.
This obligation was removed by the new animal law.
The second most voted duty in 2007, which was notified to the Office of Work as its foreign employee's service travel to 30 days, was deleted by the law on so-called green card.
And to the third of all good.
In 2009, the regulation of the physiotherapeutics has become a big mirror, refrigerator and two scales in office.
That was a mitigated declaration of the Ministry of Health this year - the obligation to have a refrigerator was declined.
New categories evaluates socially responsible companies
They are valued by ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects.
This year's fifth year's competitiveness is a category called The 2010 Responsible Company.
This competitiveness is to support reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the impacts of their business on the environment and support socially responsible activities," said Patrick Bartholdy, regional mobile operator manager, Vodafone, who is a proclaimer and a competition guarantee, as well as in the case of a rebel competitive competition.
In this year's first year of this special subcategory of the 2010 Volafone Company's main competition, companies have signed up for which the only long-term objective is not to be successful in business.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would issue a separate article.
Although the subject of its activities is diameterally different, the common denominators of their efforts can be considered support and respectfulness.
In one case, for example, it concerns persons with disabilities and other personal problems or health of their own employees.
For example, among the fourteen full-republic finalists, the Prague Software Company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of the responsible company from the Pardubian Region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been a major contribution to the Nadation Fund for the Disaster Children for 17 years.
On its health-infected employees, the old Paper of Poebrad, which has more than 70 percent, has therefore obtained the title of the Mediterranean Company's Responsible Company and was placed in the region as a third in the Voafone Company of the year.
MiRyz Soft, the accounting company, which introduced an eager working time, won on Olomouck, further reduced to the average 35 hours a week but without a deliberately reduced salary.
The jury title also gave her to buy from Czech producers, support civilian activities in the neighbouring environment and protect the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as we can to make our businesses and our administration at least affect the environment," explains Director Miluša Riznar.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Usteck district again thinks about the health of its employees and has given them ergonomic chairs and keyboards, supports their homework and uses the catering services provided by locally protected workshops.
"In addition, we support the Fundation of Man in Distress, which helps the local Roman community in particular," said the representative of the company Ondrej Suchy.
In the latest series, it also stands to mention the activity of the Laundry and cleaning company from the Karlovar district, which contributes to their pension insurance for its employees as an overstandard bonus.
"We are giving contributions to food, transport, qualification and recreation again," says Joseph Strapač from the Bruntale Building Company Times, winner in the Morausles district.
All the regional finalists of the Vodafone Company were automatically logged in to the year's categories, who answered questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the director by 15 August.
Incorrectly filled or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were then deleted by the orderer from the evaluation.
"If the competitive companies did not answer the questions, the Company Responsible could not attend the competition of the year, but they are not discqualified from the "the main" competition of Vodafone Firm of the year."
"The single login is not possible only for this competition, because it is a subcategory of the main competition of the Company's year," explains Karel Goldman from Bison & Rose's director agency.
At the Land Fund in Plzni, the police arrested at the public competition
In the Building of the Land Fund in Plzni, the anti-corruption police were arrested in the last days.
Detectives planted a local businesser in the media sphere and a reality trader, Luboši G.
He reportedly tried to manipulate the public competition to address the restitutional rights so that the property offered in the competition would obtain a specific interesting.
He was supposed to pay half a million crowns for it.
"I can now just confirm that the police are pursuing one person for a violation of a pletique in public procurement and public competition," said the Law of the Chief of the Pluznia State Representative, Antonie Greena, with the fact that further details regarding the ongoing investigation cannot be provided.
Sixty-five-year-old cops were released after 24 hours.
In view of the minimum of official information, how he could affect the public competition, only speculate.
The speaker of the Land Fund of Lubomir Black on the question The Law stated that the police were actually arrested at the disconnected workplace in Plzni during the public competition.
"It was only a client, not our employee," she said.
According to Montenegro, the public competition has the right name "The invitation to submit an offer for land transfer according to the law of land" and shall be carried out when the offered property is interested in more authorized applicants.
"These persons in the context of the challenge offer higher value of their restitutional rights to be arranged by transfer than the value of the property has been declared."
"According to the offered privileges, the order of buyers is determined and the Land Fund will then transfer the property to the person who offered the highest rights," the speaker explained to the Fund.
Apparently, Luboš G. had information on the challenge, and because he was also a legitimate person, because he bought a number of restitutional rights, he offered interesters to land that the competition would not participate.
Apparently, he incassed the distant.
That would explain that he had so much money in detention.
Luboš G. had overstanding contacts with PF in Plzni in the past.
He figured in the cause of the former PF Vaclav Sankota, who was criminally prosecuted for executing the land in the replacement restitution that has already been issued on the location of the building.
At that time, Luboš G. received from the fund, for example, lands designed to build public communications, specifically in the place where the arrival magistrala was to be built into the Industrial Area of the Borsk field.
Later, he changed them very conveniently with a master at the house in the historic center of the city, which was much higher.
At that time, the city must have joined, because otherwise it would have threatened the building by blocking the land.
Housing households attach hundreds per month
The households will have to be paid not only for all types of energy since January but also for water and stomach, heat supplys and somewhere growing and rentals.
From January, families will have to draw from wallets to hundreds of crowns monthly more than now.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent, gas will be approximately 2 per cent more expensive, until you have to pay for a tenth in some cities for water supply and a lot of water supply supplies.
The irritation of electricity should go homes a year more drastic than now.
The prices of power electricity, while all the main suppliers have reduced, there is therefore a significant increase in support for energy production from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaic.
Although the gas is mild, however, at the time when people are the most drowning and they have the highest consumption.
It must therefore also be counted by hundreds of additional crowns annually.
While electricity and gas beat all over the Republic, the change in the prices of central heating is different from the place.
Prices increases are planned mainly for larger citizens.
For example, households in Pardubica or Castle Kings will pay from January for central heating about 50 crowns monthly, more than 1,000 crowns annually pay for families in Liberca.
The inhabitants of Prague again are threatened to receive more than 9 percent of the water and sailing, in case the city increases the rental from the infrastructure.
If the rental doesn't change, it will be added to the Blank 6.8 per cent.
However, the price in Prague will continue to belong in a whole republic comparison between the lower.
In the northern Czech, where prices already belong among the highest, it has water and stomach inflammation by 7.4 per cent.
For example, the rental prices of 450 thousand rental apartments can rise significantly, where regulations have ended since January.
For example, the CPI Apartment, which owns about 2500 apartments in Usto over Labe, will increase up to 100 percent since January.
Those who won't agree with the new rent will put the company in court.
The regulated rentals paid by people in approximately 300 thousand apartments could increase to ten per cent next year.
The Czech children drink with fernet and rum. Beer is from fashion, works slowly.
Fernet, rum, vodka, specially and better whiskey mark stolen from your parents.
These are drinks, after which drinks end most often in the care of the doctors, the drunks who have not been even 15 years old.
Except for children who are treated by a monkey in the hospital repeatedly.
This comes from experiences of doctors who meet similar cases in the hospital childhood department.
"Some beer or wine are totally unfashioned, because it takes a long time before you get drunk."
"Trendem is definitely a heavy alcohol," the Right Prime Minister of the Child Division of Hořowice's Patience in Central Czechs Ludek Pelikan announced.
"When they can pull the bottle from the closet to their dad, it's like whiskey, otherwise it's overwhelmed with a fernet and a vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of pouring her into juice and then it's not so much to feel," the prime minister explained.
And for the truth, the speaker of the Faculty Hospital, Motol Eva Jurin.
"It's usually a fernet or a rum."
"This is modern alcohol today, especially in basic schools."
"In some cases, it was a slippery they brought from their home," said Jurin.
According to Pelican's primary, 13 or 14-year-old drunks at hospital income are relatively common.
Before Horowice, where he has worked since this year, he worked ten years on a pediatrician in Motole, where the ambulances are connecting high school students from a wide range.
"One girl lied with us about four times."
"The career began at the age of twelve, when she was brought to us with 3.5 miles of alcohol in the blood in combination with extasion," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the Holeshovic exhibition for some dance party."
"It's interesting that her mother didn't even find out that she didn't know about her daughter 48 hours," she looked at the prime.
Not the interest of parents or even their significant tolerance to drink their own descendants is considered the main cause of growing child drunkenness.
However, the dependence in the right word of meaning cannot be spoken by experts in children.
"An alcoholic is meant by several years of chronic dependence on alcohol with all the phenomenons that belong to it, and that's not in children."
"In those who are taking alcohol repeatedly, there is rather an unfamiliar family-social background," explained Prime Minister Pelican.
According to speaker Jurinna this year, some 40 drunk children were hospitalized at the pediatric clinic in Motole by half November.
But only those with severe inxication that had to remain in the hospital will get into the statistics.
Children's drunks who take their parents after an ambulance, they don't count at any rate at home.
In addition to the cases where children sit after school and drink a bottle of squirrels, there are three seasonal quarrels that can be relyed on: witches, Silvester and the end of the school year.
"They either drink sadness from the wrong testimony, or they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"But at the witch, I experienced seven children's drunks at once," said Pelican.
A drunk who spends the night detoxication under the doctors is paradoxally in the advantage of the other day who suffers an unpleasant bedroom at home.
The morning headache caused by dehydration and lack of glucose will cause infusion with glucose and nutrition that are missing.
"They're actually better at this because they have a beautiful night experience and awakening and nothing hurts."
"They are only confused from where they are," Pelican admitted that sometimes he would distort the pleasant mood for patients by at least the amount of costs that their treatment required.
The transport of ambulance and hospitalization on the acute bed will also come to tens of thousands of crowns.
"I used it sometimes as a training tool, when I calculated the amount of drunkness they were at the visit to those children and that they could also spend the whole summer in the Brigade to make money for one party," Pelican added.
However, he believes that health insurance is not accessing regressive procedures in which parental costs would be expensive for treatment in children’s drinkers.
Two L-159 aircraft are first in foreign hands in Spain
Two flights L-159 of the total five pieces, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to Spanish Sevilla on Tuesday, where the manufacturer of Casa - EADS aircraft was located.
It's the first time the machines of this type appeared in the property of someone other than the Czech Army.
They've been in abroad only for training or showing years.
It's a two-sided version of L-159T1, which has yet been operated by the Czech Army and which were flying.
The remaining three machines are single L-159.
These are still reserved in Aero Waterway and the trade mediator - the Omnipol company - took them over last week.
When the aircraft are physically transmitted from the Waterway, according to Jan Paiška, the press committee of defence is not yet known.
"The only L-159 flights for the shift were excluded from long-term saved aircraft without any other contributions and investments from the Ministry's resort."
"Double L-159T1 have been changed in current state and shape," said the Law of Peyszek.
He added that the army without double aircraft will not remain because the Ministry signed a contract with Aer Waterways of 200 million crowns for the restructuring of four unnecessary machines L-159 on two double machines.
One new aircraft took over the army in July, the other takes over by the end of this year.
According to Pajsk, the EADS committed to putting the aircraft into the arms of some alliance country.
"The treaty clearly states that the L-159 aircraft collector is the EADS company and will serve to train pilots from NATO countries."
"There is therefore a recipient's thing how this thing will be realized," said Peyszek.
The economic paper has recently stated that, for example, the Spanish Army of L-159 is not interested.
The exchange of five L-159 for one Casa flight and the purchase of other three planes for 3.5 billion crowns approved last year by the Government of Mirk Topolanka.
The Ministry of Defence did not sign up for the purchase of selection proceedings and addressed the EADS directly.
The current defence leadership argumented by supporting the future exports of L-159 to abroad.
The Czech Army bought 72 machines from Aer and only uses 24, and the rest would want to sell.
Casa's shopping planes is probably gonna have a jurisdiction.
The European Commission has sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in the European Court because the planes were to be chosen on the basis of a whole European tend, not by a single producer.
The army has already taken over three Casa flights, the last one should be on the Kbela Prague airport in 14 days.
The longer indicator than the ring is a lower risk of cancer
Men who have a tag longer than a ring are presented to a smaller risk of disease with prostate cancer.
This is a surprising conclusion of the study published by the British Cancer magazine on Wednesday.
It can be connected to the level of male testosterone hormone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of cancer-prostate risk, especially for men under 60 years," Ross Eeles, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help to determine which men should be subjected to the cancer test of prostate, especially in combination with genetic risk or other threat factors such as family health burden, added Eeles.
In 1994-2009, she monitored more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and co-operated over three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants of the study had a right hand indicator shorter than a ring.
The same probability of cancer of prostate was paid for them as for 19 percent of those whose fingers were equally long.
However, in the case of those who had the indicator longer than the ring, this risk decreased by 33 percent, even 87 percent for men to the 60s.
The ratio of the length of two mentioned fingers - formed in the prenatal period - apparently reflects the different levels of sexual hormones with which the child is exposed in the maternal.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer indicator.
Former studies have shown that the testosteron is currently supporting the growing prostate cancer.
The former Czech genetic and former president of the Academy of Sciences Professor Vaclav Paches for CTC said that he knew about this study at the same time, but he didn't think the relationship between the length of fingers and cancer would be "completely proven".
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered by snow on Thursday morning.
On roads and walkers mostly lies snow, travellers ride in many places all night.
The road D5 between 89. and 93. km is closed in the direction of Rozvadov due to several car and personal car accidents and also stands D1 in the direction of Brna in Prague.
The newsmen told the dispatchman of the Central Automotive Club (WAMK).
A truck crashed 91 miles [91 km], two car cars crashed 93 miles [93 km], and the accident demanded injury.
A number of personal cars also ended in the bucket.
Problems are also on the D1 highway to 185 miles in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks hit down there.
The drivers should ride closely to Brn on 190 miles [90 km] or ride over Brno and then travel to 182 miles [182 km] on Kyvalca.
There are several kilometer columns.
There's also an accident on D11 highway, right at the arrival to Prague.
In Prague there is a few centimetry snow layers, the temperatures show minus seven degrees of Celsia.
The car columns are created, for example, on the Prosecution, also the Stierboholska.
The safest transport is the metro.
Tramways, for example, are delayed on the trail between the Karl Square and the Place of Peace.
At 8:00 a.m., the Prague Crisis Office will be seated again.
Railways and airports also deal with problems.
The Czech roads had to cancel seven rapid links because of the snow.
For example, there is a trail from Prague to Kraloup or from Prague to Beroun.
The travellers should check the current situation.
The Russian airport was closed from the middle 11 hours at night to five in the morning.
Most of the roads in southern Moravia are already down, but only with increased caution.
There are three side roads in Wyskovsk, the places are formed in snow languages and in Blanensk are necessary to defeat certain communications in the above places of snow chains.
The most disastrous places belonged to Wyskovsko.
Still there are closed roads: Roussinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kucherov, and also Sharatice - Milesovice.
They're going to have to be putting fresies in their interruption.
When they're passed, they can't be estimated yet.
There is a need for caution in the area of the White Karpat.
The roads that are maintained on the ground for the protection of nature only by inertial rash, which lies up to five centimeters of snow, stated the CTK.
In the Czech Republic, two to ten inches of snow, most falling in northern Czech, many to 18 inches.
There was about 15 inches of snow in the Moraussland district.
Snowing in Czech Republic is gradually stopping.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American Army has put a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known only under the XM-25 code.
Generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban and "to turn the game" in their favour.
The new weapon is something like a small superprecise gun.
Because her missiles are arrayed by a laser with a precision of several meters.
Special bullets of 25 mm, developed for this rifle and containing highly explosive crack, actually operate as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed by exploding not only when hitting the target, but at any point of their balistic path.
Hence, it can be used against an enemy who hides behind some obstacle, behind the wall or in the grave.
Because he is usually not protected, and when a murderous rain of steel gleams comes down on him, it can be removed from the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was participating in the XM-25 development, the new gun is the first weapon for the marine that uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier deals with it in principle so that he finds a goal, sends a laser radiation to him, which determines the distance, so he gets a precise point of intention, according to him, adjusts the intention and pushs the cocktail."
"Let's say you've made 543 metres."
"When you press the detonator, the gun is loaded and fired a gun to a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three metres," said Audette.
Move 400 jobs
Concern Fujitsu will move his branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July next year from the original administrative building to Marienbader Place in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu concern moves his branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant in the field on Wednesday, which specializes in computers and their maintenance, will move in July of the next year 400 men and women's workplace from the original administrative building at the Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in the Lyon Street, part of Frankfurt called Nederrad.
According to the speaker Fujistu, there should be another 100 jobs that are already divided in the region.
The offer of rent was said to be very attractive and large-space offices in Astro Park said they were more satisfied with the working method of employee.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only rented.
The competent director Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankfurt-Nederrad we found a central seat with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent link with the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important business within the region has caused joy in the winners and disappointment in the defeated yesterday.
The leading economic referencer in Frankfurt Marcus Frank (CDU) said it was able to gain a global player.
They say it's "fantastic show of confidence in this place."
Fujitsu is said to be fit in the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Nederrad.
Mayor Bad Homburg, Michael Corwisi (Zelennia), regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
He said the city was informed at time by the company's leadership of his intention.
"Certainly we offered our help to the company," said Corvisi.
But friendship contacts could not change the problems of the manufacturer of computers with an rental on the Marienbader-stage.
As a result, economic reasons were decisive.
Now it is to prevent long non-employment in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and renter of the building will be cooperative."
The house on the Rathaus Square, which has been using Fujitsu, and the neighbouring "Kleine Verticale" belonged ten years ago, along with other buildings on the Marienbader Square to the most disputed construction purposes of the bathroom city.
Among the stations and councils, however, a joint project of the city and private designer, which was criticised for the massive construction of areas that used to be a parking area and also because of the height of buildings.
In 2001, the company of Feri's Investment Advisory and Rating, the manufacturer of a software for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the manufacturer of Fujitsu computers, which was still connected to Siemens.
Buildings used by Fujitsu were obtained together in 2006 by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and after a year the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu-concern from Tokia is marked as the third largest IT-provider in the world.
It offers for example computer companies and servers available and also takes care of the necessary services.
The branch in Ryna and Mohanu is one of the largest in Germany, but most Fujitsu employees are in Mnich.
From Bad Homburg, a daughter of Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moved to Frankfurt-Nederrad, other daughters in this location will be Fujitsu Services and TDS.
In the Administrative Building of Astro Park, 7000 square meters were rented for this purpose.
In the complex - its name points to the star landscape, which is 20 years old, sittings, other than others, the central collaboration of the electrotechnic and electronic industry.
Amazon turns off the server - threats against Assangem
Wikileaks gets in tight.
The Amazon Internet service has turned off the platform for discovery on its servers.
It is possible that this has happened to political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic describes.
The founder Wikileaks Assange is allegedly delayed in Great Britain.
Wikileaks, the disclosure platform, is getting under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their current home server in America and are now looking for an online home in Europe.
Meanwhile, the prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to bojcott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is managed in the list searched by Interpol, is to hold up according to one newspaper contribution in Great Britain.
"Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon server."
"Free Speak in the Free County," informed the activeists of the public service of short Twitter messages in the Wednesday (local time).
Shortly earlier, the Amazon Internet company downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used the secret diplomatic depešites of Amazon Web Service (AWS) to manage a high number of access to documents.
With the Twitter service, Wikileaks explained this step: "Fine - our dollars will be spent now by employing people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after senator Joe Lieberman's colleagues performed the search, published the CNN television station on the basis of the information from Lieberman's office.
The Chairman of the Senate Committee for Home Defence threatened Amazon by boycott, informed British Guardian.
"I'd like Amazon to join this step earlier, in view of the previous publication of classified information on Wikileaks," the Senator said.
In the meantime, Lieberman called to prevent the platform from using servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, inconveniently and unreasonablely, and thus our national security is at risk and threatens life throughout the planet," said an unparty Senator's statement.
"No responsible company -- either American or foreign -- shouldn't help Wikileaks in their efforts to expand the stolen material."
The founder Wikileaks Assange, who is being searched by the Swedish authorities for suspicion of rape, is on the list searched by Interpol.
On the basis of the report in the London newspaper The Independent, 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain, Scotland Yard is also aware of the exact place.
The Internet activist always marked the investigation in Sweden as an intrigue of his opponents.
Speaker Wikileaks Christinn Graffnsson in London said there were also threats.
"Even there were challenges to kill Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is rightly concerned about his safety, said Graffnsson.
Therefore, the founder Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Apparently, Graffnsson responded to the statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, asked for responsible person for the release of Wikileaks for treason being accused and executed.
In Canada, one director of the government, Stephen Harper, probably ironically, said that Assange should be "morned" and Obama could use "the whole plane".
Meanwhile, the White House and Assange spoke of a word shooting.
The speaker of the US President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "funny and absurd", that Assange asked for a resignation from Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton, if she was responsible for the recently published spying challenges to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of one man with websites," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and interests of this country are much more important than its websites."
The American government is now exploring the safety of its databanks.
A special commissioner was appointed by the Deputy Director of the Centre for Anti-terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, communicated the White House.
Travers became responsible for the development of "necessary reforms in the structure", which are necessary after the publication of the messages from the Ambassador to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review how the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The American government also announced that he wanted to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they were to get into danger for the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have given everything to contact them," the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Philip Crowley said.
"We're ready to protect them if it's necessary."
ice cream university
The Gelato University in Bolon is preparing ice cream sugar for a better year period.
The basic course for the future ice cream, which takes three days, is a great interest, and visitors come from around the world.
Where does the ice cream actually come from?
From Gelatier and Gelataio.
Gelatier, Czech, a little old ice cream, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio will extract ice cream from the cold box, delete it and sell it.
To find out, you don't have to go to Anzolo dell'Emilia in Bologna Province.
But who wants to know more about ice cream, he won't avoid the Gelato-University of the Italian Carpigiani company.
In 2003, the manufacturer of ice cream machines established the ice cream university so that the ice cream from his machines would match all the high Italian ideals.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is enormous interest, and visitors come from around the world.
However, several days of special courses are also offered on chocolate ice cream and practices in their own ice cream.
Someone wants in their Midlife-Crisis for a new career, others brave to the thin ice of their unjasted desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all world - from Brazil across Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the movement of Slow-Food and wants to offer a quality European product in the Ice-Cream Ice-Cream country in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something its own after years of stress.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening a ice cream in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one of Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian woman at Julia's home has arrived because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Galatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain the ideal properties of ice cream to the participants.
The decisive is not just a good taste, but also a silk height and a good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during his training for a Southern and patriotical sausage on the cake: "Italian Gelato is just the best -- and then it belongs to a noted dose of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts core milk, slipper, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer, which warms everything by an electronic program at 85 degrees and then cools at four degrees immediately.
Then he turns on the machine with a cocktail and flows pastered white basic cream, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
Instantly, the docent is asleep with questions: Can ice cream be made only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can a man experiment himself?
Luciano warns you to be abducted by the spirit of time to be unknown.
Who speaks of ice cream "only from natural supplies," apparently also used stabilizers -- most natural products such as guar flour from guar grains.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream even without stabilizers, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise it crashes and the customer eats the ice grain itself.
Certain variations of basic materials are vacational.
It'll be more stressful with the aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the ice cream taste according to the supplies that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit section or in the sweets section.
Besides, there are powders and creams.
"The suppliers will try to make you a lot of aromatized supplies."
"You should simply experiment."
Be with fruit sorbetes with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with ice cream from white basic material, which turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa based on all sorts of chocolate temptation.
Now he's going to take a course to ice cream machines.
Luciano lets them always make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and liquid ice creams - either with eggs or without them in basic materials, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural supplies.
The same experiment will be carried out with fruiten ice cream species.
More aromatic substances, more fruit pire - given the taste, it's not always better.
The ice cream must not taste more peanuts when it contains more liquid peanuts.
The most popular ice cream from the kivi will produce a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
The only time the balanced mixture raises the right taste of Gelato, Luciano says.
Ice cream production is a purely number of tasks: If brosque pearls are used with a lot of sugar, the sugar share in the basic prescription must be reduced.
For limour ice cream, extra sugar porcus is needed.
Luciano will extract a device which determines the contents of the fruit sugar (winners measure the moss of grapes).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate the numbers.
Producing ice cream does not require as much physical effort as before.
It does not only help the automatic production of basic materials.
There is also a device that puts the ice mixture in the cream at the same time and colds at a minimal temperature.
Despite all the automatization, we won't avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo will ruin himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit pirees when he gets out of his control of a huge mixer.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time when something like this happens."
Auditors in Double Light
The European Food Authority of the Efsa is associated with an industry that experiments with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of experts of Testbiotech, which is considered an independent Institute for Biotechnology Effects.
"Sounds like a spinning theory, but we have documented it well," said Mnich's head Testbiotech Christoph then on Wednesday.
The leaders of the EFSA team for geneticly modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and other experts of the Efsa have had a contract with the lobbysts Ilsi for several years.
It's funded concerns like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper participated in a decisive way in the EFSA control regulations for genetic plants and stands in a clear conflict of interests, criticizes then.
The EFSA rules are said to be consistent in all paragraphs with the Ilsi documents and carry out the manuscripts of the industry that should be controlled by the Italian Parma authorities.
It's the second time that the Testbiotech tells about the conflict of interests.
A high manager from the Efsa recently passed without supplements or transitional time to the Swiss Singenta agricultural concern -- and thus changed the parties.
The broadcast for Central Germany (MDR) has also revealed the recent EU-wide EU-care Office for Industrial Lobby Control, which has raised an interest in both the Ministry of Environment and the EU Members.
Meanwhile, EFSA can't recognize the conflict of interest.
It is working with all serious data, and also in the industry, if they are highly professionally qualitative, in one declaration.
The experts working for the Efs do not require that they do not have contact with the industry.
But he has to testify them.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It itself is called the neutral forum of experts from science, industry and policy - except for the risk assessment of biotechnology without a lobbist contract.
Independent experts, such as then, criticize that the geneticly modified plants are currently modified in animals without any attempt to feed, and that genetic plant reactions to environmental impacts are not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the geneticly modified corn will do in the field," said Then.
The current practice is only testing isolated proteins, not the entire genetic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If there are no risks, how would it be possible to find them?" he asked then.
And Angelica Hilbeck agrees with that.
The Scientific Employer has studied gentechnical since 1994 and currently works at Technical High School in Curych.
In this area, industry is attempted as in the United States, and now in Europe is increasingly influenced or discredited by critical scientists.
That's why there are almost no scientists who would not be connected to the concerns.
Mostly, studies that are critical for companies are not published.
"Intelligence controls security research," Hilbeck believes.
Stone Track
Uli Gsell also got some, about 400 pounds.
On Monday night, he stood in front of the Stuttgart station, a tube on his back.
It was a demonstration.
Snow.
The story is known: In September the baggages arrived and began squeezing a large piece of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: thousands have demonstrated against S21, a billionaire station reduction.
When the construction stopped, most of the wings were in ruins.
Smashed to 6,000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheim, a soft gross stone used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell's a stagger in Ostfieldn, 43 years old.
He's got some of these pieces.
"These stones are reliquies."
"She can't disappear."
"The left and poor stone, simple and original."
When one cut off, it smelled like a cigarette smoke.
What's he gonna do with those pieces, he doesn't know yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest at the former munition deponsion of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought everyone that came up during the Stuttgart crash.
"It would be a shame if they broke into a sculpture or disappeared on the depony," says in his office, a wooden chamber, which used to be a guardian house.
They tell him that they were giving him and threatening him when in September, all the newspapers said he bought the remains of the northern wing from the demolition company.
But he's been talking to S-21 opponents all day.
And he explained to them that he can't go to demolition at all.
And when it's happening, it's the most reasonable if the stones continue to be used.
Then it took about 200 S-21 opponents every one about 80 kilograms a heavy block, a cost of a piece of 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a memorial, some also hoped to bring him back when he was rebuilt.
Rongen bought 500 tonnes, a load of 25 large cars.
About half is still in the woods, the rest has been sold a long time ago.
Gardens, land gardeners, builders home.
They arrived from all the corners and pulled out what came into the trunk and the trailer.
The stones of the Stuttgart disputes have long been transformed into "grounds" or as the edges of vegetables.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"When there weren't the political embarrassment."
He's going into his territorial car and ride on a ride after his 20th hectare realm.
He studied first laws, interrupted the study, later biology, then cared about computers and eventually became a stone trader.
And a lover of stones.
It's stoned 40,000 tons of stones.
He's connecting his treasure from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest trader with old stones in the Republic.
It's fast.
In the snow there is an artificially processed sand.
"Once they belonged to the Marien Bridge in Dresdens," he said.
The sand of the Labe, the yellow, the warm, he's excited.
"My favorite stone."
We're going on the way up the woods.
It points to a bunch: red sand, before part of the station in Karlsruhe.
Go on.
"Happy travertin."
One time, they belonged to the tribune of Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
There are rocks and stories everywhere in the snow, Cannstatt-travertin from the police presidency in Stuttgart, red granit from the Sanct Blasian temple, the tuf from the Heilbron hospital.
What a job, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about the way stones were ruined before, and they were transported by simple clouds and bullshit cars, it becomes totally respectable.
"It would have been a scandal if something like that had been scattered."
He hasn't become rich, he hasn't become rich anymore.
But today, a stone stone dealer employs 14 people, and the stones in the woods were placed upstairs, one skipper, one copper, one stone, and one gardener.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who estimates the rest.
At a proper time, he's got to get to Colin.
There will also be stones saving.
Talent fight for High-Potentials
There's a lot of people in the dining room.
16 students are pushed in salmon, tomato soups and sweets.
Technical university in Braunschweig and Volkswagen car manufacturers invited students of machinery and design at workshop.
Together with VW developers, we need to talk about the car of the future - and, by the way, to know Volkswagen.
Many companies try to race the smartest heads, as well as VW, to successfully and bet with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible, recruit the most loyal graduates in the hearing rooms, before they reach the labour market and others will be interested in them.
Since universities don't issue a list of successes of their students, they try to discover the firms' special talents in projects oriented on practices and gain them.
TU Braunschweig is trying to get talents the next day.
A young lady from the personal department distributes suitcases, rubber bears and VW logboards.
She tells hopeful young talents about the practice programs, student jobs and suggests their way to the concert.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig is taking care of the project with VW.
They see the benefits for both sides: "The students will get into contact with the industry and get experience."
"WW can meet students at the same time, get closer to meet the interesting candidates and think about who would be acting as a co-worker."
Such co-operation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
But the news is, she's so openly fighting for students.
"The other way, it was rather a substantial professional project," said Selle.
The struggle for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer select their employees from the long-term groups of applicants.
On the contrary, they must try and try to attract particularly highly qualified working forces.
In particular, engineering graduates have excellent negotiating positions.
According to the Union of German engineers, VDI remained in October without 40,000 engineering positions.
And according to the VDI predictions, the lack of engineers will still grow.
Auditor's and advisory company of KPMG is going to Roman Dycta to hunt talents.
It organizes difficult Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasury race where participants must find a way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students in the United States next year.
Participants can also check the KPMG branches and meet the company.
In advance, he decides in two selection wheels who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème will be flying from many interested in the United States.
In the fight on High Potentials at the universities, according to the Dycta, laws will be increasingly rigorous.
"We want to distinguish our Race from others."
"The only trip to the sail was too little for us."
Looks like Dyct's talent hunter's lucky.
"We have been in contact with all the participants of the similar action last year."
"Some people will soon finish their study and plan to work with us," he says.
In addition to direct calling on campus, small and middle companies are presented classically at the markets of work.
"We're trying to contact students at professional exhibitions."
"As for intersolar," said Sitha Stübe, the manager of the Solar Technology Producer of Solarworld.
The Bonno company employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem with young workers.
Currently, 35 positions are written on the company's websites.
"It's just complicated at the moment to hire free places."
"It's worth a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is to contact the professors at the universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various high schools, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform us that we can do practice or write diploma."
Solar specialist doesn't do any expensive advertising.
Instead, the company is trying to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
"The great concerts often cannot offer it," Stube's head says.
The money has not played a major role in looking for work for a long time.
Flexible working hours, child care or good procedures are other crucial factors.
Solarworld hired in a study of the Grand Place Institute to Work 55th place among 100 best employees in Germany.
The Institute consists of the annual list of the best German employees.
Furthermore, he asks colleagues how they are satisfied with their work and the work environment and monitors the framework conditions of employees.
The leader of the Stube personal department hopes that the location will bring the points to the stakeholders.
"I believe that interested persons are informed especially of the external evaluations of the potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a long-term strategy of a good reputation as a employer.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, that means mainly internal measures.
"The best way to be seen as an attractive employer is through his own employees," he says.
It is excellently called the Internal Employer Branding, which is the promotion of a employee on the market within its own employees.
"The satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When the company takes good care of its people and they identify themselves with the company, they will make advertisements from themselves to their employers between friends and friends.
"It's like a rope game," said Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil caves
During the next years, they will not emerge before the coast of the United States of Florida in the Mexican Gulf of the new oil garden.
The government in Washington has issued an appropriate prohibition - thus cancelled its previous plans.
Also before the Atlantic coast, the new gardens are still forbidden.
The Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar told it in Wednesday.
The reason for a strict ban that should pay at least the next five years is the explosion on the garden tower "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before this accident, which cost 11 employees life and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled the opposition and industry's willingness to allow new gardens in the eastern part of the Mexican Gulf.
Assets are trying to reduce the U.S. dependence on oil supplys from abroad.
To date, it is not clearly explained who is responsible for the destruction of oil disaster in the bay.
In the middle of the criticism, the British Energy Concern of BP, which is confronted with billions of applications.
The Investigation Commission, which Obama authorised, should present the results during December.
In October, the Minister of Interior, Ken Salazar, canceled the ban on floating that paid for the explosion.
Subsequently, the different oil concerns of applications for new vegetable intentions have been submitted.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent similar disasters from strictly controlled and strict security regulations.
The supervisory authority, which has noted many corrupt charges, is now essentially reformed.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would cancel lucrative options for tax escapes for oil and gas concerns.
The industry now openly warns that a more strict regulation will essentially reduce the volume of the loaded oil in the Gulf.
"The government plans are the biggest brake for gas and oil industry growth," the results of the current research in the field of the BDO advisory company - before the ban on floating in the Wednesday.
American Energy Alliance is still complaining about the uncertainty in the field, "No one knows exactly what the regulation changes."
Investments in new quantitative projects are being moved until the appeal - to the impact of growth.
The Tail Area burned
The water in the rivers is brown, it smells like a pump: billions of liters of oil-extinct oils destroyed the nature in the Ogoni area in Nigeria.
People die by stealing, corruption and illegal cooking oil.
Celestine Akpobari thinks well.
"Don't worry," the journalists calm the ecological activist: "You'll get enough oil bladder before the objective today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian observed an attempt to photograph a boy who floating around the breasts of water surrounded by the sculptures: this scene works in a water flash with spirit colors almost to be nice.
The fact that underneath the surface the brown slaughter of oil can't be seen.
She used to gather enough garnels here, telling Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetta river.
Meanwhile, the water was slowly floating completely dead.
Five years ago, a huge wet area of broken oil was poured.
The fishermen from the nearby city of Bodo must decline at least six hours to get into the waters where fish are: the area of the Ogoni, which is located in the heart of the delta of the Niger River, belongs to one of the worst flooded areas in the world.
On the road along the river, the mangrove balls with many sideflows are only marked by the whole range of launching.
The boat cooks instead of light waters with brown coughs and whoever swims his hand into the water, pulls the oil fingers.
The roots of the mangroves are spinning from the country like black pharmacists, rarely emerging palms leave their leaves sadly hanging.
We seek vain of birds that usually occur in wet areas: Once the engine silent on the boat, it will squeeze in the previous paradise where it smells like pumps, scary silence.
"What's going on here is an ecological war leadership," says Celestine Akpobari sadly, "We live in constant fear of health."
The comparison with the war is legitimate.
The area of Ogoni's settlement is a battlefield, where he has been fighting for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first winners from Europe have been enrolled here, here in the 1980s the first rebellion with later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the concern Shell had to stop its production in 1993, because it was too dangerous for employees.
To date, the company must not return to the Ogoni area: while it comes from the whole area of delta with three sizes of Switzerland with more than 5000 roofs and 7000 miles of leading more than two million black gold barrels, the oil field in the Ogoni boat is very unstable for the concern.
Every few hundred meters of the steel structures, like bizarre statues, are called " Christmas trees", so much so gently called the heads of the holes.
They're 50 years old, most of them are cut off.
Every minute, such a head of a floating hole is broken, tells Akpobari, and then the constant stream of oil flows into the water.
According to the estimates of experts, more than two billion liters in the delta ecosystem in 50 years has arrived: each year, the amount of oil that came to the sea in Aljaska during the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" over 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
There are disputes that are still responsible for the continuing ecological disaster.
While the Shell concern calls sabotage and organised oilftfting for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental guards say that the heads of the gardens and intimate leadership are the main cause.
Shell requires a much smaller security regulation in Nigeria than a custom in the world, commented on the concern in 2008 US-American Scientist Richard Steiner: Only the quantity of leading disorders is "pale times more than anywhere else".
In a place that looks like a deserted oil, dirty workshops under the wide sky, the figures will come out of the mangroves: they are completely naked and all over the neck of oil.
Under one of the many vessels, which are partly connected by the leadership, partially dissolved on the ground, fires: illicit little raphineries.
The rape is warming over the fire for a few hours, explaining Michael, the leading group.
First, it runs out of the lead to a capable gasoline, later hats at the end of the lead of kerosine, and eventually oil.
This is how Michael and his four colleagues make up to four courts per 300 litres every day: "We're making 34,000 Naira" -- about $22.
Delta citizens use chronic lack of engines in the largest oil state of Black Africa.
Nigeria owns only one raphinery.
A funny low price of €40 cents per litre oil can still be overwhelmed by illegal producers: because they have raw materials free.
It comes from "Bunkers", which are connected to leadership everywhere in the Ogoni area: according to experts, the entire region of the Niger delta is losing the country every day at least 16 million liters of oil.
But only a small part of the provisionally stored raw materials will be illicitly emerged: the biggest share will fill organised criminal networks, including politicians and high positions of military representatives, in tankers and sell it on the world market.
The debate whether the inhabitants and their inflammation or the lax method of production have caused the disaster, the Activist of Akpobari considers a pure academic.
"If oil companies weren't considered aliens, and if they were not perfectly destroying the life of the fishermen, it would not have been sabotage or stealing and illicit raphineries."
Meanwhile, Ogona's relationship with Shell is so ruined that only considers the departure of the concert: "The other nations may be shown as the Chinese as better."
Michael's gonna be worried.
"The highest time to disappear," said the muscle producer.
"The soldiers can come any minute."
If a special military unit has found them, they are not in danger of imprisonment but a painful bribe.
Also soldiers who usually come from the north of the country -- like all the Nigerians -- want to profit from raw materials.
"This damn thing got our earth in all ways to the bottom," said Akpobari.
Investigators have discovered a dangerous construction error in the A380 engines
A380 apparently has a major security problem.
The investigators found out at the examination of a machine that landed an emergencyly possible construction error, which could lead to a catastrophic failure of the engine.
The Qantas airline wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The Qantas Airbus travellers had apparently more happiness at the emergency landing at the beginning of November than has ever been known: the Australian Air Safety Authority has discovered a major security obstacle in its investigations on certain machines A380 - and now warns against possible construction error.
Perhaps the disagreement would have severe consequences: a single oil connection could result in cracks due to consumption, sounded this Thursday in the public declaration of the ATSB.
This fact could lead to a catastrophic failure of the engine.
It is engines made by Rolls-Royce in 20 planes of A380.
Among them is also the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal steps against the British producer of turbines.
She filed a complaint at the Australian Common Court in Sydney, which allows further legal measures against this company.
The chief of the company Qantas Alan Joyce said that his company would request compensation for an incident in the beginning of November.
During the engine fire, parts were released, and the nose surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce marked the cause of a burning oil.
After this event, it has to be exchanged throughout the world up to 40 motors.
Australian investigators announced that they would perform additional safety tests with giant aircraft equipped with relevant engines.
Security recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said speaker ATSB Martin Dolan.
The security deficiency was considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline left its fleet A380 weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines left three of her 11 A380 on the ground.
Lufthansa exchanged one A380 as security.
The two floors are the biggest personal plane in the world.
The total snowing causes chaos in transport
Germany all white: almost all over the country snowed overnight.
Many roads run chaos, train connections and aircraft are disrupted.
At least three people died in car accidents.
Winter Frozen Germany: almost the entire Republic has fallen on Thursday at freezing temperatures with snow -- which leads in many places to transport chaos.
In the north and east, it lies in some places up to 15 inches of snow.
On several roads and many roads there is a strongly limited transport.
At A7 at Flensburg, the road service was still in place, but was not handling the new snow.
There was still a strong wind blowing over the Baltic Sea.
The Joint Floating and Hydography Office (BSH) expects a violent inflammation of water at the Baltic Sea in Sleswik-Holstein this morning with a state of 1.2 metres above the normal.
Snow curtains caused significant problems in Saska on roads and state roads.
According to the wrong weather center, Meteomedia was therefore a degree of violin alarm in Saudi Switzerland - at all the highest degree.
From the part there, 30 inches of new snow, strong and fresh winds caused curtains.
There were some trucks and personal cars left there at night.
Also, in Sascu-Anhaltsk, police authorities reported a major road trouble.
A2 caused wind and snow slow traffic and shutdowns.
There were troubles in Durinsk with snow on A4 and A9.
According to the German road, there are great difficulties in Saska, Sascu-Anhalt, Durin and Northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on railways, reversed trees on railways or broken upper leadership and shifts.
In Saska, the remote operation from Lipska to Norimberk must have been stopped.
In Durin Saalfeld had to stop one ICE to Mnich.
165 passengers received waved blankets, food and drinks in the train.
Snow wind wails over the road.
In large German airports, snow winds have been cancelled for many years.
According to the speaker, the information centre for years has already been reported from Mnich's cancelled flights.
In Frankfurt Nach Mohan, it has been cancelled according to Fraport speaker for 40 years.
Maintenance of roads is in constant layout.
There are only few passengers left in the airport, but 400 field beds are ready for them.
On many roads, there were accidents on Wednesday night.
Tonight, a truck driver died at a train crash on a railway ride in Eastern Holland.
The engineer was slightly injured.
The snowway caused a similar accident by Norimberk: the car was also caught on the railway, because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
In the train, four passengers were injured - the route from Bayreut to Norimberk remained closed until the morning.
And for that, a 30-year-old woman died after she turned her car into a slipping road at Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists have a good news: the snow will remain in the form of light powder, and it will also be raised in light blows of wind.
But the wind will weaken.
Only at the Baltic Sea will be rapid winds with the power of the wind.
But it'll be a big cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for towers-twins
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to his sign: According to one newspaper contribution, a buyer bank is looking for two towers with offices in the headquarters in Frankfurt.
The real estate could carry up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank just renovated its concert site: the towers-binds in the Frankfurt banking quarter were modernized; while bankers were allowed to return to their old jobs.
But now he apparently wants the financial concert's costs for renovation again - and is looking for a buyer for both clouds, as the Financial Times Deutschland informs with the appeal to the speaker.
The speaker didn't specify the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are still investigating whether more meaningful property is to own or sell and then rent again," he said.
This is the biggest credit institution in Germany that retreats its company for a short time.
The Bank took over the towers-binds just in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of its own fund and then costly renovated them.
Energy reconstruction has been swallowed according to the data of about 200 million euros.
Sales would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
The experts in the field estimate the value of the renamed towers in the meantime at "Greentowers" at approximately 500 million euros.
The speaker said that it was not decided whether the building would be sold again to the property of the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of grief for dead miners
More than 10,000 people have honored the memorial of scattered miners in New Zealand, who were declared dead after several explosions in the bottom.
The dead were still unable to be released because the security situation remains complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a strong explosion in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 runners aged 17 to 62 have been screwed down in the bottom.
There was an outbreak in the jacket where the sonda was launched, but she didn't reveal any sign of life.
Because of high concentrations of poisonous gases and the following explosions, they could not get saving forces for safety.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts came out of the fact that miners no longer have a chance of survival.
Still failed to deliver the dead.
Now they honored the memory of the dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth, in the southern island of New Zealand, ten thousand people gathered at sun weather.
They shut up for two minutes.
For the worship of the memorial of the miners, 29 tables were built on them, helmets, lamps and names of miners.
Also pictures and personal things, such as clothes and surfing dots found their place here.
In the government buildings, flags were in half a yard.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would reap from the "depth of the country" to the surface, the minister John Key said to the participants the memorial action of the New Zealand.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he saw his body, Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was in the bottom.
The Memorial Action took part with the exception of the ministerial President and relative victims, as well as several foreign diplomats.
During the 19 November explosion, British and South African miners were also invaded.
The rescue officers began by extinguishing fire inside the coal mine in the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the poison gas is released, it starts with the cooling of high temperatures inside the underground, President Gary Knowles told journalists.
In hell, warriors!
Is horror good for the art movie?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to overcome the old border with his battle epos "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he was filming "Walhalla Rising"?
The captured Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) will be freed from his torturers and in the large kills almost with the supernatural force of his opponents - sounds perfectly for young men who are looking for bloody action, because our hero helps cruel killing methods and his enemies wreck even inner from the stomach when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, the Single Eye, as it is actually called, will not say a word throughout the movie and other figures will make at least one or two sentences or let them strike to the pastible dying screams.
Otherwise, the silence is silent, and it is in a terribly beautiful coastland of Scotland, which offers a round of the world of Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is more ideal for adult adoration of a movie with interest in existence and very calm camera recordings.
It's good when he has more target groups, it's just a shame to exclude each other.
The director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and styled trilogy on drug dealers "Pusher", is considered to be the Danish version of the director Quentin Tarantin, but standingly prevents his work from being more humorous to the main stream or less brutal art audience.
Most of the fans of the art movie are obviously allowed to be distracted from everywhere by syringeing brains and inners.
The advocates of action films will be bored at the latest when the Single Eye comes out for freely explainable reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries of ships to Jerusalem and remains hanging forever in air and mist before the manhood is apparently floating to America and keeping silent there.
So there's nothing to be surprised that "Walhalla Rising" didn't get into the movies in Germany, and now it was issued only on DVD.
It is a shame mainly because of the beautiful videos, but also because it's behind the special fasada, places to be collected with blood, hiding an exciting cinema that deserved a little attention.
In this film, it's not about dialogues or accurate story, everything is atmosphere, a hot dream that became a movie.
And it's not for the audience to escape.
Refn doesn't give him a moment of relaxation and slowly suffocating him with his frozen images and cloud hypnotical soundtrack, but mostly unrecognizable hatred that sprays from the heart figures.
Only a little blonde boy who helps the One-Eye keeps something like innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Of all the one-eyed hero whose motives will never be explained, which will become time for enemies and transient allies as a warrior of hell, perhaps a messenger of the devil.
It creates a ruin, but perhaps only for those corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Miscellaneous Earth Works
The Office for Nuclear Energy, IAEA, has a new notification of the secret nuclear programme in Syria.
But the country is preventing expressions - and it will not even allow controls.
About midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli fighting planes F-15 I the mystery square building in Syria.
It stands on the shore of Euphrat; the nearest largest city is 30 miles away and is called Dair as-Saur.
In the documents of the International Nuclear Energy Office (IAEA) it appears when it comes to a reaktor which Syria reportedly built with the assistance of North Korea in this square hidden in the valley which is departing from the stream.
On the basis of the Communication of the US-American Foreign Secret Service of the ClA of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village el-Kibar, would be well thrown into the production of plutonium - from which nuclear weapons can be built.
The technique of the '50s is nothing else.
The ClA presented a video with uncontrolled satellite images.
The computer animation explained where the reactor components before destruction could be, should be a reduced copy of the North Korean nuclear model Yongbyon.
Furthermore, photographs were presented that showed the building closely or even inside.
They said the reactor was shortly before the launch, but without fuel articles.
Today, after more than three years of bombing, there is no knowledge of much more than that time, even the mystery has grown in time.
The former US President George W. Bush recently published in his memory that the ClA was very certain before the attack that Syria was building in el-Kibar reactor, but basically she had no grounds for the "active nuclear weapon program in the country".
Some secret services rapporteurs in Europe are even more cautious and only speak about the "reactor" even though the CIA presentation is "reliable".
They're missing clear evidence, as well as IAEA.
On the question of how sure he has a reactor, he answered the high-diplomatic UN in the summer, the IAEA said he had "assufficient material to raise questions".
In fact, the Syrians were quickly emptied, and have also correctly equipped the territories.
However, the IAEA team was able to be found in June 2008 under the leadership of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people.
Furthermore, IAEA received a satellite photo of commercial sellers over the Member State from just after the attack, which should be more precise than those presented by the ClA.
Unfortunately, these recordings are not on the market, because they have been bought exclusively by an unknown customer -- perhaps Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Siria always claimed that she never had a secret nuclear program and didn't even build a reactor.
Uran comes from Israel’s weapons, Damasch said.
That's what IAEA did after analysing particles.
Since then, Damask refuses to discuss things - as well as satellite recordings.
Furthermore, he prohibited second inspection to auditors in el-Kibar and access to ruins of bombed buildings.
But Israel is also silently silent.
"We will never comment," recently confirmed the official opinion of the ruling Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case is so unaffective since June 2008 and "develops into a serious problem in view of the credibility of the Authority", as the high Western diplomats in the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admitted, is a serious violation of the Treaty on Nuclear Weapons Prohibition, which IAEA observes.
IAEA considers the key to progress in the matter of three other devices that should be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and, unlike it, still exist.
The auditors have not yet indicated, which device is, or what function they have or why they are suspected.
According to the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, IAEA is internally referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, taken again by nearby cities.
Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found a complex of buildings on satellite images, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
Apparently, it is located inside or directly close to the military base - for that reason Syria refuses access to these three places.
In Vienna, Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that IAEA would be sent first to search for military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the U.S. Secret Service equipment.
The IAEA has foundations and satellite images that between these three places and the square of Euphrat transported material here and there.
In Vienna, the high Western diplomat said that at least one set should be "in connection with the production of fuel".
However, there are no "not evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. the enrichment of uranium and new processing; processes necessary to produce nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven by uranium which is not enriched.
But where the uranium comes from, and where it should be postponed by a plutonium to the bomb later, there are only likely estimates on these central issues.
It is also not known whether the traces that might hide important traces are stored in these three places.
As if they disappeared from the surface of the earth's hundred costs of cars, no one seem to have information where the thing came from.
Only a few miles away from el-Kibar, and on the other side of Euphrat, a salt mine al-Tibni which allowed Syria to check in 1998 as a suitable storage for radioactive waste, IAEA considers it unlikely.
Former IAEA Inspector Robert Kelley gave it in connection with the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for renomed magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the images from the universe show that after IAEA demanded access, Syria carried out all suspicious places of earthly work and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clear the suspicion.
Furthermore, diplomatic circles talk about the IAEA spent many months creating a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to keep possible military secrets -- only the effort shows how much the interest of auditors is.
In the meantime, Damashek rejected this proposal.
If western diplomats in Vienna had been calmed up a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, and that is why the matter is not burning, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has spoken about the so-called special inspections, which is one of the hardest means that the Vienna nuclear Office has to prosecute control.
The chief of IAEA Yukiya Amano, who had to suggest an inspection, has already spoken about "the possibilities I'm closing in the future", yet he is hesitating.
This option is highly risked: on the one hand, most of the Governing Council of IAEA is needed, and many of the 35 countries represented are definitely not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat warns, "What happens if they finally find nothing?"
Love During War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on still unnamed directive primary in the summer, there were troubles.
She wrote a scenario herself, it's a love story of a woman from Bosnia and Herzegovina and a man from Serbia.
You don't know much more yet - but it also causes calm.
The woman, who is a Muslim, will fall in love with a Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women were immediately protested, so planned films from Sarajevo to Hungary quickly moved.
Meanwhile, the film came up in Hungary and is in post-production, but still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic, from the Organization of Women's War Victims, wrote through the UN-Organization to help UNHCR Jolie refugees and asked for a meeting with the actress, now informed the Bosnian newspapers - Jolie is also the U.S. Ambassador of the UN-organization to help refugees.
It's not very diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary a week ago, but they refused.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In camps where they were raped, love stories did not find out and Jolie’s attitude towards the victims is pronounced enough about the scenario.
Her organization therefore recommended the UN-organization to help refugees to release Jolie as Ambassador, Guardian informs.
What exactly scenes did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received its scenario to read, allowed after smaller tahanics in Sarajevo's filming - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author emphasizes that in her film, she does not follow any political intentions that with great efforts, she has committed a conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and all participating parties to give space.
In view of the content, it remains uncertain.
On the Internet there is another version of a movie that sounds quite different: lovers knew each other before the start of the war and again met when she was like a Bosnian Muslim in the Serbian camp where he served as a guardian.
Which really sounds quite different than "the vow of rape will fall in love with his torturer."
The fact that Jolie's movie really begins before the war is true.
Jolie suggests that there is a pressure on it, which "is not fair and is based on the wrong information."
Now they can free her from Hollywood: by publishing her script on the Internet illegally, as they have done many times.
Nothing but gone.
This evening is good for Ira again.
No sign of mourning.
The home team dominates too much over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans scream at the sound of a loud music, the ass of their legs.
Bailey-Pub in the Southern Cork, because the players throw tennis balls to three meters away in the beer bowls - and hit themselves.
"Pive Pong" is called a bizarre theatre and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning premium and tickets to Las Vegas for the world's world championship in a drinking pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this screamed beer game and sustainable informant, it doesn't work very well.
Still, a 26-year-old man is trying to entertain, respond from the difficult question what brings the future.
His plan is not a playful passion in Las Vegas, he's going to an interview to New Zealand in January.
"I feel so weird about it," he says.
"It's so far and I don't have a job there."
However: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "withstandly gained her dream job as Eventmanager, perhaps it's a good sign," a young man says and smiles.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of the three Tanners have tried to make their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, the social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT supplier in London.
Boys leave: Just like Tanners, it looks like in many families on the island.
100 000 Irish will leave the country in a visible time, foretold by experts of the Scientific Institute for Economic and Social Affairs in Dublin.
They count even by 2015 with 200 000 emigrants.
For such a small land with only 4,5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the prophecies are confirmed, there will be a similar relocation wave as Irish suffered in the 1980s.
After the decades of the rise that Irish brought to great prosperity, the uncomfortableness is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is primarily polluting young, educated Irish, who have experienced only a rise.
Loss of employment and social deployment seemed absurd in these years.
The need was everyone, the money was too much.
In the meantime, three of the ten women and men are up to 30 years without work.
In Irish Times, there are many letters of readers who complain: "In Ireland everything goes from the hill."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers -- but who can, who goes away, and our earth is losing the entire generation."
"Last one please turn off."
Leanne Caulfield, the President of the Irish Student Union, has seen the future black because the government is just deceiving and the young people are not offering any views for the future.
"They make minimum remuneration, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says 20 years old.
It observes how her classmates move from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is she'll have to move herself in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a total service on the topic of work in abroad.
"For beginners on the labour market, work in abroad is an excellent chance to do the first steps on the scale of career," said the manager.
On his website, there are photographs of surfers in Australia and skiers on a snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: Work in abroad is not galays, but freedom and joy.
About how it feels to build something else, Sean O'Donovan has known for six months.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues at the construction in Germany.
He's just building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he continues to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan will rarely get home because he works in extra shifts so that he can pay a loan at home.
"The situation is sometimes really a bit crazy," he says, when the first time after a long time it's over the threshold of his own house.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Irish, which I'm not actually."
He laughs sadly and walks in cool rooms.
A small house stands in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, large expensive cars are parked in the entrances.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100% funded by loan.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was without a lot of questions," he said.
Is he afraid that it doesn't have to go well with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, he's floating hot tea, and he says, "I don't have kids that I have to eat and I'm young; even if everything turns out, I can start over."
The construction engineer doesn't like complaints that he hears so often.
"No one must starve - our situation is not as dramatic as before on this island," he says.
"When we work abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen -- maybe then we'll just feel like the Irish."
He laughs and then talks about his father who left in the last economic crisis to England.
"After seven years, he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simple."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keep the future open and simply wait for life to develop elsewhere.
She's been working in London for a few years, and why should it not be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
There is, however, another thing that disturbs him quite in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
She's afraid she could go back to a goodbye party.
"No emotionality," he says, and he's drinking a lot of beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds anxious."
"Let's call it a celebration of leaving, completely simple, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Common Democracy Practice
The support of democracy in Latin America is growing as well as private business support.
Criminal activity raises more concerns than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions more influenced than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarometro research, which took place in 18 countries and exclusively entered the magazine The Economist.
Since the research has been conducted regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in positions throughout the area.
In this year’s survey held in September and early October, two related things are dominated.
First of them is that Latin America has a relatively cheerful mood.
The second is the increase in stability of positions towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several countries on the edge of the Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has been 6% annually since 2002, the support for democracy has increased from at least 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
It also grew up in Mexico, where the economy was recovered after the depth of production last year.
But only about half of the questioned areas in Mexico and Brazil, two of the most poor areas, are the convictions of democrats, which downloads the regional average (see graph 2).
About 44% of respondents across the area expressed satisfaction with how their country of democracy works in practice, it is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, it was a large increase (graph 3).
Approximately 34% stated that they trusted the mermaid in their country and 45% trusted the government, again the same numbers as last year, but it was a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic crisis undermined democracy in Latin America.
The support was likely arising during the global financial crisis because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and were looking forward to a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped to protect poor people.
(The Economic Commission of the United Nations for Latin America announced this week that the ratio of Latino-Americans living in poverty increased in 2009 only slightly and this year again dropped to 32%.)
However, the mood changes in a wide spectrum from the earth to the ground (see graph 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its departing President Luiz Inacia da Silva reflects in the widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and the state of violence has been worsened.
For the second time since the surveys began, more respondents across Latin America are seen as the most important issue of crime rather than unemployment (see graph 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they or their neighbouring relatives have become victims of criminal activity last year, but that is a decline compared to 38% of the last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
More massive economic performance reflects in increasing support for private business and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the area say that private business is necessary for development, this percentage has increased from 56% of 2007 (see graph 6).
Approximately 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that allows the development of their country, this percentage has increased from 47% of last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuela respondents have the same view (and 80% supports private business), although their left President Hugo Chavez owns many private companies.
Brazil is a country who has a leading position in the area, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (except 18% in last year), followed by the United States (9%, against the last year without change) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% in last year)
However, the United States is considered to be the most influenced country of respondents in Mexico and in the largest part of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nikaragua.
Critical options
No one expected general elections in Haiti on November 28th.
But they were much worse than outsiders trying to help the infected country to fear.
The choices were filling the urnes and repeating votes, voting tickets stretched through channels, broken electoral rooms and intimidation.
Election rooms open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many moved because of the January earthquake, have been chasing around and trying to find out where they can go.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including a number of predicted predecessors, shouted that it was a fraud and called after the election was cancelled.
Protests, some of them violent nature, were spreading all over the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, a highly built UN official in Haiti, said that "in many respects, it was quite good choices."
The observers from the United States and the Caribbean community carefully said that "does not believe that these incomparities, whatever they were serious, were not necessary to cancel the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The election authority whose opposition votes are committed to Renee Preval, to the disposal president and his candidate Jude Celestin, shall notify the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive struggle is planned for January.
All the electoral hopes are not lost.
Two front opposition candidates Michel Martelly, raper and Mirlande Manigat, former first lady, resigned from their original challenge to declare the vote as invalid.
However, the problem may occur if Mr. Célestin, who has small or negligible support between the voters, marks the election committee for reaching a decision-making fight.
Because of the cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people still live in the states after the earthquake, the fear of the electoral participation was low.
Eventually, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of the disorganization, they were prevented.
Approximately 250,000 IDs, which are necessary for voting, remained unseparated shortly before the elections.
There's a lot in the bet.
The donors see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a key step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it is clear that the Haitians are putting themselves on it.
After the peaks to the center
In the weeks when she suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernandez, the Argentine president, from the public's sympathy, where her popularity increased from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Nevertheless, turning this success into a successful campaign for the second functioning period in the elections next year may depend on whether mourning Mrs. Fernandez will give up the impromissibility of her late husband, the predecessor and political partner Nestor Kirchner.
And on these signs, everything will be based.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued with economic policy and after his wife successfully became president, was in the habit of compiling budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This enabled the first couple to spend another income on their own.
The government of Mrs. Fernandez lost most in the last year in Congress.
But the opposition divided and was further destabilised at Mr. Kirchner's death to the heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling political movement, Peronist, joined Mrs. Fernandez.
But after chaotic meetings (which took place in facking and accusing the government of corruption), Congress was unable to approve the budget for 2011.
"I'm not going to stand up," said the president.
The 2010 budget will also pay for the next year, and the president will have more space to spend on the basis of its liberty.
Economy is overheated: this year is likely to grow up to 9%.
The official inflation rate is now at 11.1%, but many private estimates and experts are talking about the numbers that are nearing 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who entered the office in 2003, when Argentina had severed the economic collapse, set the priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than for inflation control.
He refused to deal with the MMF, burdened the private sector and cleaned the INDEC, a statistical agency that has joined the monitoring of official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernandez now measure this policy?
She called for negotiations between private enterprises and committees.
And her officials say that next year they want to limit the growth of wages to 18%.
The economy was supported by the growth of world prices for exports of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation broke growth based on large devalvation in 2002.
This may be why Mrs. President Fernandez knows that she wants to renew the Argentine financial bonds to the rest of the world.
In the beginning of this year, the government made an agreement with debt holders who had previously rejected the restructuring of the debt that Argentina did not pay in 2001.
Now, Mrs. President Fernandez is facing the agreement with the creditors' governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, which owes approximately $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted that this fact should not be monitored by the MMF as usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the fund would provide a "technical assistant" in order to design a new national consumer-price index to remind the introduction of INDEC cleaning.
It is not yet clear whether Mrs. President Fernandez will want to remain in politics after the end of the functional period when her husband is no longer by her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs the support of the high-class that is tired of kirchnerism.
When the Argentinians return from the summer vacation they have in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If he wants to win further choices, he will have to decide whether it will not be necessary to renounce the many views that her husband had in politics.
Half-courage for China
Taiwan voters are closer to the closer link to the land.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother over the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the authorized, voted on 27 November of the Mayor and the City Council in five city districts, which could be considered a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-you.
Mr. President Ma himself is the representative of the feelings that are overcome and have strong positions in business relations, including a partially free trade agreement, in the greatest comparison of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma passed the test, but just close.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) ended the victory of three of the five mayor's offices, she couldn't win most votes.
Consequently, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is inclined by the greater independence of Taiwan, won almost 50% of all votes against the 45% of the KMT party.
If it was the presidential election, President Ma would have trouble.
Since he was selected two years ago, the share of the votes of his party decreased approximately 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party was together with KMT in urban councils.
The choices took place as most of the Taiwan elections, including noises of cars and mass meetings with flags with slowly dressed girls.
Part of it was even an obligatory mysterious attempt to assassinate.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, Honorable President of KMT, was anxious for KMT candidates at the evening of elections.
The man in the crowd shot a young Mr. Lien straight across his face, wounded him and killed a watcher.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the armed person was intending to injure Mr. Lien or to resolve a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the manager of the DPP, claims that the shooting has affected the choices, suspects fall on the DPP and leads the voters towards KMT.
Hopefully the only great winner of the campaign was China.
It was amazing how it remained behind the question of the land itself.
Instead, the candidates have set up plans for the state building and the creation of jobs.
Taiwan usually enjoys his de facto independence and hates the military threats of China.
Therefore, KMT has a tendency to avoid interference with the Peking government.
But this time, the DPP also dropped from the incentive of anti-China's positions.
It is the response to the fact and realization that Chinese trade is essential for the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr. President Ma confirmed that China's policy was acceptable for most of Taiwan.
From the Peking government, it can be expected that it will continue to continue to commerce payments, together with its strategy to drag Taiwan back into the flock.
China has not wasted the time of sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on the protection of investment and medical cooperation.
Of course, they would also like to see political integration, but in order.
It's better to wait after the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP Party, in any case, has discovered itself.
Two years ago she was at the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on the basis of a corrupt charge.
President in 2000-08 was a violent and clear independence standing.
But under the leadership of Mrs. Tsai, a new generation has developed, which is moderate and DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms. Tsai was called as a DPP candidate at the president, such as Su Tseng-chang, who was the office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything to show that they can also cooperate with Peking.
Ms. Tsai published plans for research institutions which serve as a contact place between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without preceding conditions.
Ms. Tsai informs the Taiwan public that her party represents a "confidential alternative" to the accelerated approach of Mr. Ma to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be angry with this move.
In the declaration issued from his cell, he expressed the view that the DPP candidates would be better if they insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, the Pragmatic, not to be president.
But even without Mr. Chen's inflammation, the DPP will fight for the choice between potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's assessments were bad, even though the intense rate of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to go with him.
His unimagination appears to be based in particular on unemployment and promoting deficiencies among the rich and the poor.
KMT speaker says he'll reorganize his office, as well as local branches.
The strongly promoted proposals for Taiwan's support for friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwan citizens consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a famous publicist, "the point from which there is no return has already passed."
Price nomination Grammy: Jazz singing Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in category the best new artist
The presentation at the request of the President and the people must note legally.
Esperanza Spalding, 26-year-old jazz basic and singing, which President Obama has chosen to speak at the Nobel price ceremony for peace in 2009, is marked as one of the surprises of Gramma's prices in this year with a nomination in the category of the best new artist.
Because Spalding was a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" came up a little late, but it is in line with Grammy's rules when the artist cannot issue more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is defined."
Her ambitious album of 2010 "Chamber Music Society" definitely recorded a step forward and thanks to her unearthless vocal style and humble hand with the elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success that Norah Jones, the nearest equivalent for Gramma, who are looking for similar jazz work in this category in recent years.
Otherwise, the jury of Gramma rightly appreciates the album Vijay Iyer Trio "Historicity" in the instrumental album category, exciting, refreshing album ride, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album of a tested saxofonist James Moody "Moody 4B" and John Beasley's "Positootly".
Trombone Shorty, a chraptive favorite from New Orleans and a common guest in the HBO "Treme" show was evaluated in the current jazz category, which is otherwise accorded to the albums of Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild group of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with knowledge steampunk has obtained several deserved recognition in the category of large files, where the competitor stands a chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the oct "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how a bassiste can have a free hand as a chapel.
Grammy Awards Nomination: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical music category
Classical music nominations at the 53th anniversary prices of Gramma have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world.
The leading position in the nomination has Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with a number of five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three points.
Among the nominated trailers in Southern California, an estonic composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work ordered through Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted in the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also has a chance of appreciation.
Classical music nominations are divided into 13 categories that include orchestral, operal, congregation and salt recordings.
The category for the producer of classic music year has five nominated as Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nomination for the classic album was received by Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" from Nashville Simphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificum - the Art of the Castrati" introducing various artists; and Verdio "Requiem" from Chicago Simphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As regards the categories of the opera, the nominations are Berg and "Lulu" from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaia Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" from Deutsches Simphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the Orchestra and Chorus of the Marian Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" from BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Among composers who are nominated on Grammy for judicial songs, Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatemente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shhedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 had a Prime Minister in Disney Hall in January 2009 for a show that was recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under Esa-Pekka Salonen.
Approximately 30-minute work is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovski, which is captured in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for the instrumental appearance of the solist with the orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he wrote a 15-minute work specially for the Mandolin interpreter Avi Avi Avital, who was performing a concert with Metropolis Ensemble with a seat in New York.
"I wrote it by means of tons from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The director Pierre Boulez, 85, received nomination in category for orchestral performance, for the leadership of Chicago Symphony while recording Stravinsky's work.
Among the instrumental solistists who received nomination include the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-Andre Hamelin; Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Among the nominated vocal solists, only women were represented this year, Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic transition category, she got the nomination of sopranist Jessye Norman for her video "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned meshite in Temecula receives the approval of the Planning Commission
The planned meshita in Temecula has received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours often a passionate public testimony.
The critics attacked the project that promoted terrorism and would lead to the cessation of trade.
However, the jury decided that the new religious center is in accordance with local laws and would be estetically impressive.
"Mnogy good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you will remember," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre in Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"I am very proud of it as an American citizen."
"That means justice always wins."
"Opozice is minimal," he added.
"Those who are opposed are just yelling loudly."
"We have really excellent people in our valley."
The action began at 6:00 a.m. and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time they took discussions with people who were for or against the centre. These votes were equally divided, press-Enterprise states.
The discussion continued on the newspaper website.
"There is no more America," a comment appeared.
"We're the Planet's monkey with the Socha of Freedom falling in the sand."
"America fell down."
The planned Islamic Centre also caused protests in other parts of the country, including nearby the Ground Zero, the scenes of tragedy held on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley I have Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious community reading approximately 135 families lived in Riverside County for summers without an incident, but wanted a larger and more suitable space than a storage space that he rented together with the manufacturer of filter systems.
The new mechanism of 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean architecture style will also have two minaretes and will grow to a height of 43 feet.
It should take a place of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, approximately three miles east of Chaparral High School.
The opponents can still appeal to the City Council on the project.
Microbes with resistance against arsene increase the possibility of new life types on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use an arsene as one of its foods extends the space to search for new forms of life on Earth and perhaps further.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacteria here on Earth and claim that it is a sign of life's possibilities that are beyond the main elements that have been considered and underlying.
"This organism has double ability."
"He can grow either by phosphorus or arsene."
"This fact is very strange, but it is not proof that it is a form of really "external" life," commented Paul W. Davies of Arizona State University, a co-autor of the news that appeared on Thursday in the online publication of the Science magazine.
For a long time, it was considered necessary for the life of six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and cheese.
Scientists, however, found that the bacteria discovered in Mono Lake in California can continue to grow after the arsenal is replaced by phosphor.
"Ariel D. Anbar from Arizona State University, a co-autor of the news, will be starting to surprise you what's still possible.
This finding is important for searching for life outside the Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know how life can look, said Anbar.
The study focuses on the microbes found on Earth.
However, the report on this news was published to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the findings, caused a wide speculation on the Internet that the report reveals an discovery of alien life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "indicates that other planetary organisms can be able to use other elements that run biochemia and that a set of elements that we consider "standard" must not be so necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor at Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element by another element in basic biochemy and biochemical structure," Kockell added.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the NASA Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because she shows high levels of arsene.
Arzen and phosphorus are chemically similar elements, so she thought that the microb, which is exposed to both elements, could be able to replace one another.
"Arsen is poisonous, especially because his chemical behaviour is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can very hardly separate these elements from each other."
"And nothing is so different that the phosphorus does not work. When he gets into the organism, he starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists gather bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to growing concentrations of arsene that are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes are growing better in the effects of phosphorus, but since they can survive also with the replacement of arsene, the possibility that the form of life used by the arsene can appear naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where the arsenal is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an expert assistant in microbiology at the University of Florida, declared that the idea of the arsene that could be replaced by phosphorus is not new but never found an example that this fact could be done.
Arzen was more common in the previous times on Earth, she said, so scientists speculated that it could be used by previous forms of life.
"This suggests that there could be other ways to create life, not only the way it was created in the early period of the Earth," said Foster, who was not part of the research team of Wolfe-Simon.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Institute
The rest of the stolen dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs that someone stole from the Bellflower motel were found.
Four exhibition dogs - two akitas and Velgian pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, where they spent the night at the Bellflower motel 6, told the authorities.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and two remaining dogs later Wednesday late night, said Steve Whitmore, speaker of the LAPD department.
"The good news is that the dogs are okay," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were transferred to their legal owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in which location, he did not share detailed information about their discovery.
"Investigation continues."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We keep the rules."
The dog owners, Christine Rickard and David Peek, weren't capable of expressing themselves to the case.
They were very happy to find their two akita in Downey accommodation on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's representatives found the van and two dogs separated in Compton.
Akity Trace, three-year-old dog Trace and 10-month fan Didi, were injured, told by the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who planned to participate this week in regional competitions on behalf of their Japanese owners, were not found until their discovery late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to attend AKC/Eukanuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they were planned to show Trace.
Other dogs were to compete in other competitions planned in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, said Peek to the The Times journal on Wednesday.
Southern California is only one stop at nearly monthly travel of a couple after dog exhibitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard registered to the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs - boxer puppies, Parson Russell terrier and the Bretanese oak - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car where it was supposed to be colder.
They opened a little window in the car so the dogs could have enough fresh air.
Peek and Rickard announced car stealing at 6:00 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek said that he would offer a reward to anyone who will lead them to missing dogs. Dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was not clear whether prices would be granted.
Lev is ready again to scream now when restructuring MGM receives final approval from the court
After 18 months of shocks and uncertainty, MGM finally got green so that it could start again.
The Federal Insolvency Judge of New York officially blessed the "pre-packed" plan of creditors to fix about $5 billion debt and clean the way for 86 years of old entertainment company focusing on the production and production of movies and television shows.
The fourth remark that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S.A.A.A.M. does not remain any legal obstacles to restart the founders of Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum who will become the chief leaders of the exhausted study.
The number of employees falls approximately 320 of the original over 400.
The MGM will not suddenly fall out of Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees on planned financial resources allowing a loan of $500 million to finance new operations and production of MGM.
This is now about the connection with the investment bank, which needs $75 million itself, and funding is expected around half December.
The restructuring process began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise the management of how to solve its finances, since the management struggled to afford interest payments of $300 million per year.
That August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former Director-General of Enron and an expert on the turnover known for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The attempts of Moelis and Cooper to resolve the financial difficulties of MGM and 140 creditors of the study took much longer than expected.
After a few months of discussions, the parties agreed that by the end of 2009 they would give the company to sell.
Although the auction attracted several interested people, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion plus funds required by creditors.
During the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team started working on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the truster at the end of October.
When the MGM is officially arising from the audience in the next weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive multi-million bonuss in dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies that incast for their services run by the company, $375,000 a month, will receive award for success, called "success fee" $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to renew the production in MGM, which issued only one film in this year and compiled a proposal for seven or eight films that will come up at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan to participate in the financing of two films, which will provide the book "Hobit" together with Warner Bros.
The study needs a special loan between 265 million and 275 million dollars to finance its share in these two films that Peter Jackson will direct.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owned approximately 18% of MGM debts, was looking for the possibility of mergering a study with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent negotiations between the two companies have not reached an agreement.
Technological toys that keep your budget for gifts in balance
The leading candidate this year is the most amazing iPad toy followed by the video game system, but in both cases it is a significant intervention in the present budget.
Consider that at the price of one iPad you can buy five rounds BMX for 99 dollars and one game Kinect is equal to 10 coral squads or about 48 glasses Play-Doh.
But there's a way to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law works; this year's technological toys have much more energy, at the same prices, if not something lower, compared to the past years.
While relatively less new toys with associated web sites appeared, two of the most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as well as a toy with batteries charged.
Here are some recommendations.
(All those prices are from Toys "R" Us, except for cases that are identified differently.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, since 3 years old) are beast animals that sing when you press their stomach.
On one press, the tone is issued by a animal, and the second pressure starts to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: As soon as you start cating, you can't stop.
Best choice in combination of singing and dance is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60$, since 2 years)
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animated doll that can play Simon Says' game and manages a monthly walk because of his innovative foot with the blocking of wheels.
Children test the toy of Mickey dance instructor, although their parents complain about lack of volume control.
If you are a child in the '80s, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computer toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playscool, 40$, for children 3 years old), with a bag full of quiz cards that are designed to turn the car into entertainment with a self-regular, funny workshop.
If you're sending a smartphone for your child, there are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60$, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest option with simple use, with qwerty keyboard, although games do not have as effective lessons as Leapster Explorer (70$, for children from 3 to 12 years of age), the first significant change of Leapster from Leapfrog, with a new and clearer display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90$, for children from 3 to 7 years) uses the iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has a slot on the SD card that allows you to display family photographs.
And eventually, Scrabble Flash (30$, Hasbro, for children aged 8 years) is a set of five cubes that are not bigger than the LED box, each of them has a LED display.
The aim is to create words by putting the cubes in a row before the time expires; it is great for competition in improvised word creation.
Still more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
Two toys of Webkinz and Club Penguin were represented at the highest level in the toys.
If you want to buy an online toy for your child from Club Penguin, you can choose Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, 5$, for children from 6 to 12 years old), which contains coins with hidden code.
When you activate online code, your child gets enough credits in the Club Penguin store on any two items.
This could include, for example, wheel brushes or puffle animals.
A little bit bigger than your toothbrush is Hexbug Nano (10$, for children aged 5 years), the latest of a number of microbots on the button battery.
The brook moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicon legs in random direction.
It's funny to make a bone bone blossom and see if he can find a way out.
He's also very resistant.

Introduction of less police control in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked along the square, strictly checked his orders and issued commands in a loudly army authority.
He wanted women - Chinese state-owned city-law puzzlers, feared and disregarded for their hard acts and violence - to make a certain impression on the noises of the circuits.
"Stay straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, whispering quietly, "what beautiful girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants have arrived.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted as a line.
Four head covers are perfectly sitting on their hair that are perfectly tied with blue and white stripes.
"I personally think they look average," Mr. Tang despisedly said.
"The models are nice."
More than one government has tried to restore the picture of city overseers in China.
One city ordered new branches to have high school education.
The Guangdong Province has changed the gray-green uniforms to the apparently more attractive blue.
Uhan in Central China replaced the strong arms views: in 2009, a report stated that 50 officers surrounded a carriage with meals incessantly and looked at the owner when the summer seller packed and left after half an hour.
Xindu, city district with 680 000 people in Chengdu chose an operation as a main image.
Since 2003, the district has completed its city police with 13 women selected specifically according to their appearance, proportion and young age.
The aim is to show other than the gross site of the police is also softer, women's side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson itself would have trouble getting into the secret Chinese city groups.
They'd be argumenting the critics for a good reason.
Unlike the police, the police are only allowed to prosecute the city's announcement, to retain penalties and other administrative benefits.
But Chinese communications are usually captured by a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors in Hubei province suppressed an unparticipated viewer to death after he used his cell phone to record, as they begin in the event of protest against the puzzle.
In the last year, the training of police officers in Peking, the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. In the manual, there was, inter alia, a description of how to beat the perpetrators effectively without signs of blood.
This year, the summer dealer in Shanghai got into a fight with five policemen and suffered the injuries of the left part of the brain.
One video game full of violence that can be downloaded online shows Chinese police attacks on the street seller.
"Chengguan frightened the government," China Daily, national issue, complained last year after another discussion on tactics.
The paper was "truely cleaned."
The skeptics say it's not enough.
After the district booked in October an interest in eight new women's police officers, the opening of the Beijing Evening News addressed the question of whether women have real obligations or are only distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The period demanded women's applicants from 18 to 22 years of age with a good figure and "five characteristics of the face in the right proportion."
The adoptions should have a height higher than the average - so above 1.6 metres.
The 26-year-old service is mandatory.
Functioners claim that work is mentally too difficult for women over 25 years.
"Their image is an important thing," said one unnamed police officer on Rednet.com, like government websites.
"The candidates must first prove external qualitys, which then determine another, belong to the height, weight, face characteristics, etc. "
Then there comes a number of nature and "inner quality".
Women are like flower ties, he said and added, "Besides having bonds, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the District City, does not agree much with this description.
But he pointed out that the demands for heights in China are also common for other jobs, both genders.
Just like the requirement for the relative characteristics of the face.
Which means that the question of a good view is between the Chinese subject of discussion.
Medical infections or crushing are certainly not applicable.
"He can't admit to serve a chrome or garlic man with us," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who keeps a guard on the Baoguang square near the monastery, is 22 years old, faces like apples and gently shaped mouths.
She doesn't think the emphasis on her appearance could have a sexist punch, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironical view.
Her colleague with dolls, 21-year-old Xu Yang says, "Our task is to represent the image of the city."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just to start traders into streets where they can perform their activities.
Each morning, a group stands against more than ten marketers who run walks or wheels and try to sell as many tofu mice before they are expelled.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We have already told you so many times!", said Miss Xu, when the marketer began running, and for time he left his wheelchair with the nudges.
Policemen describe their duties as more monotonous than hard.
"Each day is essentially the same," said Huang Jing, 20, who studys in her marketing free.
"Great routine."
One of the reasons is that women's police have no authority as their men's prostates so that sellers can take the goods.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their men's leader.
The tendence is then protecting them from sudden public manifestations of enemy against the official instruments that are common within China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rebelled after the false news of the murder of sellers.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured at night hours; 14 government vehicles were turned or burned.
Xinda has escaped such violence by now.
But peace can only be guaranteed by hardly.
Only two blocks away from the calm Baoguang Square, where the police were guarded that morning, more than 50 people gathered on the corner of the street.
The cops took the bike that was fixed on the footstep instead of inside the store, as the rules require.
The bike owner could cry as he wanted.
A 15-minute distance from the police, faced anger, with elbows against vehicles and quickly off with a motorcycle and his owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, co-ordinator joined the male group, remained behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, the coordinators are men over 40 years of age who have only a helpful role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in maintenance and sealing images.
"We sometimes fight verbally."
"We sometimes fight physically," Mr. Lee actually said.
"Most of them is the public that starts with it."
The prosecutors will not blame Senator Ensign.
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have cleared Senator John Ensign from the criminal charges involved in his affairs with his former campaign advisor and his efforts to ensure lobby, the lawyers announced in the middle of the Senator.
The most important legal threat that Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican, has faced and has been considered to be the possible Republican candidate for the President for 2012. His affirmation has gotten into national titles and damaged his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said that the decision that followed almost after the annual investigation was "for sure pleased".
The Senator could still face disciplinary proceedings at the ethical committee of the Senate.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice "we have been informed that Senator Ensign will no longer aim to investigate and that it is not in the plan to bring further charges against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice refused to express the case.
The decision was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed that there were serious evidence that Mr Ensign was preparing violations of the federal lobbying ban.
The interviews, e-mails and other documents published in October 2009 in New York Times indicated that Mr Ensign was helping Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to provide lucrative lobby that would lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife Cynthia, about the senator's relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a treasure in Ensign's campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find a job for Mr. Hampton and supported their views after Mr. Hampton was employed to lobby for them, so many documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was a assistant of Mr. Ensign until recently, he was expelled from the law from the lobby of his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts say that the unusual arrangements of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affirmation, appeared in contrast with the ban on lobbying.
The evidence that was published "is shown that it was a clear case of preparing a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defence of clients investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the matter of Senator Ensign, Mr. Brand and other lawyers in ethics have said that the Ministry is careful about political complaints, after a large number of failures, including the last year's decision to suspend the complaint against the former Senator Ted Stevens in the middle of the question of State representation.
Federal Prosecutors "show the weapons clearly," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a lawyer group that filed several complaints against Mr Ensign.
"It is essentially pointing out that highly built government officials do not apply laws," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's chief lawyer, in his interview, told him that he had been called by the State Representative of the Ministry of Justice on Monday, and then the other day, and told him that the Ministry had no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defence team cooperates with the plaintiffs trying to convince them that the Senator, as his office repeated in the central statement, "he acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments he had handed over to the public representatives.
"I don't like to look at the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop the investigation of a separate complaint in which the ethical group accused Ensign Hampton's parents' payment of $96,000 violated the federal election law.
The electoral committee stated that it had not enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobby job was NV Energy, the main Nevada company that long supported the Senator.
One e-mail of December 2008 proved that after Mr. Hampton started acting as a lobbyst in the company, Mr. Ensign-John Lopez, he communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he "buffed" into the Ministry of Interior on a discussiond subject.
Mr. Ensign also took part in lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevadian client, Allegiant Air, and called on the transport minister to arrange a meeting on behalf of the air company after they hire Mr. Hampton for lobbyst work.
Last year, when the report of an affair appeared for the first time, Mr Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned his function as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After a multimesteral stagnation, Mr. Ensign told the reporters two weeks ago that he plans to participate in the third election period in the Senate.
In the report that Mr Ensign is no longer aimed at investigating the crime of his speaker Jennifer Cooper said that the Senator hopes that the ethical committee will quickly follow the Ministry of Justice and end the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the Nevada people," she said further.
Challenge of the town of Cheshire turns on Twitter
In the row of the courtroom, half a dozen of them were written.
A minute after a minute, there were reports of a terrible testimony through Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140 000 Twitter messages were dealt with rape and connecting children to beds in the house that was burned.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted for the murder of three Cheshire citizens, Connecticut, the family, and was to be officially terminated with the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed an appeal to the court with requests and arguments that would probably hire for years.
One of the most provocative is that intense reporting on the process - including the extensive use of Twitter main reporters - created a circuit atmosphere and this widespread, immediate intelligence of information with disturbing details then introduced the jury to the decision in the sense of influence by the public.
This claim could force the judge to deal with whether new technologies also require new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced in this submission, I think there is a real danger that the involvement of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair process for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, the chief defender of Mr. Hayes.
The Judge of the Supreme Court of Justice of the State of Jon C. Blue shortly rejected the claims concerning the benefits of the last week and that the communications funds were "depthly controlled" and that there were no evidence that would indicate that the jury acted under the public influence.
But it's probably not the last word in this case.
During the decades, the courts recognized that the reporting of noorically known cases could cause questioning the justice of the process.
In the 1966 Court of Justice of the United States, Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that in the case of Sheppard vs. Maxwell, in the process of communications, it was a "carnival atmosphere".
Some are convinced that this criminal act was a inspiration of the TV show and the "Attash" film.
Some lawyers said that the appeals of the courts which examined Hayes' judgment half a century later could be surprised by a argument that new rules might be necessary to determine the way of communication from the courtrooms, which was unacceptable in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in highly monitored cases, said John J. Donohue III, a Professor at Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was performed freely.
Professor Donohue stated that some judges may be obsessed with the idea that restriction of immediate communication from the courtrooms can make the process more fair.
Twitter's case is only one of the many shaded lawyers of Mr. Hayes who would be able to argument years to delay the execution of the judgment.
For example, the defendants argue that Mr. Hayes may be a precondition when judge Blue refused to allow him to test the responses of potential jury by showing them a criminal photograph of the horrors when choosing the jury.
Some of the jury said they were frightened by the photos of the victims that Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The prosecutors claim that they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge has wrongly renounced a jury, who was critical to the public representatives and has made his decision more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to consider the weekend.
The jury weren't separated.
But their arguments on the impact of the scope of the process may attract the greatest interest.
They objected to the verdict last month that the case was dominated to the reports in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign of the Governor and the United States Senate.
They argumented that the media were constantly disturbing emotion flames in this case.
"The daily mass of media, cameras and reporters before the court," the lawyer wrote, "there was something that was not yet to be seen in New Haven, and it may be also a state rarity."
Their focus on the effects of Twitter is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more disturbing than the reports mentioned later and, in their view, the judicial police should manage the field of other processes.
But some lawyers demanded appeals from courts with often used arguments that social and technological changes require adaptation of courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are trying for this law.
In their archives, they referred to the Supreme Court decision of 1966 in the case of Dr. Sheppard, in order to expand the operation of the process and to clarify the requirement that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard case against Maxwell 21st century."
Can courtesy overcome the failure?
After a campaign, which was incredible with its insult and negativeism, a small quantity of courtesy appeared in Washington this week.
Is this the first part of the true cooperation of two political parties or just an illusive moment before returning to a party fight in the capital?
The Tuesday negotiations of President Obama and parliamentary leaders have not made any substantial discovery on the key topics to be discussed during the meeting.
However, in any case, it was a courtesy discussion discussing the differences in the opinions of the two parties, as well as defining their joint responsibility, rather than another empty episode of the party's enclosure.
The central public meeting of the President's deficit committee was also civilized, even in spite of the political differences that remain among members.
It seems clear that close cohesion has built mutual respect for several months, which exceeds the ideological failure that still divides members.
And it's pretty hard to claim that a new era of cooperation has started.
Both parties are now in the trial period - they are pronouncing each other the signs of collaboration and compromise, trying to evaluate the borders of public opinion and election patience against the renewed party war.
Therefore, Tuesday meetings and its later evaluation of participants were also carried out with a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophy differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change in relations that are over the last two years.
Regardless of tax, expenses, medical care or rights, both sides are a mile away.
However, the November elections prepared Washington at least quickly.
"There is no question whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are inevitable after elections.
The elections broke the emotions of the strangers and then they shut up.
It's good."
In several issues, especially those to discuss meetings, the Republicans and the Democrats have a small chance to find solutions.
Bush's reduction in taxes at the end of the year has expired, and no one considers it favourable.
Both parties want to find a way to protect some or all, permanently or temporaryly.
Similarly, the probability of compromise on unemployment doses is because the Republicans cannot see how they support tax reductions for property, while unemployed people reject support in unemployment.
Following the Tuesday negotiations in the White House, there is a greater optimism on the possible agreement on these issues, together with ratification of a new starting contract.
But William Galston from the Brookings Institute notes that successful cooperation on key issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship of two political parties when the 112st Congress is called on January.
Rather, the probably period of disagreements, or even inevitable, he said.
"After doing things that must be done, psychology in a short perspective will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism -- which is largely expanded -- to bring the courtesy to real cooperation.
"I look at all events between the present and 2012 as a shadow box when the main events will occur in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the creation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters that helped to create it.
The Republican leaders are now at risk of expansion, knowing that they must act according to their promises and have to reduce government expenditures and to cancel the new healthcare law.
These reference lines are clear in the initial responses to recommendations on the deficit, which include reform of the tax law and the increase of certain taxes, the increase in pension age and the reduction of expenditure.
The joint Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their opinion, have to develop a pressure on the issue of deficit to the public programme of ways that cannot be ignored.
However, they need 14 votes in the 18th Commission so that they can present their plan as official recommendations and therefore fight to get as close as possible to that number.
The biggest resistance is among the chosen jury officials who suggest that we have, at least today, small grounds or will for compromise.
Galston predicts two stages in battles between the White House and the parliamentary Republicans.
The first starts next year in the form of party conflicts when the Republicans invite Obama to solve the budget, tax and health care when the period of greater party cooperation will be followed.
What causes the movement?
Public opinion.
There is a lot of evidence that despite partyness in the last elections, most Americans want to continue to see two parties working together.
If it could go to the grip, as it was in 1995, then both parties will be very carefully monitoring public responses.
Whoever's going to threaten the reduction of voices, he's probably changing the course and will seek compromise.
That could be a optimistic view of things.
Participation and directives are today greater than in the mid-1990s, and it appears that there has been a greater ideological failure between Obama and the parliamentary Republicans than it was in the case of the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a pre-game for more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that appeared this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will cost a lot of effort on both sides to find common foundations in issues that are still dividing them.
The unused American document lies to Moscow as a refuge of corruption
The city's management is in the hands of "kleptocracy" and it continues with a part of the bribes and protection fees coming to Kremlin, an American embassy in Russia in February records.
The police and the Federal Security Service have largely protective wings that help explain high costs of life in Moscow.
They choose money not only from legal trades but also from organised criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy -- which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "vertical of the office" -- he will take his own when the money starts to move up the ladder.
The log sent to Washington named Ambassador John Beyrle was published on their website on Wednesday through WikiLeaks.
The record is based on sources whose names were modified.
The record was written at the time when the mayor Yuri Luzhkov was still accusing him of a large share in corruption.
He was revoked in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only monitor the minimum changes in the cleaning.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owned a prominent construction firm, have been constantly denying the charges of corruption for many years, and won several complaints for the wrong charges for such a complaint.
In September, he said to the Russian TV station when he was asked to testify about corruption, "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's bullshit."
The Russians with absolute conviction believe that if their company is corrupt, it will appear to vote.
Of course, it is unusual to meet such details in such a way, in the embassy report, and it is also unacceptable that diplomats from foreign countries would do so.
"The government of the city of Moscow and its connection with criminal animals led some to call it "disfunctional," and confirm that the government works more as kleptocracy than as a government," the report says.
"The criminal elements are looking forward to the so-called 'cresh' (the date of the world of crime and mafia, which literally means 'the roof' or protection') provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Interior and the Office of State Representative, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of Moscow.
"The analysts also identified a three-step structure in the Criminal World of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is on the top of himself."
"Federal Security Service, Ministry of Interior and Milice are on second degree."
"And finally at the lowest degree, there are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an ineffective system where criminal groups fill empty places in certain areas because the city does not provide services."
The report says the FSB takes money from the biggest companies and the police focuses on smaller businesses.
One source said, "The owners of trade in Moscow realize that it is better to obtain protection from FSB or the Ministry of Interior (as rather than from organized criminal groups), because they do not only have more weapons, sources and powers than criminal groups, but also protected by law."
"For that reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer in the course."
The record says that while the selection of money is complex, the protection itself may already have trouble; even those paying may be arrested at times.
Those who do not pay fast enough, their trades are closed under different reasons.
Medvedev talked several times about fighting corruption, but admitted that he made only a small progress.
The embassy report talks about men taking the baggage, probably in cash, to the Kremlin itself.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucracies," Georga Satarov, director of the Moscow Research Team, said in the recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"They are not part of the political class, because there are no political classes in Russia."
No politicians, no opposition, no division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that Russia's corruption is worth more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ordered to 154. In recent research on global perception of corruption, non-governmental Transparency International (lands are ordered from at least to most corrupted).
The disclosure of the US Embassy Report, which appeared in Moscow until late evening, certainly did not call on the Russian government to an excitement, although only to the extent that Luzhkov could be accused of Moscow's deficiencies, it could be a possibility for Kremlin to argument in the issue of solution to the problem.
During the CNN interview with Larry King, Putin informed that the documents that WikiLeaks published could have been fakes and responded angry to the statement that the American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedeva Robin.
"The truth about the whole matter is that it is our mutual coherence, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such a pressure, you understand, so ethically."
The veterans of the Red Khmers are forced to deal with the past
In a slowly lighted concrete study with dirty and broken walls, the Director of the School of Anlong Veng High School of the man who exhibited it, the leader of the Red Khmers Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves the Moka."
"He was a good leader and cared for his people," said Sreng Cor Ma, 42.
Known as "messer" for its rawness during the Red Khmer government, the commander remains in this remote country of Red Khmers in northwestern Cambodia, where he exhibited hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and still lives thousands of former soldiers of this organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers gave up the government, there is a long-term loyalty in Anlong Veng.
In April, the victim in the forum of truth and reconciliation was allowed publicly to confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided books that explain the history of the Red Khmers and their former soldiers to children.
And in July, to bring together the UN and the Cambodian Court the first sentence of the former member of the Red Khmer, the judgment of the former leader, the notoriously known violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, to 35 years of prison.
With every such progress, there was no peace between the Red Khmer veterans in Anlong Veng, which complicates the attempts to reconcile and their attempts to join Cambodian society.
"Mean former Red Khmery is anger and fear, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them, life between the Red Khmers was beautiful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the government of the Red Khmers in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, estimates of 1.7 million people were executed or hungry, to disease or processing.
When the Vietnams attacked and launched the Pol Pot government in 1979, the remains of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodia border with Thailand.
There they began a rebellion that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were running party wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles in West Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated the advocacy in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after the peace agreement, the United Nations sponsored, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. The large groups of warriors of the Red Khmers began to move to the government, which succeeded in Ieng Sary's капitulation in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died by natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who endured, was captured by government forces in the nearby mountains of Dangrek in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh's prison in 2006 while waiting for the process.
They were no longer cared for them, most of the former warriors of the Red Khmers dropped into the ordinary Cambodia rural life, and many of them nostalgicly remember the time of movement.
Although several elite Red Khmers maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as unqualified farmers.
"These people had only minimal benefits from their capitulation," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which led the public forum throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They were raised without any idea of a business."
Sor Lim, 55, who entered the Red Khmers as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before he settled as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Red Khmery was good," he said.
"The Mok used everyone."
"But now life is hard, because we have to make it all our own."
The Tribunal of the Red Khmers also raised concerns.
At the beginning of the next year, the court will investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of Red Khmer.
The Court has a mandate to pursue the head of the substitution and the people responsible for crimes, but it was not said whether it would continue in the four cases.
It was just not enough to calm the concerns in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was a circuit leader in Banteay Meanchey during the government of the Red Khmers at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she was watching the construction of the Trapeang Thma barracks, a project that was likely killed by thousands of forced workers.
Recent couple night Im Chaem returned from work on the field to her wooden house on a dirty trip outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to come down and the shadows appear over the washed grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past between the Red Khmers.
If the court called her, she'd refuse to go.
"The peace is ruled in Cambodia and is stable," she said.
"If another criminal persecution appears, there will be war."
The Prime Minister Hun Sen, who ran from the Red Khmers in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be unstableness if the court would seek more suspects, although the experts and the historian disagree with that.
"Cambodža must dig a deep hole and bury the past," he said.
But the conflict with the past is what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation in Khmer's terms means blinding broken pieces," he said.
"It's our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The Centre issued the first book approved by the government on Red Khmers, has 75 pages and the name "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four parties on Red Khmers.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew only few details about the Red Khmers, despite the connection of the city with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, student at high school in Anlong Veng, said that a new book helps students to understand the important parts of their history.
But his parents responded skeptically when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and courts," he said.
"They're suspicious, because they're not sure how many people the court will pursue."
Such resistance makes the process of reconciliation more difficult and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forum, the books and the courts are starting to have an impact, and he has communicated further.
Red Khmers still have a strong magic here.
Upstairs in the mountains of Dangrek Mountains is a road grown by grass and ditched with plastic bags, which leads to a circuit from black rails covered by a cutting blade roof.
The body of Paul Pota here was burned on a bunch of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile seller on the edge of the road said he didn't know much about the man who was spoiled in that place.
"He has a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had her birthday and planned to visit the place of rest of Pol Pot later, where she would bring a bond of mature bananas in hope that it would bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees that its weapons seem to be found on the uranium basis
In the surprising victory in President Obama's campaign on the security of nuclear material around the world, the Belarus government announced in the Wednesday that they would surrender their stocks of highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The Agreement was published in a joint declaration issued after the security summit of the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarus Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Martynov.
The U.S. government has been trying to convince Belarus to surrender a highly enriched uranium and it seemed to have hit the stone of injury last spring.
But American officials said the Washington Post that in the last two months, several secret operations were carried out with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons based on uranium from the Belarusian research device.
This prepared the soil for the Mediterranean Agreement to remove the rest of the material - approximately 500 pounds, according to the official who spoke under the condition of anonymity, because it is a sensitive matter.
The Agreement appeared to be one of the most important results of Obamov's 47th National Summit on Nuclear Safety in April, on which Belarus was deleted.
And it was apparently a good move to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the summit on nuclear security 2012."
"This proves that the process works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group supporting nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials throughout the world within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of all their stocks of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seventh.
Twenty countries did so for George W. Bush's management.
At the time of Obam's nuclear security summit, Belarus President Alexander Lukašenko announced that his people would never give up their uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is basically a basis for weapons and less enriched uranium," said Lucašenko then.
"It's our comodity... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus joined the United States several months ago and gave an interest in reaching the agreement.
The first commitment to remove the Belarus Uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was easily lighted, the officials announced.
It was loaded on a special train which traveled more than 1,300 miles to the Russian storage and liquidation facilities, the officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and carried out by air, the officials said.
The U.S. government spent 13 million dollars on the programme, most of which to deliver a less enriched Uran for the production of nuclear weapons.
"All was coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of confidence," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, official of the Ministry of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for the study on non-expanding nuclear weapons this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium used for the production of weapons.
Belarus will, according to the joint declaration, seek to remove its stocks by 2012.
Relationships between Belarus and the United States have been tense over the years, especially because of Lukašenk's cruel repression of human rights.
But the central statement indicates the possibility of gradual drowning.
"We welcome progress in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and is necessary for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government did not work with the ClA's expenses
The Spanish government did not do precious things about the ClA flights transporting Taliban prisoners and members of Al-Qaid to Guantanam through the Spanish territories, as the ambassador of the United States in Madrid expressed in his telegram.
This is the result of the documents provided by the Wikileaks journal El País, where it is also written that the first representative of the Prime Minister Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vegava asked for the Spanish executive to be informed, and "she could show that there was an appropriate surveillance of foreign aircraft flying by the Spanish airspace".
In June 2006, following the Communication of the Council of Europe, in which the twentieth states were accused, including Spain, with cooperation in violation of human rights, a meeting between US Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fernandez de la Vegowa was held.
The Deputy Prime Minister said that the Communication of the Council of Europe "extracted the Zapater government from the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vegova emphasized that Spain has no problem with secret services flights across its territory.
"They just want to be informed," so that they are not "afflicted unprepared," Aguirre informs in one of the documents.
Also, the Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos appointed the US Ambassador that the Spanish government "will give this matter as low as possible, but because this matter was in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited opportunities to influence".
In February 2007, prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez informed the Ambassador that, if it concerns it, he intends to block the Judge's initiative to ask for secretion of the documents of the National Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence for CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminated folder or any sensitive information," the Ambassador explained after the interview with the prosecutor.
However, the United States expressed concerns rather about "the obvious coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" than the secreting of CNI information or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to address this case discreetly among governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, at the occasion of the lunch of the US Ambassador and the Minister of Interior, Alfred Péreze Rubalcaby, the Ambassador informed the Ambassador that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they consider suitable," he already instructed his colleagues, "to avoid explosive comments with intention to reduce tension."
The Ambassador also expresses its concerns about the actions of the political party Partido Popular (PP; Czech People's Party - Knock.) in this matter.
"In spite of its universal promeric orientation, our experience tells us that Partido Popular will not hesitate to use any indication that the Zapater's government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the negotiations of the United States, which could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if this discovery could have negative consequences for the United States government," he notes.
A confessed murderer mother complained about the network of her mother's age.
A young woman talked about the baby when she was dead, and she had her blog, "Teror in galician."
Monica Juanatey Fernandez calls herself "Muki."
With this nickname that she used from a little time, she communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; both are from Noah’s village in the area of La Coruňa, from which a young woman comes.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand, it is necessary to know the woman’s emotional life that ABC journal reconstructs by witnessing her family members.
A 30 - year - old woman from Galicia entered the relationship with the industrialist Ivan Tunez in 1998.
They were going together for a year.
Soon after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if his newborn child was his, but his ex-girlfriend never let him do DNA tests.
Soon she found a new friend.
Her chosen was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their consumption took a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balear Islands to look for work, the kid remained with her partner, who even arrived in Palma for a week to visit her.
But from the contents of its communication, it is evident that the relationship has fallen apart.
In March 2008, she's alone on Manorca and says, "Alberto's pissed off that I went to work."
"When I told him, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes that he has to be with little all day and can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about the message she just got, "I want you to come back this month or give me the address to send you a child."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me to leave the kid with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he says.
In May, he says, "I'll go there this week, but I'll only stay until 19, because 20 I have to go to work so I can't lose this place."
He explains that if everything goes well, he takes his son to his house.
"He will be with whom he is to be with, so with me, and it will never happen in my life that I would leave him with someone else but my mother," a doubtful intention with regard to her bad relationships.
There's another contribution in July.
When he's embarrassing this report, the child that arrived on the island of the first day of this month is expected to be killed 10 is already dead.
"The Caesar is satisfied with one side, but it's not on the other hand."
"On one side, he's with me, and he likes it here, but on the other hand, he's going to school almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Mallorc.
"It's going to go to summer school, so I'll save some money for the babysitter."
Seventeenth greetings and complaints.
"The big mouth of Cesar who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says I don't know what kind of e-mail videos he wants, look what he wants, he meets with me, sex is needed."
Thirty-third next message: "The boy's fine, he's going to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also a report about Victor, the current partner, "He gives me money."
On the Internet, Monica's contributions are on the blogs dedicated to anime and manze.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she kept calling her "Muki ex-prisoner."
"The terror of galician (motto)."
The last man with whom she lived, the guard, expresses her regret and feels guilty.
She doesn't believe everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica entered the province in Palma yesterday, where she arrived from the Prison Centre in Manorca.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, said that the defendant doesn't remember how everything happened and "she didn't intend to hurt a little guy somehow."
Before she admitted that she drowned Cesar in the bath and put his body in the trunk.
The defense and the prosecutor ask for psychiatric examinations.
People would have gained 4 chairs and PSC (Socialistic Party of Catalonia - Knock.) would lose 9 mandates
With the results of 28 November, the PP party could have the main word in the Councils in Lérida, Tarragon and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the votes obtained and the number of experienced Members during recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (Catalonia’s People's Party - Known.) already has the idea of general elections, whether or not, its prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes in all-national elections is usually one of these contrary to the catalan elections.
In 2008, the Catalan people received 610.473 votes in general elections, while this number was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC (Catalonic People's Party) received 384.091 vote.
If these trends of acceleration, supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP voters, the analysts of this party calculated that if the general elections have been made, the PPC could get 12 Members in the Romania against the existing 8 CIU (Convergence and Union, Czech Shod and Union - subsequently) would also obtain 4 mandates (the present is 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 chairs (hereafter 25).
These calculations would reaffirm that Catalonia has a vital importance for PP and PSOE parties (Spain Socialist Working Party).
According to this analysis, the ERRC (Levic Republican Party of Catalonia - Known.) would lose one messenger - now has 3 - while ICV (Initiative Green for Catalonia - Knowledge.) would continue to have one mandate, if possible, another.
However, according to the election calendar, the nearest supplier will take place in May 2011 at the opportunity of general elections, where humans can also have the impact on the end of the rule of socialists in four main provincial cities and on changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the largest budgetary administrations - 661 million euros for 2011.
As nationalists, both humans agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose the city in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lerida and Gerona, where the socialists would not receive the majority, nor could they turn to their traditional allies, the parties to the ERC and the ICV.
In view of the debacle of the Republicans, it would not be impossible if this party lost its representation in the Barcelona representativeship - because at least 5% of the votes should be obtained.
The PP party has increased the number of votes gained in four main cities and could have a crucial impact in Barcelona, Lerida and Tarragon.
The nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in Tarragon's turning, where they ruled together with the PP party before the current mayor, Joseph Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP received only 500 votes more than PSC, whose Mayor Angel Ross has very good relations with Marian Rajoy -- during the last campaign, they met on several occasions.
People have also won on other important advisers such as Badalona, Castelldeels or Reus.
At present, the PP is represented in 34 councils in Catalan and would like to create candidates in as much as possible municipalities.
Catalan cell has provided thousands of passports in Al-Kaida
Besides seven detained in Barcelona, three more were detained in Thailand
Seven Pakistanians and one Netherlands who were detained by the agents of the General Information Commissioner in Barcelona, formed a Jehadist cell managed from Thailand, which organized travel passports to various groups of Al-Kaida organisations, including "Tigers of Liberation of Tamil Elam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", while the second named group was the author of the assassinations in Bombai, in which 106 people died in 2008.
The Ministry of Interior attaches the investigation to this matter a great significance, putting its goal to ensure that the " Кампai Operation" weakness of the fake Al-Kaida accommodation at the international level and "limited its operational capacities".
The investigators estimate that during two years when this cell could be active in Catalan, send thousands of travel passports to Thailand, where it was then counterfeited and then delivered to groups forming a criminal galaxy of Al-Kaida, so that their "fighters" could travel without punishment over the borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active network in Europe, so these investigations were also attended by other European police units except Thai services, and there was no way to exclude that in the next days in other European countries there were no similar interventions such as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In connection with this operation (which were detained by the Pakistanians Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabra Asghar, Malik Istikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) developed another in Thailand where the Pakistanians were captured by Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thaic Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the men who were driving from Bangkok a cell sitting in Spain and other in other European countries.
The catalan network, whose part was eliminated in 2009, was stealing travel passports to tourists who met the Islamic requirements.
This means that the documents must have belonged to men aged 25 to 45 years, have been valid for several years and have been without visas.
In the investigation documents, it emphasizes that there are no facts yet known that would link from Catalan to the assassination in Bombai, despite the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", to be one of the groups that accepted passports stolen in Spain and then fake in Thailand.
However, it is worth mentioning that a few days before this assassination was sent from Catalan a transfer agency of about a thousand dollars that were "invested" to buy cards into mobile phones, which later used by members of the "command", which killed 106 people.
The police have already taken a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) requires Mass to stop the fiscal agreement
The President of the PPC Party (Lid Party of Catalonia) Alicia Sanchez-Camach had yesterday the opportunity to present Arthur Mass its conditions, under which he is willing to support his introduction into the function of President Generalitat; these conditions are consistent with those proposed during the campaign and their priority is the recovery of the economy and renouncement of risk firms such as the economic agreement he wants to propose during his mandate.
The Chairman of the Catalan People has been delivered to a meeting with Arthur Mass with certainty that 18 messenger chairs received in the elections from last Sunday, which is more than satisfactory for the acquisition of the pleasant, so the ClU candidate needs at least one of the forms of opposition to hold the vote on his entry into the office.
The future alliance that the nationalists in the Assembly would like to maintain when general elections are held, but the interviews that lead to Mas with the rest of the political leaders are currently being carried out in the catalan spirit.
With regard to the President of the PP in order to obtain its support for the functioning, "he will have to end with all the sovereign and free speeches", as well as with the economic agreement -- similar to the Baskick leader of the CIA -- that he even wanted to vote in the referendum.
Both leaders would like to cut out the overriding political instrument of autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
Details of the negotiations on Masov's entry into function will be addressed within the PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised a strong opposition, Joan Herrero (ICV) and today meets Joan Puigcercos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laport (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric device assures that death has not been caused by "death of measure"
Presentations of Olot Centre do not exclude that their carer killed more than 11 clients
The leadership of the Gariatric Centre La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to evaluate what damage caused the criminal behavior of Joan Vily Dilmé, a guardian who - while he was employed here - killed at least 11 seniors he had been caring for.
The director of this home for the senior Joan Sala was escorted by the lawyer of the establishment, Joan Canady's lawyer, and announced that "the wish of the home of La Caritat would be able to bring charges against the guilty" responsible for the murder, however, "legitimacy and responsibilities oblige us to leave this process to the competent authorities".
In addition to the damage to the good name that this institution may suffer because it has not revealed criminal activities of the guardian in time, a great threat to the home of La Caritat is now the requirements for material compensation already calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the remaining.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime has already happened in August 2009 and that he hasn't stopped killing since that time.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of the senior clients' home with suspicion that in many cases no doctor had seen the dead personally, but that - given the age and bad health of patients - everything was resolved on the phone.
La Caritat, through its director yesterday, definitely rejected this extremeity and emphasized that "a lack of measures could in no way be the cause of what happened".
The Legal Representative of La Caritat added that “in the case there is no indication that, except for the accused, any third person would have made any doubts.”
The man now called "Angel of Death" admitted the death of 11 yesterday and stated that the first crime was committed on 29 August 2009 and a month and a month and a half later, he killed the second old woman.
in this case, death was caused by the administration of too high dose of insulin, unlike the first case when the mixture of calming tablets was used.
Director La Caritat stated that it is complicated to control the personnel's access to medicines.
Insulin and cocktail sedativ were likely in six cases of nine means that this carer used to kill patients in his attempt to relieve them from suffering.
However, the analysis that is currently being carried out in the lab should show whether Vila is not lying and is really looking for his first victims with less cruel death or killing them, as he already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
in La Caritat, they do not believe in medical claims and do not exclude that the number of killers can be higher than the one he admitted, and justify their behavior in various versions that Vila has submitted to the court with awareness that he has to change his actions when it appeared to have killed eight people.
They therefore say that they want justice to be available to light the whole scope of this matter.
European Central Bank Threats
The investors responded very quickly yesterday to the threat of President of the European Central Bank of Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The border diferencials closed by force, and the shares to the European bank fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to make mistakes - the euro has just risen above the critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical for the non-liquid market, which, though happens to decline, is recovered -- but thanks to a short and very speculative position.
Investor will take a while before he loses his concerns.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us to retrieve the liquidity peace today, and tomorrow he will have to renounce the fourth in two years.
Bundesbank demanded termination of the public debt plan for ineffectiveness and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the period of time and leaving unlimited access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to predict "minimum to March" and to hold three-monthly eligibility with unlimited access to the end of this trimester to guarantee the liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue to pursue their debt purchase programme and even to announce its intensification.
If it does not fulfil the expectations, it will rebuild the markets from yesterday, and if they continue blindly to download the liquidity rate, God with us!
The same was at the May convention, where they claimed that they were not even considering buying bonds, and there was a collapse of markets -- tomorrow history could be repeated.
The European Central Bank must be reliable and endurable.
In May, the pancier's fist announced it on Monday and told me Wednesday that many of them had already been purchased, which caused a further disturbance of the market.
Yesterday's receipt of exchanges for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the auction previously.
Thus, the rates in Portugal dropped by 30 points below, reflecting the change in the nature of the market, which happened after Trichet.
The numbers were published in Ireland are the losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent approximately 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15,000, they have a chance to become private capital by February, otherwise they will be declined.
Although Ireland has no credibility, since the problem has not revealed stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable within the aid plan and will help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need to obtain the approval of the new budget by Parliament, and there is still no sufficient support, so uncertainty continues to rule in Ireland.
Angela Merkel mitigated its tone of speech to release the tension in the face of the next EU summary meeting held on December 14th, where it is necessary to reach a political compromise that would show that we are the union and we are all on the same ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagnera, while others prefer Beethovenova Oda to joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had yesterday an opportunity to present a plan of action to be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, employment recovery measures - to the ears of the investors, it sounds like the four-year period from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish bureau increased by 4.5%, thus twice as the other European storms.
Unlike February, government reactions and the Spanish National Bank were rapid and persuasive - we are apparently a surprise effect.
Today we have a key accounting account for three years, which will be benefited from the Trichet effect, which, we hope, will be a major demand that will help disturb doubts about our refinance ability.
Request a rescue plan would be for Spain's self-wedding.
They would give us cash that we don't need - in El Tesoro there are 40,000 million in cash, three times more than in March - further high rates and market access would close our son to die.
However, it is necessary to continue using the Emperor's wife's strategy - "not only being it, but also to seem that."
We can do it.
The President of the Eulen Group attacks the negotiations of Vega Sicilia demanded by his children
The storm in an open conflict in the family of Alvarez, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro, is not silent.
David Alvarez, the founder of the group, will think of it after he considered it "very meaningless", the legal proceedings of El Enebro, planned at 16 this month, and the five of his seven offspring, on which they should try to force their majority and relieve with the help of the administrative authorities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons, Jesús David and Maria José, have set up a legal group for their new chapter of arguing about the rule of part of society.
The founder of the largest holding of business services does not seem to be willing to dispute in its dispute on membership in the governing authorities of the El Enebro Group.
of its Administrative Committee, five of its seven descendants, who were named transmissions during the meeting of shareholders on 18 January this year and whose objection was filed in the Trade Register.
The Tribunal of the El Enebro Group planned for the sixteenth month, which was called by the Officer of the Trade Court No. 2 in Madrid, renewed the loon of the family of Alvarez.
The appeal to the judge is the only legal means that guarantees the appointment of the Commission.
The last step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elvira of the Alvarez Mezquirezs considers David Alvarez "the desperate means of his five children serving through the judicial law and a clear legal fraud for strengthening and improving the proceedings of January 18, which was completely inappropriate".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal attack of this proceedings as "very meaningless".
The self-protagonists who are discreetly silent have tried to summon the court in June.
in El Enebro, a group owner of other activities Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls seven descendants of David ALVAREZ 100% capital.
However, the founder of the group, according to family protocols, requires the right to use 51% of capital.
This matter is a key question that the judge will have to decide on the question of the trial.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with secret weapons from Siemens
Software proposes improvement in vehicles in real time.
Since the Red Bull came into the Formule 1 series in 2004, his history in this special speed world is characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took too seriously the possibility of this new arrival team, and despite the rising trend of recent times, everyone was betting on the Ferrari Fernand Alons triumph.
Without wanting to reduce the riding capacity of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibilities of the Renault engine, which drives his car, in the world of Formula 1, a legend was born -- "secret weapons" that multinational Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to make him a victory team.
In fact, it is an executive software simulating marches that the German company has marketed in 2007 for very remote car sports.
So-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to propose mounting lines in production races around the world, in energy races and for high precision devices.
His goal is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is realized, thus avoiding useless mistakes and expenditure.
The PLM has facilitated the development of Canon, Sukhoi aircraft or the most famous user vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwourm, head of the Siemens Industrial Division, explains that the use of this software applies to the Red Bull team to perform "in a few hours, in almost real time" modification and improvements that otherwise detected during races and tests.
Rasswourm says that in 1992 the stakes were employed by a average of 10 techniques that were able to perform up to three or four improvements during one period.
in the Red Bull team today works for 180 young highly qualified professionals equipped with effective information techniques that analyze and propose every type of modification of race vehicles.
The leader of the company Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyse and improve all the elements of the Red Bull race vehicles, except the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours by means of advanced production systems using laser and highly technologically advanced autoloops.
The only limit of this technical capacity is the amount of $40 million representing the maximum that each team of Formula 1 can issue in each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull set up about 50 km from London a race of high technologies that served as design and production of its race cars.
It is two buildings in which visits are limited - especially to journalists.
Everything that's going on here is considered "great secret".
The list of participating in this project reads 580 people, including two pilots - the champion of Vettel and Mark Webber.
Hero Red Bull is in Formula 1 without doubt a fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
However, other protagonists whose aid is invaluable, and no one knows them.
The Manufacturing Technology Chief Steve Nevey claims that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in the research and development of vehicles contributed to 50% victory and the rest was the credit of riders.
This ratio has now changed and technology is worth 85% success, while the pilots contribute from 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by calculating techniques, because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP shall establish 20 own trades within two years in collaboration with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in collaboration with his business partner Pont Reyes yesterday opened its first exclusive sale in Barcelona.
This business will be the first of 20 trades in the area of 80 to 100 m2, which this supernational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These shops will also be located in 16 already existing business houses such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Inglés.
Vice-President of Spanish HP Helena Herrer presented as an example of a newly reconstructed sale on Barcelona Gran Via, belonging to Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for 30 years.
The Northern American company has planned to establish 200 sales sites in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish trades.
The first sales were opened last week in Bucharest (Rumunia) and Belgrade (Serbia), the trade in Barcelona is third.
Herrer didn't want to tell where other sales would be opened, however, she confessed that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrer, who also runs HP staff systems, assured that the philosophy of opening trades will continue to be the same - using local distributors with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North America Company advises here with an exclusive design of sales equipment (with products that can be interactively tested), which will be identical in Europe.
Furthermore, HP also deals with the security of trade personnel.
Helena Herrer denied that it would be franchising, and stressed that the exclusive network of sales has a goal to "establish customer service, services to small and medium-sized businesses in shopping, service, sales service and even packaging".
Trade in Barcelona is part of the pilot pioneer programme at the world level, which aims to address the possible problems with computer devices in the guarantee.
Online service is connected to the technical centre of Maastricht (Netherlands).
"We'll be able to solve problems in 10 minutes, which may take up to two days."
"This system is designed specially for small and medium-sized enterprises and for customers, since large companies already have a contract service technical assistant," Helena Herrer emphasized yesterday.
Sabadell's betting on stealing a million clients for three years.
More optimistic than other bosses, a delegated member of the Bank's Council, Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be difficult for the bank, but rejects the new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of passive war.
However, it counts on the reduction of interest rates, which will try to compensate by reimbursement of banking fees and credit prices.
Sabadell expects him to be able to get a million private clients within three years.
Sabadell found a way to use the next three years and to survive so in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan for three years in 2011.
The goal is, in addition to surviving without the need to turn to public aid in FROB, to acquire a market share by captureing a million new private clients - respect of 700,000 if those who will leave the bank - since the institution has rather moved small and medium-sized businesses and large businesses than small clients.
This year the bank has already received 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is 3.5% in private clients, while it is more than 10% in the company client.
Another of the basic ideas of the plan 2011-2013 is a commitment to productivity, or can also be said soberness in order to reduce the costs of which the bank will show the challenges when presenting the results during the period.
A few banking institutions are daring to determine their goals at this time and to publish them, since the financial crisis has changed all world banking plans.
Sabadell closes its Optima programme, established four years ago, although originally was for three years, but the market situation required extension for the next period.
The clients who leave the sponsors will be their main target group.
The APIE meeting insisted that Guardiol would be "deep and very important" in 2011.
He believes that the journey from the crisis in Spain will "be long."
Furthermore, in two or three years, it will "be very difficult to create employment", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And although he believes that the passive war - which reduces the margin - is declined, the price of intakes for the risk paid by banks and creditors for their emissions to receive liquidity is already being transferred to credit prices, compensating the reduction of the margins.
"The theme of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor for loans."
"We haven't closed the collar yet, but the diferencials are very high," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already issued its networks on Thursday orders to reduce long-term loans and increase the prices of diferencials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking is "now reduced commissions", but there is a competitive framework.
The Sabadell's strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
It doesn't guarantee for nothing that in Spain "will require greater size."
"The next year will not remain on the stone," he assured.
It confirms that capital needs are "properly reduced" and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions will enter between red numbers.
It also indicates that the FROB can supplement fund collections on the market before a new capital measure.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary conclusion of the markets, it remains a serious problem what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but, unlike what was in June, it is possible to receive short-term funding by means of repo rates, which reduces the crisis.
CECA excludes another fusion wave
The Director-General of the CECA refused yesterday that another wave of fusion should be accompanied, and again insisted on the speed with which the reorganization of the sector was carried out.
When the merger process was launched, several institutions assured that the first phase would not participate and wait for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta excluded yesterday that there should be a new wave of these operations.
"I believe that most of the fusions have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Civica group cannot be considered as a second round, what happens is the conventions."
"The majority is fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 constitutions we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes are already ready and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which cooperated very well in this matter," said the Director.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting (Aragon's Association of Heads and Personal Officers - Knowledge.) Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process is performed by "the highest possible speed and we must be very pleased, as it appears in the payments of its time, not now, appeared in trade plans with the Spanish National Bank", he stressed.
"Going from 45 compartments with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 to 75,500 million is a process that does not have comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to be larger and thus falling in line with the Basile Treaty," he stressed.
Olavarriet acknowledged that "there is a number of happy opinions on the disadvantage of the process", which show "a lack of seriousness and understanding," because "the thing the Spanish National Bank does is reminding us that we must be at the end of the year in the term."
The Director-General of CECA José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain has the most strict financial system throughout Europe and "probably" both in the world, and those who question it, condemned "in lack of knowledge".
The director noted that in the current favourable economic situation, we can "be calm" about financial institutions and the communicative system that has managed the "very important" concentration process and continues with "the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking was very good from stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and red German lines
Berlin decided to maintain the euro, but set the conditions for the entire Union.
The tension on the markets caused a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from the reduction of taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises, by regulating private intermediate agencies or cancelling 426 euros for unemployed unemployed persons, until the privatisation of 49% of AENA (Spain airports and air traffic management - signed.), the manager of Barayas and El Prat airport and 30% of the state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgada, with the support of the former Prime Minister Felip Gonzaleze, at the other hand, joined criticians to the address of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility for resolving the current crisis.
How can we interpret this movement?
For example, Merkel's opinion is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of the euro redetermination.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what his future is to be, which implies on the idea of respecting old traditions, which is held by a large number of other members.
The face of the European resistance in Germany begins to speculate about three possible paths from the crisis.
The first represents a strong euro area, which would be part of Germany, but also Austria or the Netherlands, while Southern States would leave the currency zone.
The second is the return to Marce - although now it can appear as scifies, this version has wide public support, nearing 50% of the inhabitants.
The third option is, according to the German proposals for the processing of the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary strictness, penalties for the prosecuted States, possible payments for some of them, and by extending possible costs for regulation on the private sector.
The German position is clear and has already been defined for a while, so there is no space for screws now.
First, in 2009, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission initiated deficits, the German Government pulled the constitutional reform from the sleeve to prevent them since 2016.
This was the first indication of the dispute between what Germany considered proper (fiscal strictness plans and public finance stability) and by practicing its European partners, including France.
The second showed this medium-European country when Merkel painfully stretched Greece's rescue decisions.
It was already the subject of a sharp criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinions that have also been published were strongly against Greece's salvation.
Finally, in the last October days, Merkel again appeared with a clear opinion when she demanded reforming the European Union's Conventions so that a Member State could be saved and at the same time to enable private creditors to carry out a part of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as an anti-European, since it has accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although somewhat mitigated, was approved, and in the next months, we should monitor the Union reform process, which should allow these measures since 2013.
Germany was a red line that she wouldn't cross.
And it tells us all that, although now it is necessary to make measures that apparently disagree with, it will be over from this date with the old euro function.
The year 2013 will be the birth of a new currency zone in which the States infringement rules will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to announce payment delays, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany suggests that we must put ourselves in a strict way of growth with an increase in savings and investments, moderate consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness and capital reserves.
Another option based on claims and construction, with enormous spaces in the payment balance, which was ruled in the years of the growth of Spain, they simply do not tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we would have made a mistake if we hadn't understood it.
It is not only a renewal of public deficit at 3% in 2013.
What they want from us is much harder.
And the worst thing is, under these conditions, we might be wrong ourselves.
I hope these current turbulencies will be more calm.
And that we'll use the opportunity they're giving us to spring 2013.
It appears that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this and his double statement (reforms promised after meeting with large businesses from last Saturday and yesterday's notification of new measures) has given the idea that, through the criticism on Merkel's address, the way of the idea that things should be fixed.
However, the red line, which Germany has emerged, is here, and it does not seem to want to move with it.
And from the possibilities to be considered, the evasion of the euro area full of serious countries cannot be excluded.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that she warned us.
Sport and circulation of rules
Finty, which Alonso and Ramos showed in the fight with Ajax, show a tip never intends to escape the punishment.
Real Madrid (Xabi Alons and Sergei Ramose) has been excluded from two players in the Ajax League of 23 November, which has caused the sea of the ink to decline whether this is or not a non-portary behaviour and whether EUFA should not have been punished by both footballists.
As we know, a few minutes before the end of the struggle (which their team had been clearly earned) the named players each after another deliberately wasted their time at the time that faul was to play so to provoke the judge, and it showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will fulfil the prescribed penalty in the next fight against Auxerre - and Real Madrid will end in their group in the head - and will be able, rid of the card, to continue to another stage.
Finally, the EUFA disciplinary committee gave coach José Mourinh a penalty for two matches, and the prosecutors received a penalty.
Provoking the yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but it is more common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of football ethos, so rules that are not written but observed.
Part of the debate in this case came from the fact that her participant was the Real Madrid team (which praises in her hymnasty with nobleness and honour, and who has already been punished by his players for similar acts), and as it appears, also by the dramatics led by Mourinh, which thus adds to his long history of the comedian and provoker of another episode.
In any case, the debate is about whether this type of action, which is not explicitly prohibited, is in contrast with sports principles, therefore whether there is a circulation of law in these acts; it is indeed an action respecting the sports rules whose sense, however, seem to be around.
It is resolved what kind of damage such acts make a sports spirit.
One of the relevant sports behaviour is the physical intactivity of players who have not been distorted in these cases, or there has not been a violent game.
Another of these characteristics of a pure game is to avoid the players to have their offences against the opponent's team of benefits, which has also not occurred here.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is the fact that there was no normal characterization of what we have characterized as a forest or the circulation of law, there has not been a hidden violation of rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behavior should be as much as possible in order to receive the punishment.
They waited, and they loved to get a punishment.
Another question, however, is, what advantage will the guilty of their deliberate offences have.
Here it is necessary to establish that the rival does not get into a disadvantaged position and that no benefit will be targeted in the current match, as the obvious result is that the team itself will have less players.
And it's not even a useful strategy for the next game, because the club will not be able to count with these players.
The benefit is obviously that players start another stage of the League of Masters without cards that could threaten their participation in the future match.
However, it is the advantage of long-term perspective and with a certain degree of inadequacy, therefore, at first, the team can be eliminated, and, in addition, the players will be regained with the punishment, and they will go to the second round of cards in which the exclusion is enough for one card less than in the first round.
So as the wheels continue, it won't be quite clear if it's the advantage.
Shortly and well, these actions are not against the sports spirit, which is part of a strategic decision that allows for maximum benefit under the rules.
In the case that we are dealing with here, the players had no goal of avoiding the punishment (as a clear case of rule circulation), but rather chose when to obey him.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding a punishment or running from him.
Although the boundaries between the type and the circulation of rules are absolutely clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly a nature.
It seems to me that the debate comes for two reasons: because it was two self-exclusions and the way it was carried out by instructions to provoke them from leadership.
The damage to sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as ethical.
Fight of offers for Christmas partys in Barcelona
The calendar dictate concentrates the reservation lavin this year on 16 and 17 December.
Fastly accommodate the celebration of self-employed employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like a Turkish honey or lottery, the first-night partys are coming again in December, which still acts as a oxygen bomb for restaurants and free time facilities in Barcelona, but through the crisis, they struggled in combating clients with price reductions: almost all want to spend 20 to 30 euros for food, the businesses and associations of this sector are in line.
In order to complete the complications of the numbers, it concentrated the calendar this year (when the Christmas Day was on Friday) of the request for a week from 13 December, which created the reservation lavina for days in the summary (16 and 17), while in the last week there was almost no operation.
As this happens since 2008, since the thin years began, many companies have been dismissed by collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order to not leave traditions, many employees pay for their own pocket party loss.
Regardless of the situation, many require prices at the limit of capability, says the President of the Association of Restauracio de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The representative of the patronate of the restaurant facilities is not daring to predict the celebration this month.
"People will think well before they make a booking."
"They want to go out, but on the subject of prices, they are cautious," he adds.
Business will go well to those "which offer quality and good service at a favourable price", he says and recalls that the crisis has the customers' tendency to go down and most customers want to spend about 25 euros now.
The examination in various facilities shows that the biggest effort of the reservation requests is on 17 December night.
The Soteras group reports a real boom booking for this Friday, most of the requirements are to be spent up to 30 euros, allowing the offered menus, whose total prices are between 25 and 30 euros.
in another important company that Andilana reads 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Funda, and other) has brought the specialty of the year’s calendar more early bookings since the beginning of November.
"We have made possible and impossible to keep the prices from last year, and our menus, from which everyone should choose, are moving from 19.95 to 30 euros," they state.
In the AN Group, which belongs to El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and totally reads 23 businesses, they remain optimistic since the second half-year rise of profits and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas markets.
The sources of this company emphasize that 18 December will also be a burdened day, since the pre-night feasts will be held among friends.
In comparison with the last year, the guest tendency to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanese forest wine - knockle).
They also noted that companies that again call their employees are already appearing, and it seems that the size of groups is something bigger.
Vice-President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as Bar Association, Restaurants and Free Time Centre in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that he starts to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of bookings is "free", although the clients "contract to the maximum".
This impression even during Christmas celebrations did not pass, let anyone pays show.
The Pakistan Nuclear Program has produced a great disturbance in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons "faster speed than any other country."
Wikileaks documents confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The contents of correspondence between the United States Ambassador in Pakistan and the United States Foreign Ministry, published by Wikileaks, confirms the exceptional disturbance that the Pakistan Nuclear Programme in Washington triggers.
In addition to the explanatory and significant details offered on the contents of communication and thoughts of representatives of the North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two States, as regards nuclear security, instead of increasing, "is on retreat", and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other State".
The speciality of the Pakistan Nuclear Programme - that his weapons are not mounted, but consists in the works to disrupt their destruction in the case of attack - represents one of the main reasons for Washington’s awakement.
This calculates the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before visiting a national security adviser James Jones: "The closestness of some nuclear devices to the territory under the control of Taliban, the alleged distraction of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
Increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and the controlled shooting programme is no longer observed only in the USA but also in Russia, as a widespread and presenting reason to be attentive.
"Pakistan had to hire a strict religious personnel to protect nuclear facilities; due to the decline of education and culture levels, extreme organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programs or programs managed by shots," said Jurij Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with their US troops.
The largest news of documentation published by Julian Assange server is increasingly lower cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the topics of nuclear weapons and the increased pakistan production of these weapons.
Depesses issued by the embassy in May, which qualify for communication with Pakistan as "frusting", say: "Transparence often does not exist; aid offers remain without response or are rejected".
In the next report, Peter Lavoy, a national rapporteur service for South Asia, states that "in spite of the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other state in the world".
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to "exclude very well" the "pakistan army must end with silent support to terrorist groups during the visit of the Chief of the Army of General Ashfaq Kayani.
Hone to Chief Wikileaks
Obama appoints a highly built worker responsible for the fight against terrorism to avoid the new escapes of information.
Interpol issues a "red challenge" to track and determine where Assange could be.
All about Wikileaks and his founder Julian Assange forms a complicated labyrinte where it's hard to be certain of facts.
Interpol announced yesterday a "extreme challenge", called a red note, to "localization and monitoring of movement" of Assange.
However, it is not a classic order for detention.
Besides, this challenge is not new, it is dated by 20 November.
And it has nothing to do with the last escape of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that Australian faces in Sweden.
Furthermore, the legal representative of Wikileaks Mark Stephens assures the "police know where and how to contact Mr. Assang".
It was on November 20, when the international police in the French Lyon issued this order on the request of Sweden, it was not published until yesterday, when the Swedish authorities were authorized.
In this situation, 188 countries of Interpol have the instructions for identifying or location of Assange "with aimed at putting on it a temporary tie and issued it."
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of the person concerned with the red challenge, many Member States, as explained by the organization, however, consider the so-called order of notice to be carried out as permitting arrest - this must be secured by the national police component - especially if the States have a two-sided detention agreement, such as Sweden and England, where the Assange should be found.
This step disturbed Assenge's lawyers who published the writing yesterday, where they declare that the ninety-year-old founder Wikileaks was willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by using a video conference.
They also recall that Assenge asked and then received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, compared with the legendary Lavrenti Paulovic Beriou, head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter states.
While the whole world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother protects his son's innocence - Assange is still in the unknown place, he is not silent.
On Monday, Skype provided an interview with the chief editor of Time - in this conversation, he demanded a demision from the Foreign Minister of the United States of Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that it was responsible for the order of the US diplomats to spy in the United Nations and to break international conventions signed by the United States, it should resign," he said.
His view was rejected yesterday by the press speaker of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demand for demisia as "funny and absurd".
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual that operates the website," CNN announced.
The Obama himself has authorized a highly built worker responsible for the fight against terrorism, Russella Traverse, to avoid further escapes of documents.
The intention of the speaker President Barack Obama to stop adding Assang to the importance of contrary to the views that conservative politics and comments are advertising in these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will be chairman of the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber since January, has requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to examine the possibility to include Wikileaks among terrorist organizations "to be able to interfere with and pursue anyone who would financially contribute or otherwise to help them".
Still further went Tom Flanagan, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who said Assange should be "be killed", which he had to subsequently revoke.
"Obama should write a reward or use a pilot or something."
Whoever didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, baptist priest, former governor of Arkansas and possible president candidate.
"Whoever is in the government, who is responsible for the escape of information, has committed treasons and any other punishment than the execution would be too modest," said Fox station
Puigcercos is looking for peace in the ERC by embarrassing Caroda
The Republican leader will allow a secret vote on its endurance.
Huguet suggests more plural executive and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercos apparently found a recipe of how to combat the already several-first internal revolt in the row of ERC (Levic Republican Party Catalanska - Knock.), unreasonable because of the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The Chairman of the Party is aware that his gesture on demisis seems to be insufficient to the advocates of the former leader Joseph Lluís Caroda-Rovira, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is as weakened today as his leader himself, and that he cannot absolutely make him such anxiety as he had with other missing streams.
That is why Levice leader will try to get new criticisms by turmoiling that will help him turn into general elections.
First of all, Puigcercos announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the entire state committee will be able to speak secretly to its endurance in the function.
By voting tickets, not by raiseing your hand.
If Caroda's members will want to give the president a criminal vote, they will be able to do without fear of the legal measures.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the fracture and fabrication of his person.
In several interviews, he claimed that he would not be considered confirmed with half the votes and one more, but added, without accuraging the percentage that it would also not be a good result "in Bulgarian".
Caroda's representatives require more than to give their function - which they consider as a gesture that does not weigh, as Puigcercos controls the biggest authority at the conventions.
But since they don't have enough majority to force demises, they will try executively to remind the plan from now to May.
Therefore, they expect to participate in the drafting of a strategic reorientation document to be held by the National Council on 18 days of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercose in exchange for this promise to move the Congress on autumn 2011.
The Leader of ERC declared that "multimity" damages stability and that its goal is that the organization will be able to wash its dirty laundry at the closed doors once and for all.
in this context, it appears to be an encouraging article that current advisor Joseph Huguet signed on his blog.
After taking into account Puigcercos' ideologist, this innovation advisor took it to be a complete thing that the leader will be confirmed by "in exchange for several targets".
And he named five of them, of which two came.
The first is the "recompensation" of executives so that it represents at least 90% of the members, which means to include new faces that are from the Carod sector.
The second target can be a big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC complete its meeting as an operational mechanism.
So he fights for reform of the statute so that conventions can be held through the delegations chosen by vote.
Completion of the meeting system model, exclusion in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of the Puigcercos team that has already been fighting in this direction at the last two conventions.
However, the 2008 shrewd meeting decided that the meeting must be assessed at a special convention on reforms.
This issue is still unresolved, as the situation inside the party has distracted from the solution to this matter.
Now, without qualifying critical sectors, it could be a suitable time to reconsider this matter and try to close it once and for all.

China observes its goal to reduce glass gases
The representative of this country at the UN Conference on Climate Changes, COP16, assured that its country has developed extraordinary efforts to reduce carbon trail, and stated that it insisted on its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will fulfil its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, assured Su Wei, the representative of this country at the UN Conference on Climate Changes.
In its first public performance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei has ensured that its country has developed enormous efforts to reduce carbon track and transform its industry.
He said that his country has already invested $245 million in trying to reduce glass gas emissions in the past four years.
However, he realized that China would not change its goals and continue to work together with the international community.
He pointed out that the Chinese strategy for climate change is divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity building, building institutions and support for pilot programmes.
In all these points, progress has already been recorded, including last year's approval of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
He further emphasized that in China, federal authorities cooperated coordinated with provincial and local authorities to achieve their objectives in terms of energy savings, effective energy use and emission reduction.
Furthermore, as he communicated, various several-year plans have already been completed, funded by both the Chinese government and the governments of other countries.
For example, it is stated that the Programme for Effective Energy Exploitation, which has been introduced over the past five years, which has received investment from the United Nations, government and private initiatives.
The provincial project of climate change also runs, further the project to exchange lights for savings lamps, and the mitigation and adaptation project, set out.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the expert advisor of this country for climate change, assured that the efforts of China were greater than they generally thought.
For example, he calculated the greenhouse gas emissions on one inhabitant represent 6 tonnes in China, while it is 100 tonnes in the United States; China is responsible for 9% of the historic share in emissions.
It has also developed unprecedented efforts as regards energy usage -- for example, it has increased 20% efficiency in energy over the past five years and expects further progress by 2020, he added.
Acted exclusion of Espina: Cesar Nava
The National Chairman of the PAN (Partido Acción National, Czech National Action Party - Knowledge.) stated that the former Chairman of this party is entitled to demand from the National Regular Commission of its law.
The National Chairman of the PAN, Cesar Nava Vazquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientos was legalized and that the former Chairman of this party was entitled to contact the National Regular Commission and to require its right.
in an interview, which was raised before the objection by the Governor of the State of Gabin Cué Monteagud, said that exclusion of Espina in any case is a decision taken at the local level.
"It's one of the autonomous decisions of the Sonora Regular Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal in his case through a complaint to the Request Commission of the National Council in order to make a decision made by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that now is no time to think for 2012 and that she has never been at the negotiating table on the presidential candidacy of the Alliance.
Nava Vazquez expressed his conviction that the PAN will come from the internal elections of the following 4th and 5 December, in which his follower will be voted, will be strengthened.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a theme that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for now, was the purpose of local elections that had been successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The President PAN said that his side stands 71 years of dialogue, and therefore "we are not afraid of internal competition, but we hardened and strengthened from it," he added.
He said that the Committee would be able to choose the best President or Chairperson whom PAN deserves for the next three years, so it will convey the chaffet to "who the committee will determine".
"I am therefore absolutely calm and relaxed, and any of those five with pride I will give to the Bureau of the Party."
He foretold that the rise that the party has recorded in the last July elections will reflect in the future moons, although "not yet time to think for 2012."
"Now we need to escort Governor Gabina Cué in this mission."
In this context, he emphasized that these three governments, which have roots in the Alliances in Oaxace, Pueble and Sinaloe will represent the flag and will be subject of observation throughout the country, since "their many expectations and desires are included in them, and I am sure that Gabino is worthy of these expectations."
When we asked him to criticize President Felipe Calderon by the Pri (Partido Revolutionary Institutional, Czech Revolutionary Institute Party, Known.) for his speeches within four years, Cesar Nava called on members of the PRI to consider the six-year periods of former Presidents Ernest Zedilla and Carlos Salinase de Gortari.
"If the governments of Zedilla and Salinas believe they were better than the rule of Fox and Claderon, let them start defending them to get out of their ultimates," he stated.
He expressed that the head of the federal power has the right to express himself as he did during the National Auditorship, since no manufacturing or cenzura are used in this country.
Obama promotes a law on Twitter to support students without evidence
"If you believe that the approval of the Dream Act is correct, let your Senators know and insist that they approve this law," said the US President on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today, with a contribution to his personal social account, Twitter joined the national mobilization to support the law of Dream Act, which should legalize students without documents.
"If you believe that the approval of the Dream Act is correct, let your Senators know and insist that they approve this law," tweeted Obama.
His brief report points to the Internet reference to a larger document that asks the public to connect immediately with the Senators, since the vote on this law is approaching.
"Because the voting is expected to take place soon, it is now a moment to let your opinion sound," he pointed out.
The report was published after 42 Republican Senators threatened by blocking approval of any law unless the increase in taxes from Bush's era and government finances were approved.
Such blocking, notified by letter signed by the 42 Republican Senators, could affect the vote on the law of Dream Act and other projects, such as ratification of a new contract with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons called START.
When asked about the republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the president said that he believed that once the fiscal theme was resolved, it would be possible to make a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe that there's still plenty of time left..."
"We all agree that we have to deal with the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that we can reach agreements in this matter at a certain point and then we will be able to plan a series of other matters," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask for "voting to close the debate" on the law of Dream Act, so that the proposal for legalization of students without documents could be voted in the Senate since the next Thursday, although it is more likely next week.
The senator's approval of Dream Act, or the law of the "American dream" would legalize about 800,000 young people who had arrived in the United States before the age of 16, stayed in the country during the past five years and were adopted to a higher education or army institution.
However, the respondents need to approve the proposal of 60 votes, which require the assistance of several Republicans, so the organisations of its participants carry out intense agitation to ensure the approval of this law.
Democrats whose most Dream Act supports have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, expressed that he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for this law.
Therefore, the participants of the Dream Act need to obtain several Republicans in case other democrats decide to refuse the proposal.
Among the Republican Senators with whom the most negotiates are the Senators of Main Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as the resigning senator from Florida George Lemieux, who complemented the mandate of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchson from Texas, but they declared that the next time they won't support him.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet expressed himself at this point.
Although the Chamber of Representatives is attached to another version, according to most analysts, Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature they put their finger in the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "to put a finger in the wound" is the period of the Czech "Back a slipper on the head-knock.)
The second round of the cycle pleasure from the language was a promenade where participants showed literary gala show
"I understand the sex in language, but... the finger in the morning? What is expected from me?", asked writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round of pleasure from the language, the cycle that celebrates the literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used in this occasion as a subtitle (in other ways, they devoted the theme of Sex in language, explained).
The finger to the wound "we are brought to the tight," the Argentine writer said to the audience consisting mostly of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to hear this debate at the round table, modern Marisol Schultz, and with the participation of Valenzuel, Sergey Ramirez, Mayry Monter and Luise Garcia Montera.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text which was dedicated to Gonzala Celoria, and which Schultz then marked as a great story in which Louisa spoke in the first person as a protagonist who, when looking for knowledge of the "ran" is coming from a doctor to a doctor who does not get her answers, although the footprint of the same story yes.
The infector leaves the persuasive: "Truty is not my strong side, maybe it's my wound."
Finally, after frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the road, he explained to her that the morning is not a scientific term, it's a psychoanalytic who will reveal the secret: "The wound represents it really open and symbolic is a scar."
The protagonist sighed with relief and concluded that "on the wound, she was able to learn only so much that it was really open and that it was not," but she was convinced that the pleasure and strikes in the language must go along with her hand.
The writer Valenzuel played both of them.
Nikaraguying Sergio Ramirez also made a pleasant story called the Praise of the invention, in which the finger is not named in the wound, but in one moment it will appear.
With the elements of magic realism, it tells a famous witch who played the clouds, brings back the people who left far, or fixed the honour that one virgin lost, this story that then turned to speak to America, a great roman in which his own cronics, who told him, had not been missing since the beginning, and is quoted here by Bernal Diaz del Castillo, who criticizes exaggeration in the story of the winner captains.
"Cervantes, who invented us all (writers), laughed at a finged testimony that was presented as real, but in other ways, it has never been able to tell the story of America with such artificiality that lacked even shame."
However, he emphasized, "They are fools and liars who have a bigger fantasy" and just where the fact and lie are complied, where they don't know what the story belongs to one group, and what the other is the fictional literature of their top.
It really calls Cerant's tradition.
"We have his reference, what we have."
Then Mayra Monter emphasized and commended the variety of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Faith with its word Prst to the wound.
The Cuban-portorian writer showed its fingers on a big injury of social violence that passs through its country - and shares it in Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs close a quiet compromise, which is of course not intended," she said after saying that the reality of literature is communication and dimensions of compromise that is created between the author and the readers - and in their "chemical response".
The Spanish poet Luis Garcia Montero, whose performance also emphasized "to this finger in the wound of a writer bound by the writer."
He said that in the world in a hurry, also in intellectual habits and awareness control overriding dogmatism, it is forgotten, "that there is a small non attachment behind every entrance and there is also a small yes."
"To be mastered by our thoughts and realities, we must paint: and paint means putting a finger in the wound many times and disturbing those individuals who are much more comfortable, because he thinks in charts, blackwhile, in fixed ideas and without color, and also disturbing the authority that prefers this black-white world," he said to support the sense of writing.
Romano follows his first title
Ruben Omar Romano reads three defeats in the final, during his career he experienced good and bad, but he was able to achieve it at three occasions for a decision-making series.
in the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are two different styles that emphasize their techniques, teams that have a clear difference between results.
Ruben Omar Romano reads three defeats in the final, during his career he experienced good and bad, but he was able to achieve it at three occasions for a decision-making series, but until now he was leaving with the undefined, and that's why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentinian must have satisfied with the silver medail, remained a step behind the winner and curiously played with the same team the next finals.
As a trainer, the Santistical Strateg reached its first final at Apertura 2002, when he had a total of 4-2 against Toluce, and then went again to the decision-making duel at Clausura 2003, and also lost it with a total score 3-1, which was against the team of Rayados.
Already with the Santos Laguna tournament Torneo Bicentenario 2010, again against "Devils" from Toluka, Ruben again suffered the defeat, even though his team played against "Useners" (hereinafter name of the Deportivo Toluca Club - late.) after 210 minutes of games indecisively 2-2, after a series of criminal shootings, he got into the advantage of three per one and had two opportunities to seal the title, but at the end his three players passed from 11 steps and so the team suffered a turn to 4-3.
Ruben has already lost two finals against the Red Devils of Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, and he could celebrate the title for the first time, although he says he's the most important institution.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want to break statistics, this is for the club, for the passion I'm bound, and the title would, of course, be also for me, but the first is the most important thing," the coach said when he was asked about the numbers that speak in the finals against him.
In a living memory, he has had the previous finals, in which he confirms that he has learned many things, "we have taken the lesson that until the judge does not write the end, we cannot celebrate, we must be prepared for action, as well as players, because last two penalties, we have already been ready to celebrate, and I think we have learned in this until the match is over, we can't celebrate."
It doesn't concern him that this series could be decided in criminal shooting, believes his players: "You never try to get to a series of criminal cocks, you try to end up in normal time, but sometimes there's no other option and it's necessary to be ready for it, in the last tournament, but unfortunately, fate has made us a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxieties we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, something left in us and hope that this time will not happen."
Romano has a chance to stop being the other and taste the first glory that the titles bring.
United States amends the rules for visa participation
People will have to turn to the service centre for visa applicants before the Consular Division interview; the costs will be lower and the waiting time will be reduced.
Since 10 January 2011, the process of visa negotiating the United States Ambassador and consulates will be changed.
With a new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Centre of the Service for Visa Applicants (short from English ASC) before the interview at the Consular Division.
The ASC personnel will take from the applicant biometrical information and they will be evaluated by the Consular Division before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages between the following:
The total visa settlement costs will be lower, the fee will no longer be paid for the agreement of the meeting, the second for the processing of the application and the other for delivery of the transport service document.
The applicant shall only pay the only fee that covers all three services.
The current tariff remains unchanged: the amount corresponding to $140 for tourism visa, 150 dollars for applications (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visa for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to conduct an interview with a consular official, but only turn to the closest ASC, where they will submit their documents and their fingerprints will be obtained.
Since biometrical information will be obtained in the ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with the Consular Division, they will spend a shorter time here than in the past.
Also, those who will ask for visa on consulates in Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay extra fees for $26.

NASA will notify the discovery of alien life
The U.S. Space Agency called for a press conference tomorrow to present an discovery that could cause a fracture in searching for alien life.
The National Aviation and Universe Authority (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, on Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 o'clock at astrobiology experts, science dealing with the study of origin, evolution, spread and the future of life in space, on a press conference in NASA's headquarters in Washington.
When she invited the journalists, NASA assured them that she would present "the discovery that would cause a fracture in looking for an alien life", which raised the speculation of experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures who live in unhospitable conditions that were considered unavoidable and which could represent the possibility of one of them to become intelligent creatures, such as humans, if they improve the conditions in which they live.
According to the appearance, it is a microba found on the bottom of the lake Mono in the Yosemist National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich on the arsen.
The creation in some ways uses the arsen for its life, and this ability increases the probability that a similar life could exist on other planets that have no atmosphere as it is on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use in their metabolism of arsenals, it will prove that "there is a different form of life, different from the one we know."
The Space Agency will notify the real range of discoveries for tomorrow's press conference.
The conference will be attended by a geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of living on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who are studying Titan (the largest month of Saturn) with the perspective that his chemical composition is similar to this on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patron are becoming an opposite "block"
The reforms of the Constitutional Law on the Congress lead to the arrival of bipartism, they declare.
The 60th parliamentary period has not even been launched in Congress when the opposition block, led by the PRD (Partido de la Revolution Democratica, Czechly "Democratic Revolution Partido", PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Strana of Work" - recognition), Convergence (Cheese "Shoda" recognised.) and Jesus Manuel Patron Montalve, who declared himself independent, and these four discussed one thing: the arrival of "bipartism" to the Romania.
Before the beginning of the meeting at the beginning of the 60th parliamentary period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez of Convergence, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PRD and Patron Montalvo "hrimated" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, as it excludes them.
This reform, they repeated, begins "bapartism", because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control the Congress.
These four ambassadors, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, the co-ordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones who voted against the Council led by Salvador Löpez British by PAN (Partido Acción, Czech "National Action Party" - Known.) and Louis Cardenas Fonsecou as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms are institutionally forming political marginality from the PR (Partido Revolutionary Institutional, Czech "Revolutionary Institute Party") and PAN.
He stated that during the next days they would talk to PAN and PRI representatives to modify the scheme on the basis of the political will, and if they do not, they will again be subjected to these two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
"When I came here (the opposition coalition), I am looking at it because we are excluded from any decision, they are not even willing to consider the views of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez of Convergence stated that the PRD, PT and Patron would be compatible and therefore will form a plurality group.
It is impossible to allow, to continue Congress after being monopolous, now being "duple".
The aspiration of law reform is not to be an infinite bipartism in Congress.
This group begins with five legislators and its members are now talking to other colleagues and colleagues to gain more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza by PT explained that Congress currently became "utilities" of two - in the PAN and PRI.
"Only one side was controlled, two today divide it."
Patron Montalvo asked for respect for the personality of the messenger to give him a place at the work table.
"To be five of us who are probably going to be nine, but now see us at five, we have not remained outside, everyone in another fraction, we have joined ourselves to find a place at the work table, because the problem is that the reform they have created and consented is that we are standing outside and we do not agree with this reform."
Another 200 thousand pesos is issued for "supplier"
The city in Mazatlan will pay another check of the debated owner of the company suppliing electrical material.
Another check for a little more than 200 000 pesos was sent by the council to Laurena Guadalupe Camach's Palazuelos.
This is the amount paid in this second half-year owner of the company that supplies the electrical material will go up to 1.200,000 pesos.
According to the city's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was sent on 16 November this year, exhibited to 200.144,56 pesos and as its subject was stated "compensation of unsaved payments".
Box Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the community would pay this supplier, which was monitored by the High State Audit Authority for high price sales, another profit.
What was not said is a total receipt that the city owes her, and how many more checks will be sent in favour of Camach's Palazuelos.
"Nothing was purchased now, just what we owe her, as well as the other suppliers," he said in one interview.
The last checks appeared in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two days 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last 16 November.
Although this entrepreneur has not yet been published in the Government's Letter, as it provides a law in the case of companies verified by the High State Audit Authority to avoid the use of their services by other administrative authorities, the treasury ensured that the service of the contractor has not been re-used.
In the previous period, after 25 July, Noroeste issued a review of the checks exposed by the council to its suppliers, which revealed that between March 2008 and 9 July 2010, during the three-year period of Mayor Jorge Abel Lópeze Sancheza, the city of Camacha Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 checks.
It also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where it incased checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need maintenance
Tourist managers complain about the accident of a foreign tourists about the bad situation of the Sancheze Taboada talk in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourists in deeply on the Sancheze Taboady talk, the tourist sector in Mazatlan requests the authorities to pay attention to the areas and places that are in a bad condition and do not show the port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Zone Dorad Trade Association, recalled that they repeatedly asked for an impression of destination, and the bad thing the tourists find here to replace with new activities or routes.
He stated that the bad state of the streets and walkers affects tourists who walk here and see a mess, which disadvantages close businesses.
"The police don't know what it's like to shut up for one day, and they don't have a clue about the salaries they avoid, otherwise they wouldn't deal with these matters so long and without a proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sanchez said the tourists' dropping caused lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the city.
"The Council will have to take responsibility and avoid repeating such things, it will have to be committed to preventive maintenance, not only to repair the already existing disabilities," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean town, because not only because we are a tourist area, we should be maintained, because even as inhabitants we deserve a clean place, the city should change its urban maintenance strategy."
There are other places that seem negligible and poor, such as Mazathlan Emblém and El Venadito (monument, statue of deer - known).
"Tourists today should offer a good product, that is, a city swimming the purity of their beaches and streets where permanent maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"There was no attention needed here, and these facts emphasize something that everyone is well known, the maintenance is missing.
He spoke of a number of places to be arranged in collaboration with the council, he said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and fine to be attractive because he has a tourist potential.
Raoul Llera Martinez, a sub-secretary of Tourist Promotion, said that saving tourist sites in Mazatlan is immediate because they are not used correctly and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural goals and spaces, however, which will need to be arranged first so that we can impress these places and we can put them in the list that we have to promote this destination."
IP requests the results of the Congress
Eduardo Davalos, President of the CCE, would like the Members to take great responsibility by taking an example in searching for better Sinaloy, in various challenges they face.
The parliamentary period full of dignity and without agreements between the parties and the State executive requires the business sector in Mazatlan, because Sinaloa is disturbed in the screams and faces major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary period, composed of seven political forces, 19 PAN Members, 13 of the PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergence and the last of PVEM, which includes 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from the new members of the Congress is to be able to implement good leadership, commitments to society and to different areas that require responsible legislative work and that the same parties and paternist patrons will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dajalos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), proposed that the recently elected 40 Members of the Congress take great responsibility and follow an example on the way to the better Sinaloa in various challenges he faces.
"We expect the Members to truly exercise their right, without agreements between parties, because they usually make measures to promote their own interests and become carnivals of rulers and leaders of parliamentary fractions."
He therefore said that the obligation to establish the necessary curve should be confirmed to move the ruling forward according to the order.
"We want them to do dignity work and to be primarily obliged to companies and sectors, because they were the inhabitants of Sinaloy, who gave them with their voice in the previous elections of confidence."
José Ramón Manguart Sanchez, President of the Association of Hotels Tres Islas, expressed that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will gather all the powers to achieve the economic growth of the country because the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is that they initiate economic growth to create investment and infrastructure incentives, which will support a certain way the creation of jobs."
With regard to the travel movement, he asked new legislators to give him greater weight within the state budget and to support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is the Ministry with the second lowest budget, which is unreasonable because it is an important economic activity that brings currency and investment, which is also directly competitive with agriculture."
In addition, to issue funds on launching tourism projects, the Congress should help to add the state to certainty and help with the alcohol law that has not been resolved in the previous parliamentary periods.
Three Kings are looking for.
Dollies, cars and wheels are along with other toys on the wish list of children in the family of Coronad Valenzuels.
For their parents, the coming holiday of the three kings will be difficult to fulfill their imaginations, since their homeowners read exactly 12 people and one bean.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isaias, José Juan and Miguel do not lose their hope that Caspar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them toys and clothes that they want so much.
The family lives in a humble accommodation in the Colonia Salvador Allende village in poor situations, since the father has no permanent job.
"We're sometimes hard, because my husband's unfortunate, but we're selling mandarins and potatoes... and I'm dating "plebeans" this afternoon on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuel Andrade, the mother of the children.
Four-year-old Adelaida wishes a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like Barbie's doll.
With regard to the ten-year-old José Alfred, he'd like a monster car for a while, and for his eight-month brother, Jessus would wish Cayetana's clothes for one year.
"He told me (Josee Alfredo) "I wished this monster car," but I told him, "We'll see my son," because it was very expensive," he remembers the sadness of Cayetana.
For the older children who were just at school, it would be perfect clothes and shoes.
Maria Guadalupe, which is 11 years old, has the size of 12, the ten-year-old Isaias size 10, where an eight-year-old Miguel wears size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan is missing his tennis, so he would need a couple of sizes five and a half or six.
To help meet the dreams of children from the family of Coronad Valenzuels, you can attend the campaign "Seek the Three Kings" and bring a gift or money in cash on the reception of Noroest's journal.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
The tens of examinations were carried out in Estri, Wednesday, within the liquidation of a network for production and sale of Indian cannabis.
14 people were arrested and faced with different charges.
The surveys took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that served to produce drugs.
"Originally 750 Indian ropes, four pounds of hashish, money and equipment that served for production were taken off," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, speaker of the quebek police.
A total of 11 men and three women were arrested, both the alleged heads of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons had to get to the Sherbrook court after they were arrested.
They could face the charges of the production of an Indian rope, its holding to trade with him, conspiracy and stealing, inter alia.
These surveys took place after a long-term investigation, which took nearly a year.
"It was the information that we received from the public and which allowed us to join these arrests," said M. Ruel.
This police operation took part in 70 police officers of the Regional Investigation Office of the city of Estria State Police Quebek, State police in Sherbrook and Sherbrooku Memhremagog.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without problems.
The proposal for a conservative law which, according to the government, should regulate the issue of ships imposed by illegal immigrants, will obviously be overcome , while all three opposition parties in the middle have not been able to support it.
"I'm based on Chart."
"I'm standing straight on the side of the party that built a jula under your feet," said the chief of Liberals Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by the Members after the weekly meeting of the weekly du caucus.
Liberals insist that the draft of the law, as designed, the law that would allow to hold up to one year any person originating from the ship identified as a ship transporting illegal immigrant would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The chief of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also stated that he could not support the law's proposal because he's heading towards the wrong goal.
"We are against and all opposition parties seem to be opposed, so we will see what the government will do," M. Duceppe said.
The NPD criticism in the issue of immigration problem, Olivia Chow, rejected criticisms that want her party not to be strong enough about illegal immigrants.
"Neo-democrats agree to take measures against illegal immigrant transmigrants, and that is what we consider a portion of the other law proposal, C-35," said Mrs. Chow.
"We do not support the law of conservatives, because it is guilty of refugees and puts children in jail for at least one year," explained Mrs. Chow.
The Minister for Immigration Jason Kenney accused opposition parties.
"The Canadians inform messengers that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that they take Canada into a mushroom and treat it as a patolizale."
They expect Canada to take consistent measures, the Secretary Kenney responded.
The government has not declared the voting of confidence in its draft law, which could lead the country to the elections leading to its rejection.
One conservative said to the Agency QMI that the government would ask for a vote so that each Member who is opposed would respond from his position before its voters.
New unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the notification , the possible establishment of a permanent unit for the fight against corruption and collusion, many observers continue to require the creation of a public investigation committee for the problem.
The Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, is trying to avoid forgetting this idea: Québec will consult the Department of Investigation from New York in January next year.
Metropole has a constant countercorruption unit available since 1870.
That is why the Tuesday notifications of many of us surprised us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Standing Police Service Council in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
Furthermore, it was not necessary that the public security criticism, the PQ Stéphane Bergeron, evaluate this notification as "the rabbit pulled out of the hat" and "amaterial solution embedded on the knee".
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"It's satisfied with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For President CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of an interrogation of witnesses in public receipt.
"In addition, Mr. Charest claims that he doesn't want to create this investigation committee, and people think, like you and me, that he's hiding something," he explains.
"The only way to achieve the creation of the Investigation Commission is to demise Jean Charesta," explains Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and politology in the Institute for Education of High Public Officers.
In order to be able to get out of this blind street, he proposed Quebec to give special power to the General Inspector so that he could investigate the collussion and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the General Inspector," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same power as the Commissioners who is allowed to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the Charest's records of the government.
Quebec would also after Ottawa to change the Criminal Law so that he would be better adapted to this type of criminal activity.
This requirement would come from an author for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marca Fourniera that the judicial procedure in this type of investigation is not explicit.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his judicial colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some amendment proposals related to this record.
During the summer 2001 operation, which affected the group of bikers, although the Criminal Law has not yet been modified, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently made changes in the gangstership law.
The rivers are under strict supervision.
Several water flows have been under strict control due to strong crashes that have fallen from Tuesday in several regions of the province.
Wednesday afternoon, in Shawinigan, Mauricio, there was a land sewage.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
There was another soil in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudier.
The road's out of the way.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions of strong crash, i.e. rained from 40 to 70 milimeters.
From 20 to 40 more milimeters, it was not expected from today to quarter evening, according to regions.
The sections in the north of the river and in the Outaouais valley have been most affected.
It could fall up to 100 mm.
If we combine these snowbreaks in some sectors, we can be afraid of flood flows in some water flows.
The Relief Service of Quebec announced a warning on Wednesday night against the danger of floods for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in Lanaudière.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jerôme, in the forest Laurentides, and in Chéne, in Lotbinière, became subject of flood emergency and continuous controls.
In the area of de Lanaudière, some lakes were caused by strong collapse, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a commission bridge was cut by strong rains.
Two residents must have been preventively evacuated.
In Outaouais, some lakes from the shores have caused closing some roads, especially in the Municipality Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The rescue service is emergency and observes the situation in this area, said Annik Bouchard, a security advisor.
Quebec Centre for Flood Provisions issued a warning in the midst of strong floods for several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
The Quebec radiomoderator, Stephane Dupont, suffered partially undarmed in front of the Canadian Council for Radio and Television Standards (RRTV) due to controversial statements concerning social assistance and Haitians and, as well as due to a gross expression during the broadcast.
The Radio and Television Council believes that Mr. Dupont and his group of CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express their views, but some of the statements contained "incorrect information on social assistance and the inappropriate negative exclusion of the Haitians of a gross expression that does not correspond to the transmitted during the day".
The Council also concluded that the debate on suicide, including the transmission of the name of both persons who have taken their lives, did not break the voting regulations.
The radio and television Council received several complaints concerning comments made during the broadcasts from 2008 to 2010.
The first decision was made after the complaint of the Common Front of Contributors of Social Assistance to Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts referred to in the broadcast were incorrect.
Moderates must provide reliable information, not fake.
With regard to suicide, the Moder Stephane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of desperation.
Most of the members of the Commission concluded that the transmitted report was such that suicide cannot be considered as a solution to daily life problems.
"The majority of the Commission believes that the controversial episodes of the "Dupont afternoon" broadcasted a delicate topic in an impartial and suitable way."
There was no lift against him.
The last dispute was about the declaration followed after the earthquake in Haiti.
Stephane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were therefore put into a media shooting that caused many reactions.
The CHOI modeler declared that he has not sent any gift to help the Haitians because we can't be sure that the needed money will actually get.
The Commission believes that these comments were not illegal but that their cumulative effect would create an inappropriately negative image of the Haitians.
"I've already completed my class delay of this thing."
"My record is not touched for a year and a half," said the moderator.
In all decisions of the Commission, it refuses to use in the broadcasting of rough expressions.
Anyway, the CHOI-FM radio broadcast cooperated "on the framework of its obligations".
For a station which, inter alia, will have to notify this decision once during the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King du kung-fuwa Montreal.
The inhabitant of Montreal, originating in Algeria, Nacereddin Earthmal, has a extremely special progress.
The athlete that arrives in "sand" (kung-fu "full contact") in the kickbox and the Thai box enters the dads and rings of the world and seeks new challenges.
"I started fighting arts like kung-fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, I explained the Earthal, who lived in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for games all over the place, because for those who don't like the game on the ground that appears in fighting sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this man who works as a guardian and as assistant for UPS has just added bad news to his competitors when he won two gold medals at World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edimburg, Scotland.
"I won kickbox category full contact and Thai box, he said."
"I'm preparing for China for the World Shoe cup."
"They were invited to competitives who ended the first four at the last world's championship in each category."
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005 in Vietnam, I ended eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I ended at the tournament on the fifth morning, while in Toronto in 2009 I ended third, added."
"It's interesting that I've made some progress in every competition."
"I'm going to be the first one this year or the opposite!"
"san shoe" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China, where the hits of sand and legs, as well as throwing on the ground, are allowed.
The games are played traditionally on the platform and rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, acquired from this form of battle, is the American Vietnamese origin of Cung Le, well-known in the world of battle arts.
As long as Nacer Zemal should keep one result in his career, he will confirm his courageous participation in "King of Sanda", Super Bowl in kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains a sympathetic guy."
"It's kind of an equivalent to Stade Lumpinee (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Earthal won his first match, in seven-final its category (80 kg), before he suffered the loss in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real professional, analyzing."
"There are four rivals in category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"The winners of semi-finals are facing the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category are facing to be crowned by the only champion, King kung-fu."
450 contracted million without public competition
Hydro-Québec agreed on a 450 million agreement in contracts with companies providing engineering for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the heart of this lavina, more than 100 contracts, it is just a consortium created from BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained the most important contract, a contract to manage the project at a total of $295 million without a public competition.
This consortium, on behalf of the ENERGY GERANCE, was authorised in 2004 co-ordinately with the choice of Hydro-Québec to confer its responsibility to the private sector for the management of this substantial hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the "Energie Gerance" consorted a lucrative contract without any public competition announcement.
For the Quebec Party, the complaint on the consortion of businesses is a serious issue of ethical nature that risks the exclusion of competition and causes the increase in prices.
"It's a new way to realize the collusion and eliminate competition."
"That means that people, no longer side agreements, are already being made open today," PQ Sylvain Simard said yesterday at a press conference.
Something earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Meeting, because he said it was hard to bear how public interest could be sold so.
The Nathalie Normandeau, the Minister for Nathalie Normandeau, advocated this afternoon, clearly denying that it would go to this collussion contract.
"I have my own way," she bunched and claimed that PQ was "unfair" and "missed accuracy."
She said "that would be the least" to apologize to PQ.
The reception of the creation of consortium is common practice throughout the world.
It is usually an alliance limited in time that allows two or several companies to compil their mutual expertise so that they can respond to the call for offers to a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the abundance of work.
The building is already running and must be scheduled until 2012.
However, the contract was confessed without a competition; it was a trade.
It is also necessary to acknowledge that the consortion formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, nor in relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir discovered last week, the formula of consortion in the field of consultation in engineering is a subject of government investigation.
If we fly at the speed of the trade register of quebec companies, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortions, while some appear to be created.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; let's name CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and there are tens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, and that is Dessau.
With regard to the consortium of ENERGIE GERANCE, Minister Normandeau stressed in particular the fact that "the land of la Baie James is a typical special dynamic of working forces and that Hydro-Québec has responded to it since the 1970s".
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from the Baie James Energy company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that made us face over the fact that the project management contract was closed after a mutual agreement.
"If you go to a public competition and if there are few participants in the competition offering, your offered prices can be higher."
"You have two options to choose: that you will take people who are in that order as competitives, and you say, "Let's make a deal satisfactory and with a good price."
"But the main idea is that it's not an important price, but the competence of people," Mr. Laporte confirmed.
This contract granted by the Consortion of Energie Gerance is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 that received Page Quebec.
Contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ on the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir calculated 109 contracts for consultation in the field of engineering, concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories conducting soil sample analysis.
SNC-Lavalin grabbed 22 contracts, Génivar gained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without having a share in "Energie Gerance".
All contracts were closed.
Together, they read 449 783 344 dollars, including an agreement with the company ENERGIE GERENCE at $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard pointed out that four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very well-known Liberal parties to Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has released a report that PQ is also connected to companies that "financing it" before she stated that it was more than her management workers.
The barometer of responsible consumption - "green" label does not raise confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in actors of sustainable development, but also in "unpartial" marks and environmental certificates, in order to manage products accordingly.
The worst thing is that even when we swim in the media universe, which insists on us and invites us to more socially responsible consumption, this media universe condemns the lack of credible information, the non-compliance of the obligations qualifying even as a brake for its commitment, Barometre states the responsible consumption of which the first article was released yesterday.
While consumption of so-called socially responsible products has increased in 2010, Quebec people who are trying to sell them, they still do not trust them too much
Two-thirds of us actually say that they don't trust the promises of environmental companies, just because the green advertisement by the company is a measurement tool that the Observatory has developed the responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates attached to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and marks that are referred to as ecologically responsible, states Barometre.
Similarly, the debate of politicians on this subject is accepted as serious only 14.6% of Quebec's population.
Information on responsible consumption seems, however, primary to stimulate the consumption site, currently recovered by almost a third of the Quebec consumers.
Indeed, vacuum and doubtful nature of information would mitigate the excess of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake that Baromètre identified, at the higher price of these products.
Anyway, a third of the inhabitants of Quebecus build untrusted data on manufacturers or "green" services that we are looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their customs and especially to change the mark of one or more products, thus responding to their convictions.
All 61% of them preferred shoppings in their quarters and preferred the shopping of foods raised in their region, says Baromètre.
More "green" and responsible - the accountable consumption index reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumum Québek is pleased to present as a king of recycling, which strives for the least impact on the environment by caring for animal protection.
But their social and ecological conscience is apparently left somewhere outside their car, says Baromètre: in 2010, only 28% of the inhabitants of Quebec indicated that they use massive transport or that they recommend the use of at least two people to drive, in the interest of the protection of the nature.

The Government of Quebec, which we have requested to participate in the purchase of a kin complex by Angus et le Parallèle, agrees to participate, but only to the lending level.
Developper's company "Angus et le Parallèle", which sought a gift of seven million dollars from the Minister of Culture to buy a film-complex on the Saint-Laurenta bullwar and who proved her mission as a lover of film art, did not obtain what she demanded.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in documentation, but under its own conditions.
Rather than the expected gift is proposed by the Government of Quebec a loan, which would be lower, some original expectations that could build the basis for life-sustainable solutions under useful conditions and with sources originating from the State.
The first action plan and demands for 12.8 million have already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications have already been revised to reduce.
The proposal and the action plan sent the Minister St-Pierre President of the Company for Business Development in Cultural (SODEC), François Macerola, who manages the film project eXcentris.
The final message was sent ten days ago.
But the government's opposition came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have time until 31 December to answer.
However, the hypothesis of a gift from the state must seem to be really rejected.
Recall that the Association of Owners of Kines and Kinematographic Centres in Quebec has been against the direct investment of the State in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, considering that the Minister of Culture should not finance the project relating to real estate if he did not do so for other kinosals.
However, several participants in the discussion were required essential economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into his film space within ten years of film art after he financed the construction of the complex, which could have been the reason for changing the financial council of the State.
The lack of rooms for independent films is screaming in Montréal, and eXcentris was able to get a permanent clientel.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini in his head, runs a campaign to release funds into the private sector, in the belief that he will smash $700 000 for acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only three film companies, Le Parallèle, continue to distribute eXcentris films.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen all three rooms on 27 February next year and demonstrate the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remind Le Devoir, so he ignores himself, so he and his group thinks of the offers to reduce what they are done to him.
Lifted tire for Canada as a whole...
New diplomatic sources referred to in WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers as a complex of the minority of Canadians against the Americans, but by struck their feelings of superiority recently appointed to Canada.
The American diplomats are therefore wondering that every Canadian voter lies on the heart of the Canadian-American relations when he goes to vote and believes that the visit of President Obama has helped the conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
Four new reports between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington, exposed to the public yesterday, provide more sensitive details to reach each other under the skin.
The Communication on 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, detailed the point where the United States are not part of the bets discussed by the political leaders.
To the great impression of the US Ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins gives a few explanations to this situation.
"The Canadian complex of minority, almost stubborn, may mention political leaders to talk about internal bets, instead of realizing that these choices concern the United States (as in the free trade campaign in 1988)," he writes.
"The United States are therefore," he concluded, "the speaking elephant in these elections: everywhere available, but potentially too threatening than to speak of them."
The Ambassador understands this "profound silence" less that both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of the candidate, the party or even better the boss of the party to run these important relations should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to elections."
Another expression of this feeling of importance can be read in the report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, charge d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your way will help to ensure that the government remains trusted at the beginning of February, concerning the federal budget, which Canada publicly acknowledges its first deficit in over ten years, due to a plan of renewal of $30 to 40 billion," says M. Breese.
None of the mention that the government had to delay the pre-night parliamentary meeting so that it could not be defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties undermine their survival by the quality of the proposed renewal plan.
Another message from January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington to the increasingly negative image that the United States throws dramatic series forwarded to CBC.
The Ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which it can be observed not too typical links to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or to kidnapping for the purposes of the ClA's violent interrogations.
Another report refers to the fact that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kuchner whether Europe is ready to accept certain prisoners from Guantanam.
Mr. Couchner answered yes, but on the basis of the principle "fact from the case".
At the end of the meeting, it says, "He handed a paper about Omar Khadr, 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, a state secret."
"The secret has accepted the file to revide."
Finally, let's note that those who are involved in WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, said on the CBC waves that a person responsible for this massive escape should be "destroyed".
It came up and heard of Mike Huckabee in the United States.
World Plan for Renewal of Light
The United Nations proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan for renewing domestic lighting, trade lighting and industrial spaces in 100 countries to achieve the restriction of glass effects (GES), which corresponds to almost one third of the next restrictions to be aimed at stabilizing the climate of the planet from now to 2020.
This ambitious plan is located in a stadium of major specific projects that the United Nations wishes to promote in Cancún to compensate the absence of difficultly implementable commitments to reduce industrially advanced countries.
According to the plan submitted yesterday, if the burned lights that monopolize another 50 to 70% of the market, we will replace with fluo compact lamps or, even better, light light lights (DEL or "LED" in English), the essential quantities of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) GES by emissions on the planet emerged due to lighting would be declined.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of world emissions.
It's an equivalent to 70% of the emissions from the car park all over the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, the large countries with significant share in emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and other, including Canada, have included voluntary plans for reducing, which should allow the decline of global GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, it will be necessary to withdraw 5 Gt from this balance to achieve the stability of climate warming by 2020 at 2 degrees of Celsia in order to be excluded that it will not get out of control.
In the burned lights 95% of energy is dissolved in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With fluokompact lights, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new DEL lamps, we reduce this consumption twice.
Fluocompact lights will last between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
New bulbs with DEL, such as those that he has introduced this week to Philips - this company reportedly participated in the UN study - have the predictable life of 25,000 hours and consumpte 80% less energy than the burned light, which gives us the idea of possible savings with a plan of refund that would be applied in 100 countries.
All these new lights can also work with restats and light less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts expressed remarks against fluokompact lamps because they contain mercury and are needed to be classified as dangerous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, unless producers could set up collectives.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluocompact lamp, but rather the heat coal power plants that release many mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in burned lamps.
Only in the United States these centres put 25,000 tonnes of mercury a year.
The report also detailed the profits of each country from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is an equivalent of 3.5 heat power plant, whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
The coast of elephant expects the results of the electoral results.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon requested an immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in the coast of elephant after the deadlines were expired.
"The Secretary-General emphasizes the need for an independent election committee to complete its work and notify preliminary results immediately, stressed the speaker of the UN President."
"He requests all parties in the coast of elephant and institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and to keep any initiatives until the notification of the commission results."
Despite pressures developed by some foreign governments, the election committee has left the latest date - the Middle Midnight - without publishing the results, three days after the Sunday Short.
About 40 minutes before the expiry date, the president of the CEI on TV confirmed that the Commission "continues to work" so that it could announce the results.
In the Wednesday, the challenges throughout the world have been multiplyed to the CEI finally announce the name of the winner of the second round, between the departing Laurent Gbagbo and the opposition member of Alassan Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp relies on the cancellation of the Constitutional Council for "laud" votes in the north, managed by the former Rebels of the New Army (FN) from the failed state revolution in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential electoral campaign at the coast of elephant coast, confirmed that the maneuvers of the intimidation of the voters practiced by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country, renounced the electoral enthusiasms of the President of the Coast of the Eagle.
The elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council took into account the complaint issued by Gbagbo.
Of course, the opponents of President Gbagbo feel that the Supreme Court of Justice of the country is not neutral because Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassan Ouattara, a northern person who demented any connection with former rebels, condemned the delay in the notification of the results as "unappropriate" and asked Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he suffered loss and that complaint to the Constitutional Council after defending the electoral committee to send the results would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections, held on Sunday, was considered to be the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country that has been divided into two half years.
The United Nations warned in the middle of the political fraction of the coast of elephant that it could be responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended in the first round, October 31st, as a winner with 38% of votes against Alassana Ouattaru, who received public support from former President Henry Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The rate of unemployment in France in terms of the words under the International Labour Office (BIT) remained stable to 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7%, including foreign areas), as indicated by the commissioning data with the correction of seasonal deviations (CVS), published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed people has stopped at 2.631 million in the metropolitan.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the active population in the metropolitan and 9.7% including foreign areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate is increased by 0.1 points.
In a wider recording, 3,4 million people in metropolitan France are not working in the third quarter, but they wish to work, whether they are available in two weeks to work, and whether they are looking for work or not.
The situation of current young people on the labour market was still presented with a new increase in unemployment at 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points per year) and 25%, including foreign areas.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged from 15 to 24 were said by the International Office of Work.
With regard to seniors, they recorded a mild increase in unemployment in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as in a year), which is 482 000 people from 50 years higher and 6.6%, including foreign areas.
Only a population of 25-49 years has seen benefits from unemployment stability at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points per year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee has no longer announced the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a dispute on its method of calculation.
Eurostat, a statistical agency of the European Union, continues to develop monthly statistics and announced 9.8% on Tuesday for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini is accused and detained
Alexandre Guerini, 53 years old, one of the heads of waste processing firms and the PS Brother of the Governing Council of Bouches-du-Rhane, was accused and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of the investigation in public procurement, allegedly deceptively obtained.
Alexandre Guerini was accused of abuse of company property, abuse of public funds and public property, secreting, granting bribes, acceptance of payments to influence the office and holding guns, states his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini is a warrior and insists to explain to the judge all the questions that he's going to ask him, and not any disturbance."
"It's easy to persecute him for many criminal reasons, but the other thing is to prove it," his lawyer Florence Rault said to AFP, before an interrogation of his client.
Mr. Guerini stated through his lawyers that he sent a brief message before his interrogation to explain everything.
One of his neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simona, his client has never done anything but to ensure the functioning of the stock that he was supposed to manage.
With regard to the allocation of procurement or destination of funds associated with their functioning, he never knew anything like that, Mr. Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of Aglomeration Aubagne, was accused in the middle of the abuse of public funds and accommodation, and left at liberty, under the forbidden surveillance, the protagonists of all matters.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have been raised to him."
"The investigator is looking at it and leaving him free," his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux, stated.
Another four persons were accused and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with their judicial surveillance for the two of them, the prosecutor Michel Raffin stated.
Michel Karabadjakian, a representative of the Director-General with the elegance of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is prosecuted for the adoption of bribes in order to influence the Office and for passive corruption."
Two Aglomeration functioners of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier are accused, one for "resolution and abuse of property of society", the second for "complet in public abuse".
Finally, a business partner, Alexandra Guerini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "concealing the abuse of the property of society".
Among those confronted with Mr. Guerrini, Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently accused in a concomitant case of fraudulent public procurement in respect of Korsica.
The investigators suspect his company that they were helping to wash money from a large gangstership.
The investigation is conducted within a number of open trials against X in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters relating to alleged fraud in closing public procurement, in particular in the issue of waste.
From close investigation sources, the search focuses particularly on the conditions of allocation and operation of the stock in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as some cities from the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: The Elysean Palace extremated Syria's mediation
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Klotilda Reiss, the young research worker arrested in Iran for "spionage", united opinions in France, introduced the diplomacy into the fighting emergency and emphasized relations between Paris and Teheran.
All of this was carefully monitored by diplomats from the United States.
The American documents received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some disadvantages in this crisis.
They describe how the Elysean Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, and he went so far that he advised them how to deal with such hostages in Iran (a small group of travelers).
They show how the French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of young French was not compensation for the release of Majid kakand, the Iranian prisoner in France, and the American justice requested for the deceptive trade in materials in favour of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they are subjecting a sharp light to the way French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bachar al-Assad played a central role in the release of Klotilda Reiss.
In fact, he didn't do anything for it.
The diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris has a title: "Iran:France Comments to solve the way in the case of hostages".
Adviser from the Elysey Strategic Palace, François Richier, accompanied by director Quai d'Orsay for North Africa Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks to the representative of the American diplomacy Allegrone.
They explain to him the French method.
They recommend that the Americans do so much to be transported back to the country of his own nationals by violence detained in Iran.
"Do noise," they say, "continue saying "in the media the words "base human rights", "innocence", "instant release".
It is necessary to bring into difficulty the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it more than they ask you to stop it."
Because the attempts to negotiate through discretion channels have been carried out, the Iranians are "masters of avoidable maneuvers".
Mr. Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is "Iranian family tactics: taking hostages for the purposes of "political extortion".
It announces that the release of Klotilda Reiss (which will occur on August 16th, the day the French Embassy's refuge) "seeks a high amount of money to the Iranians" (caution 230 000 euros).
And they will announce that the Elysean Palace anticipates the cases of hostages, the phenomenon that "will be sharp."
In the future, the Iranians could "are arrested by about 1800 French living in Iran," he states.
28 August 2009
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but she remains blocked in Iran.
Information is broadcasted: Iranec Majid Jakaand, which the United States declares that he was exiled for illegal trade with electronic material sensitive in relation to Iran, is released on freedom in Paris on the basis of the judge's decision.
The American Embassy, as well as many observers, asks about this disturbing conformity.
For Washington, who pursues illegal Iranian networks to obtain a material designed for the nuclear programme, the dissemination of Majida Khakavananda is a bad news.
Did France join the contract?
Liberation of Iran for the release of young French?
In another conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4th, François Richier assures it is not.
The Elysean Palace, he states, was not only "invited by this decision of the judge," but he was looking for an opportunity to stand against it.
"The interviews between the President's Office and the Minister of Justice have been held," Michèle Alliot-Marie, but "the French government cannot change the decision of the court," he notes.
Mr. Richier also wishes to demonstrate that Majid Jakand is under the "limited" supervision of the French rapporteur service.
The advisor of the Elysean Palace has drawn a phone number, suspended the phone listener and then informed the American diplomat that Iranian is currently in Paris buildings managed by the Iranian Embassy."
During the prison of Klotilda Reiss in Iran, the Elysean Palace of effort, negotiates, through communications and organized "levels" into the media to convince Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "significant" and "influential" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony and find that manipulation brings its fruit, since several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
Telegram of 25 August 2009 evolves medial "blest" of French officials.
What is the measure of gratitude based on M. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
"In spite of their statements full of praise, French officials in private recognise that they have only awareness of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Elysean Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication "intensively aims to verify President Sarkozy's policy opening with Syria", she analyses.
Politics applied in 2008 "was observed by many critical votes in France and abroad and labeled as early and undeserved."
By "as he exaggerates the Syrian role", Paris is trying to "promote Syria, which praises can serve when he plays a constructive role in the area".
The goal is also to sew the grain of dispute between Syria and Iran.
The American Embassy knows it from a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "We certainly don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it was."
"But we thanked them."
"That should at least bring mess and irritation between the Iranians."
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts it in the Elysean Palace.
In the communication, he thanks the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the benefit of the release of our country".
Ending online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Pecival", which will prohibit the teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, stated the government officials.
The proposal for the law will be submitted to Parliament in December to request companies running online games to block access to these games after midnight to persons under 16 years, stated the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family.
"A lot of children play these games all night and then they have problems with school and are not able to lead normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," AFP Jo Rin, a leading factor in the ministry who has a draft law on charge.
Online games will be newly accessible since 6 o'clock in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law.
The government also assumes that it will request companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents are asking for this is completed by the responsible worker.
It will also provide people asking for this, free programs, allowing them to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "infected" countries and the daily press brings regularly different facts related to the intense use of the Internet.
The country is also an uncontrolled champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals on World Cyber Games, faced to 58 other nations.
World Championship in 2018-2022: Fifa establishes host country.
The full disturbance of the corruption suspects establishes Fifa's executive committee on Thursday of the host country of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, the selection of sovereignly politically motivated, where the fight against influence and lobbing risks to reach technical criteria.
The thing is sure, the Royal Competition of Fifa in 2018 will be held in Europe , the traditional garden of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgia).
In 2022, the championship will be much more exotic, while the International Federation hopes that it will be able to gain a new territory (Qatar, Australia) after the Prime Minister on the African Continent in 2010, or continue to be planted in the United States or on the Dale East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that will be attended within the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Kataru, Head of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create an idea of the economic and political rates of the world.
The negotiation in the after-cluster faces the risk that they will last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to determine the hierarchy according to candidates.
According to the Fifa evaluation report, the English, Spanish and Portuguese (2012) and the American (2022) have the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not have too much weight for 22 members of the executive committee in an hour for voting.
Sunday Times at the beginning of the discovery leading to suspending two members of the CE/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temaria et Amos Adama) may have destroyed the chances of his country, the colleagues that have hosted the world's championship only once in the year.
The BBC set the crown on Monday, when she sent a document "whispered on the sandwich" by three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fif unsatisfied and lead the English leaders with David Cameron first.
The President of the Government hopes that he will be able to repeat the move that his precedent in the function of Tony Blair, who was able to gain for London in 2012.
Is this intense activity enough to add England a new flash to its name in the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the two of Spain-Portugalians are not missing the tramps of the already prepared stadiums, its welcomes (the World Championship in Spain in 1982, the Olympic Games 1992 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the cloud economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
The appropriate legal measures against the English and the doubts of the payment eligibility of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was outsider even through spaces in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But the President of the Government, Vladimir Poutin, decided that the championship will not be moved to Curich and publicly declared "some competition in the preparation of voting", only in the voting exemptions that were barely imposed on the accusation of English press against members of the CE (European Commission).
"We'll throw them in mud, try to compromise them," Mr. Poutin said.
For 2022 it seems to be a logical favorite of the United States with its significant experience of 1994.
The world's highest performance of the economy, the seat of Fif's main sponsors, seems to have a great impact on this country in front of Japan and South Korea, which separately set up a beautiful project.
But these candidatures seem to be too early for both countries, which together in 2002 did "test".
Another threat: the grant of world championship 2026 China, which is hotly wishing Fifa, made the Asian chances for 2022 invalid.
With Katar, who pulled a large eso from the sleeve in the form of futurist stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand into new lands, but these two countries represent more risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could have been paying for tangible TV fees (for time-shift) paid by European countries, creating a movement force for Fif.
Second mandate: apparentity (sufficiency)
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand woke up the appearance that he hesitates.
Valery Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate at least.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than them.
The mandate of the Elysean Palace calls someone else.
The current head of the State will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But apparentness is not in good conformity with the share of secrets associated with the Chairman's function.
It is therefore necessary to do as if doubts continue.
In one and the other way.
In 2006, without to be believed, Jacques Chirac's friends made their privileges to not be excluded from the third mandate.
On November 15th, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that "he'll decide at the autumn of 2011."
As he reminds members of the UMP Parliament on Wednesday night in the Elysean Palace, the perspective of "two mandates" has slightly agitated.
Was it an official notice of his candidacy?
It wasn't far from that.
The President only recalled that the amendment of the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year functioning periods to two.
It was of his side just a setup, not an announcement.
It's not the first time he reminds of such a humorous tone of presidential election.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you have another seven and a half years with me," he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I am not considering another stage."
His previous statements will not make him a candidate more than the previous day; it will not make him a candidate or less.
If they're calling comments, it's because of the two truths.
Speeding the way to the PS candidate, on the side of one.
But it's not the entrance to Segolèna Royala, which pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to convict.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS want arrangements for combat systems rather early than intended.
Bad research on the other side.
First, the right voters would prefer Franceoise Fillone's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we don't discuss this thing with the UMP," responded immediately and carefully people from the nearest neighborhood of the presidency of the government.
"If he believes the possible defeat, he won't run," Jean-Pierre Raffarin informs.
"He will still believe that he can win," repairs Alain Juppe, balanced with apparently.
Euro: The Central European Bank is forced to continue its purchases of public titles.
The last meeting of the Governor's Council of Governors in the year was to be an opportunity to set out the conditions for execution from the crisis or at least to notify a large number of unusual monetary policy operations to be terminated by the end of this year.
The crisis of the sovereign European claims is obliged, the Institute for Securities Publishment will undoubtedly not be able to afford such a category under the threat of the deterioration of the situation today, so tense on European markets with valuable papers.
The political price would be higher in that case.
Yesterday, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde gave up an active role played by the Central European Bank in favour of the crisis of demands of European States.
She did not want to say if she thought that the bank could do more, for example, by enhancing their programme of purchase of supervised bonds.
"I require my consideration for my European partners..."
The evening before, in Brussels, in his interrogation by the Commission for Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the Central European Bank Jean-Claude Trichet did not appear as more explicit in terms of his intentions, and he satisfied that the programme of purchase of public titles on the secondary market "continues" and "we will see how we decide" during the Thursday meeting.
Similar certainty: The Central European Bank will be watching its basic interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the shoppings from the treasury carried out by the Central European Bank have doubled up to almost 1.35 billion euros in the last week.
And because of the unreasonable market dealers, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
Overall Eurosystem central banks have purchased 67 billion euros since May 2010.
There are no doubts between the market anticipation agreements on the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even the economies do not expect any significant change in course.
If the lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the Central European Bank's arsenal, the latest appointed bank shall access the unlimited provision of liquid funds under generous conditions and for the period of one week to three months.
The economies today expect this mechanism to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine she would change her program in a significant way."
"If not, it would take the risk of provoking a short-term new tension," Michael Schubert, Commerzbank Economy.
"Progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," says Norbert Bräms, the Econome at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In order to plan its interventions on the public debt market, "the European Central Bank would have to maintain a volume of purchase of its bonds to restore the dirty market," Norbert Bräms added.
In view of the exposure of European banks on markets with the euro area, there is no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"He needs to replace the lack of investors on the market at any price and act in such a way as to prevent the inflammation of the paid performance of the states belonging to the slightest," a significant bond manager confirmed yesterday.
Because if interest rates start, the States will be more troubled to reduce their debts rather than to stabilize it.
It's a salvation of euro for this price.
In Italy, the Government of Berlusconio back
After the beginning of the week for Italy, the alarming situation has reliefed a little, with the backward rate of 10 years.
Return to temporary calm.
At the end of the meeting with the Economy Minister of the Regions, the Presidents said they heard Giulia Tremonti qualifying the situation as "unresolved" and expecting "unpredictable" weekends, which he then demented.
In any case, the derogation from long German interests reached the record of 210 basic points and the price of contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) arrived to 263 points, which caused a certain disturbance in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interests was higher than 400 basic points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, declared himself "too busy" by the "burning market development" and the possibly infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third euro area economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that he's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an econome at the Hudson Institute.
Yes and unencryptedly, her problem is the absence of growth and inexplicit fiscal entry, which goes in hand and puts the state in risk that it will not be able to cover his financing needs.
The last forecasts of Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is expected from now on 1,1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public finance deficit will be 4.3% of the gross domestic product in the next year (protecting 3.9% from the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (apart from 2.7%).
The reputation of the new summary of supplements to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, amounting to 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken," evaluates the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For this moment, Italy accepts the support of international institutions.
"The basic stones of its economy are fine and its calculations are correct, we repeat it for a long time," Arrigo Sadun, Italian member of the International Monetary Fund, is assured by the International Monetary Fund under pressure of Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, neither short-term or long-term, because, in spite of its significant debt (119.2% of the gross domestic product 2011, NDLR), the efforts to stabilize the efforts required in Italy are less than the efforts required from other countries," says Pierr Carlo Padoan, the main OCDE econome.
Political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face the proposal for the inconfidence of the messenger of the Parliament, and then the elections that are counted at the end of March will be organized.
This would start a period that would not be suitable for a decision in the case of a serious crisis.
The Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde again stressed it yesterday in the press conference in Paris: "I think the Europeans have demonstrated it throughout Sunday and night, apparently very solid determined, engaged to defend their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion relating to the interests on European state bonds, it brought water to the governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the start of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's Notification Office announced that it could degrade the portuguese debt record, the goals on which various speculations are most focused.
"Because in May there is a real insufficient and apparent policy, based in particular on banking systems," said the Exane BNP Paribas.
More about that "political time runs slower than market time."
In knowledge of this discontinued connection and the danger that hides, the European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen the already existing crisis mechanisms.
The informal consultation between the ministers of finance, most affected by the problem, and, in a broader manner, with their G20 restraints, is developing very well.
In view of the meetings of the Eurogroup (Eurogroup) and the Ecofin group from the beginning of the next week.
The meetings of the Central European Bank are being held today.
The programme is fate of non-convention measures to support the eurozone countries focusing on markets (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Fund (FESF), its Executive Director Klaus Regling, issued on Tuesday in Singapore a road to Asia in order to inform investors from the Dale East on the development of the crisis in Europe.
If this path is not a goal to increase the funds, it is preparing to ensure the land to achieve this goal.
The first emissions of FESF seem to be expected for the next month.
Yesterday, the US official informed the agency Reuters that the United States would support the possible increase in mobilized financial resources by additional direct engagement in the FMI.
The countries referred to in the first row, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms which are attached to strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid were different than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid requesting international assistance at any cost before they apply their own budget corrections and decide on structural reforms necessary to regain their confidence.
Capital participants in European funds are finally talking about options available to accelerate the market normalisation process with supervised obligations.
On its journey to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came to the idea whether 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund would not hesitate to reach the supply of valuable papers again.
Economies from Barclays Capital, an actor of the entire first plan of trade with European supreme claims, believes that an additive of approximately 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "radier" as a form of direct granting financial liquidity.
There is an average: it is a European financial stability mechanism, funded for this day by 60 billion euros.
The Council, which has all the chances to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions have been worsened.
Snow and hope: 24 districts have orange emergency.
Snow allocations cause further problems in the transport, especially on the roads of other classes in Bretani, and there is a risk that some economic activities will be violated.
Twenty-four districts have orange emergencies from now on due to the risk of snow and nail.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, forest Deux-Severs and la Vienne, joined 20 districts that have already declared orange emergency, 18 since middle afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later at night.
According to Meteo France, significant snow attractions cause problems in the north of Gironde and forest Charentes and weak snow on Ile-de-France.
The snow cover between 2 and 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the regions concerned and a cover between 1 and 3 cm, places to 5 in the Paris region.
Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and regions of Basse-Normandia, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snow privacys are large enough to cause transport problems and disturb some economic activities, foretold Meteo France.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some districts prohibited a heavy car transport - cars over 7,5 tonnes with Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The road traffic on the roads of other classes in Bretani is very difficult, and the police recommends to ride with their vehicle only when it is really necessary and some trucks have been cancelled for this day.
In Picardia, school connections were banned on Thursday.
Wednesday night no special measures are expected to limit the cargo transport.
The district office "avoids all car drivers to as much care on roads and to adapt the nature of the vehicle".
The Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel 25% of their flights on the Roissa Paris airport on Thursday and 10% on the Eagle because of the expected snowflows.
DGAC recommends that travellers use air transport services connect to their company.
The Gatwick airport is closed until the Thursday morning in London and the Edinburgh airport in Scotland.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate on the modernization of transport to Ile-de-France is in full stream, there are billions of rains.
At least during the debate.
We remind especially 23 billion on the Grand Paris subway, which is to build the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to be launched, the State announced the granting of 4 billion euros.
It is the amount that will then allow SGP to use part of its double source for procurement.
Today we finally get to the first supplements.
The 2010 Rectivation Act, which is investigating the Financial Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains mechanisms set out to ensure these funds.
There are two: creation of special taxes from equipment and increased tax from offices at Ile-de-France.
First, let's read in the text of the draft law, article 15, "for the benefit of the public institution, Société du Grand Paris".
It is numbered: "The interest rate is 117 million euros per year."
The second is the reconstruction of the rate for the office that already exists, "to be modernized to increase the profit from it and to affect Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it take?
Excellent.
It's not numbered in the text.
We've got 4 billion away.
"It is stated that these fiscal resources are attached to 4 billion euros from capital grants that will be mobilized by the state and put into the Société du Grand Paris project," we can read in explanation of reasons.
This system does not seem shocking to us in SGP.
"From the moment we have created revenues (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then dig up to 4 billion, it explains here."
"It will be incorporated into the budget and used as necessary."
The SGP considers that 4 billion will be allocated until 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which four promised billions belong to still absent advocates, risks that it causes a rather disturbing parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting will be December 7th.
Revenge hackers and reasonable investigators
WikiLeaks' case is a double significance.
On the one hand, there is an obvious scandal, a scandal that appears to be just a scandal faced to hypocrisy that manages relations between States, citizens and press.
On the other hand, it speaks of deep changes at the international level and prevents the future by controlled regression.
But let's keep going.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, is confirming that each document composed of a secret service (whichever nation) consists exclusively of press sketches.
"Affective discovery" of Americans on the way of sexual life, Berlusconio announced what everyone could read in any newspapers (all other than these two Berlusconi own), and the charication profile of Kadafi was for a long time for cabaret artists the theme for skates.
The rule, according to which secret documents should only be made from the reports already known, is essential in the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to the bookshop that is devoted to the esoterical literature, you will see that each work repeats (on Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, Templers or Zeds) exactly what has already been written in previous articles.
And it's not just because the author of the occult texts does not like to look for new information (or doesn't know where to look for reports of the unexistent), but because those who devote to occultism believe only what they know and confirm what they have learned before.
It's a mechanism for Dana Brown's success.
The same applies to secret documents.
The informant is lazy and lazy (or limited spirit) chief of secret services (and if it is not, he might, I know, be a editor in the newspapers of Liberation), who considers true only what he admits himself.
The information with high secrets about Berluscon, which the US Embassy sent to the state resort, were the same as Newsweek published a week ago.
Why, then, did the discovery of these documents make so much emotional?
On the one hand, they say what each cultivated person already knows, even though the embassy, at least since the end of the second World War, and since the heads of States can phone or fly to a joint dinner, lost their diplomatic function and, except for several small exercises in representation, transformed into a spy center.
Any watcher who watches the inquiry movies knows very well that only from hypocrisy it seems to be ignored.
Nevertheless, the fact that this is repeated publicly, is a shameful duty to hypocrisy and it puts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker can get the most strictly hidden information the most powerful country of the world represents a hard strike, not negligible, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both the victims and his "person".
But let's go from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once, in Orwell's times, it was possible to understand all the powers, like some Big Brother who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvel's prophecy has been demonstrated since the possibility to control every movement through the phone, every transaction, visited hotel, used by the road, and so on, became the citizen of the total victim of the power vein.
But when we show how this goes now that even the "graves" with the most secret information of the mighty can't resist any hacker, the control report stops to be one-way and becomes an orbit.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen or at least hacker - chosen as a vindicator of the citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can it keep the power that no longer has the possibility to keep its own secrets ?
It is true that Georg Simmel already said that the real secret is an absolute secret (and the absenceless secret will never be disclosed); it is also true that all information on the nature of Berluscono or Merkel is a truly secretless secret, because it is extracted from public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were inconsistent, means to take away all the power from him.
WikiLeaks didn't make a mistake with Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this wound be so important?
It is obvious that in the future States will not be able to send online sensitive information - that would be equal to its publication on the poster on the corner of the street.
But it is also completely obvious that current technologies are useless to hope that you can keep a telephone message undercover.
There's nothing easier than to find out whether and when the head of the state traveled by a plane and connected with one of its colleagues.
How will they be able to keep private and sensitive news in the future ?
I know that for this moment my forecast belongs to science-fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government factors who are transporting discreetly formalities after uncontrollable routes and wear only those messages that know the memory or rather hide rare information in the shoe patch.
The information will be kept in unique copies in key boots: totally, the attempt to spy in Watergate's affair has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had an opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward sideways, which means backwards.
A century later, when a wireless telegraph meant a revolution in communication, the Internet rehabilitated a telegraph based on wire (telephones).
Videocassets (analogs) allowed the film lovers to take a step forth and move it forward and back and reveal all the secrets of the mounting, while now CDs (digits) allow only to jump on chapters, which means after macroporations.
By means of rapid trains, we will travel from Rome to Milan in three hours, while we need three and a half hours to travel on a plane and transport.
It is therefore unusual that politics and communication technologies will return to the cars pulled by horses.
Last note.
In another time, the press tried to understand what was founded in the secret of the Embassy.
Now these are ambassadors that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France hacked its promises of financing
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to test the fulfilment of the promises for a rapidly unlocked finance (specific funding with rapid launch (fast start) or early), implemented by developed countries.
And the big French hacks were discovered
In the Copenhagen Agreement, the developing countries had committed to providing $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union promised 7.2 billion euros for three years and France 1.26 billion euros (this is 420 million per year).
At the start of COP16, the EU has drawn a large eso to convince its partners of its commitment to finance a quick start: a report on the action of its Member States, the press conference, the grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparency operations are invaluable and evaluated at their real value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, which brings her to the right path to fulfil its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the details, we find things much more complicated.
These funds are under the Copenhagen Agreement "new and supplementary" to ensure that increased burden has been implemented without prejudice to the public aid for development.
Unfortunately, there is no coincidence in what means "new and extra".
While the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Everyone today chooses the reference that fits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered the 2009 reference: international funding has been maintained and it adds 150 million to the title of the finance for three years of rapid start.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment terms or terms at the level of public aid for development.
On the contrary, France feels that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
Otherwise, there is no reference to the expenses of previous periods or to the global level Public aid for the development of d'Aide public au développement.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even reduced) should comply with its commitment to finance "new and additional "...
Another crucial element is the division of gifts and loans.
There is still no rule, and everyone chooses their own way of calculating.
Some, such as France, consider that 1€ loan is equal to 1€ gifted.
Apparently, it is difficult to prove: efforts are not comparable.
If the use of loans can be submitted for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to reducing emissions in more efficient technologies), it is a flag to present one euro that we receive as an equivalent to one euro that we give... , we should not understand it from the title of our obligations, but as the price of loan for the crediting country (i.e. an equivalent interest rate).
But France can only give the following reasons: "he holds" its commitment of 420 million euros, which makes 91.5% loan (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% of gifts (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to verify itself.
It is the only Union country that uses the loan in such a measure.
Germany demanded 46% from here, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (mean others) respect their commitments with 100% of gifts.
Otherwise, if the total majority of the European Union gives 1€ to the fulfilment of its promise, France will only give 10 cents and consider this effort comparable.
Beautiful slice!
For the summary, in its financing of "fast start" France operates with two steps: on the one hand with the development of shares in time and on the other side with real financial burden.
Although he only issues 36.1 million euros, he can convince 420 million euros "new and supplementary" in connection with his promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would Member States continue to donate when it is enough to lend?) and negotiating, because the developing countries are not completely naive...
The pre-financing chapter is only a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could be a sand grain in a huge machine like UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to draw knowledge from this first year of early funding.
First, France should notify the change in its way of conducting accounting evidence for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of compliance with its obligations and obedience and justice against other countries of the European Union.
But first of all, France should prevent debate on contributions to long-term finance (other essential chapter currently discussed): we will not avoid the question of "supplementarity" or the way of receiving loans.
France should change its attitude so that it becomes as progressive in these contributions as it is in others.
Therefore, hopes are all put into the new Minister for Environment, Mrs. Kosciu-Moriset, who is coming to Cancun next week.
A surprising notification of France's fast-start and its vision of "supplementarity" and the use of loans could lead to an increase in international confidence, necessary to continue discussions.
Alarm about pesticides that children eat.
A 10-year-old child dies one day 81 different chemicals, according to one study published by this center, from the Association of future generations (ex-Growing for Rights and Conservation of future generations).
The association notes that its results "without a significant statistical value in view of a low number of analysed samples, but are characteristic for the processed problem," she bought foods normally consumed in four foods between July and September and one light food as a light meal for one child for decades in supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1,5 liters of water daily - as well as diabetes, were analysed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutant factors.
The plate balance is impressive: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are divided between carcinogenic substances, possibly or likely, and five substances belong to the clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that may be acting as disruptive for irons with internal mixing (PE), according to studies of several institutions such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical accepted individually are not exceeded, in our research we see well that the reality in the exposure of consumers to contaminating substances, perhaps carcinogenic, and/or the PE is infecting," the Association states.
For breakfast butter and tea with milk contain about ten résidues with possible cancer effects and three proven as certain carcinogenes, as in about 20 residues that could distort the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil by study as a small meal, contains six chemicals, including the prohibited fungicide in France.
The same applies to green bovines from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study revealed signs of strong insecticides prohibited in the EU.
Furthermore, pigs from milk meat, tuna in a bowl, and even gum and chewing were spiked pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water of the analysis, the presence of nitrogens and chloroform revealed.
The steak from salmon to dinner was "the richest" with 34 discovered chemical residues and even analysing the plastic plate used to warm food in the microwave tube did not avoid analysis.
The final risk for consumers of this "contaminating substance cocktail" is probably underestimated," the study shows.
The Environmental Europe-Zeline (EE-LV) has proposed "to face the urgent situation" to establish a moratorium for the use of pesticides to stop "increasing civilization diseases".
In July, the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) studied the status of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
