Parliament did not support a novel freeing Timoshenk
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected the proposal to cancel in the framework of the criminal law, on the basis of which the opposition leader Julia Timošenk was sentenced.
The amendment that opened the way to release the prisoner's exemption was rejected when the second reading of the proposal to mitigate the penalty for economic delicts.
Timoshenk was sentenced to seven years of prison in October for the conclusion of an allegedly unfit agreement with Russia on the purchase of land gas.
The judgment is not authorised, the appeal convicted shall negotiate in December.
Timoshenk refers the judgment to a political revenge of the regime, the suspicion of the involvement of the court has also caused the process in the West.
The proposal that paragraph 365, on the basis of which the exemption was convicted, should support 147 votes.
226 votes were required to approve.
Libyan victory
The story of Liberation of Libya, or the Libyan rebellion, has already defeated.
Muammar Kaddafie is buried in an unknown place in the desert, and without him, he's after war.
It's left to define the winner.
As a custom in the region, the islamists win the elections, but it's about whether moderation or radical.
The Transitional National Council has joined the customary law of the chariya and we already have a certain idea about it.
Libya will become a country without crime, for theft is cut by the hand.
Women can forget the emmancipation, the possibly apostates of faith await execution, and so on.
Instead of a dictator's person, a company consisting of competitive tribes will unify the crown.
There will be a order in Libya that we can't imagine and we certainly want.
But our lifestyle is not the only one or objectively best, and it would probably not be suitable for a change, for example, to the Libyan mentioned.
In fact, it is a miracle that Islamic warriors have taken thanks from unbeliever dogs.
It is only apologize that from their perspective, some of the generals from America did not lead NATO attacks, but Allah, whose size was celebrated at each intrusion.
So when the winners are searched in Libya, the west is not among them.
We participated in the shooting, we served Islam, and our politicians relieved a political ally in the person of the dictator without guaranteeing a profit.
After fresh bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq Libya we are not militaryly occupied.
That's where the local falls, it's a problem with expelling the crossmen.
But will they have no oil company occupation for a libyan black gold?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to admire the uncertain protection of human rights.
Unless it's gonna break up with those chariya law students.
The new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe have reached the investors' search engine
The statistical decline was over Europe on Tuesday.
Single States have published GDP data for 3Q.
The Czech economy has interquartionally stagnified, Germany and France are growing.
But the debt market is breaking the records today.
Investors are not only looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria, and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and some other countries of Europe have published preliminary assessments of the development of the economy for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP increased by 0.5% expected, France by 0.4%.
Both countries also corrected the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better than expected (0.3% growth instead of original 0.1%), so France stated that it appeared in a mild decline of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy has increased by 1,5 per cent annually in this third quarter.
However, a fourth-year-old gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated and, according to the CIS, confirmed the trend of gradually reducing economic performance growth.
The results are worse than the estimates of analysts.
Most important events:
The Czech economy in the third quarter of the year increased by 1,5 per cent annually, but inter-quarter yearly stagnated.
The German economy in the third quarter, according to the preliminary and seasonally calculated data, increased by 0.5 per cent.
The euro area economy and the European Union have increased between July and September against the previous quarter by 0.2 per cent, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2 per cent annually.
Her 10-year-old debt income is 28.45%.
Contributions of Italian and Spanish bonds grow to critical borders.
Problems also start to feel Austria, Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc....
The benefits in the Czech 10-year debts are below 4%, even if the situation in the region is worsening.
The votes from Germany are that the ECB should be the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs were qualified for EURO.
In Black Mountain, they won 1:0 and celebrated the procedure for 200 million
Football representation has managed the hardest task of the season!
In Black Mountain and thanks to the great Czech and beautiful brace of Peter Jirak won 1:0.
The Czech soccer also with a great portion of happiness in the second halftime avoided a luxury incentive from home revenge and will not miss again at the European championship.
IHNED.cz monitored the progressive struggle in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a big portion of happiness in the other.
The Czech representation also thanks to the homemade in the end, the great Czech and hero Jiračkov won happyly in Montenegro 1:0 and glorifies the procedure for the championship of Europe.
The Montenegros have gotten into pressure in the second halftime because of the precise defense of the Czech whole.
The Smolars of the battle became Damijanovic with the Vukovič, who burned two great chances.
Even thanks to the great Peter Czech, the Czech representative will not miss Europe's championship either next year, and the remuneration of approximately 200 million crowns will be added to the tuther football.
There's been a lot of fighting football since the initial minutes.
Both teams were just hardly involved in the combination and played mostly around the half-line line.
The pressure of home footballists has also not arrived in the first half, since the Czech defense was exactly disturbing.
The Iranian students are ready to die for the nuclear program of their country.
They created a live shield
Several hundred students created a live shield around the nuclear object in Iran.
They want to express their gestures to support their country's nuclear programme before possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed on Tuesday on the afternoon before the facility and then caused the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred students of universities in Iranian Isfahan created a live shield on Tuesday around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Centre in which Uran is processed.
They show that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear programme by their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) stated in its recent report that Iran had not stopped pursuing nuclear weapons.
The possible attack on the Iranian nuclear equipment is discussed in Israel.
On the afternoon, the students prayed to the Isfahan nuclear facility and then called upon America and Israel to die.
In the event of an assault that would make the Iranian nuclear programme as possible, Israel's press other than the Isfahan Centre would also be aimed at an equipment in Natanz, where the uranium is enriched.
A meal of a burden child: not breakfast and dinner prisons
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with overweight of 9 per cent of students, and the weight of 5 percent of children.
In most cases, the generous children come from families with unhealthy lifestyle, as shown by the current research.
Again shows how important it is for healthy human development in which it grows, and the models that it is surrounded.
For example, prisons appear to be half more frequently than in children’s families with normal weight.
Fruit potatoes had no coincidence of more than 19 percent of the massives for dinner.
In the fat families, there is also no habit of sporting, which, however, concerns most of the families of today's schoolmates - only 15 percent of children responded that their parents would find time once a week for active movement.
Research between 900 children
The examination took place at the end of the last year's school and was attended by nearly 900 children from basic schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second year of the Obesita action is not a coincidence that supports the General Health Insurance and Unilever.
More than 12,000 students from 4 to 8 grades have already been involved in the project.
The right food and sufficient movement in the family is one of the determining factors that cause dramaticly rising numbers of children with overweight or even obsessiveness.
"Only half of the questions asked, for example, said that she had five times a day in breakfast-swachina-swachina-swachina-food, which is one of the basic predictions of proper nutrition," is one of the results of the research.
No breakfast and no evening
Experts notify that for healthy development, and relative details include regular family breakfast time.
In the same time, only 23 percent of the schoolmates have breakfast in Czech Republic.
In most families, everyone's breakfast alone.
And the worst was finding that in a dozen households it doesn't breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of the right daily food.
The questionnaire showed that more frequent potatoes are consumed in the families of obsessive children.
Almost every - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70%).
While they regularly sport more than 40 percent of children questioned, their parents were less than half - 15 percent.
Build your dining room
Another part of the survey enabled the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile from the possibilities offered by their own meals according to their own taste and opinion.
"The preferences of the Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from a healthy diet."
Among their favorite foods, there are many wet, massive and sweet foods.
"Alarming is in particular a great love for sweet lemonades," the final study report states.
During lunch as the main meal, the poultry cakes were victorious closely over the poultry.
But the children practically did not want the crustaceans, and the love of fish and afternoon vegetables is also low.
Suppression to health
The survey also showed that children are willing to adjust their diet habits if they receive the correct information.
"No coincidence has occurred in a number of cases a significant move of preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," the project reports.
For example, it was marking for sweet lemonades, where more children would start to prefer ordinary water.
Children also frequently pinned in the poultry and fish questionnaire as the main meal of the day and would limit sweet foods and knives.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, hard professionals
In the introductory article on how styleists learn, I complained so much that there was a lot of things in the early hours.
I didn't know what was going to happen.
Three professors from the field, clothing problems figures, and a seminar about how it goes to the place.
And it'll be worse.
The closer to the final test, the more information and practical tasks are waiting for us.
And even when the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "scattered."
This time, Director Alenka and I discussed (in the course there is no only boy), how to dress a woman who has no perfectly relative character.
And that's most of them.
Someone's got a short neck, someone's a boy's face without a real curve, and someone's overweight again.
The stylist must know how optically to reconcile the broad shoulders, extend the neck or add the necessary curves.
We've received tips as in a woman like Jennifer Lopez, that's the bigger tits and sides and a narrow passport, a figure to emphasize, and at the same time the woman doesn't dress too challenged.
For example, if there is a difference between the passport and the sides that skirts or pants really do not fit, it is worth keeping at least one such a piece of peace.
You will definitely not regret, because the perfectly falling clothes are unpaid.
In a peaceful dress, you will feel much better than the one that moves you all the time, he swallows, he drops in passports, and so on.
The boy's character can afford to wear clothing with weed, apps, sewing or acquiring.
Such information and types of figures, of course, are many, so I'm glad I have a whole week to get all the information in my head.
And I'm still afraid that, given the homework specified, it's all the way.
Each of the courses has been given a designed celebrity to make up two outfits: day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the individual and the type of character.
I'll dress Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my spirit, I am definitely better personally than Britney Spears, Christine Aguiler, who has recently collected a hundred pounds (please take overthrow) or young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut our clothes out of magazines or search on the Internet and print and follow a graphical process.
The moodboard, as it is called the whole result, will also express our personal style and the relationship with graphic creation.
Thinking about the graphical page of style is also important.
The stylist does not just physically, but also create so - called product pages in magazines (for specific purposes, such as purse trends, coats, etc.).
That's what a stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us.
But that's Sunday.
The stylelist must have a general review
The Saturday lecture, which was loaded with information on types of figures, was immediately released by three guests from the field.
Stylist Honza Polymer, fashion designer James Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is illusion, and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a fancy stylest can work with one piece of clothes differently.
Variability is key in this case.
So such a trick (or if you want to originally trenchcoat) can be wearing classically over the jeans and shirt as a coat, but you can also dress it on a naked body, hatch the boat and photograph as dress.
Or it's just to get out of the sleeves or the sleeve, and the whole look looks different right now.
"Please play it," he emphasized.
But most of all, I appreciated the following advice: "To work, you need to know the rules perfectly."
"Then you can start breaching them," said Jacob.
So I finally understand why we're breaking all the lessons that we're combining with, why, if we see something else in fashion magazines.
Don't even talk about shows.
Thanks to Ben's photographer, I know that a stylest must have a much more variance of clothes than how many of them are going to take.
So in the fashion story that will have ten pages (this is ten outfits), I need to be prepared to "stable" at least 15.
And also that it looks and works in combination with other pieces of leckdy completely different than actually.
So we have to count on this in the formation of supplies.
That the image and style makes leckdy up to half the success, Honza Ponity confirmed us.
Just look at Madonna, who's not exactly a miraculous singer, but image and marketing made her a world star.
In Czech Republic, access to the use of stylists is rather cold.
And the famous faces of his leckdy consider it useless (it's enough for me to know something, what I look like is secondary).
And if someone's already letting us make a style, then we're going to count on being directed to us with a whole different (small) size than it really has.
Then there's nothing left to google and find out if the bullwar not wrote that the celebrity was thick/small and similar.
Honza and Mario were putting on our hearts on Sunday that the stylest doesn't have enough to focus on fashion and skills.
In his work, it is important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing how to estimate people, not to advocate, stand by your opinion.
"If a manager orders you to get her a closet and fill it up with nice pieces, you can't throw it out and say, for God's sake, it's horrible."
"Find at least a few things that you commend and recommend what you can wear," Mario says.
He also showed us exactly what everything must contain the so-called "package" or the bag on the square.
It's the one you put around the passport and you have all the goods you need.
In addition to clear things, such as scientists, knives for hair, or clothing, there are also nylon threads (with it the stylist helps photograph products such as purse or hats), special clips that we put behind the clothing if it is larger (whiskey or other cords are not allowed, they would destroy the clothes), or a shield.
In order to avoid listening, we also practically try something, we learned how to fit our shoes right.
Even in a photo in the athlete, where the surface is equal, the irrigation could be damaged, even outside.
So we sticked and sticked.
We can't even touch our shoes with shoes so they don't get hurt.
So it is really necessary to be handicapped.
Mario satisfied me when my creature commended me without an excuse.
It's really not my friend.
This is just a small piece of what we heard about the second weekend course.
It starts to be more clear that devoting to style at professional level is really not a walk of a pink garden, whoever says what he wants.
In Need for Speed: The Run races all over America.
Reviews
Originally, the unemployed ride is transformed into a routine morning journey.
Although the ambition has been largely fulfilled, it is nothing valid when no one apparently wanted to do anything more.
A new part with the subtitle The Run woke up before the issue of high expectations.
He promised that the Flight Racing Series Need for Speed would relocate a piece in a new direction and from the playmarks appeared as a game that would not only be to the number.
We were also curious about how the passages in which the main hero will come out of the car and run by his own.
But as in the NFS series, many are a little different than we expected.
These are potentially pleasant arcade races, but they have been dragging down a few useless mistakes that have been shown in the series for more than a few years.
So it's not actually mistakes, but rather a manifestation of some kind of unacceptable lazyness of developers.
Adventure begins very well.
You are listed in a story whose main hero Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution, it offers participation in an illegal race across America.
You will sit behind the volunteer on the west coast in San Francisco and your task is to get first to New York.
The idea brings with it several interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then to more than 50 races.
This shows that each race is on a different trail and that stages are placed in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
Man doesn't feel like a game would still offer the same thing.
Some of the environment are also very nice to see, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's nothing worldly.
But riding around deserts, autumn landscape or high in snow mountains is visually very pleasant.
Furthermore, the races are attached from time to time by some untypical element.
For example, in the desert, you are embarrassed into a sandstorm that significantly reduces the visibility.
On the contrary, in the mountains, you must be careful not to be asleep by the lavina.
In addition, individual races are well placed behind them.
There are only a few types, but it's enough.
So you try to prevent the required number of rivals (in fact the classic race), then you get the time again (classic fighting with footsteps) and then you need to have a duel with the only rival.
The police are still involved in it from time to time, which continues to disadvantag your efforts.
The news is the passage outside of the cars.
It's more than just an interactive animation when Jack runs before someone, and you have to help him by printing the right buttons at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
But it is surprised that these passages are much less than you would expect (in particular maybe even three).
But in the result, it is for the benefit of the matter, because this element does not have a chance to become annoying and in the context of the above, it is ordered to the elements that build the game.
The model goes in tracks of previous parts.
That means that it is definitely no longer witch today, but it is not possible to say that it would be a negative.
If you're looking for realistic simulation, you'll have to look around elsewhere.
But a more conceived race this road model still fits pretty well, even though we can find better in competition.
So then it's all in complete order.
However, problems begin to occur after a while.
Unlike the driver's model, it's not a collision model anymore.
From the game of this type, we don't expect it to count complicated deformation and collision, but when you practically don't have any idea how your car works, then it's probably not all right.
Typically, when you drive closely or cross cars in normal operation, sometimes you just lick each other easily, but sometimes in a nearly identical situation your car ends in wild piruets.
Or even attack straight.
The restart system doesn't really mind it, but it'll dissolve you reliablely.
Restarts are solved so that if you smack yourself or you go far off the trail, you're throwing the game back to the last capable point on the track.
But restarts are only five available in each race.
If you exhausted them, you have to start the race again.
So it is rather such a help in case something doesn't work rather than you can expressly rely on them.
Sometimes, however, the restarts will not help, but will solve them as long as they need to learn that part of the race to remember.
The big noise of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some scrolls are needed in a specific way, otherwise you simply don't enter them.
Otherwise, you will meet the civilian cars in the same configuration in the same place, whether you get there first, five, five seconds sooner or a minute later.
It's especially in situations where you see the rival between the two opposing cars will pass easily before you, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to ride or brake them.
It doesn't matter when you get to them, because it's "counted" so that the situation is always in front of your nose.
The competitors also have other advantages.
During the game, you will face several places where, again, no matter how much time, the same competitor will always precede in the same place.
Most of all, it hits at the end of the game on a long bridge where you go in the opposite direction.
The opponent must get in front of you obviously at any price.
When he comes in front of you, it makes you feel worse about the anti-cars, so you're starting to get somewhat good.
You can understand the intention of making the game more stressful and adrenaline, but the implementation is so obvious that it will reliably quickly distract you.
And it's a shame, because despite a simple ride model, playing fun and places, and so much action that sometimes you don't literally watch where it flys.
And basically, it doesn't matter whether it's the concept of 50 unique tracks, the sorting of races so that boring doesn't have a chance, or anything else.
The untraditional idea is to exchange cars during races.
You have to be careful about gas pumps on the road, because there you can change the car, even though in a total majority of cases, you'll be enough with what you have right now.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable in urban areas, strong American storms on the straight roads and exotic supersports for technical ride, for example, after clipping mountain roads.
With the main history regime, it goes hand in hand and fashion of challenges, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points into your profile, which is common for challenges and stories.
In order to obtain higher levels of drivers, various objects are unlocked: starting cars and ending with backgrounds for the profile.
It is also connected again with the on-line function Autolog, which, inter alia, compares your achieved results with other players and acquires other community functions.
One of the other hardly understandable baths is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car, you get to the metro tunnel (besides), where you take it in the darkness of the railways (besides).
There are numbers between 150 and 200 km/h on the tachometer, and the meter's arriving in the back and unpromisely scratching you.
In the editorial, maybe for a few days, we'll have a debate about whether when we're making a game, nobody really thought a little, or if the authors think of us as a really big asshole.
The technical page of the game is nothing extra, but at least the total visual impression is very pleasant in most cases and in several cases even great.
It freezes so that in some more distinct moments it falls, and in some cases it's pretty tragic.
But most of all, this concerns a broadcast with a larger number of participants, where you'd have no more valid pictures.
The sound page is fine and soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to like the widest scale, rather, the younger audience created soundtrack from the category "Every dog different village", but it can be assumed that because of listening to music, it's probably not going to buy a game.
Total impression from Need for Speed: The Run is so much disappointed.
If the game had been avoided by completely useless mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say The Run is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
But this is how the game works incompletely.
The fun is definitely cool, but prepare for mistakes to squeeze you through the power of the airport reflectors.

Ambassador at the EU Vicen:
Czech Republic has the reputation of negativeists and euro skeptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly broken the balance between individual institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years before the situation gets a little cold, and before all players get used to their new role," the Czech Ambassador at the European Union Milena Vicene began a lecture at the Legal Faculty.
As far as its motto "Acceptable and open about Europe" takes seriously, it has already shown in the first part of the lecture that it has been able to describe individual EU authorities and their relations so transparent and understandable that a number of speakers from the UK Legal Faculty could envy it.
Vicena also commended the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuye:
"The first criticism appeared that it was inexplicit, that he was a grey official, that he couldn't play any role, and I must tell everyone that the breath was excellent."
"He is a person who can listen to the twenty-seven Member States, having a great communication with them and has a clear vision where the European Union should go."
The new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question, "Who is the European Union? Which phone number should I call?", therefore, as an important step to unify and more readable EU policy against States such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our cheese.
Vicena also devoted the agenda that the European Council lived to live and will live in the nearest time.
The Presidency of the Presidency of the Presentation of the Presentation of the Presidency of the Presentation of the Presentation.
The Czechs solved the coming financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or organized a summit for Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at this time has then been a major negative which has severely damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, "fact fmol" was not only presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis that is addressed to date.
Furthermore, the new seven-year budget of the Union must be approved, which is very complicated because of the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be thin and savings that will receive the sector's advantage that countries will be supported more and less, all this is on the next series of negotiations.
The Ambassador also reminded her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels, "O Europe understandable."
"I really don't like ugly shortcuts, foreign words, a hunch that no one understands.
How should a citizen understand that in Brussels, they really don't seem to be screwed or rounded coats, bananas differently large or that someone really needs to banish us cheese."
He also wants to better use the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
Multi-speed Europe Awaiting
According to the Ambassador, the Czech Republic has the reputation of euro skeptics and people who notice more negative than positive pages of the matter.
Furthermore, she regrets the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
It is guilty of many factors, such as the modestness of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, she raised the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
" Believe me, if Polk and Hungary come to me and the Slovak approaches, the French next to me will say, "Hey, what are you seeing there, what's your Visegrad four again?" and it's not getting excited about it at all.
In the future of the Union, Vicena is awaiting mainly new hard rules for the Member States' budgetary policies.
As a very real, then he takes into account the concept of double-speed, not more speeding Europe, rather than the new "European Federation".
"We have euro zones and lands outside the euro area."
"We have Schengen's space, we already have an institute of strengthened cooperation."
"The first time it was said that only the countries they want to cooperate, and those who do not want to stand down."
"These institutions will be more and it will be a strongly double-speed Europe," Vicen expects.
In this regard, she also evaluated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye in promoting the principle that all the topics affecting the entire Union are to be discussed among all Member States, not only among the euro area countries.
Brand story:
Innovator IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone was looking for a word that would express the IBM Strategy most accurately, it would probably be "long-term".
For the broad public, IBM is a symbol of technological revolution, it is a company considered very current, and yet since it was established, it has passed a hundred years.
The foundation of this long-term was set up by the first head of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already hit the password that a number of world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His password "Think!" has become a fingerprint around which the life of the future giant (and also the name of an internal magazine that began to appear in the IBM in 1935).
It was also the basis for a carefully built company culture.
"For us from IBM, long-term thinking means continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for hundreds of years because she remained loyal to her basic values and was not afraid to change everything else around her.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that we can achieve more in the second hundred," Samuel J. Palmisano noted for the anniversary.
Processed system
Watson, in the 1930s, had access to care for his employees, as well as the company of Bacia in Czech Republic - the IBM people had a vacation paid, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and an developed system for rewarding the best inventors and businessmen.
It is also developed that IBM has a long-term relationship with the customer.
The company has been brilliant in exercising talents from the beginning -- as one of the first world's companies, it has cancelled any discrimination, so she could choose.
In accordance with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana is headed by the IBM in the next year - Virginia Rometty.
It's been working in IBM for 30 years, so far the selling, marketing and strategy heads.
IBM has made so-called holes in recent years, online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovation are exploited.
No wonder it's enough ideas - almost half a million people work in the company.
Institution with good name
A certain position in business ensures the company its strong internal and external image.
"In the beginning, IBM had rather the concept of an institution than just a technology company," said the Economist professor Harvard Business School and the author of the IBM Rosabeth Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems for the use of technology," George Colony added from the Forrester Research Consultative Company.
As the company itself says, it is the difference between entering into the market and creating the market directly.
IBM - or "Great Blue", as it has been called familiarly because of her log in the United States - in a hundred years, she grew up into one of the biggest companies in the world.
It is apparently the universal technology company - develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in the scale of products from servers to nanotechnology.
He holds the most patents of all American technological companies and five of her employees gained the Nobel Prize.
Between its inventions, such as bankomat, payment card, financial swap, line code or discette.
The IBM has become the second largest technological company this year by market capitalisation (first is Apple), when the first time since 1996 Microsoft was in place.
Forward View
Not all products and innovations have been hit by customers' taste and time - IBM, for example, did not bet on OS/2's own operating system, on-line services Prodigy or IBM PCjr.
"If your business is built forward, you can't emotionally bond to the past," Samuel J. Palmisano notes.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms - and if they do not work, leave them.
Unlike the competitive Microsoft, which in principle stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technologies
The IBM markets are largest participating in services, after about five, software and hardware are created.
In 1990, he was the strongest representative of the hardware with more than half a share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profitable assets worth $15 billion and invested $58 billion during the same time in the shopping of perspective technologies.
It also continues in investment since 2008, when the world has first overcome the modern financial crisis.
The IBM acts according to its first boss Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the volume of investment during the major economic crisis.
It seems so far that the IBM is undergoing the current crisis is untouched.
The IBM share price has increased by 120% from the beginning of 2008, the net profits of the company continue to grow.
The IBM company password is to change everything, just not your values.
It is therefore possible to expect that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant can handle it.
IBM History: From cheese cutter to flight to universe
IBM (International Business Machines) created in New York 100 years ago, originally had a complex name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took up until 1924 — originally used for office offices in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later IBM has compounded four companies whose history touches the 1980s of the 19th century.
They owned technologies such as famous "shooks", that is, hours recording employee's arrival and leaving.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the supervisory council by 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson's competitive boss to help him handle the company.
The Lydr then shadowed the founder IBM - on Watson's thoughts has yet been built invincible company culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as stated by her name, began with the production and sale of all possible business machines - from the cuters of meat and cheese in the treasury.
During the first four years when Watson was headed by the company, he doubled the turn of nine million dollars and began the widespread expansion of the company into all worlds.
Watson was so impatient for the company that almost forty years in the boss chair, his son, Thomas Watson Junior, was handling him.
Under his IBM leadership, it started working on artificial intelligence development, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and IBM computers helped NASA fly to the universe - to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 a famous human year to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - a series of IBM System/360.
The classic "peanut" which set up the computer standard at that time, IBM 5150 came to the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold Lenovo's computer production, purchased the consultant's part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began full consultation and services with high value added.
Strategy that's been paid by IBM in the last three years is the concept of Smarter Planet, "Smarter Planet".
Its aim is not to use smart technologies in unplanned areas and improve the situation, for example, in transport or management of cities.
She recently launched a Smarter Commerce platform for the trade area, which helps traders to drive the whole commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history even in the country.
She established her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM CHR also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe Centre is situated in Prague, and there is also a research team of the world level dealing with the recognition of the vote.
Richtara about the unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep that asshole, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richtar (53) said it's over!
After her husband Joseph Richtara (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartosh (45), but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and return home.
But now she's not waiting, and she has made clear rules in her next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," explained Richtar.
When Darina Richtar in summer she provided Bartos’ asylum in her house, she probably had no idea how her marriage eventually ends.
Although Iveta had moved away after 30 days of her insistance, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly confessed that he loved her.
During her time, Darina resigned her husband’s relationship, and now she even gave him goodbye forever.
The fishermen don't care who his wife's sleeping with
If Richtar and Bartosh broke up only once, his wife's arm will not wait at home.
"It's my son's biological father, and if he wants to live his life in our common house, no one will chase him."
"But it will live not as my loved, frauded old but as a man with whom I have certain ties," Richtar said, "and she was departing from her husband and insisting only on mutual respects.
Joseph, the fact that Darina closed his back door is still fine.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta, and I won't change it."
"Man has set up a paper marriage, and I respect it."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, gardens, real estate, buying."
"Darina and I have a totally normal conversation, but we don't share beds together," said Lightning Richtar.
If Richtar finds a new love, she says she won't stop her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where he goes, who he's going with, and if he has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I'm in love with Iveta and I'm taking all responsibility," Joseph closed up.
The worst women's habits: Are you involved?
When you ask men if they can name some typical female habits, they usually all in one are very urgently emptied out of the glove.
Beautiful women, do you know in the following lines where there are several female habits that can perfectly pump the blood in the veins?
Shopping
Does your second half count that you're dependent on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one clothing a week?
You're shopping a lot in discounts?
Then in your case, you can talk about shopping as a nausea.
Some women realize that their shopping passion should at least be a little embarrassed.
But tell me, who would resist it just walking through clothing shops, looking for well-falling clothing and then try them all (perfectly in different coloring) in the cabin?
Even though most women are hobby shopping, they can literally become a complete hell for men.
Just remember how many times you've told yours to wait for you before the entrance...
Permanent Dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat?"
"I should lose at least five pounds -- should I start practicing?"
"You like me at all?"
Do these sentences remind you of anything?
Right?
Then you belong to those women who are obsessed with how they look.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners are still complaining about their appearance.
The stronger sex is also consistent with the increasing frequency of this complaint, which makes women more nervous.
Order and purity first
It's like an infinite circle.
Washing windows, sucking, erasing the plate, washing dust, drying bath - at least twice a week.
You're counting on his partner that he screwed his dirty leg on a clean tide, to the kids, that they dirtyed the scratched washing and screwed up a scratch of the living wall, with which you've given you so much work?
If you are suffering from this “relief, ” try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and order and cleanness should certainly not happen within the family at first.
This harmless desire for pureness can endanger your relationships and family comfort.
Ripping
"You used coaches throw in the trash."
"You old socks will wear yourself tomorrow?"
"The wet scratch doesn't belong to the ground."
If you do this several times a day, know that you can rely on it.
Of course you don't mean anything wrong, you want to make everything right.
Maybe if men knew that, women wouldn't have had to sneak so much into them...
Scattering, chattering
For some women, there are also traits, talks, but also insults and associations against someone.
Women are focused on relations, so they like to discuss things like who, where, who, who, and why.
I hope each of us gets a little screwed-up or a slander in here.
The hand to the heart, it may be owned by all women.
But again, they are the worst seeds that they love and often talk, perhaps they despise each other and are contemplated for their surroundings -- especially in women's workshop -- especially dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped assistants to win Philadelphia
The hockey attacker Jaromir Jagr participated in the Monday fighting NHL with two assistants in the winning Philadelphia 5:3 on Carolina's ice and is again headed by the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux was accompanied by an overview of the nineteen-year-old star, which added another subscription and was announced as the best player in the game.
Two assistants in the game also recorded Jager's colleague, Jacob Voraček.
The Jager after the attack of the foreign journalists claimed that Giroux had predicted a great evening.
"I told him before the game he'd give him a hattrick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimly, you're overwhelmed by such a feeling," explained Jagr, after which Giroux gave a goal from the first shot of Flyers.
A little later, there was a second inflammation in the team with a Czech track.
The vacuum fought behind the door of Hurricanes and presented it between the circles that scored Maxim Talbot.
The second before the first break, the home player Patrick Dwyer weakened, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to Flyers.
Especially Giroux.
After collaborating with Jagr, he shot the third goal, then he stretched his shot in the fourth gate of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the liague, but I'm sure he belongs to the best three," Jagr appreciated his center.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockeyist like him at the end of my career."
"I'm glad of it."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in NHL my fellow players tried to play at me, now it turns around," Jagr added.
Carolina made a drama of the game, a goal of Tuom Rutua and again Dwyer, who came out of a criminal shooting, came apart from one gate.
But another complications did not allow Matt Read, who finished the number two per one.
"Super hit in our Pronger zone."
"He blew the wheel, I pulled the speed, and (Read) went to the remote sticks."
"I tried to hit him, and I'm glad it worked out," he described the last gate of the fight from his view of the Beauty.
Philadelphia has won the East Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček did not win a fight against Buffal, in the second third he resigned because of the wounds in the upper part of the body.
Candiens lost binary leadership next to the experienced beach and lost after penalt break 2:3.
One of their invasions did not change Tomáš Plecanec.
The home coach, rather than the lost points, was overwhelmed by a broad marrode of the back of the row, with only five defenses played the game.
"It's bad."
"We only played with one experienced player, the rest were youths."
"But we just can't do anything about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"It's been going down on us, and we couldn't resist."
"We were supposed to simplify the game, move the knock out of our zone."
We had spaces in that," added one of the P.K. Subban defenders.
The Czech Branker Ondrej Pavelec contributed to the thirty hits of Winnipeg to win 5:2 over Tampo Bay.
The Jets goals, who interrupted the 5-pass series of passages, shared five different shooters.
As the prices of the railways have developed since 1989
By 1989, only five state travel offices were allowed in Czechoslovakia: Chadok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
The travel offices at that time sold only to the socioist bloc countries, since travel to the west was very limited.
The Czech tourists traveled to sea holidays to NDR (Germany Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Soci at Crime in the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
The light exception was from the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime moved to the West, and the roads of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of socialism was that the citizens of the Socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czech Slovakia) were not allowed to travel individually freely or within socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovakian wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an official letter from this country, otherwise there was no individual path perhaps.
Travel offices at that time also offered visits to the West, but there was a need to stand the front overnight with a bedroom or to have "good friends" in the travel office.
Nevertheless, it wasn't won.
The so-called devision pledge, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not granted to "politically unreliable people", which could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovakia currency was not a freely exchanged currency, and without a devious pledge, it could not be possible to obtain funds (west currency) for the journey to the West.
However, from far to far the Czech Republic spent a vacation in the country, which resulted in a large amount of chats and chalup that the Czechs acquired and survived today.
This is how Czech travel has experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While by 1989, she was vacationed in NDR or Bulgaria by our maxim, the loons spent Chechy in abroad 4,5 million vacations in the countries of the world.
The giant paradox that we don't realize today is that we were currently not able to travel freely by 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia.
At the end of the 1990s, visa responsibilities to neighbouring Western European countries have been cancelled, which launched a huge wave of short-term visits mainly in Austria Vienna or Germany.
The Czech Slovakians couldn't get to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to look at it for at least a minute.
For example, in Paris the Czech races in the parks were sleeping, since our income then did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of the Czech travel was the ride of own food, can, salads, etc. to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely changing Czech crown, thus our tourists could finally buy Western currency after many decades of years.
However, our life level, and also the average payments, increased, which arrived around 1997 at another important moment.
With the increased demand for travel, travel offices started regularly preparing to charter airlines since 1997, making air railways possible to negotiate quantitative discounts compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, Czech Republic had a visa contact with practically all developed countries of the world, except the United States, which has continued to make our journey easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the revolutionary journey occurred in 2000, when a significant demand was transmitted from the Czech Republic historically the first direct charter flight to exoticism, it was to Thailand.
Since this year, there are direct charters with Czech tourists to warm remote countries, and this year's winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to the twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries will visit about 100,000 Czechs a year now!
Another interesting moment in this period, symbolized by our revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US visas for Czech tourists has been cancelled and thus our country has definitely been incorporated among the most excellent countries in the world.
In 2008, also the Czechs first spent more than half their vacations in abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history spent a foreign holiday, including the cost of staying in more than 15 thousand.
The valuable bunch is to find the president again, but it is threatened to be a pat
Almost five months is the Czech football without the Chairman and threatens that the successor Ivan Haška, headed by the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR), will not be known even after another extraordinary valuable crowd that will be implemented on Thursday in Nymburg.
Because there is still no agreement under which the election order will be proceeded.
Without it, it won't even begin to vote about which three candidates will be elected.
The interest in the Czech football is in Henry Richl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomasz Paclic.
The Hashk resigned the function in June and called on his colleagues to unify and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
But in the era after Hashk, the football slipped back to the spots between the two alliance chambers that can't match the common candidate.
It was fully shown on September 16, when the new president was to be elected.
The delegations of the valuable accommodation entered the National House in Prague for nothing, because the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just a way of choice.
Because there was no conformity with who has the right to vote in the crowd, in fact, whether only statutory representatives, or even the power-finished officials.
In this single point there has been partial conformity since then, which also helped the recommendation of the Institute for State and the law under which the representation is not possible on the basis of the full power.
But the disputes are still in charge of the election order.
It was too clear to the situation that the executive committee, which has already taken care of, whether proper or extraordinary, does not deal with anything else.
The view of the option has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is, how do you proceed at the 3rd round to exclude the possibility of the pat?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the provisions or find another model," one of the three Vice-Presidents of FAČR Dušan Freeboda, who represents a professional football in the association.
According to the provisions of the model designed in the third round, the candidates who will have greater percentage support in the compartment for no candidate.
Morava is allegedly willing to step forward to win a candidate who gets a higher percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech Party promotes the condition that the winner must receive at least two-third advantage in this percentage calculation.
"If it would then dismiss the sense of two previous rounds, it would completely deny a two-comparty concept," he understands the opposition of the Seaban Freedom Party, according to which it would be the best order to avoid and vote according to the valid positions.
It is quite surprisingly agreed with Tomasz Paclic, although it is estimated that the rules set by the electoral order are satisfied with all the candidates most to Pelt.
"I wish it had been voted as much as possible according to the Statute."
"To not make any nonsense as to the last valuable crowd," said the owner of Victoria Pluzen, who is running for the first time and has been determined first in his expressions in particular against Pelt.
Pelta remains an optimist.
In Nimburg, he believes that the new Chairman will be famous and believes that candidates will work together in future constructively.
"All passions will calm down the eventual process of the national team at the European championship."
"The football will be again on a happy wave, will be more willing to cooperate," means a Japanese official who has the greatest experience with the ball management of both professional and regional levels.
Raichl's more restraining.
"I hope of a deal, but unfortunately, the situation is very uncomfortable."
"It is not among the Czech and Morava people, but there are attempts to adapt the rules purposely."
"It can cause the blocking of the wave bunch to happen again."
"But I hope he wins a healthy mind," said Raichl.
There's not much time left for the agreement of all parties.
Some negotiations were allegedly to be played directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football generality will be complete in the game at all.
The aircraft specialised to travel to Podgorica, inter alia, the Vice-Presidents of Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, because of the technical infringement, did not fly from Prague in the morning and was searched for a replacement option as a part of the executive committee to be transported to the field of barage deviation.
Finally, there may be a decisive meeting at the ministerial level that may be reportedly happening in Wednesday.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Technical Affairs, Joseph Dobeš, would like to force the most powerful sports association in the country to the agreement.
There is a lot in the game: State grant, soccer credibility, as well as an accommodated bunch of CFT, which will address the new direction of Czech sports after the financial problems of the Sazaka.
He's going to fight for the President because he doesn't see a suitable candidate
If the Football Chief Pluzna Tomasz Paclic had seen a strong candidate who would meet all his ideas about the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR), he would not even report to combat the top function.
"If a quality adept exists, I fight for it and I don't go to the election."
"But in the current situation, no one has been able to find such a thing," said CTK Paclec.
In the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl, Paclík's motivation to just try to avoid Pelt, the alleged favorite of the elections, in the way to the FACR.
It also emphasizes that, in the event of his victory, he would only endure the role of the President until 2013, when a valuable bunch of funds is proper.
In the function, he would like to see a experienced and top manager who is not too connected to football.
"I've spoken to some people who would come into consideration."
"It was crazy for me when some said that at this point the Czech football didn't even want to identify."
"I would like to change this view," he said.
Paclick is now the most disturbed of Pelt's connection with the President of the Plyznja District Football Union, Roman Berbre, a man with a controversial reputation known as a powerful lobbyst with the ability to influence the vote of delegates on the valuable crowd.
It is so unacceptable for Pacliko that Pelta stands in the presidential position.
"If he wins, the current condition is reserved and nothing would move forward."
"In combination with the support of Berbra, who is an excellent merchant, it would not have done much more to football," said Paclick.
It also envisages that Pelt's name has sounded in the interrogations in the investigation of a corrupt affair, but from which Pelta came out without punishment.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring to football."
"And how we would also look in the eyes of EUFA and FIFA," said Paclick, who is already taking over his former statement that he would "sell the Pelta club if he became Chairman".
In case Paclic triumphed in a quarter election, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
He also considers another Richl candidate, whom Paclic supported before the shine wave, which ended with fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He has great powers."
"I could imagine him as the head of the representation."
"But the manager wouldn't be able to run the association."
"I also don't push my nose where I can't do it," said Paclick, who raised great attention in September by standing behind the appeal of the judges' committee to the Ludek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damk.
The pack says he'd take a trifle for the leadership of the Association.
He renounces his ability to manage private companies, and he is also headed by Plzni since last year, which celebrated the Prime League Triumph in May with its support.
"I have the strength to change something in the football environment to contribute to certain cultivation."
"To limit the impacts of some interested groups that need to affect disciplinary and appeals to the Commission, which takes place to disgusting situations," said Paclec, who does not do their antipaties, for example, to the Spartian boss Daniel Christian.
He would also consider the reinforcing of the FACR relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help he would lobby for more money from the lottery tax for political tops.
"It is one of the key things that the new president should devote."
"If there is a gambling tax, as political parties declare, I understand their arguments, but they must say where the money goes," he noted.
As an obstacle now, Paclick does not even take his connection with the Pluzzi club, as he himself claims that the FACR Chairperson should be "overside".
Pelta is connected again to Jablonce, Reichl with Prague Duklo.
"It's not perfect."
"But I can't see the point of converting my shares to someone hypocritically in the Pluzny Club and returning in a year and a half," said Paclic.
Pelta promised new FACR provisions that would exclude the election pat
Two days before a bunch of football associations, one of the candidates to President Miroslav Pelta promised that, in the event of the election, the FACR would have the new provisions that would definitely exclude disputes over the election order in the future.
The Jablonean functioner is optimist before the Thursday negotiation in Nymburca and believes that the pre-election fight will substantially reduce the eventual success of the football team today.
Pelta has promised before the lightless choice that it will focus on the representation and acquisition of finances in the event of the election.
He decided to go to the election before the last bunch, so he could use a two-month delay to defend and present his ideas of football management in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"She feels that it's the highest time for someone to lead the association," he thinks the man who is connected primarily with the Jablon club, but which has been working in Sparta and the executive committee of the union for several years.
And that's why he thinks he's got enough experience to drive the Czech football.
He is convinced that there is an eufory in the time of Ivan Hashk's government in the current election problems.
"It was unfortunately approved in the June Val Communities, which were not as perfect as they all thought."
"If the various interpretations were not accepted, we had the President since September," he warned Pelta.
He just converted the most important document of the Civil Association as a chief of delegates.
"If I become Chairman, I will take it as a personal task and willing to bear my personal responsibility if it is not succeeding."
"It's a fundamental thing we can't be without," says Pelta.
He says he's still trying not to qualify against his rivals.
He's previously aware that he can imagine collaboration with Jindrich Rajchl, who he recognizes because of his legal education, and knows well that his counterpart would be his first vice-president.
He has not attacked Thomas Paclik for a long time, who did not leave a dry thread on Pelt.
"The football moves something over a year, he's already got some success."
"His attacks, however, were independent, and many people in a way of the election campaign shocked."
"It is why a number of them now doubt his real nature," he said to the opponent's address of Pelta, who remains faithful to the pronouncements he has already announced in September.
His strongest weapons, he believes, is the knowledge of football from the lowest competitions until after representation.
It should be the explanatory football closet.
"And I would also try to end all the affairs starting with the cause of the Bohemians or the sounds of the last year's corrupt scandal."
"I would then go to the private and public sector negotiations to ensure enough money for the whole football," said a sixty-year-old Chamber candidate two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his arrival to football would not mean any personal cleaning.
"I should first get to know the full of individual employees," he pointed to Strahov, where understandable nervousness is overwhelmed from long imminence.
Despite today's catastrophic scenarios that carry out an intensive bunch, they believe that the delegates will not go to Nimburg on Thursday.
"If the only controversial point is how to vote in the third round, we can move over."
"The football needs confidence, and it only gets it by finally having his leader again," remains Pelta two days ago, perhaps, a decisive day of its functional career with optimist.
Raichl promises FACR would start working hard under it.
If the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic had been elected by the Deputy Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Because Raichl promises that, in the case of his choice, he will start working hard.
He wants to make systemic changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the cause of the Bohemians, to improve relations with EUFA and FIFA, to bring more money to football and to continue the work started by the former President Ivan Hašek.
"As the president, I would like to devote football as a whole."
"Of international contacts with EUFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance football after youth."
"But that I'm not saying that I would do everything myself," said Raichl in an interview for CTU.
"I'm a team player and I want to share competence in the executive committee so that each of the members is devoted to certain areas."
"And I'll give hard tasks to move football a mile forward in every segment."
"Man would probably not be happy because it would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Because of a critical atmosphere in football movement, he said he was thinking about not running again.
"I'm aware I'm working 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I won't have people behind me who will keep throwing sticks under my feet and questioning every step I have," he explained why he he was hesitating.
"But many people told me that I shouldn't give up, 'cause then others would give up."
"This is the trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He's also motivated by continuing the work he started with Hague.
"In those two years, there's been a big piece of work, and I don't want to throw it away."
"There are starting processes that will have sound, as long as they are in a few years, and I don't want anyone to stop them," he said with fear that if another candidate Miroslava Pelta is selected, the situation in the union could be returned until the time before Hague.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's the thing Mirek Pelta doesn't think can do."
"There are mainly people who would do football so that it would be only for those chosen."
"I can get a lot of things out of my mind, but I'm sure I'm not putting someone away."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will be well and not only those elections," said Raichl.
It also distorts the claim that he would be only the Czech President.
"Although some people are trying to say the opposite, I plan to make the maximum for Morava."
"For example, it's time to think about the second League divided into the Czech and the Sea part whose winners would go into the first league."
"The current situation would not occur when only three marine communities are in the liague, which is a problem towards young players in Morava," said Raichl.
Since the head of the Pluzny Club, Tomasz Paclic, also participated in the fight against the President, Raichl does not think to estimate his chances for the election.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as its Vice-President and sees that there are clear successes behind me," said Raichl, who considers the saving of tens of millions of crowns on inappropriate contracts, dealing with television contracts and negotiations on the lottery law.
On the contrary, it's a co-operation that the union doesn't pull for one rope.
While Pelt declares that he is "disqualified from returning to the Czech football trust", he considers the other of the rivals of Paclik as a strong candidate who has a soccer to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Plzni in that year."
"If he was chosen, he might continue with the things that Ivan Haszek launched here, and he would not significantly change his staff jobs in the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to crush it for his sake," Raichl evaluates the rivals.

When Iris Meder was presented in the last one and a half year for the discovery roads, she was not allowed to miss her trunk: her swimming.
The lying sign on the water, looking at the height of the artificially formed kupoles, swimming across the marble paths (the figures of a little naked boy, the child (wildings) who waited for her on the edge of the pool and admired the closely restauranted secession shop.
If she liked some swimming swimming, she put it in her notebook - even with remarkable details about the way the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 ploweren examined this way the historian of the architecture of Meder and now presents them in its currently published book "Badefruden (Badefrude of Shopping) ": People's Swimming Chambers in Mnich, the historic palace of flowering in Schwarzwald" "Tue core of concrete buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries led her "The journey to the most unusual bathrooms in Central Europe": Below Germany, Austria and Switzerland visited the locations in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old Germany is a real enthusiast of the pluareen culture.
With sports, it doesn't overcome much, says Meder - just in the water it's something else.
It is only anger that fans of swimming must be satisfied with blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while the racemen for health can breathe a deceptive smell of swimming forests or listen to the joyful swimming of birds in the park.
"I asked one day why the floods must be always so shining," Mrs. Meder said in Vienna.
"So I started gathering nice shops."
Water level doubles the architecture
The swimming in the sky pool and the ethric oil for sauna - the convenience factor is so big that it concerns all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, they could be flourishing with a real pace for the eyes, "Instead of the floor, there is a man in the bath water level."
"But it's transparency, on the other hand, but it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is optically doubled: high slaughter, peeked tiles, popcorn.
Low-format image link "Badefroden (Badefrode of bathing) " provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of historic oaz wellnes - but mostly the desire to jump into the blue.
Extraordinary examples have been discovered by Mrs. Meder's collector at its search in Hungary.
Beautiful medicinal bathrooms, such as 100 years old Shechenya bath in Budapest, found water with the contents of nitrogens in the original beautiful cave (the cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal bathrooms whose pools are filled with alkalic water and are located in the building of a bottle shape (Varosi Termalfürdö in Jasberna).
Beautiful view of it offers many heated floods under the wide sky in Switzerland and Austria. While a person has a curish swimming bathroom on the eyes of the whole city, the swimming pool in St. Anton can be watched in the snow covered by Arlberg - and: in the couple baths there is a window from which you can monitor the movement on the ski congressor.
Hopefully the most remarkable design of the pool expects the bathroom guests in Längenfeld: Aquapark Ötztal looks like ufo that just landed in the Alps.
From three upstairs opened panves in the winter, a couple rose up until the back of the mountain Ötztal ́tztal ́s closing into the sky.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not in every sailing room, the pool collector of Mrs. Meder smell of chlor in the chryp.
Many thermal baths are to smell cheese, in the Arpad bath in Hungarian Bekescsaba, it smells like a warm oil to the extent that a person can hardly believe that he got into the treatment baths.
The smell comes from the medicinal water with the contents of alcalyc hydrogen hydrocarbons, which is almost black and whose plants climb on the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a little special experience of wellness.
However, one place was Iris Meder, when she was looking for nice baths, disappointed: When she wanted to visit the Czech Solar and Climate Bath, she ran into a closed territory.
During 1902, the designed baths were closed by Dusan Jurkovic.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the split windows of the red-white-white secession building, she saw how much the grass rose between the tiles.
The disappearance was contrary to the magic flying room in Schwarzwald: in Palais Thermal, Bad Wilbad.
These bathrooms have already three stages of construction; a person can discover not only new Romanian elements that originate from its creation in 1844, but also the Maurean Hall in the style of Alhambra, which was connected around 1900.
Since careful modernization 1995, Palais Thermal is the favorite bathroom site of Mrs. Iris Meder, not only because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"It's already some kind of performance, connecting such a variety of construction stocks into such a beautiful complex," Mrs. Meder said.
In such a palace, diving into thermal pool is apparently a border matter.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank lets the commodity trade check
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its trade with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Joseph Ackermann has authorised a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
Then, in January, the chief of the concert wants to get the consequences out of this.
Hamburg -
For the common citizens, it is clear: 84% of the Germans consider it unacceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of the questioned are even demanding that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions come out of this trade because the problems of the poorest world are enhancing.
This is the result of the Fors survey of the Foodwatch consumer organisation.
The study is based on the report that Foodwatch presented in the mid-October.
It shows author Harald Schumann that the bets in the global commodity bureau are due to prices and banks are therefore cooperating on the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank Josef Ackermann, even though large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting the same way.
The commodity rates were originally considered to provide traders against price shifts.
Meanwhile, most experts agree that the capital market participants with the interest of high-risk trade were disconnected from the offer and demand - and the bill of the poorest profits.
Otherwise, competitors in the United States responded to the criticism of Ackermann: He promised that he would check and said that no trade "is worth not to be given a good reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to the information SPIEGEL ONLINE controls the international working group of the Foodwatch-Report.
By the end of the year, the check will be closed, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank, together with the recommendation, how it should be imposed.
At the end of January, the bank's representatives want to tell what the consequences they have.
At the end, the reduction of trade in goods or even total refusal could be reduced.
Ackermann works his help on his image.
The head of the Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time strengthened his financial sector's criticism: "The plantation on a growing food price shows particularly drastically how unreasonably banks today harm the general welfare."
Let Ackermann as the highest bank lobbysta be obliged.
"Deutsche Bank must scratch out of its portfolio all the items for which money is used for food prices," Bode declared.
"If Mr. Ackerman is hungry or a reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's view appears at first as surprised, but it is clear that the concern chief would like to leave the perfect image a few months before leaving his office.
In Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board would not go to the supervisor.
By turning away from a controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about possible losses - he should finally deal with it with his successor.
Each other would describe the investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
More than 30,000 users of the Internet have already participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, he published a Bode survey in which the Forsa Institute questioned 1001 people.
Just 11 per cent accordingly considers legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments related to food prices.
Many customers of banks would also have personal consequences if they found out that their bank is participating in such trades: each other would, as a result of the survey, describe all investments for which the money is speculating with raw material speculations.
43 per cent would warn those known to such a bank, 49 per cent indicated that they would consider exemption of their account and go to another institution.
Home of the 21st century in Vienna
Moved pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of the architecture with tops, falls and happy end: Austrian pavilon from the World Exhibition in Brussels 1958 gained prices, became a Museum in Vienna, left empty and deserted.
Now it's opened again as a exhibition house.
When it burns for the modern war architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, courageous divisions and new construction materials that are typical for faith in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilon of Karl Schwanzera for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958 is a precise and glorious example.
Schwanzer's pavilon then received Grand Prix d'Architecture for his light and prosperous steel and glass structure.
The construction is still considered a million of the current architecture.
He celebrated the architect by also building a pavilion of Austria during the next world exhibition.
With his legendary four-war BMW-Palace plus as the key carried out by the side building in Mnichov at the end of 1973, the international celebrated.
It was placed in Schweizer Garten in the Vienna Sübahnhof (South Station), reconstructed and in 1962 opened the 20th century Museum -- named "Home of the 20th century".
But the appropriate for the museum of buildings was not, neither space nor technically - the walls were missing to hang the art exhibits, no suitable climate.
However, it was used until the current art came to a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building was empty, and it was still more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz reconstructed pavilon, now brings the name "Home of the 21st century" and will be used as the Museum of Current Art in the future.
On Tuesday night there will open the Museum Belvedere, where the palace belongs, the first exhibition - a happy purpose in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Huslein-Arco, which became the new Director of the Austrian Gallery of Belvedere, was launched.
Husslein-Arco, the promoted history of art with a great career, i.e. in youth of the crosmoser, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim's museum and as the founding Director of Musea of Modern Salzburg, set up a substantial reconstruction for politicians and monuments, provided public funds and private sponsor money and set up the use.
In addition to the current art, the works of the Fritz Cup should be exhibited by the same foundation, cafeteria and bookstore should be built and the office building must be built.
Strict surveillance, low budget.
Crischanitz was then an ideal job.
Not only was he emotionally reconstructed and expanded the separation buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna and Pavilon was a "independent place" for him in which he had seen exhibitions " almost every weekend".
He knew the original project, and he also knew the problems of the building, which he lost on his generosity and lightness when he moved to Vienna and changed use.
In this reconstruction, there were much bigger problems: Building was a "catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass fasada were replaced, used by glass fibres of exhausted isolation glass and glass roofs replaced by special security glass.
The cold steel bridges were strengthened or replaced, and the azbest filled ceilings were sanctuated.
Two underground floors provided a place for new use, launched lighting channel between the building and the streets brings lighting, the entrance leads to the entrance bridge - nearly new building, but still the highest Schwanzer's pavilion.
The original input door remained preserved, the building is planted in an old anti-corround red tone.
And the movie is even the same as he used to be.
And all of that for the strict supervision of the Memorial Office and the low budget.
"It must have often been found, which is good and cheap and also liked the Memorial Office," says Krischanitz and pointed out the broken floor of the basement.
In spite of all pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and air.
He said it was difficult with a pavilion, "who came here from Brussels," said Crischanitz recently, typical "Drop-in-the- City History".
They say that such a architecture stands "ever in the wrong place" and yet he wants to "be the right self-conscious."
In this case, however, the house of the 21st century is not in an inappropriate place, because it happened a city happily coincidence: In the circle around Schweizer Garten, it is a newly designed "The City Room at the Main Station" with office and residential houses.
And perhaps another lucky coincidence: The house of the 21st century could receive support from another Crischanitz's building, because the collection of Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as they hear, has already been dealing with the city on the neighbourhood in Schweizer Garten.
The road plans a winter crisis package in millions
The road set out a crisis plan to prevent railways in the winter period.
The number of employees should be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
Deutsche Bahn issues more than 70 million euros in the winter in this year, according to the report.
The “Bild” newspapers have previously reported an appeal to the internal concert plan that it is counted by 2015 as a total of EUR 300 million investments.
He said it should be achieved by better use of trains and railway networks also under extreme air condition.
It is said that, inter alia, the number of internal and external employees of 16,000 persons were planned to remove snow on rails and accessories.
The aim should be to eliminate the architect until the start of operation and 90 per cent for the operation of the necessary shifts within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the chief of the Road Rüdiger Grube warned after meeting at the highest level with government and industry representatives against railways and delays during this winter.
In the last winter period, the road had significant problems in personal transport, as, inter alia, under difficult air conditions, there was lack of reserves.
This is how many new regional trains have been waiting for the approval of the General Railway Authority for years.
Furthermore, the delay in ICE train transport is accessible
The road has also been unsuccessful for years that ICE train repairs must probably be more frequently verified when one ICE train was at Köln's main station to destroy the repair.
Deutsche Bank pays a million penalties in the United States
Following the disturbance around Joseph Ackermann, there are new trampots in the United States: Deutsche Bank must pay millions of compensation there.
As if Deutsche Bank had not had enough problems at home, the huge in its past in the USA: the Frankfurt Institution is in one counterfeit procedure of $145 million (106 million euros) to solve disputes for the bankruptment of five large social banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling hypothetical leaves.
The NCUA financial market regulator comprises a number of large banks that have made public banks false promises to buy financial products; that risks may have decreased.
Such papers have lost significantly during the crisis on the value and have slipped banks with them into a ruin.
"We are pleased that we could address the subject without having to drag parties to court," said speaker Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank doesn't admit any guilt by compensating.
This also applies to Citigroup, which was committed to paying $20.5 million.
The NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the courtesy of both monetary institutions.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US social banks and assists in bankruptcy to protect customers' claims.
The NCUA is trying to get a compensation for billions of damage.
Now the ending comparisons are the first of their species.
The regulator also connected to other large banks and summer sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In suspicious hypothetical lists, it is called Mortgage-backed Securities.
They're based on bank loans.
When the American bulb around the real estate in 2007 cryed, it became a number of financial companies fateful.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its thought.
Even though the event happened a few years ago, he's blowing the banks in sharp wind.
Investors and supervisors have filed a number of complaints to reach the corrections or doubts.
The Federal Houseing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest appeal wave.
It points to 18 international banks that two US state financers dealing with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's property at the hygiene shops in the volume of about $200 billion were disadvantaged.
Deutsche Bank must also face FHFA's lawsuit, which is more trades in total of approximately $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The Surveillance Authority requires the frankfurt constitution to be responsible for "essential losses " without, however, specifying any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the requirements as unreasonable and declared that she wanted to defend herself.
Warren Buffett enters with 10 billion to IBM
Buffett's financial guru invests strongly in IBM IT.
He bought more than 10 billion shares since March.
A significant US investor Warren Buffett has always declared that it will not invest in IT and computers, since long-term development of companies will only be difficult to predict.
However, now he read the IBM business reports and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
Must have realized that IBM offers primarily services and acquires computer systems for IT-distribution of other companies.
The investment of Warren Buffett is considered to be a matching knight in the financial world.
As a result, IT IBM is now called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett delivered the U.S. Economic Radio station that he bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His Investmenthoring Berkshire Hathaway has become one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a 5.5 per cent share.
Buffett sagte that neither IBM knew anything about his engagement yet.
He commended the management that tried even for the economic crisis for proper profits.
"You did a great job," Buffett said to the strategy.
IBM has been betting for a long time on lucrative IT services such as the operation of the calculation centres.
More than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice and executive computers for companies.
Buffett avoided technological companies until today.
He claims to invest only in companies whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached the cargo railway, after the manufacturer of mazines or machine manufacturers.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 ownership companies also shared in a number of high-concerns like Coca-Cola or Munich Re, former Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old gentleman took over a small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built one of the most valuable businesses in the world.
Still, his way of life is modest.
He is therefore a cultural character for many investors around the world.
His almost irregular sense of money earning brought him a nickname "Oracel from Omaha" (The Miracle of Omaha).
When Buffett's investment became famous, IBM shares rose before the storm started by one percentage.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, has a total value of more than 220 billion dollars on the bureau and is treated with Apple and Microsoft as the most valuable technological companies in the world.
In Microsoft's company, so much Buffett, but he wouldn't want to come in.
The founder Bill Gates says he's his confidential friend.
Dangers are material
The Turkish media doubt the German legal state after the discovery of the Zwicka Bounce.
The newspaper even speaks of bloody ideology, which now lives again.
The killings of eight small Turkish businesses and one Greek in 2000 to 2006 had a legal extremist background.
In Turkey and within the German and Turkish population in Germany, the report responded with fear and concern.
Because for many German Turks, this returns to the scary that was long considered dead: From the burning attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there was no comparable violence with a legal extremist background.
There was still no doubt in Germany.
However, the discovered legally extremistic network reveals the scope of which the dimension cannot be observed for a long time.
"Does Renew Bloody Ideology?" Sounded the titles of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk" online.
The Sabah newspaper, in contrast, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators was to be a secret police officer of the Constitutional Protection Office and fears that the German authorities could also be involved in the right radical moor.
The Turkish community of Germany responded reasonably: she mentioned the weekend of demonstration by silence in front of Brandeburg's gate by victims of racist violence.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, along with the German and Turkish policies, mentioned the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkey Bureau Agreement.
In joyful colors, a common life was designed - as a history of success.
As a box here, the reporting of several Turkish media: "Germany's gift to 50s" is the title of the article in the Turkish online platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also, the issue of Hürriyet for Germany cannot be married so that it does not make this thought link.
"It's starting to smell," sounds the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
It emphasizes that people who paid taxes and their work had contributed to the renewal of Germany were killed.
The most critical discussion is discussed in the German Croatian Internet Forums of the police and its late success in search.
Why didn't the German authorities think much earlier to search for suspects in the right extremist circles, the authors wonder.
So many are presented at least rhetorically intensified to use drastical means: "If the activity continues to be carried out so surfacely, there will be nothing else to immigrants but their own defense and arms."
"It might be the best self-defense."
"The quality of explanation and suitableness of punishment of the whole network is very strongly dependent on internal peace in Germany," says Selen.
Which means if internal peace in Germany is threatened, they explain the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the burning area in Solingen is deeply wrapped into the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event showed to Turks living here more clearly that there is a mutual threat and the Germans that untrustedness and departure can result in right violence
However, the assassinations made Turks more apparently a sense of mutuality.
Do not repeat past errors
In Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the assassination was criticised: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who survived.
After the burning attack in Solingen, he sent a compassionate telegram to the Turkish state president, but he was allowed to represent his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech that he calculated the fees that the Turks were giving.
It's quite as if the value of a person was measured according to the height of his tax.
The current reporting of Turkish media shows once again how deep the uncertainty of many German Turks in this State's legal arrangement is.
With regard to the efforts to explicitly clarify and to evaluate legally extreme terrorism in Germany, it requires open words this time.
Scandal Bank at the Curish Lake
The most friendly bank of Europe has no place in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered for the financial crisis almost bankruptcy and from then on, from one crisis to another.
Now there's some German to compare it.
That's not what Axel Weber meant.
After his noisy departure from the leadership of the Federal Bank, it became known in July that 2013 would enter almost the same spectacular new job: the President of the Swiss UBS Administrative Council - the unexpected and lucrative step in the career.
Axel Weber was looking forward to the public, praised Switzerland for his beauty and UBS for its newly gained solidity and told friendly notes against future colleagues.
"Die UBS has reached the turnover."
"I'm looking forward to cooperating with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September, it was clear that everything would be completely different.
One UBS dealer in London surrounded all bank security systems and wasted approximately 1.7 billion euros.
The head of UBS Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland a recognised banker, had to leave.
The President of the Administrative Board of UBS is also as burned since then - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally be here?
It has already become known that the Weber bank is allowed to advise since February 2012.
And the Presidency of the Administrative Council will take over in May -- not only in 2013, as the bank communicated on Tuesday.
It'll be hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather an economy professor and emission banker, and he would certainly need time to work.
Suddenly, he will take responsibility for the bank's strategy, which has just once proved to deserve the title "Bank of the biggest scandals in Europe"
However, UBS is huge - until recently, she was the greatest managing of property in the world - and she's swimming for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, so it seems that the proud Swiss bank will not remain saved.
It started in a financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had a great reputation.
The image of a silent and solid but smart managing property combined with ambitious goals: She also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
So she managed UBS 2007 on one side with $1.6 billion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank of the world.
On the other hand, the investment bank went into the League of the biggest world banks
It made an impression.
Former banker and later long-year-old bank professor in Curych Hans Geiger tells: "I always put UBS to my students as a model of a good bank."
"How could I just be wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was for the first time obvious that something in UBS had been wrong.
In half a year, Peter Wuffli, who was still considered highly intelligent and brilliant banker.
A few months later, he knew why he left.
The Bank's investment division has lost subprime-papers and had to write down billions.
In order to keep it, she revised the UBS increase in capital of 13 billion francs.
Therefore, she found investors, however, those over whom she would have recently embarrassed the nose: the Transparency Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that the person had not even known his name.
But it was just the first hit.
In April 2008, it developed worse.
The Bank must have acknowledged new billions of losses, the President of the Governing Council, Marcel Ospel, 2006, the second best paid Switzerland Administrative Council, resigned.
In October 2008 there was a catastrophe: UBS stood in view of its mistaken investments for the financial crisis from the decline and had to be saved by the State.
Nationalbank bought from UBS for dozens of billions of troubled valuable papers, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs to a mandatory exchange bond, for which it could become a companion of the bank.
The whole Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed how dramatic it is for the small country when it has so large banks in its territory.
Finally, UBS 2007 was more than five times greater than the performance of Switzerland's economy (see picture).
"We can't save UBS once again," says Bank Expert Geiger.
The first catastrophe is connected to the second.
For several months, UBS has been capitulating in a tax dispute with America and has demonstrated its willingness to issue data of proprietary customers who, if possible, reduced taxes.
Furthermore, she agreed to pay $780 million -- as returning the unauthorized profits from these shops, including the penalty.
The UBS has learned more or less openly that it has helped to reduce taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in a competition for rich clients: a discretionary sanctuary.
After this scandal, Swiss bank secret was no longer what was before.
The resignation of the Chief of the Office and the President of the Administrative Council was followed.
And the exodus of the money of the customers.
So the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas over a few months: in investment banking due to bad speculation and in the management of property to help reduce taxes.
And just when it relaxed again, just when UBS thought it was recovered again, there comes this unfortunate business anabase: the only dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it is clear that risk management in investment banking is still unlikely.
"It is likely to be found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Jansen, economy and Finanz Professor of Finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zürich.
Also, the Finance Director of the Great German Bank is sure: "The problem of UBS is that he does not control risks."
However, it was exactly the idea of caution that Swiss bankers have gone forward long ago to become the guards of the great property of the world: no too big risks, so money security -- also the Alpine Republic has fallen down again.
The Swiss bank treasures have become a symbol for insecure reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly quality chocolate.
The UBS Centre in Curych is still suitable to the cliché of the good Swiss Private Bank - is just a little bigger.
It's a classic location already.
The Bank has its headquarters in Curish Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Curish Lake, which is reserved by the snowtops of the Swiss mountains.
Buildings here are beautiful, trade rentals belong to the highest in Europe.
The priesthoods like Tiffany's are found here among Swiss traditional trades such as Sprüngli sugar.
For centuries, Swiss banks are located here: from Nationalbank through Palast der Credit Suisse to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall enters with a heavy turning door.
Inside the walls are covered with marbles, they are standing in front of the powerful skin chairs, next to the bank's logo, a great direction towards the "serif".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suiss, but sometimes - have been pressed or betrayed, as found by the chief of a small Swiss private bank.
His name would rather not read in the newspapers, eventually closes, like all Swiss bankers, as well as with both large banks trades.
UBS may have increased too much, it finds -- especially in the investment banking, where the Anglosass has expanded.
Switzerland probably don't have anything to say about it anymore.
"And if they were, they'd adapted to the English ways long ago."
In fact, it was an English investment banking that changed the UBS, leading her to high profits at first and then a disaster: No European financial institution lost all the money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"In that Wednesday, the government coalition of a small seven-million country took place on the largest rescue action in history of his nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
When 68 billion of francs or approximately 45 billion euros approved by politicians to save from a bankruptcy standing bank.
How could that happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, you see the problem mainly in UBS size.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss largebanks joined a powerful concert.
There was a bank that has already been too large for small Switzerland -- and has grown.
However, it helped that both different banking precedents of UBS were supplemented: one rich but sleeping bank in Curich with burden in the management of property and poorer but internationally more involved.
Suddenly, the internationally-induced investment bankers came to benefit from many money that they could make a big rule.
With this increase, UBS are associated two names: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, head of the UBS and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the Administrative Council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future," said Bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, this highly intelligent, modest, who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, a man who controls the feelings around the stomach, which has been drawn up from banking science."
But Ospel said he trusted Wuffli at the end.
And Wuffli probably made the decisive mistakes at the end, "If he thought his models were reality," Geiger said.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, I guess.
It's clear: Honour prevented the decline.
UBS employees clearly remember the mattress of the heads of workers, on which the concrete chief Wuffli repeated the same password: Strite Goldman Sachs from the throne down.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank of the world.
She introduced "League Tables", a series that documents the success of the banks at the time.
In it, UBS tried to place it completely upstairs.
She's done a few steps.
In the devision trade and shares, she participated games completely upstairs.
However, the entrusted advisers emphasize one weakness: in international interest trade, in the language of the bankers "Fixed Income", probably there is a large distance behind the biggest banks.
UBS probably has spaces in American hypothetical products.
In order to close this space, UBS decided to adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hungary after growth, invested both the bank and its founded risk fund in the US Investments Subprime.
It developed into a powerful machine that converted valuable papers to American hypothetical loans and transferred further, while he also kept risks.
Also when the other banks have long been looking for an exit.
"It's still in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, UBS was buying there," said the Bank Expert Geiger.
How big the eufory is, so deeply falling.
One manager had to go to the other when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than it was thought.
The UBS position has become a catapulting seat and will be houpled by today.
Now who runs a large bank, he has almost unsustainable work.
He must find a strategy for the bank that all close business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea: End with investment banking, concentration on property management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go this far (always).
But investment banking is going to kill strongly, so clear now.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present the world with its future strategy.

Intelligent gates are expanded in cities
In many places, the owls are treated as "probling birds": But these highly intelligent animals cannot be thrown out for a long time, say experts.
Some love them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Ravens belong to the image of the city for centuries, but in some communities, the complaints of the inhabitants of uncleanness and noise caused by animals.
But it's not against "problém birds" yet in surveillance.
The garments of the field may not be released from the cities, the experts declared on the first symposium of crowns in Eastern African Leer.
That is where experts from the entire community consulted on possible exits.
They're looking for alternatives in cities
Nature protectors also carried out the problems of the cities from exode of particularly protected rabbits in the field: The use of agricultural chemistry at a growing extent destroys traditional areas for life.
The persecution, the growing plant, and the clipping of typical trees for bird nest, make life difficult.
The crows are protected.
The large colonies with more than 600 nest couples are among others in the Westfall Soest, northwestern, including in Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Brem and Leer.
There the 2005 controversial project of mass killing crows in the rural district had a negative title.
Critics have marked the trap of animals into bird traps and killing the stick especially brutal.
"Normal execution, scary, nothing brings," so many urbanist and landlord Werner Klöver found out of Leer.
The removal of nests by scratching water or dropping trees has often undesirable consequences, also said Manfred Kaiser from Lahru in Badensk-Württembersk.
"The animals retreat, the large colonies stick and divide to other places."
Scaring is thoughtful only as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out of here."
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of the cities can be resolved was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
The combination of expelling animals from sensitive housing areas and attracting them to sit in other places.
"Information table instead of chain drinks" promoted a psychologist and ethnolog Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different treatment of animals: "One urination in the face can eventually be the best to stop with self-consciousness."
Mrs. Jürgens cooperated in Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg's scientific return to the path to which the information tables provide lessons about life of a highly intelligent Polish Raven.
They said the project was already accepted by tourists.
Also at the criticism of the noise caused by the bird, Mrs. Jürgens had her own opinion: "This is every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
Intelligence and animal skill are legendary: The Hawaran fields use not only a help to reach a pample, but even as a help to make their tool.
Students from the University of Cambridge recently tested behavior on four field crowns, how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the stones have to bring down the structure so that they can get to the larva of the mole.
Without a great training, they recognized the size and shape of the stone must have to cause a collapse of the plot.
In the second attempt, the worms had to solve a more twisted problem.
In the vertically built war, researchers placed a small powder with a liquor mola.
The birds couldn't reach their captivity.
Of course, researchers put their pieces of wire in there.
Of them, she formed all four animals of a hook, which she used as a hook to hunt out of a tube for a holder.
Three of the four Polish Ravens even succeeded with a sequence.

Personal massacre
Emotionally strong new book Peter Englund entitled Beauty and mourning: The Confidential History of World War I (The Beauty and the Sadness: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with such a long list of appearing figures when your head gets out of it.
One advice about how to behave at that time: Take this page out carefully and make a bookmark.
Because you will be very well acquainted with all the people in Mr. Englunda's romantic story and this list will serve you as a navigation - as a lighter - in times when you will feel confused and lost in different situations as well as men and women in the story.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and a journalist.
He is also a new district at the Swedish Academy, which grants the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite delicately, as an antihistoric work.
It contains several very famous names, important contracts or famous battles, but it is almost missing the Ambassadors, the energy journalists and the debate on tactics and equipment.
It's not even a book about what happened, it explains the author, rather, "the book of what it was like." It talks mainly about "sensitions, impressions, experiences, and moods."
"Beauty and mourning" combines war experiences within 20 more dozen men and women, on both sides of barricade, from students and botanics to hills, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become war captives, lose ends, mad or die.
Their lives are floating like the flames of candles burned in the church - news are joined in the fate compound, while others are extinguished.
The book of Mr. Englund is different from classical historical romans.
It edits the idea that the first world war was just about horrible fighting in the West Front.
"Beauty and mourning" extensively examines other places where war drama was held: Alpa, Balkan, East Front, Mezopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are dealing with the problems of falling down by the nest bees, having to spend Christmas in the shadow of pyramid or fighting with the presence of much tse-tse.
It's almost from the beginning about a very touching reading.
The war will absorb the lives of people like some natural disaster, like the hurricane of Katrina smelling a fire dust.
When a gunfire starts from the shops, and you're a woman who's home with your children, will you run away or stay?
Who's actually coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on, even why the whole war was unfolded.
"Vacuum arising from the lack of facts," Mr. Englund observed, "has been filled with arguments, presumptions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and fams."
"Beauty and mourning" watches the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young navy serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are taken from biography, letters, and other already published materials.
The descriptions of their lives may sound terrifyingly and boundaries, but through the inclusion of small moments and details, they are completely alive and confidential.
Many of them discuss suffering and dealing with him.
In the story of the German student, the author says, "Pleases, all over the places."
"Coffee substitute, imitation of aluminium, rubber imitation, paper ties, wooden buttons."
He goes further and describes the substitutes of food in Germany.
It is mentioned as "mass made of lissed rice cooked in cooked fat (and supplemented with a fake bone from wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried potatoes, wooden shoes."
It recalls that there were "837 registered substitutes of meat in the production of peppers and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
One American in itself finds internal grounds for wildlife and brutality, namely war, saying, "You will finally understand that this is human nature, not sitting in comfortable chairs with cigarette and whiskey, evening newspapers or good books and pretend that this mask represents civilization and that there is no barbar behind that scratched in the inner."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that with the highest probability, he will soon die, and no one will notice it, but to grieve.
"When a person finally agrees with sacrifice, he would at least expect it to happen in front of the grateful audience," he says.
Instead, he feels like a "convict who's secretly hanging."
Other notes relate to the departure of old Europe and the occurrence of new horrors.
"Conflict has become more economic competition and competitive fight," says Mr. Englund, "the war between factories."
He caught what he said "new kind of beast of the coming century: an excellent and ideologically sworn mass killer in the clothing cut by peace that he does his bloodshed without getting up from the table."
People behave completely unexpectedly, the cruelty is settled with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some sexual illness to avoid the service on the front.
"The best example of this behaviour was the dealing with a gonocco gnost that soldiers shopped and scattered with genitalia in the hope of ending in the hospital," he says.
"The most desperate ones put him in their eyes, which often blinded them for the rest of their life."
In this Swedish translation from Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's wire is swift, but it's not an excellent point, which is perfectly suitable for his human theme.
In the tens of small outputs, the way the war "was exposed to totally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders are forced to fight.
The best books about the first world war mostly worked with signs, such as "First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell or Romans like "In the West Front of Peace" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most exciting ending that the popular scientific literature does not have.
But I won't give it to you.
But you will feel like the author would suddenly jump out of the book, extract a page from your hero list of heroes from your hand and burn it.
After the previous error this time a precisely scheduled case
She took part in hundreds of police officers, some in the helmets used in street disturbances.
The Monday night on Tuesday was selected because the park Zuccotti should be almost empty at that time.
No one knew about the action except a few highly built officers.
The police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence emphasized how many problems the police department had to face during surgery.
They were not allowed to repeat cases of the past weeks when pepper sprays were used against demonstrators, which broken the rules of division, and also the wave of sympathy to the public was transmitted to the squatter side.
This is why the police operation aimed at cleaning Zuccotti from demonstrators was started until two weeks after careful planning and exercise.
The leaders have been inspired by operations carried out in other cities.
The massive exercise in the case of conduct in crisis situations took place in Randalls Island, which was preparing for action in Zuccotti Park.
The leaders have strengthened the so-called training for disturbance -- anti-terrorism measures includeing a rapid movement of a large number of police officers -- focusing on the city part of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River River.
The orders to move to the park have literally come to "for the last moment" someone who originally had been explained to the act only as "training".
"I know a few police officers who were also invited to this action, and no one definitely told them that they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person who spoke only if he remained anonymous.
"The fact that they were going to Zuccotti Park, they only knew the highest position of the members of the department."
One of the reasons for secreting was the lesson that the city had already received.
On October 14, the city's representatives planned to clean up the park, but then they resigned from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard of it, they enrolled them before the operation started in the park for hundreds.
Tuesday's actions were attended by police officers from various units, including intervention groups from around - dozens of policemen who are commonly used to strengthen quarters with a higher level of criminality.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day he was coming to the park and leaving a lot of people again, so one hour at night was the perfect time to start the action.
"It was suitable to do when it will be at least people in the park," he said.
Before the units arrived, Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge Bridge Bridge, car cars of emergency units with circuit lamps and amplions.
The lights and recorded reports of the amplions frightened many demonstrators.
When members of the regular units entered the park in their blue winds, many demonstrators packed their things and left.
The police claim that until 1:45 a.m. she didn't touch the only tent, so she wanted to give the demonstrators time to pack things.
Other police teams were seen as they gathered on the edge of the park so they could get into it if there was a need for arrest.
The reporters were forced to leave the park.
The chief speaker of the police department Paul J. Browne claimed that it was for their safety.
Many journalists, however, feel that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing their units in action, and also some police treated them rudely.
Mr. Browne claimed that television cars on Church Street could be recorded without problems along the west border of the park.
The police went to the Western direction, and the density of personal protesting things, including luggage and igeliti bags full of clothes, had exploded by teams from the hygiene department that immediately buried everything left in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were pulled out of the park. Documentary image materials appeared a moment later on the Internet.
The most intimate group of demonstrators stood near the kitchen in their camp, near the center of the park.
Some of them have created a surgery, and the police started their methodical arrest.
About ten people in the center of the camp have tied each other.
And two people were tied to the tree, Mr. Kelly said.
The members of the emergency services were called to cut the locks.
Until 3:30 a.m. there was no arrest in the park, Mr. Kelly announced.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said that about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests took place because of "organisation of eruptions and resistance at arrest," he explained.
Joseph J. Esposito, commander of the police department, was the highest built uniform officer in the department.
The operation was also attended personally by Phil T. Pulaski, detective commander.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he had not shared with the management of the operation," said Mr. Browne.
The second cops were waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between the streets of Liberty and Cedar Street, in case it was necessary to call her.
The street of Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and the street Pine Street, a block south of the park, were raised.
From these places, the police developed a protective belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
In one place, police officers were observed, many of whom were equipped with shields, as they push people beyond this border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The most wildest night events went south of the park.
About five o'clock in the morning, a demonstrator was seen south of Pine Street, jumping on the police car cap, and a few others who released the air from the police supply tyres.
In one moment, a piece of slip came out of the crowd.
At the end of the surgery, a cop and one protestant were hospitalized.
The Committee's Association of Assistant Workers will sue the city for release
The committees representing hundreds of school assistants who have lost their work last month are planning to sue the city in the middle. They claim that release was not necessary and that it was also discrimination, due to the undue impact on schools visiting poor students.
The Court of Justice is probably the last option left to the Committees in District Council 37 in their efforts to reverse the release decision.
On October 7th, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees who belonged to the worst paid employees of the city. They described their release as the remuneration of the city for the last spring of having failed to access the healthcare fund to the workloads that the city wanted to stick a hole in the budget.
The city's representatives have categorically rejected this charge.
At the meeting of the City Council last month, the Minister of Education Dennis M. Walcott said the release was part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the Council immediately contradicted that none of the budget had been specifically spoken of the release of subsidiary workers.
The representatives of the city part of the District Council 37 announced that they have already completed the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue him. In the Wednesday, they will call on a press conference, where they will formally announce the suit at the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education will be accused, while the defendant will be eight released employees, of whom all are African Americans or Spanish, as well as most of the other assistants who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a speaker of the city's legal department, said that the city had not yet seen a complaint, so it would not be made public.
According to the proposal for a complaint that was successful in New York Times, the committees focused on the quantities released in poor parts of the city to support their claims for injustice, because they believe that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have long been rejected by sufficient funding.
They point out that while schools in Staten Island were not invoked at all, and in Upper East Side only at least, in Brooklyn, part of District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants were lost and in parts of District 8 and 9 were released even 46 assistants in South Bronx.
Recalls that the public school 36 in Harlem lost the job of five of eight assistants, although it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The complaint says, "It's not a neighborhood full of motion parents who can obtain funds to compensate the deficit in the budget."
The budget of the Public School 36 was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year and the school also lost money when the city changed the way the bonus finances were calculated for each poor student reported.
In addition, the committees argue that high school directors could be confused by the way a document authorising the release of parents' coordinators was written.
The document used the word “excess” to describe the action, although this word is used much more often to describe the teacher's movement from the school's paylist to the database of available workers whose wages are paid by the central authority.
"Six six parents' coordinators were released," states the complaint proposal, "and not only moved to the database to the position of available workers."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept the situation agreement in Libya
Finally, the Republicans and Democrats in the Congress seem to agree on something about the rebellion in Libya.
However, before this happened, the revolution had to succeed, a long-term ruling dictator Muammar Kaddafi must have been captured and killed and participated in United States units.
On Tuesday, the Commission will decide on the expressions supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCaine (Aris.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which the Libyans should congratulate their successful rebellion and the American units for their "stabilities".
"We want to appreciate the courage of Libya's people who started restructuring their country," Kerry said.
"Both parties of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
These sentences may seem innocent, but no debate on Libya has been easy until now.
During the summer, the lawmakers of both parties continued to argue between themselves and the White House on the change of a series of declarations to approval or the refusal of the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution permitting limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the Parliament because of the different views of both political parties, so it was never voted in the Senate.
However, the same day when the proposal was rejected in the Assembly, the Chamber also rejected measures that would stop the financing of American operations in Libya.
By this, the US mission in Libya was literally in the legislative cleaning room - Congress criticised the way President Obama managed, but his members did not seem to be so irritating to stop supporting him in his initiation.
The hesitation of the convention event eventually took place.
The rebels won Tripolis in August and was killed by Kaddafi in October 20th.
The mission of Nato officially ended on October 31st.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission for International Relations in its statement "congratulates Libya's people for their immense courage and remarkable nature that they have earned to free their people" and "approve men and women of the United States' armed forces and their allies who have joined the Libyan population's operation for extraordinary courage and professionality."
The statement also confirms the national interest of the United States in successful and unreversed transition to democracy in Libya.
Will the Commission receive a new proposal full of support for international relations, or will the legislators be divided into two halfs again, as was the approval of the June proposal?
Against the last version, Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indus), the chief representative of the Republican Party in the Commission.
Lugar's speaker said on Monday that he had not seen the final version of the new proposal yet.
In the Parliament this week, a supplement to the Constitution will be voted, which requires a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first addition to the Constitution relating to the budget or other theme that the entire Assembly or the Senate will vote.
Other legislators have not yet been able to push their proposals to vote for themselves.
Goodlatt's proposal is only one of 68 supplements to the Constitution, which were presented and touched in the Congress, wide scales of various topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to the Parliament and to the Senate - and others are only a small exchange of others.
Only in the House can be found at least 15 versions of the supplement on a balanced budget and another bunch that would like to "regulate federal expenditure".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their advocates -- especially the starting Republicans who want to improve their reputation -- can praise their "authorism".
The estimate for the regulation of the budget approved in August requires that the Supplement concerning the balanced budget be voted by the Charter and the Senate.
In March 58 Senators voted in favour of an unbalanced declaration to support the creation of such an additive.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss the limitations of the periods in which members of the Congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods to be president.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a number of supplements that would, in addition, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The continuous proposal remains a supplement that prohibits the marriage of couples of the same sex and the supplement prohibiting the burning of the state flag.
Some legislators also want to allow the abolition of federal laws if two thirds of the states are against them.
Although members of the Congress appear to be very active in the design of various additives, they do not seem to be significantly disturbing from the average comparison with previous years.
In 111. The Congress offered 77 supplements, while in 100, 66 was offered.
Their activities even fade in comparison with the early 1990 ’ s, where, according to the statistics of the Senate library, members offered more than 150 supplements every two years.
But they were not far more successful than current politicians.
The latest supplement that was added - the 27th supplement - was ratified in 1992, however, was actually designed by the Congress in 1789.
"Back but not defeated," says Gifford in her first television interview from the shooting.
Ten months after she was injured by the shooter at a public meeting with the voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Aris.) appeared on the state TV on Monday night, she sang along with the melody from the Shirway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and announced that more than returning to Congress was worth her healing.
Giffords appeared in the "20/20" series at the ABC News station with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that the creation of a sentence still causes her problems and needed help in walking.
The whole series documented her difficult reconvalescent, which was necessary for the injury caused by a bullet that hit her skull ahead, broke through the left half of her brain and came out of her head.
Three months ago, she suddenly returned to the House to triumphly attend the vote on the debt ceiling.
During her first television interview from January shooting, during which six people were killed and 13 others were injured, Giffords smiled, sang and singing -- and she described her recovery as "though."
When Sawyer asked her how she feels, she answered the eleven-year-old Giffords, "That's pretty good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly's astronaut, was part of the watch special of the series "20/20", which was forwarded at the evening of the publication of the new book of this couple, entitled "Gabby: Courage and Hope Story".
The special has been watching the whole reconvalescent Gifford since the 8th January shot.
In the videos that Kelly filmed during the first week, it is seen by Giffords in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar over the forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can't do more than just raise one or two fingers.
A few months later, Giffords was caught sitting in a wheel chair and a therapist teaches her how to perform simple activities.
Swimming with the head.
Pull the lips.
And then, her first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords said another word - "toast", when she demanded changes in her breakfast.
Videos emitted by the ABC station show that the difficult role for the recovery of Giffords played in music: Congressmanka is singing them together with a therapist on a song "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" from Cindy Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During the interview with Gifford, who spends two hours a day of therapy, Sawyer told her that she didn't remember anything from the day of the shooting.
Her husband said that Gifford had read the newspaper articles about shooting until 12 March, when he first asked who she was the six of her who was killed in the incident.
The suspect Jared Lee Loughner is detained in a prison in Missouri, where he is waiting for a trial under the influence of violent drugs.
"A lot of people died," Giffords Sawyer said.
"Awful, horrible, horrible."
Kelly Sawyer said that at one point his wife said during the reconvalescence, "I lost."
"So I told her right away, Gabby, you didn't lose," described Kelly.
"You only got a load.
But you can do it, you get together and you'll come back even stronger than ever before."
Military units meet more compassion than respect
This event was a Wall Street gallacher who delivered millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who have no roof over their head.
Kid Rock sang a ballade of power, frustration and loss.
There were hundreds of soldiers, sailors, aircraft and marines around him.
The gloriously dressed crowd rose up and thrilled.
"Mans and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized spring benefits.
The festival evening also attended the chairman of the Chairman Committee of Heads of the Heads of the Staff, including Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of military units a little differently.
"All were presented as orphans," the officer in e-mail wrote.
I'm sure the organizers thought that well.
I know it is.
But what I saw was not respect.
Such totally opposite impressions only illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and the often measured, sometimes celebrating the American public.
The army is in the shore by praise for its victims.
But this praise is worth something, they say soldiers.
The public acts more and more like she regrets the individual in the uniform.
"We are not at all victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the units in Iraq and soon left Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us in a role of unhappy souls."
This theme is very sensitive to military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or to corrupt relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that had to face was much worse from the returning units from Vietnam.
As a result, most of the words of regret are expressed in silence and private between war veterans.
When two sons of the pensioned Colonel Mark Cancian returned from the battles where they served as members of the Marine Marine, their father warned them that people outside the army would look at them from two corners.
Some will feel respect and awesome because they defeated the enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
Others, however, will swing the head if "beside the surface is not covered by a wicked, violent veteran," said Cancian, who participated in the fights in Iraq and took place in Washington in the government after return.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some people who were doing interviews with him were unlikely to suggest whether he could resist the stress associated with work in Washington so soon after returning to the fight.
"When you talk about your service, you must count on negative reactions," the Cancian taught his sons.
The concern of the army is partially a source of American indifference to wars.
The achievements in the battlefield are only a few of the country's recognition that has little awareness about its own army and in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan finds little of its own benefit.
"As a nation, we no longer respect army heroism as usual during the second world war," General Lieutenant David Barno, who commanded US units in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition of politicians and the public focuses primarily on the suffering of men in the weapons.
The soldiers are awarded for the number of actions they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost, or for the scope of their injuries.
The army faces a growing pressure to strike hard against rape
This week it decides whether the trial of 28 women and men against the army will be initiated because of alleged inactivity in the event of rape.
If not, they are ready to file a complaint by hundreds of other proposals.
The soldier of the first class, Elizabeth Lyman, was reportedly raped by her colleague from the army, 25 years old, and she was pregnant in 11 weeks.
It happened in October 2008 and she was headed to a casar on the air base of Miramar north of San Diego. After dinner with her friend, she met her male colleague bearing a 12-beer box.
He asked her if she could join her, so she could drink a little at her room.
"I've got a warning light in my head," Lyman described.
But the Texasan, who was born, completely ignored her objection.
I thought, "No, he's 19."
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listen to my instincts."
He claims that only a few minutes after they entered her room, the man went to her, threw her into bed and raped her.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other existing or former members of the army will wait for a verdict of hearing that could have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be about whether the charges against the former defence minister Robert Gates and his precedent, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought before trial.
The charges indicate that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to fight the spread of rape in the army, which is in contrast with the constitutional rights of soldiers.
In February, however, the charge was filed by the Washington Lawyer Susan Burke and the complainant had 17 members at the time. During the next months, their number increased to 28 - 25 women and three men who all claimed that they were raped or otherwise sexually attacked by their colleagues in the army and that the army had failed to investigate, punish them, and any persecution of justice.
Burke claims he's going after his neck to the highest constructed army commanders, because the problem begins just with them.
"The Army is a direct system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in position that they can avoid trying to take measures against such acts?
Burke also claims that since February, she has contacted at least 400 survivors, many of which could become part of the other complaints filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than to collect all the charges in this case - she put all eggs into one basket, as she says, - she will file complaints in more different cases, if it is necessary to prevent pressure.
The defence team is headed by the State Representative of the United States, Neil MacBride, who, together with his colleagues, made an incentive to reject the case.
The judicial documents obtained by Newsweek are detailed in the defence strategy - in principle, the current or former soldiers cannot sue the army for injuries that they have suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to Regulation 1950 of the Supreme Court of Justice called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries suffered by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injury concerns the military service of the defendants," the document states.
The Ministry of Defence refused to express the matter.
However, things have changed since the 1950 ’ s.
Although women may still not officially serve in battle, it is only wording: in modern wars only hard to find a clear front line.
In wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the teams of female soldiers played an increasing role, especially in the area of communication with civil women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female gender soldiers fell between these wars -- two thirds of them directly in battle.
It's time for modernization in the army, explains Burke.
She's not alone in her struggle, but she's dealing with three other legal representatives.
At Yale's legal school, visitors of the veteranian seminar on legal services are preparing for the four major military academy for alleged development of the atmosphere supporting hatred to women.
Regardless of this, the non-profit organisation of American Vietnamese veterans collects grounds for its suit against the army. This suit focuses on the diagnosis of "personal distortions", which was reportedly identified in victims of rape to have a cause for their release - according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati, belonging to the group of warriors for human rights Service Women's Action Network, it is an entirely common practice.
In December, her group filed a proposal for a complaint against the State organisation for negotiations with veterans accused of discriminatory practices that should have occurred in the processing of requests for assistance by persons who claimed that they were sexually attacked in the service.
The nine separate proposals submitted by the group of Senators and messengers from both political parties and proposed a number of corrective measures in the Congress.
According to the Ministry of Defence's Prevention and Resolution Office, 3 158 sexual attacks were reported in 2010.
This type of attacks, however, remains not reported in most cases, and according to its own estimates, the number corresponds to approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated number of 19.000 incidents that occurred in that year.
The report issued in March also addresses the rate of criminal prosecution of suspects: 20 per cent of the cases reported in the army, which is half against the civil justice system in 2010.
Prosecutors in the case of Deputy Burke describe the attacks only as the first of the whole series of traumas.
For example, the soldier of the first class of Lyman announced the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after it was expected.
During the night, she said, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape 11 times to different members of the police, doctors and commanders.
All the examinations necessary to determine rape and the blood of the attacker was found in her bed - from the wound she made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman's hearing was graduated before the court, during which her questions were raised regarding whether she loved her friend on the day of attack.
Six people were called to testify as a witness of the reputation for a alleged perpetrator who was finally released.
"I remember the day the sentence was sentenced," says Lyman.
"I felt like I was right there at the place of birth -- I ran out of the courtroom with a scream."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember that I said to my commander, "It wasn't his judgment, he was mine."
The Lymans ordered to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed the disorder of personality, named it a disadvantaged service.
In January 2010, she was released from the army without honour and therefore without the right to service.
Whether the case of Lyman and other prosecutors moves to another stage or not, it's a long run, says John Turley, a professor of law at the Legal University of George Washington.
Of course, he notes, "From my perspective, they should be able to move into other stages of debate."
However, among them and the verdict stands a doctrine that was criticised since the first time the light of the world was seen.
I'm a lifelong criticist of the doctrine of Feres Doctrine.
The army has been behind for decades, because their obligations do not sustain the same level of motivating initiatives and disturbing funds.
He adds, "The chances are hard against them... but it's important for them to try it."
A change only happens when good people will be willing to fight.
If it is not decided in their favour in the hearing, Burkevoa, the defendant's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other persons prepared to file a complaint and begin to work on other causes relating to this subject.
"We will not stop the army in this issue fighting where there is no reform," he says.
Or until we die, according to what comes sooner.
The walls have eyes: How scientists study you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became a new face of right extremism in Europe, he was only another young man who presented his anti-employment opinions on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the June murderous anger, after which he remained in Norway 77 dead, attended his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could have acted alone, he was definitely not lonely in the cyberspace: he spent a lot of time in the computer preparation, chatting with some millions of nationalists supporting the right groups on the social network sites.
After this year’s tragedy, scientists want to know more about these people.
But how can we find them?
Easy - just go to Facebook.
"We realized that getting them is not really so hard," says Jamie Bartlett, the chief author of the recent report of the British Research Team that deals with the European Digital Populism.
The personal information stock on Facebook is so extensive, says Bartlett, that the scientists were just enough to use the website advertisement, and thus, with absolute precision, they identified the searched demographic group -- something that marketing workers have done for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe found half a million fans of the right groups, focusing on them and sending them advertisements, but instead of inviting them into a new group or offering them some diet products, they called for a questionnaire with questions about the level of their education, their relationship with violence and optimism in view of their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
"It's a completely new way to do research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: the on-line advancement of the right groups are all over the world young men who entail a growing rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, "the ones who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind the computer screen."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one of the examples of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, healthcare scientists and political researchers use these sites to study everything, from health problems to social trends hiding status updates, wall contributions and pressed buttons "I like them".
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them will provide three different daily data, which literally makes this social network "information supernova", which stands behind the development of many new research. The number of academic work in which the Facebook word appears, has increased against the state five years ago to almost 800%.
For some scientists, Facebook's magic is giving them a chance to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"When you wanted to conduct an examination between the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get into a site where they would never let you go," said Bartlett.
"It's all off the Facebook -- you're just going straight to them."
Others argue that the site can offer a way to identify the social and health problem and avoid them.
In a recent study, Dr. Megan Moren of Wisconsin University, the research team found that the university students who discussed their drunken performances on Facebook were much more threatened by alcoholism than students who silenced this subject.
Morenov suggests that students of the site monitor and offer help to a student who publishs too many drunken statuss.
"The problem cannot be resolved unless you can diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, a co-autor of Dr. Moren and Director of the Health Centre for Behaviour, and the development of children at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We found a way to identify the threatened children that we wouldn't have the chance to discover otherwise."
Facebook himself constantly pronounces the data of his users.
The information team has developed statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, election participation in 2010 and the coefficient of the nation's satisfaction (in particular with the use of information they had access - the website has long claimed that the website should have its information treasure access to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching whether they like it or not - in exchange for the possibility to play Scrabble with a friend that is thousands of miles away, the site needs to provide your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of the research they don't even know?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect offline data. However, online data are accessible to everyone.
"I think most users didn't even think that scientists could look into their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist in London Knowledge Lab, about the 2006 study he conducted with the use of public Facebook walls of his students.
"If it was about them, they took it so that the information was between them and their friends."
Then it is also to consider the question of methodology.
Even when researching off-line, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There is no way to verify how much information on the profile and contributions to the wall are true.
"What do you say on Facebook and what you're doing outside Facebook, these are two completely different things," explains Selwyn.
That's why Selvin, who has spent research on new technologies for years, thinks that the pencil and recorder continue to remain the best possible tool that can be used in research.
"When you go to the real world and talk to real people, it's something that can't be replaced," he says.
"Communical research should be about society and social activities -- and a hell of a lot of social activities are still offline."
Anders Behring Breivik is participating in his first public judicial receipt
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to launch two attacks, during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, during his first public hearing in Oslo, described himself as a warrior of rebellion.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and among the Norwegian templarian knights," he declared before the court where 500 people gathered.
"I object to the court because the mandate has given you an organization supporting the ideology of hatred and supporting multiculturalism."
"I recognise my actions, but I don't admit any guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivika interrupted it during this monologist because "he didn't want to give Breivik an opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could report his opinions."
For the same reason he rejected Breivik, who brought a ready talk to him, to allow at the end of the hearing to contact his relatives with his victims.
Nesheim also commanded the police to keep Breivika in custody for another 12 weeks, banned any contact with the media for four minutes and announced that the authorities will have complete control over all his visits and all correspondence over the period of eight weeks.
The hearing attended about 30 family victims and survivors.
Some came in hope that they would be able to look Breivik in the eyes, others to make sure that he was held firmly under the lock.
They all participated to move the case to a rapid conclusion.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," the commentator said to the NRK one of the survivors' attacks.
"It was nothing pleasant, but I can say for myself that after I saw and heard the suspect, I mentally moved a little further."
Breivik, in the dark suit and the blue tie, remained calm and professional all the time hearing. At arrival and departure to the building without trouble with the view of present journalists and survivors in the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre idea that he was part of the bigger motion of resistance, the judge said he was not crazy, and noted that there was no proof that he had a co-complice.
For someone it may be a comfort that the 22 June attacks seem to be the work of the only extremist and not a group of radicals.
This, however, does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish she could look like a creature, but it's not," said a relative of one of the victims.
"If I did, it would be much easier."
7 Lessons from a lost conversation with Steve Jobs in the movie I'm heading to the movie this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5th, the views of people who compared him to Henry Ford began to appear and chose him as his genius the Greatest Modern Inventor.
On the recent regenerated Jobs interview, which was made for a special film to go to movies this week, all Apple's fans will be the fact that his creative mind fully understood business processes and work flows behind its products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer and a self-afficient member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a man who put every smallness into the smallest details - believed that many businessmen suffer "the idea that a really great idea is from 90 percent of their work... [but] between an excellent idea and an excellent product is still a long way of work."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show Triumf of computer crazys who discussed the light of personal computers. During the film, he took a unique, more than an hourly interview.
At that time, Jobs had been forced to leave Apple for ten years, and had full hands to work with his new NeXT computer company, and was impatient to see how wide public would accept the Internet.
In the television show, only a short part of the whole Cringely conversation was used, and the original copys of the interview traced that they were lost during transportation.
However, shortly after Jobs’ death, VHS copies were found in the director’s garage.
This material, mildly cut, forms the base of the 68-minute image of Steve Jobs: The lost interview that heads into the selected movies this Wednesday and Thursday.
To someone who has known his insensibilities to provide longer interviews, Jobs here acts surprisingly excitedly that he can talk about his technological philosophy and trade strategies.
And it also appears to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when it is to see Jobs’ answers perfectly thinking to be the most precise and precise.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism is on the surface, when he acts impatiently and drives him to get to more important problems and topics.
The conversation was recorded before Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, and it appears to be scaryly prophetic thoughts when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and wrong, offering his own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read Jobs' after-death assessments of his career, but on Jobs, who we see here as a thirsty dreamer in the flower of his genius, is something raw and inspiring.
He's got his own vision here of how things might and should look.
Not long ago, and after he said his thoughts, he also began to introduce them into practice.
Quick summary of seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth a note:
How he learned how to manage the company:
"In the years of business, I've always asked, "Why are you doing this?" and the answer was always the same: "Well, that's just how you do it."
Nobody knows why he does what he does, never think about business things.
I found out.
Jobs continues by declaring his efforts to simplify accounting in Apple.
He was totally confused by the way the cost was recorded - often started with the "standard costs", they could only think about their height. At that time he decided to go his own way - developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that trade costs could be determined during a moment.
How he did the pope's barn:
Jobs remembers the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allows people to efficiently break into the phone company and call freely anywhere in the world.
The device has been written in the past, but Jobs’ enthusiasm is literally infectious when he describes the Blue Box as a tool of power.
It tells us how they tested the equipment with Wozniak using a paid phone and during the call they were allowed to reconnect from one AT&T network to another while using as many satellites as possible.
"We've screamed around the world at least half a dozen times like this, so when we screamed in a paid phone, it ringed a minute later from the second phone at the door," Jobs laughs.
"We were young and we found out that we can build up a thing that can drive infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world."
We made a little thing that managed to control a much bigger giant -- it was an incredible experience, and I think without it, Apple would never come up.
Jobs continues with a description of a joke that they almost reached to the end with Wozniak. By means of the Blue box in the middle of the night, they called to the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the pope, making the best to be Henry Kissinger.
They were gradually invited to speak to an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before they woke up the pope itself, the two of the members of the Catholic Church were embarrassed.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old and he was looking for replacement parts so he could build a kmitometer, he found a number on Bill Hewlett's phone list and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had secured summer brigade in Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I've ever met at the time, and it formed my view of what it really is and how to treat his employees."
Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited the company research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw the "first desk computer ever made".
He was big as a trunk, he had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him immediately.
When I was a teenager at the HP, I went higher and higher, I screwed around that computer and started writing programs for him.
How innovation invents:
In several places, Jobs talks about how they invent new products in the run.
At the beginning of his career, when he turned out to sell a few boards with general connections, one customer asked him to build up the entire computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days during which he had to invent, mount and add finished devices.
When he was later in Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in the development of the computer mouse:
"I remember how wildly we argued... we screamed at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost 300 USD] until it stopped entertaining me, I went out and found a designer."
90 days later, we could make a perfectly reliable mouse for 15 USD.
How the big company gets breathing:
A long time before he led the resurrection of Apple, Jobs predicted that many industrial leaders in his vision would screw up and lose their market share.
"Say you're working for IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better copies or printers, so what else?"
You have monopoly on the market, so society can't be more successful.
At that point, the reconciliation and marketing are already in place, so the companies are headed by people who are responsible for this, while people who are responsible for their own products are shocked out of the decision process.
Technological genius, which led the company to its inconvenient position, is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - genuineness and technical knowledge are necessary.
That's exactly what happened in the Xerox company...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry literally.
She could have been ten times bigger than she is, she could be Microsoft in the '90s...
But instead of winning, they made a loss.
How innovation takes as a form of art:
"It's still a long way and a lot of work between the great idea and the excellent product... and as the great idea develops, it changes and grows."
During that time, you'll learn a lot about him.
You have to join a number of compromises - some things just electronics, glass, robots or factories, you don't force them to do.
You must have 5000 things on your mind all the time - different concepts - and put them together...
Finally, it depends on the taste - you're trying to think about the best things that humanity has ever created, and in a certain way you're trying to demonstrate them into what you're doing yourself.
Picasso said good artists are copying, but the best artists are stealing.
I've never been ashamed of stealing the best ideas.
The Macintosh company was so amazing and successful because people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, history and coincidence also the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, they would have done amazing things in completely different sectors.
Skalia and Thomas had dinner with opposers of the medical law when their case was dealt with the court
On the day the Supreme Court seated behind the closed doors to discuss a political controversial question whether he would accept an objection to President Obama's healthcare law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended the feast dinner sponsored by a legal company that would participate before the court.
The event occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the proposals.
One of the cases discussed was the complaint filed by 26 States that questioned the radical reconstruction of healthcare approved last year by Congress - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed that the complaint would be heard, but 5,5 hours were expected in March, whose results will further develop the presidential elections planned for 2012 and will be in full stream during the decision.
A lawyer who stands in front of the court and endeavours to reject the law will be most likely to be Paul Clement, who served as a general prosecutor of the United States under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's legal company, Bancroft PLC, was one of almost two dozens of companies that helped sponsored the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which has been dealing with both conservative legal principles for years.
Another company that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations of doubting laws, called the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which there are huge funds in the process.
Dinner was held in Washington's hotel a few hours after a court discussion on the subject of the case.
In addition, Mitch McConnell, the highest representative of the Republicans in the Senate, also attended her, and confirmed the opponent of the Healthcare Act.
And the guest's introduction?
This is nothing new: these two judges have been involved in the action of the Federal Society Group for years.
And it's definitely nothing that would be in contrast with the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are empowered to follow the principles of behaviour which are subject to lower federal judges.
However, if not, their behaviour would definitely fall under the principle of C4, which says that "the judge may participate in actions that are currently related and other organizations in order to gain funds, however, the judge must not be a speaker, a honourable guest, nor shall be introduced to the action programme."
However, the relationship of Scalia and Thomas with two legal companies in the case, as well as companies with enormous financial interest in this case, was rich enough to warn the activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference against the code of behaviour is in contrast with the claim of several judges that the Supreme Court acts according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause Organization.
"The judges drank and dinnered at social benefits with legal representatives who are waiting for their case to be discussed before the court."
Their presence and assistance in obtaining funds by means of this action undermines their legs by all claims of unemployment, which is unacceptable.
Skalia and Thomas showed little understanding against their critics and told them that they also combined their judicial obligations with the actions of groups such as the Federal Society.
Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a highly built conservative activist.
Conservatives also suggest that the ethical problem has mainly Judge Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as a general prosecutor for President Obama's government when the first objections against the law appeared before the court.
The Critics of Kagan pushs her to deny her involvement in the case, and claims that she was fighting for the law as much as she could now be unemployed.
Kagan didn't mean she was going to retire.
The Boeing company has obtained a record order for electrical aircraft worth 18 billion USD
Airlines Emirates order 50 binary aircraft Boeing 777 with a possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner airlines to Aman Air, for which it incases more than 1 billion USD.
When a company gets a order for 50 pieces of its products, it is usually no reason to celebrate.
However, if the manufacturer of Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aircraft is combined with the records of 18 billion USD, it is something different.
The important message is also from where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, the growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to the predictions issued on Monday, the Chicago estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2 520 airlines worth 450 billion USD in the next 20 years.
The Boeing company announced its biggest order in history in respect of dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 biennial streams of 777.
The Sensation Procurement came from the Emirates Airlines in Dubai.
The Boeing company in 2011 Dubai Air Show announced that airlines have the opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft, which would make the total value of the procurement go up to 26 billion USD.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air airports ordered six machines Boeing 787-8, sometimes also called Dreamliner, which is proud of considerably better consumption of fuel and passengers.
The total price of these six aircraft exceeds 1 billion USD.
"One of the excellent report for the whole Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the nations of heavy oil.
This means that they have not only money to pay for aircraft, but the increase in the prices of engines -- mostly damaged airlines, because it's one of its biggest costs -- it's not so crucial because the country itself earns on higher prices of oil.
This is important, because they are not as likely as in other airlines that they could collapse or postpone aircraft orders because of the increase in fuel prices, Dihora says.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The procurement of airlines Emirates reinforces Boeaing's leading position on the market with a wide body and brings to the close airbus SAS, which tried to distort Boeing's dominants with its A350 transport model.
The winning of Boeing is coming four months after Airbus' representatives announced that their largest A350 aircraft, which is a direct competitor of the aircraft, would be dismissed.
It was because customers demanded more useful loads and flights, so the manufacturer took time to add the machines to the more power of the engine.
Boeing Co's share price increased by 1,5% to 67.94 USD.
The sister of the Mexican President was allegedly defeated in the Michoacan elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon from the PRI, helped hunting the governor's chair of drug traffickers.
Sister Felipe Calderon seems to have lost the position of the governor in Michoacan in victory, and then, on Monday, she announced that one of her opponents helped the drug traffickers to win.
The preliminary results contributed to the leadership of the governing elections of the Western State Faust Valley of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The impacts of the members of organized crime in the entire election process and especially in the course of yesterday's elections are alarming not only for Michoacan, but for the whole of our country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in the interview for the radio day after Sunday elections.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the public opinion group... entertaining the election urnas, building road trails... and letting people vote in order for the PRI.
The Pri Party ruled in Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when she lost presidency.
However, it plans a rapid return to power and victory in the elections in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
The Pri Party hopes to win in July in presidential elections.
Vallejo seemed to beat Calderon, who had led a day before the elections, just very closely.
Calderon, a conservative candidate of her brother National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Valleyon as a winner.
The third is Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left side of the Democratic Revolution Party, or the PRD, which has already controlled the Governor's Office. For the reasoned and unfortunate, the persecuted party is in front of the presidential elections in 2012 for a very unfortunate loss.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results as valid.
Valleja, former mayor of the capital state named Morelia, refuses any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to recognise the results.
Michoacan has been controlled by drug cartels specialized for marihuana, heroin and metamphetamines for a long time.
This is the birth state of President Calderon and just in Michoacan in December 2006 the military fight against smugglers began.
However, violence persisted.
The mayor of the PAN, Luisy Marie Calderon, was murdered only a week before the elections, and many candidates of the elections have gone away from fear.
However, whatever the results of the elections in Michoacan appear to be for the Party of the PRI, the winning of the party will help gain a new impulse.
The expected representative of the Party of the Pri presidential elections, Enrique Pena Neto, congratulated Wahington Valley and said, "I think this victory could be very encouraging for the next year."
ADB Bank calls on Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank called upon India and China to be prepared to help save the Eurozone from its serious debt crisis, otherwise it could have a overall decline in the world economy that would have a negative impact on the growth of the economy in Asia.
Rajat Nag, Director-General of the ADB Bank with a seat in Manile, said that two of the fastest growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to help quickly recover the currency block through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the countries of the Bric Group [Brazilia, Russia, India, China] are following all European difficulties "too unexpectedly" and said that Asian financial assistance in combination with European leadership and funds would help to blur the long-term decline in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who could help Europe from the crisis," he told Financial Times during the World Economic Forum in Bombay during the interview.
"Asie may be protected at a certain extent, but she's definitely not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should certainly do it."
The European Monetary Association has been severely tested for a serious debt crisis for months.
In the last days, lending costs of Italy have increased dangerously, and the Presidents of the Governments of Italy and Greece have withdrawn.
A growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that the global economy could retrieve to the recession, and the calls began to appear so that the new economies of the leading economies would connect and help the Eurozone find solutions.
Mr Nag foretold that all Asian support would be directed through IMF, but he noted that mutual aid - such as the purchase of bonds of the Fund for the European Union financial assistance, the European Financial Stability Institute - would provide more negotiating opportunities to Asian partners in the European countries.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do what she can," to help the Eurozone, because its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and drying the acquisition of foreign capital.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and unstable," he said.
"We're standing in front of a difficult task and we have to keep a high growth rate."
"It's not an alternative, it's a naked fact, because otherwise we could find a job for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others suggest that developing economies, such as the Indian, have nothing to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the USA, said that it would be politically very difficult to explain the aid for Europe for 1.2 billion people in India, when 800 million of them live from 2 USD or less per day.
"Once they could find out that the Greeks are retired at 50 and enjoy vacation on the beaches, which would be hard to explain," he noted.
Lee Howell, Director-General of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why the Indian stocks should be used to maintain well-paid employment for many Greek citizens in badly managed and loss sectors such as railway transport.
Mr. Nag emphasized that the Eurozone crisis is threatened by the "dangerous dominary effect".
The prognosis of the bank that in Asia in 2011/2012 will occur to 7.5% of economic growth, is now facing the "decline risk" because of the European threat.
He declared that vulnerable developing markets must create "plans of unpredictable expenditure" to be protected from the decline and significant discount of capital from their economies.
Pentagon's warning about possible defence creams
The Minister of Defence, Leon Panetta, in Monday in the Congress, put a good way under the kotle when he warned that the automatic cuts in the budget could threaten national security and cause a financial reaction starting in Pentagon and continuing through the battlefield in Afghanistan to civil mounting lines.
Pentagon will have to spend a reduction in the budget by 450 billion USD in the next 10 years, but now it is afraid to reduce by another 600 billion USD if the Congress is not able to conclude an agreement on expenditure.
"The impacts of these screws would be destructive for the whole resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the incapacity of the Congress to reach the budget agreement and that the so-called structure would cause 23% of the standard decline and stop many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction used in this unreasonable way, it will not be possible to implement most of our construction or ship projects - you cannot buy only three quarters of buildings or ships. Besides, there may be serious damage to other modernization efforts," the Panett wrote to the Senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is going so fast, we will also have to send civilians to a forced vacation to be able to meet the objective requirements."
"These changes can shake with the faith of those who care for our army and seriously damage her preparedness."
Finally, the scratches will also touch the fighting units, he announced Panett.
"Although the accounts for the financing of possible military operations in the invasion will not directly touch this site, the operations there will be negatively affected by major changes in other budgets," the Panetta warned.
"There will be scratches even in the contract staff, which will result in the delay in contracted contracts supporting our people's military efforts."
"The states of paid employees will be reduced, which will also delay payments to suppliers and subsequent violations of legal and political support."
Both Senators signed off to Pant ten days ago and asked him for details about possible impacts on automatic defenses in the defence ministry.
"The consequences of the defence ministry could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military force."
"We are strictly against this hard measure," the Senators announced in the joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Pant's letter.
"It's not about the conclusion we can live with, and we definitely don't want to sign it."
"The planned sketches are a threat to national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"It will only be seen to see if Pant's letter and fresh warning will increase the pressure on the Congress that approves the budget and strengthens the votes calling for the release of Pentagon from the list of scratched areas.
The Panetta has recently been more open in the discussions about possible scratches, although he himself went to his high position in Pentagon with long years of experience with the approval of budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was running into a strong fight.
At the press conference held for a minute week, the Minister of Defence indicated a short picture of what his resort can wait - a shell of the army, but within which the core will be missing.
"He'll be like a ship without marine."
"We'll be like an ammunition.
"We'll be like aircraft without trained pilots."
"It will be like paper tiger, like the army of casarans, buildings and bombs without sufficient numbers of trained soldiers who could complete the mission," Panetta said at the beginning of the Pentagon talk.
"He'll be like a unit without moral, unprepared and incapable to compromise the possible enemy."
"As a result, the aggression will be welcomed..."
In the Annex, as added by letters to McCain and Graham's Panet, it sets out how the reduction will be due to "explicit operational risks: late responses to crisis, conflicts and disasters; significant restrictions on the possibilities of landing and laying down around the world; the expected unacceptable risk in future fighting operations."
Furthermore, the Panet added that some of the largest defence projects could be expected to terminate, including those already tested, and those that are only in early stages of planning.
For example, the F35 project, planned new bombarder, the balistic submarines of the new generation, the new coastal fighting ships and the new ground fighting vehicle, which the army and marine marine wanted to replace humvee.
By stoping further development and testing of F35 F35, 80 billion USD would be saved over the next 10 years, but its advocates claim that it is a necessary further step in improving the army, which is necessary to address possible threats by China and other rivals.
How to recognize a lie
A summer view of recent newspaper titles suggests how serious and everywhere lies and lies in everyday life are.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has full hands of work with the accusation that he sexually disturbed several women - both parties claim that the second lies.
The governors at the University of Penn State were accused of the wrong testimony when they tried to hide records that a pensioned football coach sexually attacked the boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was arrived, as it was called by the American President Barrac Obama, that the Israeli President of the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie was able to destroy the entire career and stable the stability of many countries.
The New York Congressman and the Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made himself a fool when he published information that was immediately withdrawn by unquestionable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of abuse of finances from his campaign to try to cover up his unmarried relationship.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that broke around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period of his sexual interference with Monica Levin.
It's all about cheating stories at school and university.
There are cases where teachers give their students test answers only to make them look good in their judgments.
The mentors who should teach the contrary report that lie and fraud is acceptable.
How many frauds do we meet?
Studies show that in one day you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Suppose many of them are mercy lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lied three times during the first ten minutes of their first meeting.
Determination of lies, or "recognition of lies", is an essential skill that each should be equipped for personal or job reasons.
However, it is not a social game that would be similar, let's say, Sharada, when a person shouts, "I have you." Recognition of lies is a serious science sector working with scientific dates gathered during the last six decades in prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths of lie were distorted.
Liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're screwing, cocktailing, red, or sewing.
Nevertheless, do not make it difficult for a liar to observe and reveal.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from the facial building, small expressions in the face, the way of creating questions and their timeout.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from a large and developing fabric on the determination of lies and it is clear that the discovery of lies is a modern skill that can easily be learned and in today's complex world can help you very much - especially if your jobs include employment, interviewing, negotiating or managing people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them lean in caution, direct their emotions and intuitively realize how the other party accepts them.
From research we know that extroverts lie more frequently than introverts that men are making more "sebibly" lies, while women say more lies "focused on others" -- mostly to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less often to their partners than free people (but lies that say, mostly, they are "wrongly").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
It's called the starting observation.
He will have later findings to compare with what.
Note the hold of the body of the subject, his laughter, the voice work.
You should know if someone usually keeps knocking his legs, so that you do not wrongly blame him for lie only because he starts to knock his legs in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to determine the summary of false verbal and verbal behaviour.
But consider it only as warning signals, not as evidence of lie.
People speaking lies can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their invented story, the shoes can swipe to the door, to the east, dramatically change the hold of the body, or show "relief after the end of the conversation" - overreasonable breathing and changing the position when a difficult testimony behind them.
People conducting interviews often issue a false signal that the interview is over, just to see how it will look relief after its end.
Also, take into account the language of the subject.
It's a famous story about how Scott Peterson once spoke and used the last time he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, which was a whole state search for her body.
The deceptive individuals can also express themselves measuringly: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Levinsk" or a difficult question they repeat.
The most common verbal signs are just very minor.
Someone can use a lot of "measuring language" when he answers a difficult question, "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... according to my best consciousness."
In such an answer, we do not know too many facts and often it is another warning signal.
There is no magic that can be revealed by any lie, but it is possible to gain skills that can help to investigate a lie.
With these skills, a person will have a greater chance that he will not fly to a liar and a fraud in his personal and work.
The controversial plan for the construction of oil pipes will be transmitted after the threat of the retention of approval by the American Government
A few days after Obam's government threatened to defer the approval of the planned oil pipe from Canada to the Mexican Gulf - by putting commissions against herself, but calming the environmentalists - the company with the building of pipes has announced that it is willing to redirect the project so that things can move again.
The TransCanada company announced on Monday night that it will move the planned routes from the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is convinced that the project will be approved anyway.
The company notified this decision at the press conference in the headquarters of the Nebraian government.
The transCanada column Alex Pourbax claims that the company is convinced that the construction of the pipes will eventually be approved, although it will lead a different route.
This notification came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced last week that it was deferred to the federal authorisation of the project from which it would not conduct a study of possible replacement routes that could not affect the Sandhills region in Nebraska and the water layer of Ogallala, a wide range of underground water supply.
"This is really moving forward," said the Republican representative Lee Terry from Nebraska for Fox News.
The new ecological assessment ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would likely put any decision away until 2013, thus a year after the elections in the next year, however, the authorities refuse to play a role in the decision.
In a written declaration last week, Obama described his decision as a request from the Ministry of Foreigns and expressed his support.
1,700 miles long pipe will connect Canada and the Mexican Gulf.
From the province of Albert to the raphineries in Texas, it will run 700 000 oil barrels daily.
This way, six states will need to be crossed.
This project is totally hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by workers who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear at work on the pipe.
However, lawmakers in Nebraska have constructed the plan and considered the introduction of laws that would force the company not to interfere with the Sand Hills region and the water layer of Ogallala, the main source of drinking water and moisture.
The existing study on the environmental impact ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would only have a small negative environmental impact, but the source of the energy industry said that the Ministry's General Inspector ordered a new review of the entire process of original study, and focused mainly on two issues.
Once, whether the lobbyst employed by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton's advisor in 2008, was not representing a conflict of interest in the programme.
Furthermore, whether the company which was hired for the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti Labelle is accused of vomiting fears because of her.
The New York family claims that Patti Labelle's singer was pissed off into their Manhattan house and scared their daughter so that she embarrassed.
The exit of the Hit "Lady Marmalade" scared the 18-month Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personal changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," stated her family in the lawsuit filed to the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10th, last year, the public technique Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a teacher in the school school, and Genevieve were about to take a family trip.
When Kevin Monk landed the car, Roseanna Monk got in the baggage of their house in the Riverside Boulevard part and carried Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door for a moment and put her baby away.
Someone appeared behind my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said yes, and I left to pick her up."
Labelle irritated her pregnant woman.
"Aggressive tone she told me, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care about your opinion."
She freaked out, and she began to speak loudly - she screamed loudly the most slow expressions...
She had a bottle of water with her, and she started screwing water out of me.
He claims Genevieve had a hysterical invasion.
"I told that woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
Labelle had her mother - who still had Genevieve in her arms - threw it down and had to stop her until her escort, which then dragged her into the waiting car, told Roseanna Monk.
In the meantime, the daughter screamed so much when she wounded, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter where Labelle demanded apology, but they had no answer.
The lawyer and speaker, Labelle, aren't responding to our phone calls to express themselves to the whole cause.
The complaint requires closer compensation, but a family legal representative, Sam Davis, said that he took the case free and that the family plans all condemned money to devote a charity organization devoted to cancer children.
"The purpose is to force Patti Labelle to take responsibility for her initiation," Davis said.
"This behaviour is absolutely unacceptable, especially if it is targeted against a teacher from a school holding an 18-month child in arms."
Climate disagreement has reduced the economy
During the first year of the government, Maria Löpeze Valdeze increased unemployment and reliability in Sinaloa, declined foreign investment and economics with them
In 2011, it is the first year of the government, Maria Lopeze Valdeze, who is called the Government of Changes. This government has brought great expectations in terms of economic progress, however, because of the adverse climate conditions at the beginning of the year, no growth has been observed and even the decline of the main indicators of economic development.
Low February temperatures have caused millions of losses in agriculture, limited the growth of the state economy, have a 3.6% reduction in economic activity in the first semester of this year. In the field of agriculture there has been a historic decrease of 31.16%, which has violated the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the report of the damage issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damages were recorded at 582 835 hectares of land processed, of which 78.03% were totally destroyed and partial damages were found on the remaining 21.07%. Mean the main destructive plants include vegetables, corn and games.
The decline of economic activity until November resulted in a continuous increase in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geographic, the level of unemployment in the state has been observed during the first three quarters of increased growth. From January to March 55,053 people of the State of Sinaloa, which represents the unemployment rate of 4,53% of economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5,28% and between July and August, average unemployment increased and reached 6,19%, which represents approximately 74,000 unemployed people.
Less Liquidity
For unemployment during the year in the State of Sinaloa, more factors can be explained. According to Gerard Löpeze Cervantesa, Director of the UAS Economic and Social Science Faculty can explain unemployment indirectly, on the basis of the steps carried out at the public policy level.
"We are witnesses of growing unemployment, which is related to various factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market because of the restriction of resources due to the legislation approved by the Congress in relation to the fight against laundering of dirty money. For people who have illegally strengthened dollars, it is not easy to earn, invest them or use them for something," he stressed.
Suspension of migration
Lopez Cervantes indicated that demographic factor is also involved in the growth of unemployment.
"The number of people who go for work to abroad, to the United States, has been reduced, however, because of the reasons of an unlawful entry, and then because, even if these people get abroad, it is difficult to get work for them.
Incompatibility
Analysis of the Labour Market in Sinaloa is also worsening because of the growing insecurity that prevails in working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the employees in the state work without taking the doses of the social security administration.
The following features of the labour market, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and unreliableness. In this administrative territory, the lowest wages from the country are listed in the registers of the Mexican Institute for Social Security and the Secretariat of Work and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was 5 352 pessets, deep under the national average, which moves to the amount of 7 375 pesets.
Reduction of direct foreign investments
As a result of the decline in economic activity and the growth of unemployment, in 2011, the most significant decline in foreign direct investment has also been reported in the last 10 years. According to the Ministry of Finance from January to June, direct foreign investment amounts of $630,697 were reached, which represents a decrease of 87.74% over the amount of $5,143,312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State invests 17,280 million peset per year, which focused primarily on businesses in the field of services.
Bond
With regard to the decline scenario of the economy, the Government of this State requested in July to approve the lending of 3 billion pess, which would be intended for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas to restore the economy. The local convention approved a loan of 2,600 million pesoes. No debt profits have been recorded until November in no public economy sector.
Reaction
According to the representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government, Maria Lopez Valdez pointed out the lack of government ability to manage.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, Chairman of the National Transformation Chamber, declared that in 2011, the will of individual sectors, including the government of the State itself, was missing.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa was really minor during this year. We need to work intensely on retrieving the land that we have lost this year. In 2012 we have to double our efforts, lacking harmonisation of efforts to all of us, and in particular the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. Let's hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economy slowness
Loredo Lopez stated that events like freezes in the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and limited its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement has been caused by a number of events, including freezing. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not quickly reconsider, so that it could re-establish the dynamicity that would enable us to achieve the acceptable levels of movement of processes, products and services. Therefore, at the end of the year, we have experienced deeply under the expected forecasts," he stated.
Re-determination of the mission
According to the Theodor Salazar Uriarte, President of the Staff Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, it is necessary to push the state to more dynamic productive activities.
"We generally observe that we are working, and we believe it is necessary to prepare a long-term plan to re-determine the goals and economic direction of the State, because it is important to mobilize all the potential of material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
The work that's in front of us
The President Coparmex emphasized the importance of identifying the vision of the future that would better manage the efforts of the government.
"I would generally say that the government has tried to achieve good results in different areas, some progress has been made in economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He stated that the current administration has shown progress in governance of public policy.
"There are elements that allow the government to claim that it is trying to be pleasant. I can say that there is a work done here and I believe the government is aware that there is also a lot of work before us," he said.
Condemned for 8 kg of marihuana
The population of Navolato was sentenced to five years of prison and 100 days penalty for holding eight kilograms of marijuana.
The General Prosecutor informed the Republic that the convicted dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted for a criminal act of health threat, specifically for holding marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by the mexican army components on 7 June 2010 at Cypriano Valdez Street, opposite station 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
Dealer drove in the van type pick up white colors. In the car in his cheek, he had a black bag and a small bag on the seat of the colleague. The soldiers found 8 kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the secured man remains available to the Judges of the Second Division and the management remains internal within the Centre for the Legal Effects of Crime.
Dude contributions to projects
Social projects that are part of programmes such as Habitat, Reservation of public places and 3x1 for migrants face the danger that they will not be finished or that they will have great delays because of missing economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of City Social Development stated that if construction work has been progressed so far, it is now threatened that the government of the State will not be able to provide appropriate supplies that require more than 11 million pesso to three programmes.
He stated that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesso. The state is 25%. Only the Federations and the city have added funds to work until that time, so it is possible that the projects will be delayed.
"They have to provide nearly 12 million and even though the year is on the end, we have not received anything, even though we had to get a part," he said in July. "We don't lose time, we started and continued very well, but we miss money."
He stated that in the last year, the State had not fulfilled the supplies, so at the beginning of the new period, the city had to request a loan so that more than 7 million were not paid by the government.
"The same thing has happened to us in the previous six-year period, because the state had no economic capacity to participate and programmes continue. To get to the programmes mentioned this year, we had to get funds that would cover what he had not finished," he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a pledge by the State representatives concerning the transfer of these resources, he stated that the application of Armand Villarreal, the Secretary for Administration and Finance, was sent to the Secretary of Finance to speed the proceedings and the corresponding percentages had arrived as soon as possible.
"They were supposed to provide us 12 million and even though the year is coming to the end, we haven't even got a pesso yet."
The Court approves "the end of analogue transmission" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analogic signals is one of the most important changes that the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional lawsuit submitted by the Senate and the Ambassador Convention against the Presidential Decree, which wishes to speed up the so-called "exclusion of analogic signals" and realize it in 2015 instead of 2021.
A minority of four ministers, including the Chairman of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderon did not exceed his power when he issued a decree in which individual steps were set to move to the earthly digital television.
With this result, the complaint filed by the Senate was rejected because the qualified majority of eight votes were not achieved so that the court could express the constitutional or non-constitutionality of the mentioned decree that remained valid.
The proposal for a judgment designed by the Minister of Olgo Sanchez Cordero presents the possibility to declare a decree for non-constitutional, as the regulation of all issues relating to radio and television is the matter that, according to the law, the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofetel), is violated by the principles of hierarchical submission and the exception of the law.
Only Zaldzivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Parliamentary Chamber supported the constitutional dispute in trying to fight the decree. Minister Sanchez Cordero accepted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described in it, leading to the transition to digitalization.
The minister's meeting also decided to refuse the complaint filed by the Ambassador's Chamber without entering a debate on the proposal under the charge of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his presentation, the minister of the President stated that it was not identical with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal execution cannot be structured through the general standards of measures to prepare public administration.
"I don't think that even if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is a federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the State.
The compensation of analogic signals is one of the largest changes that the world has experienced in the past years. It is related to the better use of the radio spectrum, the better quality of the signal and more channels.
It believes that distinguishing the change would mean a distraction of the benefit of digitalization, which requires decisions in public interest, because digitalization is not only a technical dimension, but "including economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he emphasized, these questions "require the operation of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, includes a number of competences that the Constitution confers in the hands of the government of the State".
He recalled that a number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to the digital system and have done so through their governments, even though they had highly specialised technical authorities.
He stated that it could not be possible that the Government by issueing an inconvenient decree that is incorporating congress's competences to a certain extent, introduced in the area of the administration of compliance with the laws prepared by legislative powers.
In Michoacan, they analyze the possibility of counting "glass after voice"
According to the data published by the PREP, the difference between the first and second in the governor's elections is less than 27 percent. The votes of 879 of 6074 elections have not yet been calculated.
The possibility of compiling "glass after voice" appeared in the year's elections in Michoacan, where, in accordance with the information published by the Preliminary Election Programme (PREP), the difference between the first and the second place in the Governor's elections of less than 27 percent has not yet been recorded in the votes of 879 of the total 6074 elections.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Election Institute in Michoacan (IEM), Maria de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that several days ago, 9 November, the election authority approved a number of measures to harmonize local standards with federal election reform.
As it will be recalled, Michoacan has not officially confirmed his political institution or its National Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act. The State Congress has approved reforms shortly before the legal period for their entry into force in this election period, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel noted their publication in the time specified in the Official Public Journal Act that he had any objections against them.
On 9 November, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative power and declared the voice of the Head of the State in the Constitutional Reforms "incorrect and illegal" because he has no right to "neither approve nor vet".
On the question of the possibility of compiling "glass after voice" María de LANGELES Llanderal replied that by approval of the relevant measures, the General Council of IEM will be able to perform a partial and general computation by the local Election Authority.
This means that a partial summary of votes, one or more electoral packages, will be possible under the following conditions: the election results do not agree; there is no record of the computation of votes and the calculation in the corresponding box, or it is not available by the President; or if there are errors and apparent violations of the election results.
Furthermore, the total recalculation of votes in all electoral urns will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of elections and the candidate in the second place is less or equal to one percentage point; every time an explicit request by the representative of the party and/or the coalition that proposed a candidate in the second place appears at the beginning of the session.
The total recalculation of votes will also be possible when the difference between the probably winner and the candidate in the second place is equal or less than one percentage point, and when there is an explicit request of the political party whose candidate has ended in the second place. In such a case, the election packages that have taken partial computation will be deleted.
It should be mentioned that in such a situation there are choices in Morelia, where the difference between the first and the second place of less than 0,16%, even though 129 of the total 923 elections has not yet been numbered.
His last will
His ashes will be dispersed in the mountain of Zapaliname, confirmed by the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. During Monday, the celebrating ceremony and the surgery will take place.
According to the family, the colonel was the last wish that his ashes were dispersed in the mountain of Zapaliname.
Once the family Bacio Cortese, along with the other people who died in the accident, received the highest honour, returned to Coahuil's capital on the aircraft of the Mexican Air Force. The family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
In the afternoon, Colonel's ash arrived in a chapel in Nazario Ortiz Garza class, where the family and friends also came.
At 5:30 a.m., a goodbye was held at the Technological Institute in Saltillo, which was organized by its former students from Technology School and members of the American football team, Felipe Bacio, who was also a member during the graduation preparation.
"He wanted to return to Saltilla and his wish was that his ashes were dispersed in the mountain of Zapaliname. This is what he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortes, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the top of his life, "It was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young and entered the Collegio del Aire air school in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said that even the truck was driving, but he always went to his dream to become a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "he barely arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapapan for his uncle’s promotion, so he is convinced that he died in his favorite life: aircraft management.
They gave him the last goodbye.
With Felip Bacio Cortez, underpublic of the Mexican Air Force, we greeted with all the honors that he came to give to governor Jorge Torres Lopez, citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the only Mexican air force, the leaders and students of the Technological School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he arrived both in the study and in sport.
Bacio Cortés died in the last days after the helicopter dropped down, which was driving. On board also there was a government secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other persons, all the officials of this state.
At 18:05, the remains of the Saltillen cousin Bacio Cortése (softened) arrived in order to be transferred through the funeral service to the Mexican air forces under the leadership of Major Jaime Martinez to the area where the family, his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, mother, and other relatives, students and teachers were gathered.
Three abandoned dead bodies were found on Cadereyta NL ship
A few hours before the foundation, military representatives represented the media of 11 persons detained in this area for criminal offences related to organised crime.
The bodies of three men killed by shooting in different parts of the body and the head were found on the abandoned ship of Cadereyta Jimenez, Nuevo Leon.
The road from Cadereyta to Santiago was found at a level known as El Castillo.
People who were moving in these places noticed that a house with a beege-coffee fence had a open door from time to time.
When they looked in, from about three metres away, three people noticed the dead body, and they immediately warned the competent authorities.
One person was wearing a sports shirt of yellow and dark cotton pants and was not shoeed.
A few meters further was the body of another person dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three were lying in the face to the ground.
According to the data obtained in the places, all three people were probably killed elsewhere because no bullets were found.
There were messages addressed by one group of organized crimes and a number of bullets, both to build and on the door.
11 suspects were detained in Cadereyt.
The National Defence Secret represented 11 persons, including young people, who were members of the criminal group, which were particularly operational in the area of Cadereyta and which were associated with kidnappings, murders, persecution and illegal funeral.
According to the information published at the first attempt on 11 November in the Los Alveros colony, 8 persons were detained and one detained person was able to be released.
Three real estates and mobile phone were secured, confirming that members of the criminal group called Los Zetas.
On November 12, at 6 p.m., the military personnel was in the Rancho Viejo area in Cadereyta when he noticed cars without the SPZ and two persons in it.
After the car stopped, they took an explosion and discovered one rifle, a bullet and 18 bullets.
Then, on the basis of these statements, on 13 November, about 14 hours, one of the competitors in the area of La Frauda was detained. When he saw soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were accused of illegal funeral in general Terran, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday
The named President of the government, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce to him a new government that will face the crisis that holds this country over the destruction of the economic disaster.
The named President of the Government, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the Italian President to introduce to him a new government that will face the crisis that holds this country over the ruin of the economic disaster and puts the whole euro area in danger.
The Presidential Palace issued a report in which he announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Georgi Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could create a government.
The government is expected to represent a complex majority of technocrats, although it is not yet obvious when the new government is taken into power.
Monti declared that he would present to the president the results of his interviews that he led with political parties in an effort to create a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told the journalists.
Monti explicitly did not say that he would be able to create a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well defined," he added.
Monti has completed the government's creation process in less than three days, which is much shorter than usual. In the meantime, Italy is trying to combat the political and financial crisis, which has led its debt to an insustainable level.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Montim must approve a hard package of savings required by European leaders, and only so it will be possible to renew the broken confidence of Italy.
Monti's high pressure has been developed to hurry. For the instability of the markets, the interests from the Italian BTP bonds have exceeded with a ten-year term of 7 per cent limit, the level where Greece and Ireland had to ask for salvation.
Emma Marcegaglia, the President of the Italian Employees Organization of Conf industry, told the journalists after the Montim meeting, "We said that we would very much support this government."
We believe that this government is the last option for Italy to get out of this thorough situation.
Monti's hope for success has been significantly multiplied by support by PDL Silvia Berlusconi, who had forced the crisis to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are prescribed for good results," she told journalists Angelina Alphano, the secret of the Mediterranean Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is important, because until this time, a number of its members have been against the government with the technical majority of Monti.
Parliament’s support
The new Monti government must have strong support from Parliament in order to promote unpopular savings reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in a given effort could cause a new and destructive attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks joined the pressure and warns that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti started negotiations with political parties, committees and business groups, youth and women in Monday.
The bike will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitan, which allowed a very quick process in response to the crisis.
After a short decline from the end of the last week, when it was obvious that Berlusconi would demiss, the interests of Italian bonds returned to the critical border and responded to the uncertainty of whether the new president of the government would be successful.
To save Italy, whose public debt is moving at EUR 1.8 billion, it would be beyond the possibility of current euro area financial reserves.
Monti declared that his government should endure to the power until the next elections planned for 2013, despite the general prognosis, which claims that politicians only give him time to carry out reforms, and then to announce early elections.
Monti stated that he would like to integrate policies in his office, but the major parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to bring Italy out of the difficulties that the country has gotten into because of financial pressure.
Political sources stated that both side disagreement and disagreement among the parties have complicated attempts to integrate the government and political personality.
Spaniards participate in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of 22 Spanish footballists, ten will cross the border of 50 international matches.
On the side of Costa Rica, only one of 22 challenged players has reached 50 matches.
The giant contrast on the side of Costa Rica, if we compare 22 players of both countries who met at a friendly battle today at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While world champions and Europe, number one of the monthly FIFA ratings, have a wide range of inter-elections of class A, Kosta Rica has only the defense of Michael Uman, who was the only one who played 50 international matches.
This number reached last Friday at the fight against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernandez stadium.
The Spanish footballists who play in the Star Falls and in the powerful clubs of the English First League, maintain intense activity in the League Championships and home cups and high-level attacks within European cups such as Champions League over a year.
We must also add experiences from the national Spanish team in the complicated eruption matches for the European and world championship.
Costaric players have very limited options for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, Concaf, which is considered to be the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign struggles from the Spanish representation has an Iker Casillas brancer on its account, who last Saturday before England (a loser 0-1 in London) reached an ex-branker Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international fights.
Casillas will join Kostarica today and receive a new record for Spain - 127 international fights.
Xavi Hernandez, the key player of Barcelona, has 106 matches on his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week together with other Spanish players who have a hundred matches on their account. Between them, Zubizarreta with 126 and medium attacker Schalke, Raúl Gonzalez, has already mentioned 102.
Carles Puyol also approached hundreds with 97 matches.
The following are Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fabregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and close to Michael Umana, the left wing of Junior Djaz with 48 matches and braker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
In addition, only 5 overcome the border of 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36 and José Luis Lopez with 35.
The least number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches, Roy Miller stands with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Budilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest didn't go even 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Kostarice Victor Bolivar only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are waiting for their first match.
The best shooter of Spain is David Villa with 50 goals and follows Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rica side, Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour at the opportunity of celebrating twenty years of existence
"The road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality."
In an exclusive interview for Viva, the Basist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said that the group is ready to offer one of the best concerts on the National Stadium next Sunday.
We waited for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that the possibility to play in Costa Rica represents a dream fulfilled for them.
This is what the Basist and the founding member Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent within the tournament at the opportunity of celebrating twenty years of existence and on Sunday 20 will be at a unique stop in Central America.
This day will be performed from 19:30 on the National Stadium, along with the Angel Group of The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an exemplary of the interview you can find the entire record on La Nacion website on the Internet.
For your Costa Rica, it's a dream fulfilled. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans experience?
The way to Costa Rica is our dream that becomes a reality.
In South and Central America, we were barely twice, and experience was great.
It's a beautiful country, and I believe we can stay here for a few days.
So we're so happy that we can bring you our music.
I ask, because they literally love the group here, the fans live these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your greatest favors?
Thank you for standing with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica.
Some people speak of the concert as the greatest show of the year.
Does it cause more pressure in you?
Some of the biggest shows we've performed in the last 21 years have been in the horizon for several weeks.
We showed a couple of great shows in Sao Paul and hoped that we got into the shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we're looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like serif, we like the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and her waves fit to surf?
We have a lot of surfer friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends are going to surf to Costa Rica or to Nikaragua or Mexico. These are the best places to surf, so we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you've prepared a huge show with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Because we've never played here, we have no restrictions that we can't do.
We'll try to play the best show with various songs. We'll try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans a good and diversity repertoar.
You'll never repeat the repertoar.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes other songs, so it's hard to choose what songs we play every night.
When we have two three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played for a long time, we focus on them, and we are also surprised, because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about it.
So it's more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
This tour you celebrate 20 years of art tracks.
If you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yeah, sure.
First of all, I think that none of us could imagine being in one big rock group and staying in it for over 20 years, that sounds like a dream.
We realize how much we have been given, and he feels that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we like to make music.
We're lucky to see the places we've always wanted.
We couldn't get better.
What meant to you that you were an important part of the genre of grunge?
We have always been honored to be part of this group in which the great ones themselves are represented.
The people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when the movement comes from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
From time to time, there is a group in the city, but it is much less common that five to ten groups will emerge from one city at once.
We're proud of it, and we're honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we play with some other.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on the tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honoured to be part of this movement that came up in Seattle.
It is also very unusual that a group like yours keeps together and has still the same members after those years.
Yes, we four have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is a long time longer than the normal duration of the group.
I think for the first time we're all lucky that we're still in this world and the second part of our role plays the fact that we're constantly interested in each other.
We are all close friends, and so we managed to open musical roads that allow each one to have sufficient freedom for our own experiment.
We believe each other, we appreciate the music of another, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship with the word of glory was not easy, but thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was increasingly easier to find balance.
We try not to go too much on the tour because it's very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, you will recall that you have to respect music and what you gave it, and you can't let yourself abduct by being famous, rock stars.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs, and at first it was something great.
As a band, we existed for three years and we never gave any album until Andy died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us. When I listened to some song or looked at photos, I remember Andy how amazing he was, how I laughed with him. It was always happy to work with him, laugh, talk about music or soccer and many other things.
She was an incredible person, and we missed him very much.
The National Group of Las Robertas will be authorized to start a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as jumps?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals, and we liked this group mostly, so we're wondering what Las Robertas offers alive and must be very funny.
Why do you always change the words of Yellow Ledbetter alive?
That's the question for Edie Vedder, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he adds to the first one that attacks him.
Who's affecting you as a basest?
A lot of people.
I was first attacked by Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them that I could talk all night about the basests I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge, even though he's not in fashion?
I think we've always felt easy to separate from the word grunge.
When it comes to grunge, I'll imagine groups that I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the other people who came up at the same time, and if music is valid today, it's something great, because it's music worth listening and groups like Mudhoney today are playing better music than ever before.
At first, your music had a slightly dark nature and now it's more positive.
What is worth this change?
That's interesting, because I feel that there are a few musical songs in the new album, which are lighter scattering, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe, which are considered very dark, even though they can sound positive.
With both of them, when Ed played me, I cried, and it was deeply dark.
I think when you grow up and you have some trauma in your life, you lose a family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs for me represent this.
I also think you can be a happy man and still make a dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was re-established for medical tests
The former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital Tuesday, where he would be tested because of the muscle loss he suffered in the area of the lower ends, his physician informed him.
72-year-old Fujimori, who has been penalized for 25 years of liberation for violation of human rights committed by his government (1990 - 2000), suffers from several diseases, including language cancer, which has been surged four times and are already under control.
Ambassador Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told the Canal N TV station that Fujimori will be testing in the National Institute for Neoplastic Diseases in three days, where they should find out why he is hurting and why he loses powers in the lower ends.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion, Fujimori could have mercy for humanitarian reasons, however, the former president himself does not want mercy because he feels innocent.
He was operational four times because of language cancer, dropped 18 pounds, and other problems were added to such problems as severe erosive gastritide, cysta on slippery, kidney stones, high pressure and circuit problems in his feet, said the doctor.
Fujimori has been punished since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was convicted to 25 years of prison for the death of 25 people killed by the killing escort army acting illegally in the first years of his government.
Mujica visiting Mexico to strengthen political bonds
The Uruguay President, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and entrepreneurs, begins to visit Mexico on Tuesday. Its aim is to reach an expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch the political themes of the region.
The Mujica meets with its mexican proteeman, Felip Calderon, on Wednesday. It is the most important meeting of the widest visit with the representatives of politics, trade and representatives of the Uruguya community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguay presidential office.
The meeting of both Presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political matters between the two countries," Uruguay presidential office published on its websites.
According to local communications, Mujica will try to force Calderon to support Uruguay in a dispute with France, when the French President Nicolas Sarkozy incorporated the South American country on a list of tax paradises at the G20 meeting in the French city Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkoza threatened that countries that will continue to remain in the position of the tax paradise will be removed from the international community, which has caused a rejective opinion by Uruguaya and consultation with the Ambassador in this European country.
Mexico President G20 since November. G20 is a group created by the most powerful developing and developed countries of the world. The Latin American country has concluded an agreement on the exchange of information to prevent double taxation since January this year.
The Uruguay Government has been trying to concrete fiscal exchange agreements in recent years with a view to getting out of the "black paper" of the Economic Cooperation and Development Organization (OECD), which have not introduced all required international tax cooperation standards.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have concluded the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has strengthened the exchange of goods between the two countries.
The beard installer runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been intimately struggling for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the sponsors of Bowser, but he has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title that comes this month into all shops around the world has been created from the beginning to use all the characteristics offered by the Nintendo 3DS transmission console that allows you to play three-dimensional games without using glasses.
"Mario is a character that must tell how to work stereoscopy without glasses," said a press specialized at Nintendo in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of a video game in Madrid.
Alvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game Nintendo created specially for this carrier", because until this time, successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptation of already existing titles.
The Nintendo speaker stated that, in addition to the fact that the picture is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and gasily party.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less manual users.
Once you overcome this level, you can run into the "second round" at the levels of games that are more difficult this time.
Furthermore, users can choose real time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of action. But it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to be able to overcome various challenges and "do not subject to optical lies".
This new appearance of Super Maria in 3D also assumes with the return of the character to the transmission console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo plays a note to those who watch and repeat the successful formula from the previous parts. It is that the man's beauty installer will have to go through dangerous minified platforms to free Princess Peach.
Even though the player finds news in the moves, in the area, in the clothing and among enemies, Luigi also appears to be a "grave" Luigi.
Colom approved the issue of Portil to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he has taken steps in the issue of the former President Alfonse Portil, who is to respond to the conspiracy in the United States in order to launder $70 million.
This ends the process aimed at answering Guatemala to the request of the northern country, which requires the issue of Portil to judge it.
At the press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judicial and executive power and that he remembered that the criminal court had already ordered the issue.
He assured that during his mandate he "no" interfered with the court decisions and allowed all the editions that came to his desk.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be issued for murder and severe health injury and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's step means an execution step after all judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to lead the trial against the former president who ruled in 2000-2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after its legal situation in Guatemala and will be guaranteed compliance with human rights.
Portillo was considered innocent in the case of fraud of 120 million in the Ministry of Defence during his presidency. This process was preceded by the issue, but the Ministry of Public Revocation revoked and returned the case to the game.
Trinius helped 6000 young people in the state of danger
The organization came up to help children without education so that they would not live on the edge of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the existence of social support organisation Triniova is very important: 6.000 young people threatening social exclusion have been assisted. The organization has been helping them overcome the difficult situation for the entire 25 years.
This should be added to a long hundred jobs that have been obtained for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary also served to present a balance within a celebrated act that took place in the former production sites of Fabra and Coats and attended by more than 300 people.
In 1986, the Triniova organization was established in Trinitat Vela, with a view to helping young people with low education, without jobs, drug addiction or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
A large number of representatives of organisations and institutions attended the meeting in Sant Andreo yesterday, which worked with the association in the past 25 years.
A variety of political representatives, during elections, showed a united nature of work that Trinius implements.
Together with President Generalitat, Arthur Mass, and his precedent, Jordi Pujol, the former socialist counselor for education, Ernest Maragall, and the former mayor, and the current ecological-socialist council Ricard Goma.
In the large Hall Fabra and Coats, the current advisor for Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of Social Work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinius had emerged in a very difficult time and that today, too, has a number of obstacles, but he added that the work that association has brought to this day is a good foundation.
The President stated Trinius as an example of how to combat inadmissible circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is not for this organization and for the work he does, nothing new," he said.
There was a relocation of a hired house in which giant partys were held
The aliens have owned 11 out of 13 apartments in a building in Balmes, 51
12 occupants left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
It all suggests that the nightmare of the neighbours in Balmes 51 is finally over.
Twelve people volunteered yesterday at noon to leave the building that was illegally inhabited and organized by giant parties that were awakening the neighbours, leaving the building from the court order and without having to interfere with the police.
After the operation was completed, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent the repeat of the situation.
"The entrance will be watched from now on," said the governor.
The occupants who took 11 out of 13 apartments in the building - the rest of them are resident - took all electrical and partially and water facilities, also painted walls and left waste all kinds, especially alcoholic drinks.
In the first three apartments there were huge partys that lasted up to two days and woke up other tenants.
Within the building there is a discotec, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europe Press that, as long as the building was busy, sales dropped by 80%.
The owner of the discotecture emphasizes that the occupants of the building made her some competitiveness because they were selling drinks for 3 euros, where the discotec is 10.
Furthermore, the entertainment company owner had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors because of noise, but the problems did not cause visitors of the discotec, but the residents of the host house, and especially those who participated in the organized partys, whose frequencies and intensity have increased over the past weeks, according to the distressed inhabitants of the area.
The owner explained that problems were so big that they even agreed with the owner of the building and for nine months she forgives her rent.
The City Police also confirmed that over the past weeks she received more complaints from the neighbours to the situation.
The Chairman of the City Group of People's Party, Alberto Fernandez Díaz, last week requested "the building to be moved immediately and thus ended with the problems of civil society suffering from the neighbours and the destruction of the area".
The president explained that only one floor was prevented in the summer, but in the past months, the occupants got into all the floors of the building and nearly all the apartments and even stolen in one of them.
In this direction, he added that "needs to end with punishment and be consistent when it comes to acts against civil responsibility that happened in the building."
Last night, the city police also cleaned the building in Nou Barris.
At 15:30 p.m., the police got into the building 35 on Mont-Ral Street after the neighbours who saw her entering the building four people.
All four were immediately detained.
Park or mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of writing a procedure that brings more than a dispute about the fees.
The City Electoral Management on 16 gates again opens a debate on the role of the Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-80 ’ s, during the largest flower, the Corporation Metropolitan de Barcelona (CMB) has already been destroyed, this self-supervisual administration printed several pamphlets to support the Collserola Park.
The flight defined the mountain as a big metropolitan park Barcelony.
Moreover, it was complemented with a number comparison with the New York Central Park.
After CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the mind of many like the top border of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the small ones that are not oriented on the axis north - south, but up (top) - down (sea).
Colserola's qualifications as a natural park goes this way.
Because the reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wildlifes instead of a bear of Yogi.
This was the position until September, when the city announced the mega competition of 16 audiences for the same number of gates in Colserola.
The gate, of course, records the idea of the park.
Either this or someone's trying to put the gate on the field.
So the only question is, Colserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, as well as from a cleanly organizational and based on the city reflex, this issue becomes a central topic of all Barcelona architects.
It's already the topic as sharp as two members of this old castle chosen at the elevator meeting.
And this is what caused one of the rare coincidence between what three barcelonic architects think and the more advanced university professors.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: Election management has its justification.
According to Roldan, after the issue of the party of the Gulf began, "I need" to discuss the "horse side", so the speech of Ildefonse Cerda about green apples was not questioned until the end.
"We must come from the principle that the most diversified barcelon park is the beach.
Besides, it's a great availability.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect for which the name "branes to Collserola" is "lexic trap": we should not imagine them as "as entering the park, but rather as the determination of zones where they can work."
The Modol, like Roldan and Bayona with the experience of the world of urbanism, qualifys the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with a "some danger".
The danger resulting from the "insecurity presented today by the public place project" after the experience of the 1980s that had in the field of the Forum "her singing lab".
The first concern is the limitation of the borders where it should be.
"Something to define means to make another step," it is in principle to move a step further.
"The new urban and planning tools must be remembered, because the current (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM) can cause a real disaster."
If we focus more on the question, Modol thinks that the valley of Collserola can be considered "park", but the barcelonic part is not, for the reasons of pure topographic.
The Modol also recalled that there was already a job done by Patronat de Colserola, which "can't end up on the trash," even when the city welcomes the fact that the city offers his grammy to hit the project from the "first time".
And he also understands that the nearbyness of the mountain and town is some kind of a passage that allows the architects to join the debate, but "he doubts" that it should be this technical profile that leads multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills", it adds), which is necessary to create: "Architects should be only tools."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complex because there is no global vision of Collserola in the electoral framework: "The 16 selection procedures have been declared, which deal with all the axis of the mountains - the sea, but there is no long study that would look at the area and understand it as a whole."
This causes at least him to join all 16 election procedures.
Otherwise, the project of one gate can implicate the concept and definition of the architect of the neighbouring gate.
According to his opinion, the city should ensure that the zone located directly above Rhonda de Dalt should ensure the entire length of the equipment zone that would ensure a passage between the city and the green.
Casino excused Jonas Larrazabal to be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the lawful officer Cadino Red granted mercy to Mayor Monterrey's brother in the process in which he was prosecuted for alleged extortion.
Manuel Jonas Larrazabal spent 72 days in prison and now will be released after the lawful officer of Casino Red granted mercy before the Second Criminal Court in the District, which discussed the extortion case in which the brother of Mayor Monterrey was accused.
After the assassination on Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photographs and videos on which Manuel Jonas had asked him to pay the economic quota to enable the city in Monterrey illegal operation in the betting house.
After the Public Prosecution, the State Prosecutor started a criminal prosecution of the brother of the panist mayor. On September 2, he was detained and detained for 30 days.
After four hours spent before the Agency of the Ministry of Publicity, number 3 for property crime was transferred to prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the capital of the State.
This is where the next 49 days remained after the second detention regulation was issued and the Agency of the Public Ministry returned the possibility of co-operating or organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to a criminal court in Cadereyta for suspicion of the extortion of Casino Red owners by a amount of one and a half million pess. However, he remained only a few hours in prison with medium-term supervision, because he was threatened by death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in the city cells in San Nicolas de los Garza during the process.
On 25 October, he was presented to the arrest issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yanez, who declared that almost two months after the investigation was gathered enough evidence to prove Jonas' guilt. For example, evidence includes the payment of the amount of 1,5 million peso to the casino representatives in exchange for a pledge that the operation would be allowed.
This Monday, the Legislative Officer of Casino Red, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, delivered to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the brother of the mayor of the region.
During the legal negotiation with the representative of the Ministry of Public Assigned to this Court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez whether damages were corrected and who of the companions decided to grant mercy.
On the basis of the official record, 197/2011 legal mercy is granted to Jonas Larrazabal. In the process taken against him, there will be no complaints. It is also not possible to request damage or punishment.
After receipt with a legal author about 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabala Breton.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yanez, moved to prison in San Nicolas de los Garza to inform Jonas that his official mercy was granted and his case was deferred to the archive.
He also informed him that the judge issued an immediate regulation on his release.
The secretary Dionisio Perez Jacome presented details about the air accident where Governor Secretary, Francisco Blake, died, and seven others.
The Secretary for Communication and Transport (SCT) informed that the results of the accident investigation in which the Secretary of Francesco Blake Mora died and that seven other people showed that the helicopter affected the territories with full power without a chance to try for forced landing.
During the press conference, Dionisio Perez Jacome, the Secretary for Communication and Transport, said that the pilot concluded that air conditionalities allow for flights before the aircraft were launched.
"The parts that appear to be suggested that the unit has arrived several times in contact with the territories, the wings have embedded into the trees branches of 25 meters from the place where the unit lost the body."
He also informed that the unit was designated for 19 persons, so it fulfilled all the requirements for the transport of staff.
Furthermore, he stated that no parts on the ground were found on the ground based on the investigation carried out in the area of impact.
"In search, parts of the plane were found to be nowhere else, so the plane struck into the land as a celiste.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 persons, fulfilling all the requirements for the transport of persons.
The terrain shows a scroll with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment the most important thing is to get the results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or more than one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Assistant Services, declared that at the moment of the attack, the presidential headquarters had a movement by speed and accident occurred in a soft upward territory.
"This information supports the hypothesis that during the accident was an ordinary cross-border operation," he stated.
At the press conference, SCT Perez Jacome named six basic points of investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with airline standards, the flight was implemented according to the visual flight rules, which means that the crew must see on the ground during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports in AICM indicate adequate conditions for launching, in accordance with this plane, the aircraft is heading towards the border, and there were a clear layer of cloud in low heights between the DF and the State of Mexico.
Selected routes:
Probably because of the dark crew, the crew was looking for a lower area and more visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Place of stroke.
The co-ordinators of the attack and the last record of the radar helicopter are consistent, it is likely that there has not been a loss of control before the attack or a violation of the flight trajectory.
Distribution of the remains of the aircraft in a limited territory:
The information that we are currently available allows us to assume that the impact occurred on the equal trajectory and from the side.
The distance of the remains of the aircraft suggests that the helicopter was incompatible at the time of the land.
There was no fire or explosion recorded.
There were no evidence of the explosion or fire at the scene of the accident.
The last results of the investigation showed that there could have been several contacts with the land.
During the field work, the remains of the aircraft were found up to 9200 feet above the sea, the territory is considered to be above the slope of seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show recordings where the route is likely to fall down.
Information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could contact countries in several places.
Following a careful search in the area of the accident, in the area that is larger than the territory of the explosion, no remains of the helicopter have been found, which strengthens the presumption that the impact occurred in the state where the helicopter was still incompatible.
The Mexican Health Insurance Institute launched gene research that causes obsession
The Institute of Health Insurance is conducting research in order to discover a gene responsible for the absorption of children and teens. The study is conducted with support of experts from the IPN Institute
The Mexican Institute for Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it has been conducting research in order to reveal the gene that causes obsession in children and young people. The study entitled "Genetics of obesity in children and youths" will enable you to gain the results of overweight.
In the report of the Head of the Research Medical Unit in the field of Biochemy from the Specialized National Health Centre of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz Lopez explained that a multidisciplinary team composed of doctors, sisters, nutrition experts and social workers was established.
This team is based on the support of specialists and students of postgraduate study from the National Public Health Institute (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnical Institute (IPN).
People can come to the IMSS sports centres in Valle de Mexico, where every youth consort will be tested for 8 hours.
He emphasized that research began in the Cuauhtemoc Sport Centre (Mexican State) and has been conducted in the Nehaulcoyolt Sport Centre since 8 October.
Once data are obtained from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue in the Independence Sport Centre (Juth of the Federal District) and eventually in the Morelos Sport Centre (North from the Federal Centre).
He explained that the goal of this research is to determine the elements and meaning of genetic development in terms of obesity, and to track the mexican children and young people's risk factors and thus prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
At the occasion of the International Day of Diabetes, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with the consent and under parental surveillance, for the application of specific questionnaires on nutrition.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family analyses of inheritance diseases to avoid risk factors that may cause diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficience.
He stated that every Saturday all participants are performing anthropometrical measurements (weight, height, passport circle), blood pressure measured, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genes are investigated (see the identification of genes that are involved in child obsession).
Cruz Lopez stated that this research reflects the concerns of the healthcare of the alarming increase in child weight.
'Health surveys carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that only in six years, there was 77% increase in obesity in boys and 47% in girls. 'The dramatic increase also occurred in the case of overweight,' said IMSS expert.
He stated that one of the reasons for searching for indicators is that the population of the country is different from the other populations of its genetic history.
He informed that the average Mexican has 65% of Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This is reflected in genes responsible for diabetes and overweight.
He explained that generally the obesity genetics are commonly explained as incapacity of burning the excessive energy that we consume (caloria) and which is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they are given a total assessment of the condition of children to find out whether they show some famous overweight or obsession.
He indicated that even the presence of dark color waxes (acantosis) on the neck and the prelocation indicates the probability that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-sugar conditions.
The information is still confidential, the doctors transmit it to their parents in writing and explain all the measurements and changes in their lifestyle to avoid diseases.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obsession and other chronic diseases: a seating way of life means a lack of daily physical activity, a full-day seat before television and use of vehicles instead of walking on short distances.
The overweight also causes a large caloric income, which is greater consumption of salt drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetic burden that is subject to this research.
In Asfalt from UNAM, there will be no bullets
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the UNAM Chemical Faculty creates modified asfalts with polymers and thus creates a mixture with better functionality, independent of climate conditions and temperature
If it was properly taken care of duration, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 thousand moles after every rain period in the Metropolitan area of Valle de Mexico, Rafael Herrera Najera, a scientist from the Chemical Faculty (FQ) of UNAM, who added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt loans were adequate, there would be a significant limitation of requests, or even could be completely removed.
In his lecture, the Technological cause of the molds, which he made within the International Year of Chemicals, he announced that the laboratory under its leadership develops modified asphalts with polymers, which should create a mixture of similar characteristics asphalt but also greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Najera believes that this type of modified asphalts could be used in places with extremely warm climate, for example in some cities in the northern country.
He explained that asphalt, the hardest part of oil, is the coupling of hydrocarbon molecules, a molecule with a large molecule mass called asfaltenes, and other with low molecular mass, which are called maltens, together adds asphalt typical viscoelastical nature.
Viscoelastical nature of asfalt is that at high temperatures, approximately 180 degrees, it acts like fluid, at 120 degrees, has high viscosity and at 50 degrees is almost solid, while asphalt tendency to break, he added.
This means that asphalt resistance in the streets is not united, but changes during the day according to the meteorological conditions and temperatures, noted the expert on chemical engineering.
The Chemical Faculty Scientist observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de Mexico are covered by an flexible plot, which forms six types of materials, of which three last are mixed with asfalt.
Among the highest layers is the asphalt cartridge, created by small stones filled in asphalt and then compressed.
He emphasized that every stone that forms a cartridge is filled with asfaltom.
When driving cars or creating pressures, it is possible that the forces in the plate are well dissolved.
If it was a modified asphalt, it would have been even better, the chemical engineer believes.
He added that the asphalt cartridge will be placed on the last layer of the soft stone, which is also a sand poured in the asphalt.
Given that this layer will come into contact with the cartridges, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt cartridge and must ensure the waste of the vehicle.
Given that a large burden will be exposed as part of the dust, the coat must have sufficient fat and must be careful about the material from which it is made.
The climate, especially moisture and temperature changes, are also a very important factor that needs to be remembered. In particular, the water has a great impact on the functionality of the asphalt cartridge.
Once the ground is wet, the water is spreading in and it is hard to get out, it causes mitigation of all kinds of slippery, and thus the rise of blades.
He explained that during the creation of pranks, the first film will be destroyed and then the asphalt cartridge is damaged. However, it does not occur at one point, but it is a free process that should be stopped at the first marks using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in creating molds, and that is why the thickness of each single layer of the slide must be consistent with the load of vehicles and must be guaranteed that this burden will not exceed, and only so we can prevent the frequent formation of motion.
Rafael Herrera warned that asphalt is still waiting for us, and research is at the beginning. For example, the asphalt emulsions that are already available in other countries are already available on the market and allow for easy repairs without being required to use high temperatures.
What was missing the Valle candidate to become a new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that contributed to Melina Ramirez Serna has not obtained Miss Colombia's corn.
That's how Valle gets the 14th title of the first multimiss.
Valle del Cauca has not reached Miss Columbia's corn again.
Melina Ramirez Serna had to be satisfied with the victory scene, obtaining a silver crown and scarf based on a new multimissile colombia.
On the basis of the results of the final yesterday in Cartagena, in which the conquered and sprayed the Miss Atlantico, the department received the 14th title of the first multimiss. Melina thus joined the women from Valle del Cauca, who reached the victory corona, but finally published by the first multimiss. Between these are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1949), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garces Alure (2000), Olga Giraldoc (2007), Aphare (2007).
The question that many have been asking.
As a result, the defeat of a great favorite who in all the previous rounds showed that it had to become a new Miss Columbia and not for free become the Queen’s Police and the Best Face of Joile de Volgue. These titles, for example, have been achieved by Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, which followed by the title of Miss Columbia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name it only the First Multimiss is the fact that she did not convince her answer to the question, "Which book you liked most and why?", put by Martin Murillo Gomez from the literary edition of Leamos.
The candidate answered:
"I read a lot. I believe very much in the role of literature, I believe it's one of the forms of culture. The book that affected me most in my childhood was "Little Prince", a very deep book.
It is a book that is part of the universal literature that we should all know. And today I have a book from Irene Nemirovski, Russian authors. It is a beautiful book called "El Ardor de la sangre".
However, the answer did not like because of the term "culturalization" and secondly because the candidate did not explain what individually mentioned books noted to her.
After the end of the ceremony, Melina declared that she was calm and is rejoiced with the result: "The world is wise what is to happen will happen.
And you people read, if you can, the little prince is a beautiful book."
One of the other hypothesis is that Valle destroyed her favorite position.
The Bogotian journalist pointed out that the biggest, most famous, and the one that took all the previous prices (Gastronomic challenge of Oster, the public title for the best art dress and the Queen's mother), has raised the envy of other peters, and stressed the queen, which then ripped up on the scene.
It was evident at the first presentation of the swims on the beach of Hilton and during two sights before the final coronation.
Even though she shined at both, she was aware that she was missing the strength and inflammation that the representatives of Magdalen and Atlantic showed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the "As at home" programme on Canal RCN, believes that Melinda has obtained the title of the first multimiss confirms the fact that a candidate who gets most titles at the contest event does not go with the queen's crown."
Furthermore, Valle had a rather disagreeable view of the media in recent days, and it was not worth it.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury of its interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
Only on the edge, two days before the election, the international member of the jury, Lucy Doughta, said they were looking for a woman who will be aware of the social needs of their country.
"In Miss Columbia's competition, beauty itself is not enough, you need to see something more than a physical beauty. You need to focus on social feelings. It is important that candidates have been involved in such projects before entering the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle's candidate lost points because of the shortcomings of her background and fibrosis, which was obvious on her ass. This is completely contrary to the jury's verdict that chose her Miss "natural beauty" for the healthy body, the right food and the responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernan Orozco, who is preparing the queen, admits that Melina had no best body, that there were better girls here, "but the problem with fibrosis on the ass, which, in my opinion, was not too familiar, they took her points until the last day."
Meanwhile, a journalist Guido Hoyos from Cromos believes that a family from Valle made a mistake when she made several surgery.
"The surgeons are fine, but they didn't make it in Valla.
The body was never her strong site, and here she chose her tax."
Because of this appreciation that the National Beauty Meeting first made, after the swimming show, there was a cruel prediction that had been fulfilled. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction Raymundo Melina had contributed to not having to give her the highest crown.
Whether it is true or not, it is sure that Melina has started her rulership year today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where it will be appointed by the National Competition itself.
Nevertheless, it is recorded as one of the queens who, despite the success of Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
This was the work of the inhabitants of Cali who identified the body of Alfonse Cana.
Cali's expert on fingerprints entered history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfons Cana.
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4th, last year, a CTI fingerprint expert entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the highest leader of Farc: "Alfonse Cana," by comparing fingerprints.
Of seven fingerprint experts working at the CTI section, this week, Eliazar Gonzalez, a man from Puert Tejad, who worked in the field of trials 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked at the city in Choco, where he had to scatter for more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the bodies needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle and after graduating the appropriate courses, he began to specialize for fingerprints. This science is dealing with a study of skin shaking, that is, hand hand and legs.
In the week when an operation was carried out against Alfonsa Cana, Eliazar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night he went to Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he was going to have to identify two bodies and suspects that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerilla in the world, so he was asked to take a card with the fingerprints of Guillerm Leon Saenze (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigator team to the place where the body was located, he didn't recognize him because of his physical perspective.
He had no beards, he was dressed like a village in a given area, without glasses, much slighter.
But the prints aren't lying.
Together with the galton lupo, the ink and the transplantator and the light Eliazar started comparing the dactyl records of the body with the card records.
The eye didn't disappoint him: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was assigned to confirm whether it was really the highest commander of Farc.
Searching for tracks
For the Daktiloscope of Sien de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos showed to Eliazar Gonzales at the press conference of Operational Services against Cana is very important.
Many people don't know our job.
Dactylscopy is exact science, without a possibility of a mistake that can play a key role in the decision-making of criminal acts.
In addition to identifying bodies, these people are helping to investigate crimes such as stealing or murder and confirm the identity of captured persons.
When they get caught, a lot of delikvents present false documents or they don't have papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and we're looking for them in the database.
The investigator said that in the case of injuries, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house because the thief was resisting in this place to extract a vault full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended to collect prints, but in this case we could get a print of the whole hand and identify the perpetrators who participated in several stealings," he recalled.
The fingerprints can also confirm or undo suspicions in the case of murder.
Recently, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around them.
On the basis of the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and the bottle's fingerprints really confirmed.
Although it can't be confirmed 100% that he was really a killer, it's obvious that he appeared on the scene of crime.
The CTI lecturer explained that the objects are "whispering with chemical or physical reactive substances".
When it appears, the transplantator or tape is used for their selection.
The prints are subsequently sent to Asif, which is the database of delikvents or the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians whose data are not brought anywhere," the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as it appears in the CSI TV program.
Just like everything that shines, there's no gold, not everything you touch, there's no sign.
However, if it can be used, the appropriate comparison shall be carried out.
"Angering" protests in New York
Thousands of manifestants were in the Zuccott Square, where they wanted to be.
Many of them waited for a cleaning order and moved to the nearby park.
The members of the movement Object Wall Street provoked in Tuesday in New York, when the court order tried to reappear to the Manhattan Square, where they were taken out in the morning. Then they tried to pick up another New York Park.
The hundreds of manifestants were pressed to the Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get through the court order, which allows the "burious" to return to situation in the place. The second part of the movement reacted to the cleaning by taking the park in the north of the city where there was further detention.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will sit elsewhere and continue to the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through the meetings and peaceful manifestations," said one of the speakers' movements "But Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray stated that the answer of the "busy" to the camp's displacement, which the mayor of New York himself ordered, Michael Bloomberg, reached the court where Judge Lucy Billings had issued an order to prohibit the violent displacement and allowed the manifestants to continue here.
Furthermore, they took another park located on the Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the property of the Farra in Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they were able to take a place, but then the police came and arrested some manifestants. Bray didn't know the exact number, but he said he saw the ties put on to some journalists.
The organization assures that several hundred people have accommodated in the place, and the delegation of religious representatives also came to express their support and also to try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti square, which is a private property, remains closed and the court proceedings are expected to be held on Tuesday and during which the legality of the early evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the displaced manifestants even distributed and distributed copies of the judicial order and even gave them to those who guarded the square, which caused "some small conflicts," said Bray, who condemned the fact that some police manifestants were beaten.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities to move members of the Okupa Wall Street movement or to use "laws that have been published after the store started, or to forbid access to a park with shops or other places they used before".
The Mayor Bloomberg stated for the press that, given this court order, the city suspended the reopening of the public space and noted the manifestants that local laws do not allow them to return to the states and spaciouss.
The highest representative of the city personally defended the morning's displacement by Zuccotti Square, the operation where 200 persons were detained and accessible because the manifestants "violently violated the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the Square because it was a "place where people were not going to protest, but to violate laws and in some cases to hurt others," because "some trades got threatous letters" and "souseds were worried about the quality of their life."
"The early cleaning was awkward and shows that Bloomberg is trying to keep his financial interests on the expense of the American working people," he added the speaker's movement that accused the mayor that "respected freedom of expression."
The representatives of the Okupa Wall Street also stated that they planned to organize "great action" on Thursday in collaboration with Community and Communities to remind two months after which protests continue. They started on September 17th.
Pamela Anderson will represent Miss Maria in a special Christmas TV show.
Together with Michael Buble and other significant Canadians, the TV program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" will appear on 1 December.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant at "Home Improvement", a swimmer in "Baywatch", a rabbit in "Playboy", a wife of the year musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be Miss Maria in a special Christmas show of Canadian TV.
The private TV TV station today announced that Anderson and the Sentimental Songs Michael Buble and other significant Canadians will appear in the TV program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st and will embodi the Virgin Maria.
The TV today showed videos from the TV program in which Anderson, also known by the Internet home pornography, appears with his ex-husband, the "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Leem, as the Miss Maria holding a doll in the sheets representing Jesus.
As Joseph appears on the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comic of Indian origin, who recently acted as a moderator on the tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheena.
Crome Anderson and Peters will appear in the special Christmas CTV singing of the Canadian Bublé, who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, which is close to controversy.
Recently, Buble called the American Kim Kardashian at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan returns to life after a ruinful earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% due to household consumption, and thus ends the falling period that began in March
Since March last year, Japanese economy has been paralyzed, now recovered from a destructive earthquake that has risen into the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country had had to face since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government have calculated material losses to $30,000 million, a wound that, despite the difficult world situation, is well healed.
After three quarters of fall, the GDP value between July and September has reached such a position that it was possible to turn the page with definite validity: GDP increased by 1,5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
The results of the second quarter - for Japanese the tax year begins in March 2012 - additionally, they assume the largest growth rate in comparison with the January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partially explained by the purchase of machines necessary to renew the areas destroyed by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
Investments have increased by 1.1%, costs fall by 0.9% from the January to March. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy comes exclusively from the impulse that forces the crisis to make us exploit or renew the infrastructure.
Japan has awakened, especially because of the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of the Japanese GDP.
This variable has increased by 1% by increasing the cost of vehicles, roads and free-time activities.
Stigma yen
The currents have been conferred into the hands of the internal market when yen - Japanese currency - has become one of the "saved values" for investors who run away from the euro area's debt crisis and from the alarming predictions of the United States. It is also a privilege that is also a great burden for export companies.
With a stronger currency, products in abroad are more expensive, which is negative for the country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, the Toyota or Sonya combined their weak results in July until September just the yen course.
While the markets continue to be surrounded by the border countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda is cautious.
"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of certain foreign economies, the impact of the flood in Thailand and the rapid increase of yen," stated yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohis Furukawa.
And indeed, the perspectives are not encouraging.
The Economic Cooperation and Development Organization (OECD) stated that most of the Member States showed clear signs of economic delay in September.
The indicator that predicts impatience in the world's economy has shown that the economy of the main powers is slowing down.
It fell by four tens to 100.4 points against 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone has even reached the average at 100 levels. It has reached the level of 99.13 points.
Athens are spreading uncertainty again
Papadimos says that savings will be approved, but the conservatives will not sign any written obligation
With rapid and risky border guarantees and the uncertainty that has reconsidered, Greece is increasingly involved in the labyrinth, which leads to a major debt crisis in Europe.
The presumption that the "shout" of the new transitional Greek government is given to Brussels rather than the true conviction of political forces is being confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lucas Papadimos, yesterday admitted that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of 100 days received at his appointment will probably be short for their application, the President of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, declared that the new savings measures will no longer support and repeat his requirement to make new elections for the expected date of February 19th.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the Summit of 26 October," said Papadimos yesterday during the parliamentary debate, which will summit tomorrow by voting the trust of the government.
A package with 24 programmes to support employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax escapes will be among the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, the message of Samaras does not clarify any doubts about his attitude: "We have committed to helping the transitional government, but we have no longer committed to anything else."
The President of the Conservatives went a little far to the EU address and the MMF. These organizations have to unlock 8 billion that Athens urgently need. At the same time, he said he would not support and sign any commitment regarding the implementation of savings measures.
The European Commission, already irritated by the impact that caused Papandre's referendum players, stressed yesterday that its requirements were infinite: it does not block any assistance unless the new government and the representatives of the main parties sign the "writing obligation without duplicateness and as soon as possible".
The speaker for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafai, explained that the inspectors from Trojica will return "very soon" to Athens and will deal with the new government on "what it needs to pay sixth part" 8 billion. There is a definitive date.
The Greek peanuts have a moment of more than one of these.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen raises Spain's privilege in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a significant position at the world level as regards microfinance".
The Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that in the last two decades, the country became the second donor of the planet, with regard to this tool of co-operation, which is based on "the instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind."
The Queen launched yesterday the 5th World Summit of Micro Loans in Valladolido with the belief that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation "is quite necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations by 2015. "In particular, it is the fulfilment of the goals to achieve a reduction of half the number of people living with less than one dollar per day, that is the amount set by the poverty threshold".
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and takes this task responsiblely", stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which will take place until Thursday, "to ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", which are primarily intended for these loans.
"We have already achieved a lot," and "a lot of challenges are still ahead of us."
The summit on micro-lending should be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that supports "base objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the aim is by the end of 2015 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services and to reach 100 million families over the poverty threshold under which they are currently living.
The concept of micro-lendings to Spain and to other countries of the world extended after "when the pioneer of the thought of Muhammad Yunus came to this journey," said the Queen and added that it was "the act of justice and the necessary recognition."
She described the father of this tool as a "amazing idealist who went to the way of fighting poverty." She met with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to meet her directly in the place of his loans policy.
Following this experience, the first world summit in Washington and other meetings such as the Coast of elephant in 1999, Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I could set up a continuous development, the Queen explained that with her support to this project yesterday, the title "the head of the family", which she had given in Valladolid "the movement of the poor."
The Queen Sofia finished her performance by calling participants to join the discussions and search for solutions and thus allowing them to continue to fight poverty.
"Ethic imperative"
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, declared that solidarity "is an ethical imperative", which must be managed by all democratic States.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to connect cooperation with developing countries only with the baloholder period, because this cooperation is a "permanent obligation".
Jimenez believes that the micro-borrows represent a "serious and fair policy to eliminate poverty", and now more than ever before, the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the solidarity criteria and do not allow solidarity to become victims of the crops.
For Spain, the micro loan is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The National Secret for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on giving confidence to people whom all others close doors. Mayor Valladolidu, Francisco Javier de la Riva welcomed participants in the city who "opens his gates to the spirit of solidarity that is infective".
CDU proposes to vote European President on the basis of general election law
Without serious difficulties for the Chancellor and the President of the Christian Democratic Party, Angela Merkel held the first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress in Libya on Monday 14 November (CDU).
The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the programme, but it was only on the fall, especially that the members of the party who consider government policy today against the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow against the Italians as lax.
The proposal on the President of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the numbers of 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegations had delayed the vote.
Several mileage sheep are at the end of Angela Merkel's performance and follows a few hours later Wolfgang Schäubla, a very pro-European financial minister, did not leave a place for doubts.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summarized into the slogon: the response to the crisis "not less Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs are dependent directly on euro".
According to the Chancellor in Europe, "The time of change has come."
This could be expressed by changes in the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of the general election law "to give Europe one face".
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposals adopted by the Congress, whose inspirer is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all the twenty-seven countries agree quickly on this revolutionary step: against Britain and the CDU leaders, Nicolas Sarkozy thinks that the same attitude will also take.
But the direction is expelled.
The delegations also rejected a large majority of the proposals to evaluate the weight of each country in the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which apparently leads to strengthening Germany's weight.
She is concerned about calming the climate within her side, the Chancellor made several references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. She did not try to gain a convention by speaking of "little" European states or states in difficulties willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
In view of the proposal concerning Europe, one paragraph of the importance of "France-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she reminded that just two hundred years ago, there was a bloody battle in Lipska.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleon Army.
What is a fraud in worklessness?
Following support, the UMP and the government shall launch an offence against labour failures.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be visited in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and visits the Social Support Office, where he will speak on the topics repeated since 2007 on the fight against social frauds and the dissemination of solidarity.
As a companion of this offensive, which is based on the will of carrying out savings in the context of increased strictness, but is not less clear from the perspective of the right presidential campaign, the right majority wants to focus on job failures.
First, due to the budget savings, the government intends to force the private sector employees on the fourth day of worklessness before they start taking support in the disease.
Clearly, without the company's consent, the employee who is sick would lose four days of remuneration, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
Measures that risk many evil blood, but which, according to Les Echos, 280 million euros could bring.
As well as measures to be accompanied by the following measures of the symbolic reach: to give public employees one day of unsaved labour failure (not yet incompatible with three days in the private sector).
While these questions are subject to discussion, the right majority also launchs the theme of frauds focused on criminals associated with job failures this time.
"Controls will be much larger and more: if you are arrived, you will return," Xavier Bertrand warned at the interview of the RTL station on Sunday 13 November.
Like in other cases, the notification effects seem rather unreasonable with regard to the truth of irregularities in job failures.
These were actually subject to constant monitoring since 2002 and political efforts that brought their fruit.
The French are not more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's first stop in a few official numbers.
According to Caisse National d'assurance of Maladia (CNAM - National Health Insurance), more than 237 million euros of daily refunds were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Health Documentation, the daily refunds with EUR 11.3 billion were 5% of health expenditure in 2008.
Of this amount, 46% were related to maternal contributions and work injuries and 54% were related to labour failures, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
I mean, only 2,5% of the medical costs.
According to Alma Consulting Group Study, the French had an average of 14,5 days of worklessness compared to 17,8 days in 2009.
The average which covers certain derogations in it: another survey published in 2007 on Monster.com working opportunities pages showed that 75% of the 40,000 questioned French employees responded that they did not choose any day of worklessness.
Another study, this time carried out by hospital insurance institutions, indicates that 37.8% of work failures were shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% lasted longer.
If we compare them to their European neighbours, the French employees are not more than anywhere else involving job failures.
One long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 total absence (for health reasons or not) in France was 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in Britain and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in job failures represents only a very small part of black work.
With regard to fraud, these are just a small range.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic controls focused on job failures longer than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM concluded that at 1.5 million checks, 13.8% of 285.000 carried out due to short-term failures of "incorrect or too long", i.e. 37.050 cases.
In the case of systematicly controlled incompatibilities longer than 45 days, 11% of cases of "unregulated or unauthorized" were calculated to 1,2 million checks, i.e. 132 000.
Therefore, the total of 169,000 unauthorized cases for several million employees who had worklessness.
A number that represents a lot less than a number that expresses black work.
According to UMP Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on this question, this number would represent EUR 9 to 15 billion missing in the selection of taxes a year, i.e. more than the total daily refunds and thus infinitely more than the frauds related to the last mentioned.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue programme to restore its economy.
On Monday, on 14 December, the ministerial President Lucas Papademos said these words before the parliament and added that 100 days given to his government would not be sufficient to fulfil this task.
"To re-establish our economy, we need support for our European partners and a new rescue budget plan," the chief of the government said when he held his first public speech on Wednesday at the beginning of the debate to vote on confidence in parliament.
The application of the decisions adopted on 27 October at the summit of the euro zone will be "the main task" of the new government, as our country's participation in the euro area is added in the game.
As a result, Mr. Papademos assumed that the country's public deficit would be "in the surrounding of 9%" of the gross domestic product since it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new savings measures
The right lider of Antonis Samaras expressed his support on Monday with already approved measures to try to escape from the debt crisis, but noted that his party does not commit any additional savings measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras emphasized the meeting with the messengers on his side of New Democracy.
We agreed on the goals relating to reducing deficit and debt and fighting waste, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr. Ollim Rehn, the European Economic and Monetary Commissioner, who warned that the MMF and the EU would not block the necessary loan of 8 billion euros without a written guarantee of all the parties to support the anticipated measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize eutanasia and associated suicide, says the Commission of Experts
According to the King's Canadian company, the Canadians have been denied death.
In the matter of palyative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together in order to ensure the best palyative care, even in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of the Canadians really accept the possibility of talking to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and making decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Company's broad report, in which six experts worked in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Commission recommends that the government change the criminal law so that it allows an assisted suicide and eutanasia if this option appears to be necessary in a patient considered competently to take such decisions.
In the beginning, experts quote the recent survey of independent Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada is situated in the 10th place, the study notes that "medication of death in Canada has led to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Medicalization yes or not, 77% of the Canadians have no access to palyatic care, we are informed by experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the desire to die at home that most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average applies to the whole of Canada, while the Québec province is the highest number of 86% of the dead in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of eutanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report find that they are against the position of the federal government, which has already said that the criminal law relating to eutanasia and assisted suicide does not want to change anything.
According to experts who have also undermined the control of all countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered criminally, there is no evidence that this discrimination causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in practice of eutanasia or assisted suicide to persons insufficient or disagreeable.
On the contrary, Mr. Jocelyn Downie, a co-autor of the report, confirmed the teleconference last night more than a number of cases of these overwhelms just in countries where eutanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Eutanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are inclined by eutanasia
Recall that, according to an investigation carried out by Angus Reid in 2010, 85% of the Canadians have already been expressed in favour of eutanasia because they believe that they will allow people at the end of their life to make their suffering easier.
And 66% believe that the legalization of eutanasia will not mean that we are sending the message that the life of old or disabled persons is less valuable.
With regard to persons who practice an assisted suicide, 41% of the questionnaires believe that they should not be prosecuted.
In the case of maintaining or interrupting the care of the patient, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest that, in the list of their recommendations, the criminal law indicates that derogation from the treatment for which there is legally confirmed rejection is not criminal.
The Commission also requires experts to be educated to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of their life without fearing the criminal prosecution.
In the matter of palyative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together in order to ensure the best palyative care, even in cases of cancer.
Finally, in the case of palyative or final silence already used in Canadian health facilities, the Commission requires that it be considered at a time when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain, for eutanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.
Exceptions of other experts
Some medical experts have already expressed their remarks regarding the conclusions of the King's Canadian Company's experts.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, medical specialist, has qualified the position of experts-signators of the report as "extreme" among other things because he does not limit the practice of eutanasia to the sick at the final stage.
"This opens the door to the situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who had over 18 years could ask him to help commit suicide," said Pierre Deschamps, who studied the summary messages yesterday.
P. Deschamps also emphasizes that it looks like the authors of the report are building a person's autonomy over all other values that create the social prevalence of society.
Because in society, he says, there are warning marks and restrictions."
The medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "potential objections to the conclusions of the report qualified as "manifest for Eutanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Canadian Company, doubts particularly the dates of the report on the absence of doubt in some countries where the eutanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the US state of Oregon.
The king of Jordan invites President Assad to resign
Damaszek's talking about "complette"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Basar al-Assad's representatives showed yesterday before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria, President Basar al-Assad, who resisted Russia with support and spoke of "complet" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership in the Liague of the Arab States, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, have taken a view for the departure of President Assad.
Jordanian King Abdallah II was yesterday the first ruler of the Arab State who invited President Basar al-Assad to enter Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the regime were killed," he handed over power.
"If Basar had his country's interest in the heart, he would have to demiss, but would also have to create conditions necessary for the new stage of Syrian political life," said King Jordan, a country neighbouring Syria, in an interview for the BBC station.
On its side, the Turkish diplomatic chief Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the efforts committed to Turkish mediation in the Syrian business regime has not been crowned successfully since the beginning of the year.
"They in the Middle East do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them, they will leave," he declared with an instance on the neighbouring Syria, which Turkey is applying to increasingly harder lines.
The United States rejoiced in "promoting consensus against Assad and the dishonesty of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, the countries like Turkey apply increasingly stronger tone" in Syria, Mark Toner, speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced, during that time, 16 civilians and 19 members of the pro-regional forces died in Deraa in the south of Syria.
According to this non-governmental organization, two other civilians were killed in the shooting and focused shooting from heavy bullets in the city of Jobar in the area of Homs.
However, during the press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moullem estimated that the country was "going out of the crisis".
Otherwise, he responded lively to the decision of the League of Arab States to stop Damascus membership, which, according to him, constitutes a "dangerous step".
Sirie "does not turn away," he added with assurance that the "compounds against Syria will not succeed".
After its decision to stop Syria, the membership is currently reflected in the League of Arab States "mechanism of the Protection of Civil Persons" and plans to send 500 protectors of human rights, journalists and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also welcomed to the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from repress of a regime that he considers being "paranoid".
The new special meeting of the League is called for tomorrow to Rabat to take the opinion on the solution plan, which was decided on 2 December and which was particularly expected to remove the army from the cities of the disputes and to release the detainees.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov considered the decision of the League of Arab States "fake" yesterday, while China encouraged Syria to accept the crisis's plan, while it was completely avoided by supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and victims after Italy
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for a little time to form his team and start applying the program that will contain "wedding" to regain the credibility lost in the last months of the government of Berlusconi.
The former European Commissioner discussed with political parties yesterday before meeting the representatives of experts and employers today.
It should be composed of a relatively thin cabinet consisting of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti talked about the important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a Member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in the interviews, after meeting with the designed ministerial President.
The Chairperson of the Parliament's Ambassador, Gianfranco Fini, expects Mario Monti to ask for confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
Mario Monti will end the consultation by introducing a small team of 12 ministers to President Georgia Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented on the nerve on the financial market yesterday and asked for time.
In the "democracy apply precise terms" as regards the preparation of the government and its programme, he emphasized and added that "the markets will be patient and understanding."
His appointment by the president was initially accepted favourably, but the concern was reappointed after the unexpected failing of industrial production in the euro area.
The named ministerial Chairperson should comprise a team that mainly includes technocracies, even though he stressed that he would also like to accept "politicians".
He expressed the conviction that the new government will endure until 2013, i.e. until the next elections.
According to the President of the Ambassador's Chamber, Gianfrance Fini's new government will be trusted by Parliament by Friday.
Mario Monti promised after his function, he would deal with urgent urgency and aimed at making Italy "new become a strong member" of Europe.
The speaker of the European Commissioner Olli Rehn emphasized that "the new government has not changed our diagnosis of Italian economy."
The European Union is convinced that, despite the savings plans adopted in the past months, Rome does not reach its objective with a balanced budget in 2013 and requires new hard measures.
The Chief of the Business Union, Emma Marcegagli, who meets Montim on Tuesday, focused on the need to renew the economy 'or the country that does not show growth cannot respect deficit parameters.'
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognised for its expertise and independence, "professor" symbolizing the authors of "a call to seriousness" and "other Italy", represents for Italy "epochal change" after 17 years "berlusconism".
A great unknown time of life will be for his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid preliminary elections, since Italy has to place the national debts for EUR 200 billion by April 2012.
Soviet Scientist helped the Iranian nuclear programme
Soviet scientist Vjačeslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator used for atomic weapons, announced in Tuesday an American NGO organisation specialized for atomic risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) and other documents fled from this UN Agency.
Last week, the MAAE announced its "value concern" about the possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the ISIS Institute widely drawn from the MAAE documents, V. Danilenko (ar. 1934) should work for three decades since the 1960s in the Soviet Military Research Centre in Cheljabinsk (Ural), where it should be dealt with the production of synthetic diamonds by the explosion method.
In 1989 or 1991, he had to leave the centre to establish a nano-diamant company in Kijev.
The economic difficulties of his companies were to lead him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he would then cooperate from 1996 to 2002 at the Iranian programme.
In its last report, MAAE reminds the "jasnimous information that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" was based on the work of a foreign specialist who did not only well know this method but who, as a Member State informed the agency, worked during the substantial part of his career on this technology within the country's military nuclear programme from where it came from."
The anti-muslim criminal acts and delicts increased by 50%
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of criminal acts and delicts targeted against Muslims increased almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence were slightly declined or slightly increased at the same time.
According to these numbers, the total number of violence committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% of the increase in the process against the Catholics, decreased by 4% in the offences against the Jews and total increase by 14% in anti-religious criminal acts and delicates.
The total number of "hatred criminal acts" has very easily increased to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% of religious differences.
"After staying in 2009, it is disturbing to see these criminal acts and delicates rise again," the organization of Human Rights First dealing with human rights emphasized," the rising of antimuslim violence is particularly important," the organization added in its communication.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hated criminal acts, must be considered serious violations of human rights," Paul Legendre added one of the leaders of the organization.
"American government can and must do more to deal with these criminals," he adds and estimates that this could take place by improving police reports of "hatred criminal acts".
"A hated criminal act" in the U.S. federal law is an inheritance of the time of fighting for civil rights.
This law was adopted after Martin Luther King died to punish violence related to race, colour of skin, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter microblogger service website introduced a change in design on Monday to allow its users to observe the activities of successors, which somehow illustrates its Facebook services.
New offers "action" and "name" allow better and directly to know the activities of others who are watching you or those whose answers ("tweets") are you.
This allows you to know whether they allow to monitor contributions, whether they are logged in to new accounts, whether they have favorite contributions, etc.
This new Twitter face was tested "in August on a small percentage of users" before it was expanded to the whole network on Monday, told the AFP speaker Twitter Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, who was famous with his little instinctive function, with terms rather unrecognizable (RT for repeated spread of the contribution of someone else, next Friday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi and un public plus large avec un manipulation plus comparable and celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users immediately in their "tweets" differently assess the importance of this innovation.
"It's useless, it takes a lot of places and it's too much like Facebook," writes @jamb123.
"The Activity function will help me better track some of the elements of my Twitter," sent @dannycronstrom.
Austria
Writing a golden rule on a balanced budget to the Constitution
The Government of the Great Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, who are in Austria, decided on Tuesday to write the "Gold Rule" of budgetary policies into the Constitution to reduce public deficit and avoid the possible reduction of Austria's rating agencies (AAA).
It was the very social-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, who announced this decision at the conclusion of the ministerial advice in a situation where Austrian public debt is 74.6% high above the criteria of the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solventity was reduced by only one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay the interests by three billion euros more every year," a multicancer and a Foreign Minister, Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger, argumented.
Austria thus refers to the request of the summit of the euro area held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the chiefs of States and governments urged by the end of 2012 to reduce public deficit and achieve the balance of public accounts to the constitution or to the law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the "German model", Germany was the first European country that accepted such a rule.
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP) each year and starting in 2017 the public structural deficit of the federal State shall not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the common countries, as well as the community, will have to report a balanced budget.
The goal is to reach a public debt under the criteria 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong only
Noda threatens a new intervention on the devious markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to move again on the devious markets if he would only continue to strengthen.
"We will hit as we did last, if we find out too much instantness" in the shift course of jena, explained the Y. Noda Senate.
On Tuesday, he only regained the historic values that the Japanese authorities forced to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold yens for dollars to reduce the value of Japanese currency that only recently overcome the record of the dollar valid since 1945.
But only from then on, it has increased regularly supported purchases of investors who consider it "safe port" in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and the European crisis caused by debt.
The dollar rearranged under 77 yens on Tuesday and the euro dropped under the symbolic patch of 105 yens near the levels that have led to the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar valued about 120 yen and EUR more than 160 yen.
This inflammation of the Japanese currency damages island exports, because it excites the price of Made in Japan and reduces the value of profits obtained by Japanese foreign companies when they are transferred to domestic currencies.
"Japan is recovered" from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and the wave of tsunami devastating the region of Tohoka in the northeast of the country, stressed Y. Noda, who fears that this irritation of the jene will still kill in the egg of a slight recovery.
The third economic power of the world renewed growth in the third quarter (1.5% in view of the previous quarter) for the first time in one year through an examination of export growth and consumption of households burdened by disasters.
But the minister's president believed that the high value of a jene did not reflect the "national economy of Japan".
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ), which started its political and monetary council on Tuesday on the two-day meeting to take all possible measures leading to the weakness of the yen.
But the more governor of this institution, Hirohide Yamaguci, noted that BoJ had already adopted "suitable measures" suggesting that no additional currency weaknesses could be expected in the Wednesday.
During his last meeting at the end of October, he increased its purchase of state stock leaflets by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) and increased to 55.000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling of the amounts devoted to purchases of various valuable papers in order to flood with liquidities.
Eurozone:
The rates rise, the storms fail
The risk of debt crisis is still undermining European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of governments in Greece and Italy and the better numbers of growth in France and Germany, the rates of weak countries continue to grow.
The European Bureau remains concerned about the stability of the euro area today, on Tuesday 15 November, falls into negative expectations.
In Paris at 10 hours, the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
"With new tensions around the rentals of the euro area, which are in difficulty, markets with shares throughout the world are only part of the recent profits."
"Nervous investors are only too much aware of the risk of the disease," explains Terry Pratt, an IG Markets trader, quoted by the Reuters Agency.
The market in Tokyo was closed by 0.7%, which suffered due to the concerns of the participants of the market on the ability of Europe to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and the shift will continue only in the narrow variation corridor until the investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized," estimates Mitsushige Akino, manager of funds at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This restart of uncertainty about the future of the euro area damages the currency itself that continues to fall on Tuesday.
The Euro is delivered to the lowest level since a month and a half.
At 10 hours, the European currency is valued by $1.3570 at a drop by 0.4%.
According to traders, the currency was withdrawn after the CDU party of the Chancellor Angela Merkel at her convention adopted a proposal on Monday for an assumption of withdrawing from the euro area for countries that are in trouble without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far outside the border 6%
The interest rates at loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very disturbing level.
This morning, on Tuesday, the return of Italian ten-year bonds reaches 6.85% and the profit of Spanish ten-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates of the Southern European countries, but also in France, continue to strengthen the concerns of market participants.
The Chief of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, required time on the market so that he could fix the situation in Italy with a poisonous amount of its debt.
The new Greek minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the application of the decisions adopted on 27 October at the summit of the euro area would be "the main task" of his government.
Spain is relocated in a deliberate market line when the country is held on Sunday to the Parliamentary Parliament.
The distinction of rates ("spread") between the ten-year obligations of Germany and Spain has reached a new historic maximum.
In the expectation of numbers of eurozones notifying growth
Statistical figures say that France has recorded economic growth by 0.4% caused primarily by household consumption, i.e. a little better than expected growth by 0.3% in the third quarter.
The French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies, however, revised the numbers down for the second quarter to decline by 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And in truth, it's the fourth quarter that's most concerned about ecomoms.
On its part during the same period, Germany has registered growth by 0.5%.
The first estimates throughout the euro area are expected at 11 hours, while the European Commission has just noted the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must win the dogmas
If there is any topic that cannot be taken on the basis of short-term considerations or under emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and electricity price have a direct impact on buying power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is natural that the election meeting is an opportunity to meditate on such deposits and the location of energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful when all economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
The French must establish their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic development will now cause a double demand for electricity by 2050, if we do not want a significant part of the world population to eliminate important parts of life.
At the same time, it will be necessary to face the lack of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity, while it cannot be forgotten that the necessary need to reduce gas emissions caused by glass effects to combat climate change, which is the theme that is currently out of environmental debates.
The accident in Fukushima has no effect on any of these parameters.
That's why Germany remains in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
However, this is not a case of Belgium that is subject to its decision of need to find another source capable of replacing itself, nor Switzerland, which considers to be the right to build only electrical power plants of the last generation.
On the contrary, UK, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
The United States decided to expand their park after Fukusima by renewing the construction of a power plant discontinued after the crash of the Tri Mile Island.
If the German model based on renewable energy is sometimes presented as an example, reality resists it.
The choice of Berlin will be irritated by the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on gas, especially imported from Russia, with a rapid increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of electricity on natural gas and carbon.
We'll feel all these unpleasant effects in a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves us to think about it.
The European champion in wind power plants, from which he takes 30% of its electricity, is also one of the biggest coal and gas consumers due to wind irregularity, which makes the CO2 emissions and the Danish prices higher by 65%, or 50% than the European average.
On the contrary, our necessity will pay our neighbours for electricity 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While the globalised energy cost represents a key factor in competitiveness and the guarantee of maintaining industry in the national territory, the French companies benefit from the latest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would cause a strong increase in the price of electricity that would make illustrative beautiful declarations of reindustrialization of our country and the defence of buying power.
The price that the large majority of French refuses to pay, as it is essentially not against this energy, as the public opinion research shows.
Recall that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to build the sector with 125,000 direct jobs and with 41,000 resistant jobs.
Many small and medium-sized enterprises that create jobs that cannot be transferred to abroad have a large number of exporting sectors behind international markets.
If France decided to leave the core, she would sacrifice a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lose the euros of the country for the export of nuclear equipment and services annually.
Which electricity owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to operate for 60 years while the decline of his manufacturer was planned?
In order to solve the energy equation, it is necessary to admit that there is no magic source for energy production, as there is no devil.
The development of low CO2 emissions equipment and renewable energy devices carried out by the French industry AREVA tests the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the National Nuclear Safety Office, which conducts a non-promissible and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams whose professionality is recognised have the idea of blood safety.
In 50 years, he met the nuclear industry three serious crashes.
The only one in the Tri Mile Island was in normal operating conditions and remained without human victims and environmental implications.
In Blackbyl, the drama caused the concepts of the reactor and unexcusable human errors.
In the case of Fukusima, some forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented scope that caused tens of thousands of people to die.
The nuclear industry will take lessons from this crash as did in two previous cases.
The fruitage of this step and cooperation between French and German authorities dealing with nuclear security, operators and constructors is that the EPR type reactor represents the concept that can resist such phenomenons.
While all interested parties who wish to build a nuclear power plant consider it, the stop of its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift to the AREVA Group and the EDF competitors and the release of the way to enable the leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best solution to energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machination control the debate so crucial for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is it difficult or chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out for Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised from various angles - the aggregation of police, courts and administrations of the underlying policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "the country of human rights", which France praises.
Recently, it was a administrative disturbance, which was the object of foreign students who became current when the Minister of Interior (see Liberation of 23 May) said that France "does not need foreign talents, messengers and waitress."
But so far, it was just a little bit discussed under the angle of the economy.
It is necessary to say that in this area there is quite a wide match between left and right.
On the right tone in 1976, Jacques Chirac stated his statement that "900000 unemployed people should not be a problem in the country where 2 million immigrant workers are located" and on Michel Rocard left, when he said in 1990 that France "can't accept all the poverty of the world."
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of invasion of the hords of Polish installers in the French territory was shared on the right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are viewed as burdens for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity that we're trying to give to immigrants.
In his programme, Franceois Holland is limited to banality when it claims that joint development will allow us to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may apply in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As the economics Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron reminded of this in their recent published work synthesising the latest knowledge of immigrants (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.m.): among specialists there is a wide consensus on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, remuneration and employment in countries that immigrants accept.
Limitation of immigration reduces growth and damages employment.
The concerns of the impacts of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and create pressure on reducing their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are actually much more complementary than substitutes for French employees by carrying out work in sectors with lack of employees.
Low qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not sufficient to offer places.
Positive impact on remuneration
As the surgeon will have problems with work in the country where there is lack of anesthesiologists, this complementation between French and migrants causes immigrants' arrivals to have a positive impact on the remuneration and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% would result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
Nevertheless, it does not take into account the fact that the diversity of bringing immigrants contributes to the creation of thoughts and economic growth (a high share of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prices holders; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded).
Migrants are also pure social systems contributions in European countries average 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that an immigrant in Germany, at 30 years of age, will bring a net contribution (minimum expenditure) 150000 euros for the entire life of its public budgets.
Nicolas Sarkozy said at the beginning of his mandate wishes to come for missing percentages of growth "s priced teeth".
Those teeth that served for immigrant resistance had the effect of the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think of European democracy
Democracy is rare and very fragile.
The European continent should remember that, even though it was made up in Athens two thousand years ago, it was experienced during the 20th century of the world war tragedy, totality regimes, holocaust, gulags, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some people could believe that democracy would definitely triumph over its enemies will be enough to make the election and make it as direct as possible.
However, it was known from Napoleon that it was easy to think.
General election law, if it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient and can become a "mean of impression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, department and power control, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe that we experience is an economic crisis, but it is from the beginning of the crisis of policy and democracy.
The recognition of the mistake of the Greek referendum type yes-not will in this direction have the value of double discovery: the discovery of the need for a great return of political power, but also the discovery of the disturbing feeling of his inability, its inappropriateness.
This ambitiousness must be considered so that it can be overcome.
The truth is, the lead lines of democratic enlargement have moved today and many of the Republican warriors are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We can't get anything if we require a number of national referendums organized in accordance with the requirements and disorganizedly.
Bianko exposed to the European absolute monarch or jumping with bound legs to an empty nationalist depth: what choice for citizens!
No, we don't want a gilotine knife, but a common, full-right, peaceful and continuous election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we wouldn't know where to stop the calculation - because the crisis is in Europe.
Because this is a whole Europe confronted with market dictate and rating agencies who suffer from their incompetentness and their lack of solidarity.
Because this is all Europe, which is humiliated at the international scene.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe -- but this is the whole Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty and each of its nations with it.
It is urgent that the management of the European Democratic Supremeness project should be restored.
For only together the Europeans will be able to reduce the difficulties of their debts, to get rid of the market government and to prepare the future.
The outcome of the crisis will assume decisions at European level that will not be able to be adopted without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to a disaster.
After we've long fought against this proposal of socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today is urgently demanding European economic government.
Behave.
But thinking of this without stronger political and democratic integration, and living as such citizens, would be a new foolishness and a new blind street.
We must take the new stage of European construction.
For the Republic of France, it was necessary to be the Republicans.
The revolution in the interests of this could not be enough.
This lesson goes on.
We must build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This will only be possible by building Europe more politically democratic and real European democratic sovereignty.
Let's become Europeans to build Europe.
"No contact" chip cards are spread
The optimistic atmosphere will be opened on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris the world fair of chip cards.
In 2011, Eurosmart should end with an increase in global sales of cards with microprocessor (bank cards, SIM card phones) by 11% on more than 6 billion units.
The most notable is a segment of uncontact technology that allows you to pay in a bunch of transport or to manage purchases by just approaching the card to the reader.
This year, 460 million chip cards against 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share should still be increased in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and achieve approximately 10% of the total market with chip cards (6.925 million cards).
After a long time in the APEC stretch, Europe is gaining a territories in uncontact payments.
Approximately 26 million banking cards Visa is already equipped with this function and 75.000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, the beginnings are modest: 400 000 uncontact cards were issued Visa.
But the big business chains work in two.
Carrefour issued 2,5 million incontact cards this year, Pass MasterCard.
In order to set up a higher speed, it is necessary that banks equipped with their clients from now on.
"Two large French companies have been obliged to distribute systematically in the future to their clients without touching banking cards," said Gerard Nébouy, Director-General Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first stage to pay for the future: the mobile phone.
NFC Technology (Near Field Communication) required for the implementation of transactions is only a small number of devices equipped today.
"They got late."
"But their real embarrassment should happen next year."
"For 2012, we estimate their sales in the world at 80 to 120 million units," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmarta.
But the banks are already preparing.
The Bank of Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test carried out in Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
The iPhone approximately 200 clients and colleagues will be equipped by a supporter allowing uncontact payments.
The BPCE Bank has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Also, the Social General announced yesterday that she was preparing to make an offer allowing her clients to pay mobile phones without touch.
Terrorist front touches from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is disturbing the links between Al-Kadzi in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect of Boko Haram.
Long-term suspects that there are links by the Al-Qaida terrorist group in Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian Sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Algerian Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even confessed that Algeria has "settled certainty".
"The way both organizations operate, and the intelligence reports show that there is great co-operation among them," he explained without further clarification.
It seems Paris has similar analysis.
The investigation of the kidnapping of two French in Niger in January 2010 could help light the connecting bridges.
After the members of AQMI were kidnapped from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léokor and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers in the operation carried out by special French units.
The French and Nigerian investigators were going to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorism axis
The analysis of the calls leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to the Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigator is particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to the Nigerian, who has long stayed in Maiduguri, the city in the north of Nigeria, which is a collision of Boko Haram, and the other to the man that is said to be close to AQMI and the sect.
"It is progress, but it must certainly wait for more convincing evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sects are looking forward to external financial and intellectual support and that they are increasingly increasingly active," the mild statements of the Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuvo.
In the past months, this "support" was more and more apparent in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which now include human victims or more complex explosive devices of the same way as the equipment used by the AQMI organisation.
Since then, the international community headed Washington has developed pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group a communities of enlightened mystics few good interests.
Fast success
The secta Boko Haram was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mixture, school and fundamentalists of Mohammed Yusufa. Boko Haram, which in the haussa language means "the Western education is sin", approves the establishment of the Islamic Emirate in Muslim North of Nigeria.
This poor region has such a rapid success.
The sect is politicized and demands strict compliance with the Islamic law of the sharia, while its advocates are starting the fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, the Boko Haram stakeholders become extremely active and multiply their attacks against police stations.
The government's response is usually the same.
The army's surrounding the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the sect Mohammed Yusuf was caught and killed in prison.
Since that time, the group is radicalized and left its work in the north.
On Christmas 2010, the assassination in Jos, where 80 people will die, will be followed by another in the capital of Abuja.
In June it's again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police's command at its first suicide attack.
And in August, the UN's local office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axle in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now concerned with all security specialists.
Now, when Al-Qada of Islamic Maghreb was surrounded by Mali and Games and Al-Shabab Somalians from the Al-Shaba movement, the Boko Haram appears as a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, when he talked to President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé, he said that France is in an emergency and is ready to "prove all information".
World by candidates for President
In matters relating to China, Iran, or helping Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are in advance of simplification and ignorance.
Can America weakened by the crisis manage the world through simple or even simplifying thoughts?
When listening to presidential candidates, the voters might think that.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others repeat noise statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which is already traditionally a strong point of republicans.
Frequently unfounded slogans of China, Iran or helping Israel are connected.
Mitt Romney, the best settled candidate in the nomination of the Republican "Grand Old Party", threatened by calling the Chinese to the World Trade Organization and their charges "for manipulation with their currency", which is the notorious theme in America by migration of all its parts of the industry towards Asia.
It's worse if this has to contain the launch of a business war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obam in China, and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost struck in the attitude that "agrees" emotions.
He demanded a hard but constructive dialogue with Peking (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who's in the last place in the election estimates, remains unheard.
To the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if the sanctions were not successful when he stopped his nuclear programme.
"If I'm chosen, I'll capture Iran," said the fanfaronic.
"If Obama will be elected again, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to increase Israel’s military assistance, accusing Obama of disappointment in his obligations against this partner.
Herman Cain, the second best placed candidate, proves an awkward ignorance of documents.
Recently, he called for a sharp position against the Chinese military threat, because Peking's trying to develop nuclear capacities" - apparently unknown fact that China has owned a nuclear weapon since 1964!
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants hits against Iran, says he's ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists prohibited by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Caine, Perry and another candidate Michel Bachmann.
Everyone is far away from the Republican candidate John McCain in 2008, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple thoughts, and yet he won a cold war.
They remind Obama himself was an amateur and added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They emphasize the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the nasty departure of "boys" from Iraq, his excuses relating to Libya, making him a weak sticker
But the attack is not easy.
The population judges the national security policy of President Obama, who removed Ben Ladin, rather positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military interferences that lead to separation.
And with arguments that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically in order to be able to rescue its leadership, Obama knocks to a better place.
Nord Stream, new port of Russian gas in Europe
The remote gas engine Nord Stream connecting directly Eastern Europe to Russia and led by the bottom of the Baltic Sea began to work.
It must add a gas equal to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated in the Nord Stream inauguration, a new gas pipeline that will connect directly Russia and Germany under the sea.
Symbolically German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Minister François Fillon and his Netherlands colleague Mark Rutte turned together controlling the russian gas ventil into the Western European network.
This new gas water starts to run each year to Western Europe 27.5 billion additional cubic meters of Russian gas first pipes of 1,224 km connecting the Petrohrad region with the common country of Mecklemburg-Pomoran.
The second pipes to be completed at the end of 2012 will allow for a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, which is a quantity equal to the whole French consumption.
And it's already reminded of the possibility of building a third gas pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, this enormous building has the nature of winning.
The project was strongly protested by Poland and the Baltic country.
Nord Stream will actually allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany without being led by a third State (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing somewhere in power: the possibility of pushing the Russian threats to close access to the Western European markets becomes more difficult for them.
It was strongly expressed by Warsaw when she did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet Covenant", appealing to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means that it's a theme of political sensitive.
Western Europe, with its support for this Russian project, has gained greater confidence in its shopping.
But it's at the price of energy weakening, because the project created cracks between the east and west Europeans.
Russia has only been able to promote its vision of direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries with high gas consumption, whose beds are approaching its end.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new arterial that organicly connects us," confirmed François Fillon at the festival opening of this gas pipeline and demonstrated the great gas contracts of both political and economic things.
This all explains the broad smiles of the leaders of Gazprom present in a large number in Lubmino, the gas seat.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a significant technical act.
The submarine pipes are made of steel with a concrete coat to protect them from the coals of the sea vessels.
It is located on the bottom of the sea in the average 200 m depth.
It was necessary to avoid mine fields coming from World War II.
"For security, almost a hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, speaker of Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase the protection of fauna and flora.
The only pipe is a long metal snake weighing as 242 Eiffelovec, which is not interrupted at all of its length either by ventils or maintenance stations.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the leaders of the project rejected it when Sweden was just a little desirable to see the Russian state company, as it was permanently sitting at their coast.
"We will stop the gas passage in less than one minute," says Jens Müller.
In the case of intimidation, the gas contained in the gaswater shall escape into the air.
But this case is considered to be unlikely for the builder, because the quarrels were designed to produce intitigation once in a hundred thousand years.
The control of the state of the gaswater outside is carried out by the submarine robot pulled by the ship, while the gas supply is controlled by a device circulated inside.
This cigar shape with a diameter of 1 m is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is pushed by gas.
For the purpose of all three days of the road by 3 m/s, it shall provide precise information on possible metal deformations.
The remote gas pipeline was designed to work for 50 years without needing a minimum repair.
Gas circulation is easily secured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bars on start and 100 bars targeted.
In order to implement this project, five companies have joined the forces.
The leading position remains Gazprom, which holds the share of 51%.
The German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Netherlands Gasunia and the French GDF Suez Group (9% each).
These five companies created a common company called Nord Stream, authorised by the construction and operation of gas pipelines.
The subject has a seat in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely useful.
The gazprom subsequently rented this company for five years of contract, which can be renewed, all its capacity for gas transport.
"Gazprom will have a total capacity profit, whatever the quantity of real transported gas is," Jens Müller states.
The financing of the construction of gas pipeline was secured from 30% shareholders and 70% bank loans.
The total labour costs should reach 7.4 billion euros for both pipes.
For the GDF Suez group, the investment costs were 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are sure that their costs will be returned, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gasoline is coming from the Baltic Sea in Lubmino on the sand coast with pine forests.
The ventiles high 4.5 metres form the gas gas gate gate gates.
The sensors measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the gas coming before they are transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
In achieving full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - tag recorder
The Italian Moleskine company, which has been founded 50 years ago, wants to rejoice the writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, the hours spent by writing at the light of the candles.
The notebook Moleskine is easily recognised with its black orange boards and its sheets send white colors as if by aged times.
For Moleskin’s record, as we know him today, was born in 1997.
The Italian Modo Modo settler in Milana will then decide to market a new designed but distinguished recorder.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, is concerned with the introduction of a new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique "moleskin" (skin imitation), which, for example, is used to adjust the surface of the knives.
This type of notebook was very valuable to writers and travelers.
"Moleskine returned to the familiarity of an old and forgotten object that was an icon of adventurous artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the leading person of the mark at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, Sales increased by 26% to settle on 12.7 million pieces last year.
The situation is a distant secret production from the first years when only 3,000 records were made.
Moleskine crosses the Italian borders and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It's difficult to build some artificial portrait of the buyer, because the notebook takes businesses as well as students or professionals.
The image of the Moleskine notebook is that his owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open spirit.
A small Italian company, who had 12 employees in his early days, has almost a hundred today and has two offices in Milana and the other in New York since 2008.
He dispatches his records into the books and through a chain of FNAC trades in small boutiques in the centres of towns where he was able to plant his identity.
"We followed the spirit of time and this need of new writing, through the stormful development of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently the mark opened the exhibition "Prohibition", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August at the occasion of a film festival in Locarn, she also introduced a new recorder reminding a leopard.
Moleskine profits from its success and this cultural aury and diversify its products: bags, diaries, pencils, knives on laptops ... The mark is spreading into a number of carriers.
Success that has awakened envy: on autumn 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by investment funds SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine history.
Why is such a high share of unemployed disabled workers?
About 19% of persons with disabilities are looking for work.
Today it's opening 15 weeks for employment of disabilities.
In spite of the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed disabled persons is even twice higher than the average, i.e. 19% against 9% for the entire population.
Is it creepy?
"No, it underscores Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association of Adapt, organizing a week for employment of disabled people."
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable."
"There was no percentage of unemployed twice, but three times higher."
"But there's nothing left to do."
It is necessary to say that the unemployed disabled persons keep numerous obstacles before they get to work.
It is an older person: 37% is over 50 years old (17% average).
They have low qualifications: 80% has no maturity and only 10,000 students are from 2.3 million high school students.
And eventually - long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% in disabled compared to 38% in the average.
In fact, such are criteria, which especially complicate the return to employment and represent the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, the Director-General of Tremplin Association, which was established in 1992 to help businesses adopt disabled workers.
So much about the objective brakes.
It remains unspeaked, ways of thinking that definitely develop, but too slow.
Study conducted in April by IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cite found that the questioned managers have a "slight level of knowledge of disabled persons" with "excessive idea of persons on a drive chair and mental or mental disadvantage".
The result is that private businesses with over 20 employees are still far from reaching targets to employ 6% of disabled workers established in the 1987 Act.
The latest known numbers from 2008 are equal to 2.6%.
"We are now moving around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, authorized by selecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
The proof is the number of "punished" companies, as well as paid amounts that dropped between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 guilty companies to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which has increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in great submissions."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of businesses with 20 to 49 employees are employed by disabled workers compared to 82% of businesses with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "What luck"
Before Tuesday night (20h45) the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that would bring them this friendly fight.
We're not going so far to write that there was a merger between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other at the Tribune of Stade de France's viewpoint just and Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months after his angerous gesture in the fight against Turkey, a Belgian coach found only words of praise to his player.
"I am very satisfied with Eden and his progress, and with the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," assures the French Lille player.
With regard to the difference between his performances in the club games and the fights of the national men," it is the same thing, it is justified."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not a case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my brand."
Hazard, protected against Romania on Thursday night because of this fight against France, comes to the Station in Saint-Denis to finally "flash".
You can't mention the term "happy".
Play against Bleus, which he encouraged since 7 years and in their victory drags in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This must contribute even more to the "specific" character of this meeting.
More about that, because they're opposite Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he reminds.
"We crossed at once."
"I can play against them, it's just a pleasure!"
Heartless Leekens also reminded "honor."
"Happy" fighting "against a holiday."
"Hare" also constate in the quality of the "souseds", that France has become a team of very high-level more than a year after a trauma in the South African city Knysna" again."
"Laurent Blanc did a huge piece of work," he broke up.
Although Belgium will be missing at the next European championship, the technical footballist would like to be seen in 2014 in a plane with France direction... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians become great," he underlined.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will realize it for the next matches," including against France.
Portugal very self-conscious
The Portuguese Coach Paulo Bento begins with a great optimism barge against Bosnia (22h00) in Lisbon.
On the way there, both teams missed realism.
"In the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and mostly a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt about him. The Portuguese football team, in which the steering is in 2010, is qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal divides from happiness in fact 90 minutes.
There is one game left and one rival - Bosnia.
With the awareness of the Friday result (0-0) in hell of Bosnia Zenice, it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal must have had more than an hour of advantage, but it was not able to give such a rare goal that would relieve him.
"It's a good result that, however, contains a risk because we didn't give the naked outside."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will go before the audience that should create a hot cottage there, even though the match is definitely "very balanced," says an optimist, but a smart-looking Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have the top," said a twenty-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be on Euro 2012," still referring to the follower Carlos Queiroze.
The indecisive Friday game in Bosnia forces Portugal to give goal and win.
The indecisive match can be sufficient to Bosnians who also need to give goal.
"It is a good result that, however, contains a risk because we didn't give the naked outside," Bento regrets.
"We will play against a team that has great technical quality and has the players with large individual quality," he added.
As in Zénica, Portugals will be interested in developing the Bosnian team from the beginning of the maximum pressure so that they "don't give them time to think."
Good idea, under the condition that this time it turns out to be realistic.
