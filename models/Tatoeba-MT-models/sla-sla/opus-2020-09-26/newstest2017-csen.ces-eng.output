The Czech roads invested in the modernisation of more than 31 billion vehicles.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the past six years, he invested a state carrier in modernising vehicles over 31 billion crowns.
Third of cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
Parts for modernisation in each year except 2012, however, are gradually declined.
The Czech routes have invested in the modernisation of vehicles over 31 billion crowns in the past six years.
Third of cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
The amount of money was shown in reducing the average age by two years in locomotives and separate units and by six years in classic vagons.
The larger share of investments was given to the carrier in regional transport, where about 60 per cent of those money were headed, and 40 per cent invested in the renewal of vehicles for remote transport.
The average age of locomotive and unit is currently 19 years old.
However, the modernised older vehicles are calculated as new in this indicator.
If the modernisation of the vehicles were not calculated, the average age of the drive vehicles would increase by ten years.
Some of the elders are in the average of personal vagons whose average age is 23 years when they are uploaded.
The average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years if considered only age from the date of production.
Classic cars consisting of wagons and pulled by locomotive, however, in recent years, the Czech and the world railways are gradually disappearing and are replaced by motor or electrical units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the locomotive was lost from 280 to 223 pieces, similarly declined the number of classic wagons from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of the year.
In particular, the carrier was removed from old vehicles equipped with skin seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the ride.
From January to July, he let the carrier crush 110 of these cars.
For example, investments to the vehicle park are planned to implement in the near future, such as buying 50 wagons for speed up to 200 miles per hour that the carrier plans to put on the international line of Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract to buy electrical units for the local rapid tracks.
The Treaty counts up to 30 motor pieces and 20 pieces of electrical units.
The officials know about illegal advertising for four years, they can't get rid of it.
We're completely powerless, they admit.
It's been about a quarter of the edition of the online journal Currently.cz watches the story of the billboard in the southern Czech Republic, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipna, where there is not only a touristly interesting walk in tree crowns, but also the Olympic Park.
The road managers know they're standing black there, but they say they can't do anything about it.
Similar advertisings are hundreds around the country, maybe thousands.
According to officials, there is a charity law that makes illegal mobile billboards not possible to be removed immediately.
The need is a complicated bureaucratic wheel first.
But in the meantime, the company changes the name and the office is short for it.
Or it's enough to move the advertisement by a few meters and the official process must start again.
The road and road management admitted a quarter of the year ago: the main move from the Czech Budjajevic on Lipno stands on our property at the public road of the billboard black.
Even for three months, the officials did not have enough to get rid of unfavourable transmission structures with a giant plaque.
It's like no one's got to mind standing right next to the cart, in a 50-meter protective zone where nothing can stand for security.
The road managers claim that the billboard for a hole law can't just handle it.
You can load him and take him away.
"We can't just afford that," said the speaker of the Driver and Driver of Nina Ledvin, referring to a complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must be prevented according to the law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began online journal Currently.cz to monitor on spring detail, while not unique and indicates a general problem that does not know how to deal with states and authorities effectively and quickly.
Only in the southern Czech Republic, the editor counted tens of similar mobile advertisings placed against the rules close to the cart or close to it.
Similarly, there are other parts.
"We have a problem to force the companies to remove the boss," confirms the head of the Czech Buddhej district office of Jire Klas, whose colleagues are dealing with similar stories.
According to Class, there is a hole law that connects officials.
First of all, he has to speak to the owner of the billboard to give the advertisement away.
But the chiefs of companies are often inadmissible or they know the fifth that is already Currently.cz in the past described when the problem began to be more detailed: enough mobile advertising stands to move a few meters and officials can throw the previous invitation to remove the black advertisement into the trash.
That's because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it, and the coordinates suddenly disagree, they view it as a new device and we have to refer to the owners again," explains Jirie Klasa.
The new law won't help.
The change could have been made by a new law that will ban billboards on the roads from September next year and limit them to roads I. class.
The criticism indicates that rules for illicit and easily transmitted advertising will remain the same as ever.
And the authorities won't be so relieved.
Firms can continue to earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year and no one can make it.
For example, the billboard tagging Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
The officials are well aware of it: the Czechobudean magistrate is currently running three administrative procedures for blackly built billboards.
The company is threatened by a three-thousand penalty in each management.
It is more advertising, which were placed in the protective zone of the I. Class road.
Driving is not finished yet, says Jaroslav Mraz, head of the transport committee of the Czechobudean magistrate.
The advertisement, at least Currently.ch is interested, even though it is not yet figured between these cases, soon, but with the highest probability it will come to them.
According to speaker RSD Nina Ledvin, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removing, and the case would get to the district table and then likely magistrate officials.
The Commerz Billboard company belongs to the suspected companies that can't contact.
She doesn't take the mail, and the official seat in Jižkova canceled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind her.
In the past, the company's mail went to the Southern entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who spoke about a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representation of the Hyundai mark.
Fischer, whose company EuroBillboard rents and offers them to the bookers, but in the past he rejected any connection.
During the spring this year, when the RSD began to incentive Currently.cz interested in the advertisement on Lipno, Fischer left the state officials to send a letter for the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his pension, where the new company is allegedly sitting.
No one from this address has contacted the drivers of the highways so far.
It's a vain fight.
Similar silence or untransparent changes in the seats are not unusual.
One company has gradually been sentenced for two million crowns a few years ago.
But she changed the name and the ICHO and there was nothing to deal with.
The executor's case returned, the ads went on, maybe elsewhere.
We're against similar companies and their business practices quite helpless.
It's like a fight against windmill, acknowledging anonymity preserving one of the officials.
None of the laws in this regard are yet solved.
Currently.When she spoke to several Members who have been involved in the problem.
But they haven't developed any activity yet.
On the contrary, the messengers appeared who wanted to extend the term to maintain billboards in the main Czech communications.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only for national, but also regional and general policies very sensitive and somewhat schizofrene topics.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand after their limitations, on the other hand, they need them to be advertising in pre-electoral campaigns.
I don't stop the relatively impression that if something doesn't work, it's necessary to change the laws.
Agriculturals have less grains this year, but more rapes and maque, they estimate statistics.
According to the estimates of the Czech Statistics Office, the harvest of cereals this year will be 6.7 per cent lower than last year.
However, this year’s fertility exceeds the average in the last five and ten years.
The higher will be the rape harvest (o 3.9 per cent) and maque (2.5 per cent).
The harvest of cereals will be 6.7 per cent lower than last year.
Agriculturals are scraping 7.2 million tonnes of grain.
It comes from the estimates published by the Czech Statistics Authority by 15 July.
The first estimated month ago was more pessimistic and it assumed a decade decline against last year.
Last year, the harvest of cereals was superimportant.
This year's fertility exceeds the average in the last five and ten years.
On the contrary, this year will be a higher rape and maka.
The rapes of the breeders will scratch 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they got under the roof of 1.256 million tonnes.
This year's fertility could be 2.5 per cent higher than last year.
The estimated decline in the production of cereals is caused by a reduction in hectare by 3.7 per cent to 5.71 tonnes of a hectare, and the decline of the hectare.
Agricultures have accommodated three percent less fields this year.
The wheats, which are the most important vegetable for Czech Republic, are estimated to be less than 3.3 per cent this year.
The farmers put her on more fields.
However, the lower hectare will be signed on the decline, which falls to 6.04 tonnes.
Approximately a fifth decline in statistics is assumed in the spring egg, which is most commonly used to produce beer.
The decrease in yield is 15.2 per cent lower, but also lower hectare profit.
The winter egg will be born by 6.3 per cent more.
The harvest of the grain will also grow.
The breeding rape statistics estimate to 1,305 million tonnes, which is more against last year.
The fertile surfaces have expanded by 7.3 per cent.
But the hectare will be 3.2 per cent lower than last year.
The annual breeding rape exceeds the ten-year average by 13.3 per cent, and is seated on the surface by a third of more than ten years ago.
In the last four years, we've also received fields with maco.
This year, the farmers put him out on 35.543 hectares.
Against 2008, when the maque in Czech Republic was grown on the records of 70,000 hectares, there is a field of half.
Thanks to the expansion of fertile surfaces this year, the harvest of the macho will be richer.
He'll stand up against last year by 2,5 per cent to 27,423 tonnes.
But the hectare profit will be 6.1 per cent lower.
The cops blamed two men for a knife and a machete attack, and the court sent them to arrest.
The police accused two attackers who attacked a knife and a mačeta of a fifty-year-old man on Tuesday in Olomouca.
"Although the attacker tried to escape, they caused him urinary and cutting injuries that demanded treatment in the hospital and other treatments," said Police speaker Marie Strabáková.
Both obvious perpetrators were arrested immediately after the attack.
The applicant filed a proposal to the court for their imprisonment and the court met him on Friday.
Both men are in danger of three to ten years of imprisonment.
Policemen charged two detainees for the attack of a fifty-year-old man in the center of Olomouca with knife and macheta.
The assaulters caused him screwing and cutting injuries, the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceding the incident between two groups of people, which happened on Tuesday on the right afternoon at the Freedom class, stated by the police.
The perpetrators ended in custody, informed the Olomouc police speaker Marie Strabbak.
A massive struggle between the two families took place in the garden area in front of the Bar Tratoria near the center of Olomouce.
After aggressive word breakdown, two attackers attacked with a knife and a mačeta of a fifty - year - old man.
Although an attacked man tried to escape, he was caused by urinary and cutting injuries that demanded treatment in the hospital and other treatments, the police speaker said.
In a struggle that raised great attention in the center of the city and which had to interfere with several police guards and officers at the scene, it was family disputes.
Forty - year - old man from Slovakia and the seventy - year - old man in Olomouca accused them of a severe attempt to hurt health and exploitation.
The prosecutor filed a proposal to the court for their imprisonment and the court satisfied it on Friday, complemented by the speaker.
The mačeta was used in the Olomouca Centre at the mass battle of the attackers five years ago, only a few dozen meters away, before the Discotecture of Varna at Riegro Street.
The police said that about ten aliens attacked the guests of the company standing in front of the entrance.
The police said they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court was then punished by a conditional punishment by two attacking strangers.
The abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you're walking around them every day.
One of the most screaming examples of the unused and empty house is a large building of the former IPB seat in the middle of the Sennament Square.
She's supposed to work like a hotel a long time ago.
But still nothing.
That you need to build new apartments and offices in the metropolitan?
What about the existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the center of Prague in the immediate area of the Václava Square, there are several bond houses that, despite their position, size, and often even the memorial protection, are only empty and polluted.
We have chosen properties in the center by using the Emptydoma.cz project, which maps long-term empty property in the Czech territory.
The houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, the untransparent relationships between companies or belonging to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
The empty homes are more than homeless in Czech Republic.
Let the owners pay special taxes for them, they want an initiative.
They almost shot Fidel Castro here, and Hitler's brother lived here.
The writers showed another Small Page.
Shopping apocalypse.
Business centres in the United States are emptied.
On the walk of Prague unknown.
Carlin was a luxury suburb.
The territorial plan reminds the New York Manhattan, claims the architect.
Clinton's husbands earned $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to publish its tax confession.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, Bill Clinton's expression last year, earned $10.6 million.
More than a million dollars were devoted to Clinton's charity.
Most of Clinton's income -- over six million dollars -- are for their speeches.
Trump of its tax confession refuses to publish.
An American Democrat candidate to the Presidential Office of Hillary Clinton published her tax reports on Friday, making it more pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same thing.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, Bill Clinton's expression last year, earned $10.6 million, announced the AP agency.
Most of Clinton's income - over six million dollars - is for their speeches, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton started her campaign before the elections.
The tax report showed that Clinton's spouses took a federal tax from income of 34.2 per cent last year and then a tax from the government and local level of nine per cent.
In total, they paid 43.2 per cent of the income tax.
However, Trump has a problem with a similar step, so far, he has not decided to publish tax confession.
There's a certain possibility that Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all, Clinton wrote on Twitter a few minutes after she released her confession.
Clinton is repeatedly returning to the secrets around Trump's income, inter alia in order to raise doubts whether her rival is as rich as it claims, the AP Agency stated.
Trump's wealth is estimated to be billions of dollars.
The lower earnings would harm the reputation of the Republican candidate as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, who in the Tandem with the former First Lady candidates for the post of the Vice-President, published today a report on his taxes in the past ten years.
Together with their wife, Anne Holton, they gave 7.5 percent of their funds to charity and took 25.6 per cent of their salary on taxes last year.
In Nigeria, the vertebrae broke again.
The Islamist from Boko Haram defended the consistent vaccination and killed the doctor.
In Nigeria, children's defense cases have been reappointed.
In the northeast of the country, the government declared extraordinary vaccinations, because there were two children infected with this disease.
The vaccines transported helicopters there.
In the affected area, islamist terrorists from Boko Haram, who were defending vaccination and even killing doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was undetected.
In the northeastern Nigeria, extraordinary vaccination of children against the armor, because there are two children protected by this disease.
In Africa, the branch was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government announced that a million children in Borno will be enrolled in the state of Borno and another four million in the surrounding states.
The Nigerian military helicopters on Friday, according to the AP agency, quickly transported vaccines against the children's armor to the affected northeastern part of the country where islamist terrorists from Boko Haram.
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the virus in the area has collapsed undetected for many years.
The extremists from Boko Haram in the past defended vaccination and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also failed on Thursday to get the doctors into the areas where the children with the branch were found.
Both infected patches came from refugees from the part of Nigeria newly released from Boko Haram.
The director of the WHO section corresponding to Michel Zaffran BBC station, said that the vaccination in Nigeria will begin next week.
In Borno, the Islamic Radical Group of Boko Haram has been active for a long time.
The area was accessible to international organisations and governments until the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram was able to weaken in this part of the country essentially.
The Nigerian Minister for Health, Isaac Adevole, admitted that the new cases of defence are a great disappointment for the country, because Nigeria wanted to announce that the defense was removed next year.
WHO noted that it was possible that although the disease has not occurred for two years, it was spread among the children.
The children will now be expected at age five.
In 2012, half of the world's defense cases were in Nigeria.
While in 1988 the defense was still in 125 countries, it is now only in three areas - in Afghanistan and Pakistan and north of Nigeria.
The pope met former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the motion stories of the fallen women.
Pope Francisek met with twenty former prostitutes who fled the police from the band of passages.
The pope heard their hard life stories and called them to look with confidence in the future.
Francisek wanted to note this meeting of trafficking in people and invite them to strengthen the fight against him.
Pope František met 20 former prostitutes in Rome whom the police liberated from the power of the band of passages.
The head of the Catholic Church listened more than an hour to the motivated stories of falling women and then called them to look with confidence in the future, stated the speaker of Vatican.
Among the former prostitutes František visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one of Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age moves around 30.
All of them, according to Vatican, were exposed to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution.
In his visit, František wanted to draw attention to trafficking in people and invite him to strengthen the fight against him, said the Pope's speaker.
Francesec often points attention to the fate of people on the edge of society.
For example, on Thursday he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived to Vatican this year in April and June thanks to his personal invitation.
France will strike the production of the Jehadists.
Without the help of the Muslims, it won't work.
France has to help the Muslims themselves in the fight against radical Islamism.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Vallse is preparing major changes in the functioning of mixtures and spiritual education.
Since last December, we closed 20 moshes and prayers.
And the next will follow, the Minister of Interior announced.
In the country, there are over a hundred Jehadist producers.
"If the Muslims do not help the State in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this confession of freedom," Prime Minister Manuel Vals said.
In particular, it is intended to ensure that only possessions who have been educated in France in the moshes and prayers.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding from abroad.
At the moment, about 20 percent of the money comes from a foreign country to build new messes, most from Maroc, Algeria and the countries of the Persian Gulf.
And that is why the preachers get into the mixtures that can sell radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that islam is compatible with democracy," the Prime Minister added.
The new French Islamic Foundation will be the key to ensure that these goals are fulfilled.
It should work as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
In the country, the French foundation for Islam, which was established by the Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
The foundation had already contributed to the transparency of financial flows between the meshites and the countries that funded their construction.
But the institutions soon affected internal disputes and rivality.
"It's a total failure," said Valls recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, the debate on a new institution that will replace the non-functional foundation.
All the other terrorist attacks in France have been speeded up, which, in the name of the Islamic State, have betrayed Islamists.
The French Minister of Interior, Bernard Cazeneuve, recently heard that the new foundation will be created this year in October.
He will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mixtures from domestic resources, and also to supervise property.
For now it is not clear where he will take money not only to build new patches but also to different education centres.
However, several proposals are considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on food hall.
It would be paid in practice by the sellers to hall food for providing certification.
A part of this money would then travel to the foundation's bond.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by the French passengers who go to Mekka.
Every year, there are about 30,000 people on a traditional trip to Saudi Arabia.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, only preachers who have been through special educational programmes in the French universities should work in the future.
This should ensure that the preaching is in line with democracy.
We'll close the radical mixtures.
The French government is at the same time in pursuit against radicals.
And the others will follow, the Minister of Interior recently announced.
In France, there is no place for those who report hatred and disrespect some principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
Apparently, about 2500 moshes and prayers are affected in the land.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have exposed about 80 possessions and are considering it in several other tens.
But not everyone thinks that government steps can significantly affect radicalism.
Those who want to be radicalized will do the same thing.
Because this is not happening in the meshites, youths are radicalized on the Internet, says Northine Labatová, an expert from the National Research Centre.
The Dear Kelemen lost in the first round of sprint with Baugem Star.
The Czech Road Road Cyclist must kill the progress to the 8-final.
The Road Cyclist Paul Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro after the qualification of sprint between the best eighteen in the first round of the fight with the French giant Gregory Baugem, a silver defender of the previous games in London.
The procedure to the 8-final must be killed in repair drives.
At the start of the Royal Disciple on the road, 27 riders were set up and the best Czech roadman at the moment had accorded the fourteenth best time.
He got a twenty-five-five-start in 9,969 seconds.
At the main stage of exhaust, Baugé, who already had bronz from Ria in the team sprint, was waiting for him.
Even though Kelemen concluded to the experienced French, he had taken care of the procedure.
A great performance shineed by the golden defender Jason Kenny.
The eighty-five-year-old British took the third of the fastest 200 history and qualifications won in the Olympic Record 9.551.
Then he was easy to deal with the last progressive German Maximilian Levy.
The British Quartet was also successful with Bradley Wiggins, who took a new world record of 3:50.570 and went to the final.
The current maximum (3:51.659), which belonged to the British for four years since the Olympiade in London, has been improved more than a second.
Young doctors push: They want fresh wind in the field
Young doctors met to endorse new steps in their fight on a new treaty.
The Council of Young Doctors (JDC) in the British Medical Association (BMA) must request the entire Council to support other business activities from the beginning of September.
The JDC says that the ministers were unable to solve the issues relating to the contract.
Young doctors and medical students in July voted for the refusal of the contract agreed with BMA.
58% of its members who participated in the elections were rejected.
In a letter published on Thursday night on Twitter, JDC President Ellen McCourt stated that the government remained “here still silent” to the questions, which is a great deal to reject the contract.
She said: “In this light, the JDC's executive authority decided to reject the proposed new treaty completely and request new formal proceedings in all matters.”
In response to the silence by the government today, the JDC Executive Board formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve the running programme of compromised business activities from the beginning of September.
The dispute led young doctors to report to six stags this year, including the first genderal stakes in the NHS history.
The Leader of young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed conditions of the contract BMA recommended.
The members of BMA at the meeting before the vote of 54,000 young doctors and students of medicine said that the agreement was good and should be adopted.
After the voting, the Minister of Health said that the treaty would mean a burden for medicines in England.
Russia and Turkey: the Unitedation of "incompatible"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and notify the formal ending of eight months of long word wars and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterparty in the precious palace hall in Petrohrad, I had the impression that Ankara wanted more for this reconciliation.
There's been a hand-supplier, yes.
But Putin did not laugh, and heat was barely blew out of him, even according to his measuring standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the contrary, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" to Mr Putin - five times, as one of the reports reported.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to its level before the crisis, but will be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing wrong ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm expressed the exact opposite.
But the persistent cold that grew out of Putin showed that the Russian leader did not forget anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his initial speech: the destruction of the Russian fighting plane by Turkey at the Syrian borders.
Moscow's reactions were angry at that time.
Putin was handing the wounds around him, and Ankara accused that Moscow hit the knife in the back.
The disturbance was bigger that it came from a suspected friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
A massive universal campaign against Ankara was led by the state-controlled media after a month.
Suddenly it seemed like Turks could do anything.
More serious was the accusation of the highest government officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syria's parts controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
This guy denied very much.
But there was an official message in Petrohrad that it was time to move on.
Finally, this meeting happened only because Putin got an apology he asked for from President Erdogan.
Russia could also announce some victory.
The benefits of the reconciliation statements are clear for Ankara.
First of all, Erdogan was almost freed from power during the last month, and he therefore needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey also apparently shake them.
There is also an economic motive.
The Russian sanctions had a severe impact -- particularly the cancellation of charter flights, which will transport several million Russian tourists annually to Turkey' coast.
This number decreased by almost 90%.
With regard to Russia, the tour of operators and charter companies will actually breathe here if there is a renewal of flights.
They make money on the Mediterranean travel in the end of the season.
Even this week, the state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when imports of agricultural products from Turkey were allowed again.
"The Tourists there, the tomatoes back here," as the report reported in the newspapers of Intelligence.
However, the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what she thinks is a chaboous response to the attempt to turn.
Furthermore, long-term immortality long-term talks on EU entry and entering Putina -- who will want to use the cooling and cut Turkey's bonds with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won the bonus points when Ankara asked him to help the chosen authorities after attempting the pump.
You must understand that for Moscow, which has deeply rooted fear of the change in the regime, it is given.
So the summit in this pompéz, directive palace of Russia and Turkey has allowed me to show what one of the analysts described to me as “incompatible associations”: how the forces of two countries that feel to be rejected and used by the West.
However, despite publicly showing mutual reconciliation, differences are essential among these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow has recently played a peacekeeping role, but where Russia and Turkey are standing on the opposite sides.
It could be said that after almost three hours of opening talks, both presidents at the press conference indicated that they had not even mentioned the question.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answers to the question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to raise these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both States could find a common speech in Syria's question.
But after months of open enemy -- and given the risk of a total disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighting plane -- it is certainly better that both leaders are speaking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS mark should be pressed into the role of back office.
Royal Bank of Scotland is lost for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS mark was connected to global ambitions of the bank.
She fell out of them when she almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At that time, the strategic marks used RBS to protect other consumer finance marks.
She was behind millions of pounds issued for sponsoring international sports, from the Six Nations football championship to Winbledom Andy Marray.
But now it was decided that it was better to give more to national marks.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers, but it will not launch new shops.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, except for the centre and the code of stocks on the bureau, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank mark is already used for customers in the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller marks for private banking that will get more forward - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During the journeys to customers and employees in Inverness-shire McEwan answered the questions of Ross McEwan.
BBC Station Scotland said: “RBS mark will cease to be our investment mark and the mark for which our employees are working, because we now become a much more mark bank.”
Because the bank itself became a global mark, it became a global tag, as well as RBS.
Now I'm saying we don't have global aspirations anymore, we have efforts focused on the home scene.
Each of these marks will mean something completely different in their own communities and our workers will work under these marks.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsoring of the Six Nations Championship, prepared a profile of individual sport sponsoring marks.
"There is a good time for us to move to the bank of the marks, because the basic question (which we ask) is how to focus on being a better customer bank?", stated the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would be very cynical if we said we'd become a great bank for customers, and they'd represent those marks.
But along with how we focused on the needs of customers, not on our own, I think there are a lot of changes.
We can remind these marks again, I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dettori in New Market on the horse Preelection led to the target of 3000. winner.
Dettori is shaking champagne after the double winning in Newmarket brought him 3000 victories.
Joki Frankie Dettori secured the 3000th victory in Britain in Newmarket on Friday.
This lover reached his second victory at his local track - on the horse of Preelection, which John Gosden trains.
The fifty-four-year-old Italian is the sixth joke, which has achieved such a result in equations.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-fold champion of Dettori, who won the Ghayyar horse, said, "It's strange."
I'm very impressed because my family is here too.
I'm very glad that this happened in Newmarket, because right here I've screwed up 30 years ago.
It's not a huge action, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved, and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when after winning brings Preelection
Two jokes of this milkman have reached in the obstacle - the champion of Richard Johnson and the 20-fold champion on the pension of Sir Anthony McCoy, who led over 4 300 winners to the target during his career breaking records.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4 493 winners in career
Frankie is one of the best jokes in modern times, and it is not surprised that he reached a million who had only reached a few riders before him.
It's a stylish and strong, but it's just his tactical fistron that distinguishes him from other riders seriously.
He's a fantastic ambassador of achievements, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he didn't go only on weekends and a great range, he would have already had 6,000 winners!
But the truth is, Frankie was riding a winner in Great Britain after the majority of his 30-year-old career, and that's really something.
He has a living nature, which is good for the British achievement sport, but more important is that he is an incredible joke.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his renowned summer jump
From the flying finis to a summer jump - Frankie Dettori was a mailer of British equilibrium achievements for two decades.
It was like a mountain road ride.
The countless number of winners of great races, including his famous “great seven” in Ascot. He also survived the crash of the plane and had a ban on launching for drugs.
Three years ago he stagnated the first time when he returned after a six-month start ban, but proved an incredible internal strength and despite all the doubters, he returned in the best form.
And maybe it won't be the last time - Dettori has already declared he would like to continue to race for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin released the Chief of Presidential Office Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released Sergei Ivanov from the head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin’s closest colleagues for many years.
Thirty-sixteen-year-old Ivanov was appointed a special representative for ecology and transport.
The statement from Kreml states that Putin “released Ivanov from his services to the head of the Russian presidential office”, but there was no reason.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno, who was the representative of Ivan since 2012.
Forty-four-year-old Wyno was a diplomat before.
He was born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, promoted at the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the ambassador in Tokyo.
On the websites (Russian) it is stated that he later made a presidential protocol and a presidential office.
When he appointed Putin, he said: "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities of the head of the State within the meaning of the draft laws and control of the extent that your instructions are respected.
Putin said on Friday the Russian TV station that Ivanov asked him to release him from the post and recommended that he be replaced by Vajno.
Will they persuade the smiles?
This step has totally mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest colleagues of Vladimir Putin, and as Putin worked for KGB.
As the chief of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At the meeting with President Putin, who was emitted by the state television, both men declared that the head of the president's office was leaving on their own request.
But the smiles to cameras convinced only a few people -- especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is it the consequence of a struggle for power?
No one knows that yet.
But the official claim that a man who was once considered as a possible president has suddenly desired to lead the ecological policy of Russia has encountered great inconfidence.
The Cremle page quotes the notes for Putin, in which Ivanov states: “I was true that in 2012 I asked you in the interview to give me this very difficult post, even if I could say a problem post, he conferred you for four years.
Apparently, I was head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov was captured by the post in December 2011.
He has previously served as Vice-President of the Government and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and earlier, as Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was commanded by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed his representative.
When Putin came to power, he appointed John one of his five closest colleagues.
It even speculated that Ivanov could be the successor of the Putin State after his second election period, since the third period would be constitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken by another close Putin's colleague Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin was only three and a half years later a prime minister before returning to the presidential office.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the series of the thoughts of a criminal, was released after he hit the director.
Gibson was involved in physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The ABC and CBS television stations produced by the series were notified in the joint declaration of its release.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before he announced his dismissal.
There were creative differences in the scene and I disagree.
I'm sorry that this happened," he said in his statement.
According to the ABC and CBS television station statement, the details of how Gibson's character will disappear from the series that tracks the FBI team's stories later.
Forty-fifty-five-year-old actor celebrated the main role in the sitcom of Dharma and Greg in the series has been effective since the first series in 2005.
"I love the thoughts of a criminal and I have put my heart and soul into them over the last 12 years," Gibson said in his statement he issued on Friday.
I was hoping I'd be in it until the end, but that won't be possible right now.
I'd like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team, and mostly to the great fans that this show could ever be hoping for.
The return of the series to the twelveth series is expected on September 28th.
In Banff, fish landed in the garden in a mysterious way
The man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish can be sand coals left there.
Bain, living about 500 meters from the sea, published a short film on the Periscope channel in the assumption that someone could help him explain how about 5 centimeters of fish got into his garden.
Queensfery Crossing: Most now connects with Fife
The project for 1.35 billion funds should be completed by May 2017
The engineers have connected the northern platform and Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - the bridge is now connected to Fife.
So it is the first of the four locks between the “flowers of plots ” which are now almost completed around each of the three pilons of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now long 600 meters and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
There are 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 suspension lans.
The project for 1,35 billion pounds should be completed by May 2017.
The economic secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the land to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
In this project, we are all witnessing how construction engineers used more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, the closing between the viaduct and the plot of the bridge was a delicate operation that required extraordinary precision.
At its place now it is totally more than 79% of the total area of the bridge, concrete for the last part of the plot is now pouring in Rosytha, so the entire platform is ready to lift up on the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first closing in building every bridge is always an important million.
In this amazing project, this closing represents a peak of land construction.
After installing the last part of the road plot and its connection to the expanding platform of the North Tower, we had to close the last space on the north side - to the ground.
We did this by stretching the northern viaduct to the southern direction of 700 milimeters.
This was massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
It is massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighing about 6,000 tonnes, and it was needed to be dragged up to about 3%.
It's delicate because the tolerance with which the team worked was very small - only a few milimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Saved in Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happy to be alive"
Three men are “happy to be alive ” after the water slipped from their fishing boat in England.
The Moelfr RNLI rescue station announced an alarm on Friday at 13:20 of the British summer time after the crew saw the incident in the Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim safe, while their boat continued unmanagedly.
"We have seen their boat circles near them and we have thought of the worst," said the rescue boat manager Moelfre Vince Jones.
"The strong wind, fortunately, took him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men saved the local fishing ship, the third man aged 60 years was found out without a rescue vest, while fighting.
They were all transferred to the coastal rescue boat and transfer back to the rescue station.
Jones said: “Three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely injured.
The ship's engine had a rope for an emergency shutdown, but somehow there was a disconnection from the person that was driving the boat when there was a turnover.
Someone on the top of those boys had a protective hand.
The Judge refuses to deal with the case because of the Tlushor's wife.
Peter Tluchor is one of the three Members who, according to the accusation, should have received from Prime Minister Nevreme and his then chief of Jana Nagy's political strike, thus a lucrative post for political departure.
In 2012, it was the approval of the tax package.
Snaider, Fuxas and the Tlushors allowed him with their resignations.
Then they appeared on the influence posts in state firms.
That's why they also faced the suspects of the bribe and ended for a month in custody.
But according to the court, almost 2 million crowns have waited for compensation.
The fat now acts as a witness, after the invasion of the Supreme Court.
His wife is working in the court building on the Fruit Market and dealing with civil disputes.
However, Judge Helena King wants to be cautious (deciding criminal matters - recognition red.) and to avoid possible objections.
The case is likely to be charged with another Prague courtroom.
The King has released the guilt of Jan Netime twice before Nagy.
It was an alleged abuse of military intelligence to monitor the first wife of Prime Minister Netime Radka.
In this case, the Tlushor didn't figure it out.
According to Jaroslav Ortman's lawyer, it is an unnecessarily excessive response.
I think the impartiality cannot be interpreted so that the court is exclusive if the Witnesses have a wife or a relative in court.
I'm afraid there would be nothing to judge, noted for a diary.
"I think it's slippery," he added.
In the case of political hits, Roman Boček, former official, is also accused.
But according to his lawyer, Peter Toman would have a chance to succeed.
The District Court for Prague 1 discussed the 13 June charge of the former chief of the Prime Minister Petra Weather Jana Nagy, and others accused of the abuse of military reporting.
On the picture, the Untime comes to court with her husband.
The dentist was supposed to deal with Peroutk's statements.
For example, the exposalance wife was to judge President Milos Zeman's statements about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Perutk.
Zeman declared his sympathy to Adolph Hitler.
One of the school girls is already dead!
Apparently, the girl died at an air attack of the Alliance Forces.
She and her two same old girlfriends flew to Syria last February from the London Airport Gatwick.
The British Ministry of Interior did not comment on her death.
The young london women who fled from home were secretly transported to Syria through the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, and Kadiza Sultana have taken place according to the media for their next former schoolmate from the London School of Bethnal Green Academy.
The case last year caused a huge wave of attention and tension in relations between Britain and Turkey.
The British security units estimate that about 600 British Muslims have travelled to Syria, some 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined the IS radicals and other groups.
Those who come home are a terrorist threat to Britain.
Work of dreams for hundreds of thousands of salaries.
Excellent paying jobs that you don't even need high school.
That's how an I.I. look at the first look of the work.
And often for the other one.
Because it is not only a high salary in the Czech relations (in the Prague you will earn up to 180,000 CZK) but also extreme benefits.
The reason is the huge lack of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists missing.
Apparently, almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in Czech Republic.
Among the most searched are the statistics of the Grafton Personal Agency programmers, developers, network engineers and app specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
Hence, it does not compete with candidates on the labour position, but a job position on candidates, commented Jitka Součkova, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
High school is not necessary.
High school education, however, is not necessary for italianists.
School education means a good basis and is a common indicator of intelligence and the education of the candidate, but often does not have much to do with knowledge of development.
Developers must continue to teach new things, which once the high school does not replace, says Peter Kubačka, director Monster Career CZ.
It's the most money in Prague.
The wages of the Inhabitants are moving highly above the Republican average.
Most money comes to Prague and Brna, it's no longer such a hitparade in the regions.
"The remuneration conditions in Brna are comparable to those Pragues," confirms Cubaka.
The highest earnings will be reached by technical directors.
In Prague and Brna, they can come to 120 000 - 180 000 Kč.
In other regions, the payment is lower, but it does not fall below 80 000 Kč.
The demands are also the IT project managers.
They can earn 60 000 - 100 000 CZKs when they enter.
The fight is also about graduation.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the office of work, it does not apply to the italians.
Because if the companies retreat and repay an expert from another company, they will like to touch their graduate.
Because they can raise him according to their own.
They're not going to go through without their tongue.
Knowledge of foreign language is appropriate in every profession, but it is necessary for the Iitians at least a pleasant English.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a need for some IT position.
On the other hand, we meet a number of cases where companies are looking for a specially educated and experienced person and satisfy only the average knowledge of English.
For example, if the aid worker controls more foreign speeches, it is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, the Director of Cubacka adds.
Yoo in Google, there's paradise.
Just quietly envy the Czech employees of the Google employees.
Of course, it is a flexible working time for them, a possibility of homework or a variety of shortened jobs, not just for mothers.
"The newly baked dads offers a company a four-week vacation after birth of a child," said Martina Jonek, speaker Google.
Snapping also includes health care for employees and family, food, transport, training, wellness or massage directly at workplace.
Whoever wants to educate, he has green and doesn't matter what he wants to learn.
But that doesn't end the benefits.
Such a full free refrigerator is definitely not to be thrown.
Healthy lunch (in some places and breakfast and dinner) is available every day.
Furthermore, in all offices there are so - called microwave where people always find a healthy meal, the speaker proclaims.
And that nothing doesn't have to be thrown out, so what he doesn't eat, he's gonna put in boxes that employees can take home tonight.
And the reason for these for the Czech relations of incredible benefits?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"For Google, it is not important that employees sit at the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, movements or development, ideas and innovative solutions," the speaker adds.
The UN has criticised Bulgaria sharply for the criminalization of refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, UN Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday that he systematically violated human rights of refugee crime.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "related serious concerns about Bulgaria's lack of international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in the statement.
He noted that "it is particularly anxious to witness how important and influential public personalities express public support for criminal armed fights that continue to pursue the refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey".
"One of the most important problems is that almost all people who go to the Bulgarian territory in an irregular way are automatically arrested," Zeid stressed.
And even worse - they are often criminally persecuted and imprisoned - for a year or longer - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the right of everyone to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria detained 14,000 migrants this year, last year for the same period of 21,000.
Pokémon Go - hunting for health and happiness that is worth
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
A number of people over the past decade lamented that teenagers and children are no longer playing outside and prefer to spend time in front of the screen.
Pokémon raises people from the couch and leads them to activity.
The time spent before the screen originally smashed on TV, later on video games and the latest on smart phones.
It's great to watch that technology and activities outside do not exclude each other.
Of course, I'm talking about the mode of Pokemon Go, the application based on the buildings that first appeared in video games at the end of the 1990s (later a drawn series, play cards and other).
Like many cultural phenomenons, this new game was introduced at the beginning of July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand to fall into interest.
The introduction in other countries was then delayed due to the powerful interest that led to the overload of servers.
Pokémon Go won more users in a few days than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter has.
How does it work?
In short, players on a smart phone go out looking for Pokémons that are watching using GPS, and when they find them, they can "fotify" them (with screenshot on the phone) or "take".
Mania captured the generation that played a game at the young age, lifted it from the seats and a woman out looking for Pokémons.
In the United States, this game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps that a “percentive ” person will do every day.
Cardiogram for smart clocks from Applu, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that during two days of the start of the game, the number of people who have been watching for 30 minutes every day has jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who Pokémon Go plays - see only gross data on levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns strive to “couch 30, ”“ rise from the couch ” and “will be active every day ” fall into unborn soil, because most of the messages focused on public health is boring and designed for people who don’t look well.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in the mass control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that we can't all specify here.
But the beauty of the Pokémon Go game is that people go out and do something that they enjoy.
You cover three health pillars - movement, fresh air and sunlights, and fun.
Some people even gain new friends in hunting for pokemones.
As it is already, there will be, of course, some boring bullets who are looking for any reason to complain.
And yes, someone can go in the door.
What's that, what?
There's been a breakdown.
In their time, the application for smart phones, such as Fitbit, was able to monitor our activity, but they gave us no reason to do something like this in this game.
The news is scattering and the interest of it will fall at a certain point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémons, there will be other games that will combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help a number of people hunting for activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles gained gold in a more combat of women's gimnastic gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the excitement.
Simon Biles is immune against all of this.
Dynamic to jump.
No effort on the meal.
Everybody's screwed up in the free.
Excellent in everything.
And now finally the Olympic Champion.
The nineteenth-year-old American gymnast went straight on Thursday after a title in a multicombat, and the others overcome the full line under the Olympic Reflectors.
The total result of 62.198 clearly confirmed its impact in front of the silver medalist and the member of the team of the "final Fifth" Ally Raisman and Russian bronze medialist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Bilesová (USA) on Thursday during the show at the glacier in the finals of multiple individuals in sports gymnastics at summer Olympic Games 2016 in Brazil Rio de Janeiro.
Billes became the fourth American in a row that won a multi-struggle, and the fifth total when she confirmed her reputation of the best gymnastics of her generation, and perhaps even the best at all.
When her total final evaluation on the table and her long journey ended until this moment, her tears appeared on her face.
This success arrived her into the same league of unique athletes of their time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sports:
The biles sport has been dominating for the last three years, winning 15 medals in world championships -- including 10 gold. Her fascinating compositions are the mixture of ambition and precision and the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton called it "the best gymnast she ever saw."
The last test was waiting for her in Brazil, not between Biles and the rest of the race, but between her and her burden of too many expectations.
Anything other than returning home to your family in Spring, Texas, with a hand full of gold medals, would be seen as disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman are embraced after the gold and silver medals in the final of the women's multi-combat in the summer Olympic Games 2016 in Brazilian Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The first biles won Tuesday, when she was as a criterion at the celebration of the departing national team coordinator Martha Karolya.
Billes insists that during her long trip to the top, she never looked forward, which is not exactly true.
Part of her composition in the free - the one that contains her typical triple salto with a double turn - is planted in the Latin music that would just come home to the streets outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as pairs and her talent was discovered by the mother of the coach Aimee Boorman's way to the gym, where Boorman was trained and where he got power.
The competitive competition has not lost since the summer of 2013 - that's a victory trail that can continue as long as Biles will want.
Even though Mustafin took a short lead through two turns, it was just an illusion.
Cladine and free - where Biles defends world championship - wait.
She came back to her head with 15,433 points at the buffer - and ended with 15.933 points in free.
Raisman gently hugged her when they waited for the final score - just formality - and around the bright red, white and blue shadows, the Bills came to tears when the desires that she had ever been in her diary were fulfilled.
The performance of Raisman was a little retribution for the Olympiade four years ago, when she shared a third line with Mustafin, but then her bronze for the sum of three best compositions.
This time, the twenty - year - old captain of the team, which the Americans call “babch ”, was quite ahead.
After her free, she sent a crowd of air kiss, succeeded in return, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles has a contribution that this nineteenth-year-old athlete placed on Twitter this week, where it became a total hit, completely new meaning:
Police: Three victims in the case of a serial killer shot at listening to music in the car
According to the police report published on Thursday, two women and a girl aged 12 years old during the most important attack of decades, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix, were shot when they were sitting in the car, talking and listening to music.
The authorities announced that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefania R. Ellis and daughter Ellis Maleah were shot in the car parked on the arrival road on June 12th.
The report states that an armed man stood on the side of the colleague and fired eight wounds from his hand, and then fled in another vehicle.
According to the police, it's not worth a triple murder robbery because the attacker didn't take the wallets, nor the amount of $2,900 that one of the adult victims had.
Speaking police in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the investigators were investigating whether the shooting had no connection with one of the previous four attacks.
In two mostly Spanish quarters, a total of nine attacks occurred in four months, where seven people were killed and two others were injured.
“It is happening in the villa quarter in front of the houses”, stated Howard earlier this month for the KPHO branch CBS station.
The police believe that the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissane from the end of the 1990s, black BMW from the end of the 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to tell what evidence led them to the conclusion that the attacks were related and carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was transferred to a hospital, where she was later injured.
Liner (31) and Ellis Maleah's daughter died at the scene.
The witness told the police that it was not unusual that women were sitting in a parked car and listening to music.
The officials also published a police report on the shooting, targeted by an empty van just half an hour before the triple murder, and the police believe that her original was this serial killer.
The investigators found the bullets and made a bullet from the rest of the bullets in the seat.
Six - year - old mother with microcephalia: “His condition is getting better ”
Edmund Picciuto, as most children of his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffered by microcephalia, which is the result of the genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, I first thought I couldn't handle this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true - of course you are prepared for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent found out that Edmund may never know them and that she may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in the constitution.
"My first response was that I thought people were not doing this today," explains Picciut.
Edmund's walking with a walker.
Until he was three years old, he couldn't sit, nor crawl, and he still doesn't talk.
Some boundaries are already slowly filled.
He's walking with help and riding a bike.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth presents a sign speech by which Edmund says “please sing me. ”
"We teach him a sign speech," said Picciut for CBS News.
But it's not an ordinary sign speech - says Edmund made some signs himself.
Microcephalia may come from a number of different states: genetic, such as Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as bedrooms or Zika.
Symptoms and forecasts may differ significantly.
It's too soon to tell us what effect Zik's virus will have on the lives of the infected.
Piccium reminds the emotional tax that the uncertain future chooses.
I keep asking, "What happens next?"
What's next?
And she's still not sure about that.
In fact, I've never asked what the total prognosis is because I don't expect anyone to tell me at all.
However, Picciut has an encouraging report for mothers of all children who suffer from natural disorders caused by Zik virus.
The situation's getting better.
You know it'll be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Strong rain and floods demanded rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The strong rain and large floods in Louisiana caused the governor to announce an emergency on Friday. Another rain was expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) announced that after extreme lions, a number of rivers in Louisiana and south of Mississippi are exploding from their shores and threatening to flood wide.
Governor Louisiany John Bel Edwards said that the state officials are constantly in contact with local authorities and the aid is on the way to the disastrous areas.
Mike Steele, a speaker of the Governor's Office for National Security and Preparation for the crisis situation, said they received requests for vehicles for water, boats and sand bags.
Steele said that only the Tangipahoa district asked for ten thousand sand bags.
Flood patrols will remain in most South Louisiana to work until Saturday.
The weather service indicated that more than 8 to 13 inches can rain over the sea.
In South Alabama, there was a flood patrol on Friday, when rain continued in the area of Mobile.
According to predictions, the Comite rivers at Baton Rouge and Amit at Denham Springs are to culminate on the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said that both said they could flood a series of homes in the Baton Rouge area.
He further stated that the dangers are floods after the stream in the district of Ascension, where these divorced streams will only be poured slowly into the lake of Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, a little south of the Mississippi state in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached on Friday at 9 a.m. at the local time to the highest recorded level.
Savers are still picking up people from the invasive waters in the county of Amita and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his son, were already on Friday between the rescued ones at Gloster.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, was rapidly rising over the night.
He said that he was warned by his next son, who lived nearby.
"We woke up and water was coming," Hansford said.
I had it to the passport.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's ever experienced in the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said he and all his family are infected and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford stated that the crisis workers saved all three huge cars in military style and transported them to a fire station in Gloster, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that, continuing with the rainfall rain, the floods are "showing quickly" and the authorities consider evacuation.
According to Krautman, the observer near Livinstone announced that from midnight to Friday to morning, 35 inches of rain crashes fell.
Crautmann said the soil was high from the center.
The authorities stated that the expensive rain and paid roads demanded rescue of the inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa district and abolishment of the training in five school districts.
The branch of the WWL station CBS announced that, according to the elder of Tangipahoa, 200 homes were flooded.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, but both are now flooded.
The mayor of the town, Robby Miller, stated that the authorities saved 72 people and seven domestic animals that the high water has imprisoned.
In the village of Amite and in Hammond, shelters were established for those who were evacuated.
"They will be able to return home when the water begins to fall," he said.
In the area of Tangipahoa in Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed because of the flood, and local inhabitants received sand bags that could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"The last large floods we had here in March," Lacy Landrum's manager said.
These floods seem to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, head of the crisis situation in Harrison County, Mississippi stated that persistent rain continues to rain on the coast of the Persian Gulf.
He said that a few homes were reported on Thursday, but none of them showed up on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places where I've never seen her before," said Townson, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "Chlap shooting like firing", survived the shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, and this week it's a second shot on a child age 6 years old in the city.
The grandparents of the child for CBS Philadelphia identified it as Mahaje Brown.
The grandparents say the boy suffered several shots, including weaknesses, legs, arms, and stomach, but he was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He grabbed it awfully much, his little body was shot as fixed," said his grandmother's station Delores Melendez.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in a critical state in the hospital and has taken several operations.
The family for the station said the boy should be healed.
He was supposed to get into the first grade of basic school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four men who were shot in the Germantown part.
Another three men were shot: two at 29 and one at 32 years of age.
One of the men aged 29 is in critical state, according to CBS Philadelphia, there are two more victims in a stabilised condition.
According to the report, the child was found shot at the front seat of the vehicle along with a nine-year-old man in critical condition.
Another two victims weren't in the car, and the police are looking into if one of the wounded men could be a shooter.
CBS Philadelphia's investigators indicated that there was probably a shooter among several armed men.
At the scene, the bullets from the weapons of the type of attack have been found, belonging to a variety of attack weapons.
I guess it was definitely a continuing battle.
There were bullets on the street on both sides of the corridor.
So it appears that there were several armed fighters who were actively involved," stated Captain of the Philadelphian police of Anthony Ginaldi for the station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No one was detained, and the police reportedly explore video recordings from the cameras.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in the arm with a broken shot on Tuesday in front of the house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl's recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's how I imagine a female gymnast team for this year's Olympic Games, for a few reasons.
First of all, I've been on every summer olympics since 1984 and the United States have never been so dominant.
And second: There are three gymnastics in this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, complemented by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
Finally, we have a team that looks like America.
He also reinforced the presence of the black and Latin American women on the top of this sport.
The gymnast number one in the past four years was an African American.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second line last year.
That means something.
At the last olympiade, Gabby Dougals became a surprising champion of the Olympic Games and America glassed.
Now the world could be witnessed by the incredible performance of the triple world winning Simona Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who showed unexpected but artist gymnastical figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American who won gold in a woman's multicombat of individuals.
And a member of the team, Aly Raisman, got the silver.
We're witnessing the sports top, but it doesn't look like that in the gymnastic class in the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie graduated into the Olympic team the same path as Ally and Madison.
They're "final Friday", because the gymnast team for the next Olympic game will only be composed of four athletes, and this is the last year when Marta Karolya trains.
The fact is, however, that gymnastics are financially difficult sports and gymnastics train primarily in private gymnastical clubs that maintain parents who pay training costs, equipment, travels, trains, fees for competition, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their trustees and families). And that's not all.
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in suburbs that activities can support.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all training and for the families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they started in gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring a gymnastical training that is more available and accessible to the communities of unbroad young girls that Simone, Gabby and Laurie inspired.
I founded a gymnastical fund 20 years ago.
In my organisations where we offer free gymnastics or low costs in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (usually black and Spanish) and we trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and gain from this great Olympic Sport.
The gymnastics develop the strength, flexibility and co-ordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of mind.
This combination means for life benefits for good health, success in school and at work.
The inspiration of this team will send to us thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for proving the "girl's strength" and you won the Olympic Team Gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all origin to come to the way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunta's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter the following stags
The Ministers hoped that, after the conclusion of the recontract, the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would terminate the disagreements regarding changes, but 58 per cent of 37,000 young doctors who participated in the elections refused.
Hunt discovered in July plans to force the contract that NHS was in “no one” and that further delay would have a harmful impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new treaty which includes changes in night and weekend working procedures to improve care in non-social hours.
The physician Ellen McCourt, President of the BMA Commission for young doctors in the statement last night, said: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that there is a rise in the current working force crisis and therefore fair treatment to all doctors. ”
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors pass under the new treaty, progress must be made and time is out.
The efforts of BMA to resolve disputes through negotiations met with the urgency of incorporating Dr. and often with deaf silence by the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this option is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, push to force and solve the concerns of young doctors."
If this does not happen, young doctors are willing to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits, because sisters and specialists were invited to replace doctors who were among protestors.
The Ministers hoped that, after the conclusion of the processed contract, the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) will conclude disagreements regarding changes.
BMA wants higher payments for work on weekends for 54,000 young doctors who would be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Chairman of Employers of NHS, invited young doctors not to enter any strike.
Mortimer said: “The business will only achieve a little or nothing, but there will be pressure on the already overloaded teams and services, and will rise concerns, exhaustion and disturbance for patients, treatment personnel and their families. ”
In the past two months, we have dealt with the advice of young doctors and along with the Ministry of Health and others, we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervisor and informer.
Employers hoped that continuing positive involvement in other important issues - such as loading, flexibility in training, further training for those who are returning after career interruption, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study freedom and distinction in payments between sex - was proof of how serious employers, Health Education and the Ministry of Health take agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
Medicine for 60 crowns a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients who are in danger of the infarction will be able to use the medicine that is around 60 crowns (two pounds) in the overview.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of infarction in people with heart disease.
The medicinal product is now administered for 12 months to reduce the risk of infarction or other infarction.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the medicinal product be given for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from heart attacks or heart attacks every year.
Infarction and infarctions are caused by accumulation of fat, which creates a related layer on the arteries walls.
If this layer is distracted, there may be blood trauma, blocking the blood access to the heart and the infarction of heart.
If the slaughter is released, the blood site can continue, block the blood inflammation into the brain and cause a brain infarction.
People who have already committed the infarction are exposed to a higher risk of another attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca, which is sold under the Brilique trade, reduces the risk of the formation of ruins less likely.
In the design of the NICE Directive, which has been published today, it is recommended that patients receive 90 mg ticagrelora for 12 months and then 60 mg with aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “In spite of the availability of an effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who had a heart attack and who had another heart attack or infarction - often with destructive consequences. ”
The fear of repeating may have a significant negative impact on the quality of the patient’s life.
It is demonstrated that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and infarction in people who have already been affected by the infarction.
We are pleased that, in the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can extend the possibilities of treatment available to many thousands of people who will be able to gain from it.
Since information on the efficiency and safety of Ticagrelor - especially on the danger of bleeding - above the framework of three years is limited, it is not recommended in the proposal for treatment over this period.
With computer culture, cheatings in Muslim areas began to flow
Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was revoked last year for corruption, which was related to the government report
The culture of political correction led to overlooking fraud in Muslim communities, stated today in the government report.
Ex-minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticizes the police, the electoral inspectors and the city for ignoring the abuse of voters because of “sensitiveness to ethnicity and religion”.
The former communities secretary, now the ruler of anticorruption, said that intimidation of voters based on their religion is so bad that the police should make cordones and warned voters protect from the election rooms.
He recommended that the voters take with themselves the evidence of identity and be able to prove who they are when elections.
Currently, the voters are just to specify their name and address.
The report further suggests the fingers of persons when giving the voice to inject an incremental ink so that someone will vote twice.
Whistleblowers should have greater protection, says Pickles.
It requests that the press get more access to the documents from the session and decisions adopted by non-official committees or working groups.
"It is not only protection against electoral frauds, but also the protection of the local government from the wider corruption environment and financial frauds that are hand-handed with it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of the electoral scandal in Tower Hamlets in Western London.
In last year, the Special Election Court decided that the mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be revoked from his post after the charge of corruption and illegal practices.
The Court found that Rahman “cinicly affected ” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his criticism by accusing racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, according to his words, “he led his campaign so that it was a religious duty of dedicated Muslims to vote for him."
When 300 votes were questioned, or as a result of stealing identity, when a person votes and gives himself to someone else.
Sir Eric said there are evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed special concerns about fraud in a correspondent vote, which is said that the elderly members of the Muslim community during it had a pressure on people to vote for the candidates they chose.
Sir Eric, on the picture, gave several recommendations how to clean up the electoral system, including the presentation of evidence of identity
His report states: “The evidence was presented that the vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, had been pressured to vote according to the will of elders, especially in the communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh. ”
“There have been concerns that... the state institutions have closed their eyes against such behavior because of “politically correct ” hypersensitivity against ethnic origin and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations of how to clean up the system, including that political activists are not allowed to manipulate with correspondent voices and prevent "vote expulsion".
The report currently evaluated by Theresa May also requests more detailed checks in the registration to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration frauds and dosage frauds.
Consider the possibility of requesting voters to submit a document of identity before the vote.
The use of an incremental ink on people's fingers in voting to prevent someone to vote twice.
Implementation of systematic nationality controls to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic voting of correspondence to the period of three years.
Forbid political agitators and activists to manipulate their votes and votes.
Give the police the permission to create around the Cordon Election Rooms.
Change laws so that it is easier to persecute people developing illegal pressure under the Reform Act of 1983.
Disable acquisition of photographs in electoral rooms.
Require only the English (except for Wales) to work in electoral rooms.
Enhancing training and ensuring that employees observe the rule that election cabins go separately.
Sir Eric criticizes the London Police and says it's “suppressive” that no charges for criminal offences were filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court excluded Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the lithania of corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty over the framework of reasonable doubts - in the power of proof of criminal offence.
It also criticizes the inadequate “control of verifications” in the branch offices for registration of voters.
Sir Eric said: “The last decision of the court in the Tower Hamlets case by awakening.
Our nation has a proud link to the colleague of parliamentary democracy, but anxious and hidden spread of election frauds and the state of rejection to some authorities threatens this reputation.
Crazy cycle binary of the Duchess Kate and other twins of known personalities in the Rio Olympiada
Olympic game fans in Rio 2016 freaking into the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, which is quite fancyly similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 40-year-old olympionic isn't the only athlete to try for gold this year, which can be admired by its own double of a number of known personalities -- at least not according to social networks.

As a hunted beast: a member of the American Shooter team Brady Ellison (left) was compared to Leonard DiCapria since a little bit
A number of people on the cycling routes on the Internet quickly pointed out that a certain shooter could be a twin of star Leonarda DiCapria.
The racing team of American Shooters Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures came out, in which the wolf from Wall Street is deliberately similar.
Brady himself noticed the media's madness and confessed that he had heard about his similarity with Leo since he was a kid.
"There is no big similarity, perhaps except the beards," said Brady for Huffington Post.
"He's a dude and looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will certainly be emphasized this year: an impressive image between the British jumping to the distance of Greg Rutherford and the favorite actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafin with her big, significant eyes, was said a copy of the Cuban-American Singing Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star Gell Matthew Morrison for several years.
And to change: The user thinks Nathan with the "attletic version" of the actress from the film Home (Inception)
Another long-term comparison is the comparison of Rafael Nadal's tennis star and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similar dense eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver swimming Yulia Efimov is proud not only of the same skin and blond hair as Annayn McCord, and the fans of the US team Nathan Adrian say she looks like “atletical version of Joseph Gordon Levitt.”
Excellent women: Football star Hope Solová (left) and actress series Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar form of face and eyes
Not only one: The Twitter user was very pleased that the similarity was observed by others
On the waves of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for similar treatment with couples
One Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction with the fact that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are really identical. ”
The soccer star Hope Solo and the actress of Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have a really unbelievably similar form of face and eyes.
Among other favorite comparisons are Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical with the smile of her actress Laura Linney, or the holder of a gold medal behind the gymnastics Gabby Douglas, proud of her beautiful wide smile, which as if she was copying the smile of Gabrielle Union, the stars of the movie Bravo, girls!

Too excited, she dried like a smell, exploded.
Thank you.

Canadian divers began to call themselves online quickly and were frightened by tone and language that the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: "Twitter said that 14-year-old swimming from China "exploded"?
The idiot didn't notice he's still in the television."
Ai Yanhan of China in the final of a female cafet race at 4x200 meters in a free style was described as: “The little 14-year-old of China gave it up, you miserable.”
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came from all sides and many asked for his appeal.
When Twitter users learned how unsensitive Byron MacDonald is, they didn't stay back.
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we'd be a racist band.
Soon afterward, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologize for the live comment of MacDonald, said: “We apologize for the comment of the swimming swimming that fled to the broadcast. ”
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry that this happened."
CBC station eventually apologized more than 90 times to those who tweeted in the commentary reply
Colleague Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and apologized for more than 90 Twitter users who complained about the commentator MacDonald's comments

Customers in Primark disturbed by a woman who was unshy trying underwear in the middle of the trade
When a woman was dressed out to try the pants in the middle of Primark on the sales table, they weren't shopping sure of what direction to look at.
In order to make it worse, she tried how her size falls, she took off her pants and brought them back to the shelter.
She continued her review and eventually tried four pairs of pants in the shopping center of Bouverie Place in Flokestone.
Primark shop in Bouverie Place Center in Folkestone, where a woman tried pants before she returned them to the regál
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at a given time, said that a mysterious woman after the test of the underwear, “weared her new clothes and went out of the store without buying anything. ”
She said: "The people could not believe their own eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took off her pants, took her own stockings and pants and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place -- just standing there, standing like a monkey."
"Everyone was just staring at how she took off her pants again, and obviously she didn't like them because she returned them back to the regall."
She did the same with three others before she finally decided she didn't like anything, she dressed herself again and left.
"She seemed like she didn't mind who was looking -- nor thought about the man who might buy the pants she tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: “The idea that someone will take home the pants that someone else had on, and no one cleaned them; that is disgusting.”
The event happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she left, I collected things that I obviously tried to pull them out of the sale, which is also the only right thing.”
"I would have been afraid to bring my new pants home and find out that there were other women on it, and she took them off and weren't washed."
Primark’s speaker said: "Primark knows about the incident that happened in our Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9th."
All the products concerned were withdrawn from the sales.
How to defend against weapons attacks using Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but because of this Dailymail.com video, it could be more safe for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a highstream of the Federation of Krave Maga, sitting in New York, to find out how to deal with armed thieves at a close distance.
This video will show you how suddenly get violent over the violent, whether close to you from the front or from behind.
If he approaches you from the back, Mizrachi says, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and “have a free path of shots. ”
Then you'll grab a gun between your throat and your shoulder just before you hit him in the face with a lobby.
Then he follows his knee to the weaknesses, and while the attacker swings in pain, you snoop his gun out of his hand, you hit the head into his face and you start to retreat, while you keep your gun on him.
If an armed man is approaching you from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the fire line, grab your weapons and screw it out so that the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, put your strength in the weapon and hit the assaulter into your chest, then scratch the gun out of his hatching and start retreating on him, keep moving on.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video where you'll see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
Do not forget, however, that the safest way to get out of the robbery - unless you're highstream of Krav Maga - is to issue all cash.
The Ian Wright traveller licks the most dirty places in Europe to the travel guide
The British traveler decided to fail to test his immune system and long reflex - by licking the most dirty and ugly places in Europe.
The modeler and author of Ian Wright (51), originating in Suffolk, licked his tongue with a euro banknote, a barrier on Piccadilly Circus, a toilet button in the train and a Russian public phone.
He used a luminometer before closing each object to show to himself and to all of us what he's going into.
The experiment based on the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, however, brought interesting results.
The idea to lick the train button that used thousands of other people may seem totally disgusting, however, there are much more harmful bacteria in the kitchen drill.
Ian Wright talked to doctors and health professionals during his entire journey across Europe about the strengthening of the bowl flury bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his lick left in his mouth anything worse than the smell.
Ian Wright celebrated himself by testing his abdominal resistance on roads around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system completely safely - from public branches on train stations after the barrier
In a film he wrote: “I have not cared much about my health since I was a child, and I have made everything possible in my mouth, from clay to eating worms and misty water. ”
He confirmed his reputation in the movie.
The only thing he refused was dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple rubber, the luminometer showed the value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia but licked refused after his luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish producer of milk products Valio filmed a traveller named The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, showing numbers of bacteria in various places, such as in the bathroom
He said in the movie: “This is almost the most disgusting thing I've ever felt in the bathroom. ”
Nothing more dirty than this!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting here.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was recorded in collaboration with the Finnish milk producer Valio.
The company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains milk acid and vitamins C and D, which helps people strengthen the abdominal bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice-president of Valio for food, juice and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow the involvement and also allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea "Let's call Ian."
It's said that the interest in the health of the insect becomes a global phenomenon.
Instead of talking only about the products, we wanted to put them in wider connections - good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the health of the insect and how it is connected with the immune system.
The growing interest in the healthy worm is a global phenomenon, and through this document we have brought more information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who was directing the movie, adds: “Let's say this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked something of what I wanted -- like the ugly Russian toilet that appears in the movie. ”
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, others were quite difficult.
I'm glad we've made some of those dirty things."
In 2015, Valio conducted an examination, according to which 84 per cent of the respondents combined milk acid bacteria with the health of the stomach and the abdomen and 58 per cent of the respondents indicated that at least occasionally they use products containing added milk acids.
The family of socially needed before relocation destroyed the general building in Saltash, Cornwall
The family of socially needed left damage in its general house of 50,000 pounds after they were charged with terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were moved out of the house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a number of complaints against them.
After their violent immigration, the residents of the apartment company were shocked when they found that property was in an accident.
There were holes in the walls, floor cover was broken, waste waste waste all over the floor, and the walls were scratched.
Family has already moved away and is considered to live in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, the Director for Living Affairs in Cornwall Houseing, said she was worried if she could save the house.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
It is necessary to consider a number of circumstances, because this property is probably entering a consciousness as "not so nice part" of Cornwalle.
This family is disgracefully known and their names are disgracefully known.
A couple have three sons who sometimes stayed in the house, and the police stated that the horror of the family was acting in the street battles with baseball balls, intimidation of surrounding inhabitants, drug use, drug distribution, and a loud scream, arguing and arguing.
Sceldons (47), whose name was listed on the rental contract, was punished in June for anti-social behaviour.
In several rooms in the house that may be broken, was found smellless waste.
In the house where drugs were distributed in the past, the floor cover was ripped
The neighbors say they saw them on the street washing, and people regularly called the police here.
The Cornwall Housing company moved her and her partner violently from the house this week after they received an additional term of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.
The neighbors who relieved were welcomed to their lives as a living hell.
One of them said: “They did not care for anyone at all. ”
We've lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, it can't be counted at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because there was incredible silence - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a supervisor in Cornwall Houseing, said that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the police were regularly invited to the house
Waste and old toys were scattered in a growing part of the general house
He adds: “It is a shame that the hired woman has not been able to accept responsibility for her own behavior and for her family’s behavior.
It was a very complicated case, because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to scare her neighbours.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and the members of the local community, who informed us bravely.
I hope this step brings some comfort to the neighbors and at the same time brings the message that we will not tolerate non-communication.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons who lived in a different house were about 20 years old.
A polluted mattress that remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house
Workers will now have to remove the garbage of waste that remained thrown around the house
In 2014 she carried out police in the house raid and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weight, equipment and 1 700 pounds in cash.
She got a penalty when she was found guilty of holding the drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was intended for the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is considered that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymuth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffitis.
The police say they're going to seek to relocate mercenaries who violate the rules of their rental contracts.
Angela Crowe, from the police of Denov and Cornwalle, said that the relocation was a clear message for other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think that they can act without punishment, and to those who want to follow such behavior," she said.
The police of Denov and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and non-communication behaviour and will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal frightened after a low flight of a military trigger plane over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed sunlights in Portuguese Aveir were frightened to death
The Portuguese Military Aviation Aviation Aviation of P-3C Orion flyed unbelievably low
Military aircraft declared that it was a training flight, and insisted that there was no security threat.
The moment the low flying trigger struck over the filled beach, the frightened tourists panicked.
The dramatic recordings show how the military aircraft reaches a distance nearly to touch the sun on the sand beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The tourists began to rise after the noise of the motors of the trigger plane disturbed them without seeing what's coming out of the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the several recreants who published the video of the dramatic movement on social networks, said: “The plane went twice really low, and at one point it seemed to fall down. ”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I surfed and I really thought the plane would fall on my head. ”
The tourists on the beach in Aveir were frightened when the aircraft flyed low from darkness.
The Portuguese military aircraft today declared that the P-3C Orion pilot was on the exercise flight to identify the fishing ship at the coast, and had to take down low because it was the only way to check the ship.
The aircraft allegedly flyed about something lower than usual, because of the bad visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the aircraft insisted that human safety was not threatened.
This summer, forest fires destroyed the part of land Portugal and demanded four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese military aircraft today declared that the pilot had to fly low because of a dense fog and smoke from fires that stopped him in the appearance.
The pilot was asked to identify the fishing ship within the training.
Half the funeral services do not comply with the rules.
Half of the funeral providers does not comply with the law.
The Czech Trade Inspection (CHOI) found that during the second quarter checks.
The funeral services according to it often do not inform the remaining of their prices or shall not issue written confirmations on the taking of the order.
The CHI has made 41 penalties in total of 73,000 crowns.
Today, her speaker Jiri Fröhlich informed her speaker.
Inspectors found doubts at 47 of 95 checks.
In addition to non-intelligence on prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services under other prices than agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly marked and once the seller used an officially unchecked measure.
Therefore, the inspection prohibited sales of 23 products for a total of 7077 crowns.
It was related to urinary packages, covers for candles and ties that were not properly marked by the obligatory information.
"Because there is still a violation of the law in this specific area of services, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
The Londonian school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
It was announced that Cadiza Sultana, one of the three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS, died in Syria.
The Legal Representative Tasnime Akunjee said that her family had learned about her death in Syrian Racca a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced on Thursday that she was probably killed during a Russian air attack in Racca, a garden group in the country.
The sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to escape from the war of a narrowed country and returning to Britain.
"A man wants to believe that the only good one in all of this is -- as a message and a warning for others that these are a real danger associated with the journey to the war zone -- is to prevent people from making decisions when," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other students from the eastern part of London enrolled in February 2015 to a plane to Turkey and then to the bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana family learned that she married the IS warrior in Syria — and she was widowed for several months.
Reid says if Clinton is chosen, she'll leave Garland as a candidate of the Supreme Court.
The leader in the Senate for the Democratic Party, Harry Reid, says he is convinced that the presidential election candidate for Democrats Hillary Clinton nominates Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in case of its election.
The Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, even though President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The leader of the Senate majority, Mitch McConnel, says that the person who replaces the dead judge of the Supreme Court will be elected by the future president.
Reid said during the conference call on Thursday that he believed that Clinton would choose Garland "with a certain degree of confidence".
Reid's speaker later said that he didn't speak directly to Clinton about whether Garland would be nominated and only speculating.
He appreciated Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want someone else's choice.
Garland is the president of the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Reid said that republics blocking Garland's appointment are "administers" and "poskok" of the Republican candidate to the Presidential Office of Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't in the office.
According to the magazine Treats, naked calendars for "women and men"
The Magazine Treats closely cooperates with photographer David Bellemer for the 2017 calendar, inspired by Pirelli calendar since the 70s.
But instead of discovered known personalities, they try to find another generation of top models for their 2017 calendar.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine full of naked is different from Playboy from the old school because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing it for women.
Apparently, he believes that the calendar is too.
"We must return to show overtime and classical naked, when women and men feel comfortable and let themselves inspired by the photographs of the woman's body," Shaw announced in a press statement for the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can send their photos online or personally during open audiences in Los Angeles and New York.
Where's the vinyl: who really buys gramophone boards?
Vinil loves lonely men in the middle of their age.
Before you decide to swallow comments under the pseudonim No AllOsmilyWomenIn the Middle Age, we are indicating that this sentence is based on real data.
According to YouGov, such a debate about the resurrection of gramophones is related not to a boom of millions who want to love the original property of the physical object but with the nostalgy of the middle age.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are most likely people aged between 45 and 54 years of age.
Young people aged 18-24 are at least likely.
In fact, it's not even about the accumulation of an excited fan - all of it has an emotional dimension: older people who buy gramophone boards are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56% against 53%) and they like themselves (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog was sent as a television report, I would have been watched by a camera to go to a disturbing street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and widely gestulated, and then I would stop, pull my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's look at it."
Let's see it.
While Soh's heart is slowly wiped out of his charm and magic - buildings once covered by independent sellers, hotels, restaurants and dinings, confections and office needs - a few fantastic specialized shops with gramophone plates are now filled with.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a while, and I'll stand close to different men in these shops and try to notice what their age and emotional mood are.
Stuart (55), a relative from Glasgow, whom I watch from Sister Ray (the numbers: two young women, three men of the middle age) to Reckless Records (the numbers: eight men of the middle age, one woman around 20) has a meeting in London afternoon and reviews the shops to fill a few hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I've got about three or four thousand tapes.
All those tapes leak the walls of his living room - on the picture upstairs (she sent me an e-mail, I didn't follow him home).
This enormous quantity of albums and singls also has because he can afford it: he can now buy gramophones that he couldn't afford when they went out originally, and he's buying what he sold in youth and didn't even have a windra.
"There are things that would be issued when I was 11 or 12 years old and I was too small," he says.
They agree that those who buy recordings are probably introverts who love the company themselves, and he adds: “I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink too much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works in Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of customers he meets are in the YouGov profile.
He also noticed the new inflammation of people affected by the media wave. People who heard of the cameback and felt forced to buy their old gramophone panels back.
According to my interviews, the people of their collections were most frequently removed from 1998 to 1999.
Customers who once sold their gramophone boards and purchased CDs now sell their CDs to buy their gramophones back," he says.
That could explain the boom of gramophone boards of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of gramophone boards?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find that in a shop like Phonica you can find a pleasant community of people with similar thoughts.
According to Vesa, some elderly customers are particularly disturbed by the system of uncontact payments.
Some gramophone board fans may feel absorbed in the digital world and decide for the famous environment of gramophone boards, things that cause memories of peaceful adulthood.
"I think that the fulfilment of space or possession of something material may bring some comfort," says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, I'm in my house, and I think a lot of people are too.
It's a easy way to fill the place in your head.
"We are all as social workers!" a colleague from a bunch of gramophone boards calls.
The ICM research in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought the vinyl album for a month earlier did not listen to it.
According to the survey, 41% of the queryed gramophone, which they never use, while 7% of those who buy gramophones does not have a gramophone.
At this point of the report, he probably seemed seriously concerned about exploring a bunch of compilation boss new.
Aspect of “trophia” and renewing interest is something that Johnny (42), who works in Sounds of the universe (number: three men of the middle age).
"Someone recently came and said, "I don't have a gramophone yet, but I want to buy on the Radiohead desk so that we can put it on the cheek," he says.
The percentage of these is not big, but it happens.
It's more about product page than music.
People who say, "I don't have a gramophone."
These are younger people, not the older, grown teenagers who get into it.
Fopp, where nearly one floor is now protected by gramophone boards, has much more different visitors in my arrival.
There are couples of 70s, tourists doing photos, teenagers and women in the middle age.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as stores before - from the reproductors instead of the pushing jazz is called the latest pop of Wild Beasts full of synthesists and sex, it is good to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but you can hardly estimate the emotional trauma when you stand next to someone 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) is walking in Fopp for a few minutes and exploring various gramophone panels in the discount.
She's one of those who are rather looking at exhibits than expensively expensive.
According to her words, she doesn't make much money, so she doesn't seem to have the gramophone records collected.
It's worth a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but gramophone boards have their spell... ," he sighs desirefully.
I can't explain - it's unique.
My last stop is a store that reportedly inspired a new generation of gramophone lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend I'm very busy with girls in tired jeans, and I'm watching a group of 15-year-old girls that are just screwing around the Polaroid cameras, and then the father and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley gramophone.
The left is a staircase whose wall covers the gramophone panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: mixture of current and classical music, the basis of any average collection of gramophone records.
No one's looking at them - maybe because they're just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they can't be reached.
It's a pure "winyl trick."
But since any attraction to him could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into Soho's depths for another, there is no much to complain about.
There is no surprise that the demographic area where more time and money is probably more than in other areas is also the one where the most expenses for the most luxurious goods he must be guilty.
But while I find that the results of YouGov appear to be precise - so at least in gramophone shops, they do not consider large amounts of collectors and lovers of vinyl that exist in reality, in gramophone shops and online forums.
These people probably work hard at schools or offices.
Surely he doesn't spend a quarter in the morning swimming around gramophone shops on Berwick Street, walking through recordings and avoiding looking at a strange, thirty-year-old fake television moderate who hides behind the back of no idea of men of the middle age.
The Grenland Shark is the longest living revolver - video reportage
According to scientists, the Grenland shark has the longest lifetime of all the revolvers on the planet.
Julius Nelsen, who studies sharks, says that the tape shows a female whose age is estimated between 272 and 512 years and measures five meters
The Court of Justice in France refused to break the shops in the refugee camp of Jungle
The Court in France rejected the order of offices in Calais to demolise dozens of commission stores and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During this week's trial, the authorities in Calais suggested that the State should be able to cancel a total of 72 commission trades where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair cutting, in commission restaurants sell tea for 50 cents or basic foods for several euros.
The Prefect's office in Calais argumented that places need to be disturbed because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they mean the danger of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations in the court stated that trades and restaurants are vital and that free food offering by the State supported associations and other groups does not provide supplementary food for increasing numbers of refugees in the camp.
The disputed commission stores and restaurants often provide roof and food for free to people in need.
The Court of Justice in Lille decided that there is no legal basis that would prohibit 72 commission trades, but stated that the objections of the prefect Calais were “a very understandable”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food sales, cafeteria and restaurants have a much bigger role than just the use of food to people who “live in extremely desperate conditions. ”
He said spaces provide peaceful places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by demolition was the cafeteria in the camp, the Jungle Book Kids, which operates by an unprofit organisation and offers 200 meals daily, English and French hours and asylum consultation for hundreds of threatened minors without accompanied in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the “childish ” cafeteria.
Guardian received a letter that says that closing the café would “be a catastrophe for these children, some of them are only eight years old. ”
The charitable organization Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the numbers of refugees in the camp after a strict increase in arrivals during the summers increased to more than 9,000 - which is the most ever since all the time.
He thought he was dead.
Ulč creeps himself and the ball mouth.
"I could have trained normally since March," he reported at the start of summer preparation in full strength.
What's wrong with you?
I had a two-sided pulmonary embolism, and that's why I had heart problems.
Because when I was at the University of Korea, I didn't know I had any problems with blood.
So the trouble caused a long flight to Asia?
For two years, I had a smash and I didn't know about it.
It hurt me, nobody found me anything.
Then the strike got up.
There's a ruined vein in the litter, it's gonna hurt all the time, especially when it's working or changing weather.
But nothing that limits me, rather a estetical thing.
Did you worry about life?
He had.
Last year, at the summer tournament in woods, I didn't know I had an embolism, and I couldn't move there at all.
I vomited blood tonight.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, I was fixed for five more days.
I really thought I was dead, even my girlfriend and my family.
I've seen each other somewhere else.
How did you compare with that?
I guess I had to get through it, now it's just going upstairs.
I know I have some blood problems, I have to watch myself more if I fly somewhere.
But you can do anything about it.
Only when I wanted to get back to the Brama preparations last year, there were still heart problems.
It's all right now.
Since March, I was preparing myself home to be able to play again.
I'll knock it out. I'm physically better at it than before.
What do you expect from Ost?
I'm looking forward to the company looking good, most of the boys I know.
I'm curious about the other two strangers coming.
I hope we'll sit in human, so we'll get together.
Will you lift the Aust?
There was a reputation of a dick, but every season is different.
Two years ago it was eighth, and now the second is over.
There's a new team in Oste, there's only a few players left.
It was the last in extralision, so there's a big space to improve.
When we use it, it's on us.
We'll see the first rounds who's gonna be an asshole, we don't.
Is the coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's already tested and experienced a lot, he'll think better than the last place.
But my arrival didn't have anything to do with him, I made a deal earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, with one I'm a big friend, and it was agreed to work here.
I won't say a name.
Finally, Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
My big name, he was in good clubs, he trained a lot of dozen years, he's a former good player.
He'll move us upstairs.
What are you bringing?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like fighting, I love joking, and I like to get an opportunity in the wrong top team.
I've been two years in Pribrama, but the Ost is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned a stranger, the Osteau trained by Australian Boehm.
How does she look?
I know him in coincidence, we played against each other in a group at the university.
And a few times we had a conversation there, and sometimes we were sitting together at the night after the games, so we've known each other as friends.
We beat them 3:1 at the start of summer preparation in Oste.
He's got a Slovak girlfriend, he's a sympathetic.
The American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze are still on their way.
Do you know anything about them?
I've been writing with the American, looking like a nice boy, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
Did you contact the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm a recorder, so I'm supposed to communicate with everyone.
I just figured out what kind of player it was, I found it on the Internet, I saw some videos.
He showed up pretty cool, the boy jumps, he's high.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he came in with us.
How are you looking forward to the position of the recording unit?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm just going to get 24 and I don't have the nature to do it.
I'd rather be in the center of action, I'd better run a team than someone else's leading him.
I guess I wouldn't want to play anymore if I had to be like the second recorder and devote to it for a full time.
How many times have you been one?
Half in Pribrama, when Kust didn't make it as a captain, he hurt himself, then there were money problems, and he left.
Since then, we've been up and I've been playing all the time.
In Brna, whom I'm a reunion, I've been handing up one and two.
It was an excellent year in the Old City, and I had a lot of offers after it, and I just chose the Tower.
From there I was wanted by Budjayovica, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of that embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short layout remains Phelps' domain.
"Bing again on the degrees of winners and hearing the hymna is sweet as always," he laughed at Phelps and had eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and mother were again waxing in the sight, the Boomer son this time calmly slept with the listeners on their ears.
I've been through an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago, I started swimming race, and in a few hours it'll be over, he said touched.
In the final behind Phelps for almost two seconds, a silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won a long layout.
Bronz won the Chinese Wang Schun, bronze medailist in this discipline from the world's championship last year.
After Ala Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (daleko) are Michael Phelps the third athlete who controlled the same discipline on four games behind him.
After the majority of the race, Phelps and another American Ryan Lochte and home Thiago Perreira were held in the head.
While the gold defender in the final Crowlar fifty-fifth, he put himself to a ruined finish, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one chance to expand his unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the celebration announcement, he went to the final race at 100 meters of butterflies.
The legend couldn't shade Ryan Murphy, who won a marker double - after a hundred wins in Rio and a double trail.
In the final, he left 37 hundred of the Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkina, the third end of the Russian Jevgeny Rylov.
While Murphy has only the fifth place from a hundred last year, in Rio he became the king of the signature.
From the intelligent throne, Larkin was seated, who had the same double succeeded in last year's world championship.
But he only got a medal right now.
Canadianka Penny Olexiak and American Simone Manuel shared the gold in the Crowlar Stone.
For the 16-year-old Olexiac, it was the fourth medal on these games, for Manuel's second after silver from the bar.
The swimming gold won on OH as the first Afro-American woman in history.
I believe I can be inspiration for others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, sports becomes love for them, and they get where I am, said the touched Manuel.
The third was Sweden Sarah Sjöström, who won a 100 - meth-button race in Rio in the world’s record, and still has a silver from the Crowlar 200.
When the sixth world recordman, Australian Cate Campbell.
The tissue was won by Japanese Rie Kanet, for which it was the first Olympic Medal in the 1970s.
He has no valuable metal or from the world's championship, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was acquired by Russia Julia Jefimov, who, in spite of the doping past, is facing the immortality of the viewers and rivals.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won the court, and I don't know why I should keep answering these questions.
I'm so tired of it, said Russian swimming.
The right to start in Rio has been made to the special panel of the CAS sports arbitration just before the start of the games.
They were dealing with my appeal, and I won.
If anyone likes it or not, or if he has another opinion, whether he turns to the arbitration court, she added it.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could have won.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs have experienced a special day.
Not a whole hour before the match, they found out who they're going to go against.
They must have managed tactical preparations.
And then, in the untraditional time, the game started on a small kurt number one.
The first set didn't begin well, then they pulled the increment of the rivals, but at 19:19, they failed to reach the end.
In the second, they were clearly better and compared, but the decisive tie-break did not come to them.
First of all, a number of showed services meant a loss of 10:15 and a good-bye with the Olympic tournament.
"We could have defeated the Russians," she regretted Hermann.
How would you evaluate the game?
Hermann: After the unfortunate start, before I got into the game, we got great.
At the end of the last balloon, I've got the income I've used to.
We lost a hundred, which was key.
In the next set, we came to them with a view on the field, another defense, and we pushed them on the service.
The tie-break was awfully broken use, we dressed up on this page.
It was disappointment because we could have defeated the Russians.
It's a pity of the beginning of the first set, that's where we ran.
We've been able to download it, but we missed the bonds.
The second set was great, and in the third, the service was decided.
We've made a lot of mistakes.
We gave them five points, and it was about those five, we hesitated a lot.
It's a shame because the Russians were playful.
How did you play at the little yard number one?
Stuck: Similar as in China in the side yards.
The environment and the atmosphere were different.
There was an hour at night, full silence, music didn't play, nothing.
That was the difference against the center.
We wouldn't have chosen such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the game when you found the names an hour before the match?
Hermann: She was strange.
We started to practice the game without knowing the anti-players, so we couldn't make tactical preparations as for other teams.
But Simon (Nausch's house) has prepared tactics for almost all the options that were there.
He had a lot of tactics papers prepared, so we were pretty well prepared at this page.
Do you remember ever starting a game at midnight?
Hermann: I guess not.
We played at half the eleventh, but not at 12:00.
Block Rusky Birlov's in front of play-off on OH in Rio.
Beach volleyballists Marketa Sluk and Barbora Hermann in a hug in the predkol play-off on OH in Rio.
Was it uncomfortable?
Slakova: By playing the last two matches in a group of of ten, we had a regime moved before.
This was about two hours more.
It's strange, I can't imagine that another sport has sportsmen who have to make their best performance at 12 hours.
But I think we've prepared the best we could.
We knew it would be, but it's not totally typical and it's probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you appreciate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the group procedure was our goal, it's on one side okay, good.
We did what we said.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
Sluck: I'll get out of this and from tomorrow, I'll only remember the Olympic Tournament positively.
Big Brother's here, the first SIM smuggling coming.
You won't escape her.
The new rules should apply to all persons without the Thai passport, who decide to accompany SIM of some of the local operators when staying in Thailand.
Not only for tourists, but also for people with long - term visas, for example working or closed marriages in Thailand.
The Secretary-General of the National Transmission and Telecommunications Commission Takrn Tantasith informed that there would be no exception.
The SIM sales plan designed exclusively to foreigners presented a national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
The new measures to enable the monitoring of their positions will be introduced by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasitha, it is a means to preserve national security that allows a criminal activity committed by a foreigner.
Furthermore, the so-called tourist SIM should help to reveal those who exceed the allowed length of stay.
In a period of six months, SIM should be revealed by the Thaiians exclusively by the side of SIM.
The difference will be the function of the monitoring that will be permanently enabled in the cards of persons designated without the Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This function is not in the SIM for Thaians, because you can always watch easily," added Tantasith.
It is necessary to add that in Thailand pre-payments are not anonymous as in Czech Republic.
The seller requires an identity evidence.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators distributed free launching SIM tourists in airports.
They were totally anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand also considers ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries including Malaysia or Singapore.
Even in them currently apply the mandatory SIM registration, however, the legal use of the monitoring system is not possible.
However, the measures prepared are not required for a foreigner to accommodate a local operator when entering the SIM country.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in that case the Thai authorities will be short to them.
For the operators of the country after the cross-border border, that is, after the SIM is logged in to their network, they only know the relevant network information.
So they know the phone number, not information about the owner.
However, the difference in Roaming prices against local operators rates is so prosperous that even the majority of tourists during their stay in Thailand will begin to look at local SIMs.
The efforts of the authorities to supervise the movement of foreigners by foreigners living in Thailand legally faced immediate criticism.
Tantasith calms the situation and compares the residential address in immigration documents with regard to the protection of the private system.
In addition, the police will need a judicial order if necessary.
For any abuse of the system, the undetermined penalty will be threatened closer.
"If the service provider follows the position of SIM without a court order, he will be accused of a criminal offence," Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should maximise the use of pre-paid cards.
While there is a recycling of a specific number until the 90-day period after which the SIM has not been reported to the network, the new renewal of Thailand could occur after 15 days.
The luxury apartment in the new building in Vinohrads has a pool and a pool on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in the new building?
We've been looking for an unemployed apartment where most of the real estate carries the governor.
The condition was enough parking sites and elevator in the house, which basically disqualified the elderly.
Not to mention the problemic acustice in old houses, the problems with the clipping of the floor, the high energy difficulty, and so on.
The condition was also a large terrace, which the old plant is unable to offer.
For more interesting visits, see the magazine Modern apartment.
The entire interior proposed for you architect Lenka Langer with her colleague Camilo Polk from Artigo Study.
Why did you just call them?
Would you recommend collaboration with an expert to everyone?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to everyone, if he suggests an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the design of the interior itself: designers have a much better idea of the scale of possible materials and on the basis of the customer's wish they are capable of sharing the interior properly.
With architect Lenka Langer, we have already worked on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us even when we restructured our new apartment in the Winohrads.
What were your practical and estetical requirements?
We wished a generous social and residency space with the appropriate ground for a four-member family conceived as a modern but not a cold interior.
The priority was to aim at linking the apartment with the terrace and to implement intelligent control of the household.
And, of course, it was necessary to look at the quality of the implementation.
Did you leave everything on the experts, or did you interfere with the final form of the interior?
We have approved all proposals including technical charts and samples of materials, but the proposal has always come from the architects.
At the beginning, we have determined what we expect from design, and we show some elements of the interior that we would like to integrate into the proposal, such as carpets or images.
I think that our collection of Czech authors, mostly including the works of Karl Malich, Karla Susila, Václava Spala or Otto Gutfreund architectics, helped to focus on our taste.
Also the combination of black, white and nut tree was the idea of architect as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floors, lighting, carpets, textilia, art etc. We checked everything together by visualization.
Did some complications show up when you realized that you had to give up your original ideas, or are you going to join new ones?
Hopefully only in the introductory phase of the project, when we came to the building at the moment the first time it was possible to get up to the height of our floor, and they found that the views we planned are actually shading the surrounding buildings.
Then we changed our disposal literally overnight from the base.
On the kitchen line and on the armor of the chamber wall, the yula was used.
In the interior, wooden surfaces of the skin supplemented, such as the bar and dining chairs of Norm from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to change here or is there something you want to have different today?
I think it's a modern air interior, which is primarily fulfilling his purpose.
We're not going to change. Most of the adjustments after the moves have played in the shadow and accommodation terraces.
Hopefully the only climb is to the floor when the nut tree shows us as too hot for the dog's household.
The word of architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langer and MgA. Camila Hornich, author of the implementation.
The apartment is in the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to complete new disposal solutions and several other adjustments within the framework of the building.
For the interior, it is an important element of the location of lightwaters in the ceiling of the hall and the main toilet.
That's how we got the darkest light into the darkest place of the apartment.
The direct entry from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is also one of the construction adjustments that was very useful for the function of the entire apartment.
Part of it is also a pool and a squirrel.
In comparison with the French you are not negative, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live everywhere before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in southern France, a little bit from the Spanish borders.
I've moved quite a lot.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyona and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalistics, which led me to work in a magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was starting to feel like I'm drowning in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere among people.
I thought every French was awfully negative.
People in France are generally negative, but the last time it has been worse.
That's interesting that you're just talking about negativeism.
Some people appreciate the Czech nature like this.
Believe me, you're not negative in comparison with the French.
Some people may not come to France, because they don't feel so much like tourists.
But it was too much for me.
The big theme needs money.
People feel like they have little money, while the minimum remuneration in France is 1500 euros, which I think is enough.
In addition, there's a problem with the behavior of men against the Muslims.
That's incomplete for me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my unmuslim neighbor began looking at me just because I was a Muslim.
It's like I'm evil.
That's why I didn't feel well in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you just choose the Czech Republic?
I've been looking for a job in fact anywhere else, and I ran into a free place at Air France's company here in Prague.
I admit I didn't know Prague from the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my dad even told me about what was going on in Czechoslovakia, but I had no idea what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years, and I can't imagine I wouldn't live here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't catch any negative reactions or surrenders, but I feel like people are more free here.
That I can do anything, dress whatever I want, and no one's gonna judge me.
In France, someone's still looking unpleasantly at you, like if you have special clothes and similar things.
In Prague, I began to feel really free.
I don't think the desired people care about such things.
Where are you working now?
After I worked in Air France, I worked for a while for one travel site.
Then another friend and I set up a web site on which people offer and look for shared living.
We're only in Prague yet, but we'd like to expand this throughout Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are the Czechs of half, and two other Czech friends.
I have to say that another specificity of the Czechs is that they keep a distance from the beginning more.
He's not letting someone go to the body right away.
That's quite the difference from where I grew up.
In the south, they all hug and kiss their face.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural matter, so I'm trying to adapt.
You said you didn't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier problem for you?
On the contrary, I'm pretty simple in Prague because everyone here might speak English.
Even at dinners or foods.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have much time.
And by being able to communicate at least a little in English, I don't have that need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you met any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
Not in fact.
Maybe it's also because I work in an international environment which is more toleranceful.
One experience I'm thinking.
My leader, Czech Republic, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense: they are not French, but Africans.
That really touched me.
But that someone would have a problem with being a Muslim, that hasn't happened to me yet.
Even though a colleague once warned me of some antimuslim demonstration.
He said I shouldn't go to the center, they're gonna put me there.
The anti-Muslim demonstration is partially related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid, for example, that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, it can happen anywhere today.
Until recently, I may not have imagined that something like this would happen in France.
And it's not just about Muslims.
In addition, the Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me, people killing are not Muslims.
The Quran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists protect themselves by your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel embarrassed and guilty, even though I shouldn't feel that way.
I'm trying not to follow the reports of violence, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that isn't my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met at the Jeri's Square from the Debridges.
In the Wednesday, the Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated against violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know about it.
But I understand that people feel the need to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they'd have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't cause?
Do you meet in Prague and with other Muslims?
For example, my coworkers are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religiously founded than me, so sometimes we have a pretty wild discussion about Islam, because we all take it a little differently.
I'm from France, so I've been through another education, maybe they've been studying Islam in school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People of Islam sometimes connect to the subjected position of a woman.
How do you feel?
I don't think in any case.
It's rather the opposite.
I'm a woman, I'm strong.
It's related to the fact that you don't wear any head cover.
For example, Hyjab?
And it's signed mostly the way I was raised.
For example, my mom is a really principled Muslim.
He's praying five times a day, but he just doesn't wear a shoe.
She always taught me that faith is a personal thing.
It depends on every way he interprets it.
When a person reads the Quran, he should make his own opinion on these things.
So when I read the passage in Quran, which says that God told the prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said, "I am not the prophet's wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect it, and when I travel to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the blankets require it, I will take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
Yeah, so far.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but I'm fine in Prague.
I can even imagine to raise my own children here.
I think the threshold is an ideal city.
The Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated against violence.
The Yachtar's Kozelski Fencl wind in Rio has plunged on the processing lines.
The Friday ride on the sea in Brazilian Rio de Janiero arrived in the Czech yachtmen Veronice Kozelski Fencl.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved before the final two rides to the tenth place.
That would ensure the Czech participation in the final ride.
You're collecting packs like pokemons.
They want to compete with transporters.
Behind the idea of using already planned shipping routes, the television director Maciej Liska and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger stands behind the idea.
With the idea they inhaled the life of the three applications with a different geographical range.
The internal transport app we launched in May.
At this point there are thousands of cities recorded in it and we'll expand the network.
In Czech Republic, we want to learn this first than we focus more on abroad, says in an interview for iDNES.cz, a forty-four-year-old manager.
How does Transport work, and who can benefit from it?
You take it off and you'll register for free.
Then you can enter the route and data how much a large package you can carry and how much you want to do for it.
Someone might ask for a carriage again that day.
When the route and the time of delivery suits, it is parable, and both of you will come to an interim notification.
The chat will be opened at that point where the two will make the transfer.
How many people do you think would have to register to always find each package?
I don't know the perfect state, I can't guess how many registered and how many ways it takes to cover it completely optimum and every offer is compared with demand.
It's already working on the main tags, and it's logically easier than it is on the way between the villages.
The more people, the more speed and precision potential.
People are also building their trust and finding out that no one will run away with a package.
Didn't you have to deal with this case yet?
How many users have the service after two months of launching?
Now we have about 5,000 to 6,000 people who make ways.
We consider it a success, and we believe that there will be a pack of others.
Isn't there any threat that the sender will wait too long?
We hope that we will be competitive for large conglomerates only for the reason that we are able to deliver this thing for another day and for a fraction of the price.
In a large company, you pay a few thousand for delivery in two hours.
You're going to pay a hundred or less here, because that's the way someone's already taking.
Should traditional carriers be afraid of the possible loss of customers to the future?
We hope that's what it's gonna be.
The market has a huge potential, the huge transnational transporters are feeding here, as well as the trade chains where everyone started shopping and gradually discovered that quality does not correspond to what they are.
No one wants to find a ticket in the box with a message that he's gonna pick up a shipment on the branch, first that day after the 19th hour.
At the time, I needed a package for six hours and waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won't make anyone angry and send a competitive signal to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matthew Liska (39).
None of them have ever worked in information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matheus Lisica as a television director.
In 2014 they began to prepare the Shippansee LTD, which uses the already planned paths between world metropolis, especially the aircraft.
In 2015, they introduced a project to process a company that created applications such as MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming took three quarters of the year and the application was marketed in March 2016.
Transport applications started to develop in December last year and issued this year in May.
This is the local version of Shippansee, adjusted for the Czech market.
The application by the Month and the Mesique Profi has been developed since January and has been accessible to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was to make all these applications from the beginning, which one day connected into one.
In Czech Republic, they want to deliver the application and then focus more on the world market in cooperation with the strong investor.
The shared economy is a subject recently, and this is AirBnB or Uber service.
Don't you worry about the activities in the area where no one can tell us where the boundaries of sharing and where the gray economy are yet?
It's the same, but another product.
We understand that if it's going to be a success and we go up with it, we're going to be another trunk in the eye through the gray economy.
But even though someone saves and earns, it is not intention to circulate financial authorities and tax controls.
Each user, either on one or the other side, will be encouraged to give his income if it does.
Why do you think the service has such a great potential?
The sender saves and the carrier earns, respect reduces its travel costs.
That's the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
At the time of the social networks that people are dividing, we would like this one to get closer.
They can come up with nice stories, people are happy to help someone and talk about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
I think people have been missing personal access for a long time, and we say this application is the service of people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier with a package doesn't blow?
Each application user, along with the registration, scans a civil license and sets up a banking link, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give a service and a person credibility.
Couriers also collect stars on the basis of the sender assessment.
We're offering insurance, we're still going to get the details.
For the unsustained consignment in the case of loss or damage, the courier shall not take responsibility under the criminal law for the content, if there is something illegal inside and he doesn't know.
If the police stop him and find him in a closed package in his bag of self-pal or 10 kilo hashis, the criminal responsibility of the sender is over.
Isn't there any risk of using sensitive data from the database?
They are registered if necessary by a supervisory administrative authority, which as the only one will have the possibility to look into it, nor are we able to see them ourselves; the data are protected against abuse.
How much money does the courier get after successful delivery?
The courier determines the price and gets the entire amount he says about.
The sender shall be charged with several per cent for the intermediation of contact.
This money is our profit, but it's just a few percent because we want to push the volume.
The courier also can't blame that he didn't deliver the shipment when he actually delivered it, taking and delivering is verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can carry anything.
We have three sizes, small as a bone of butter, middle as an egg plate and a large as a bass beer.
Then there are no further restrictions, and if someone has a place in the car, they'll transport the fridge.
Plus the sender has a possibility in the application to photograph a package, so the courier can see what he wants.
You don't even have to pack if you don't want to hide the contents exposed.
You put the forgotten mickey in your hand to the courier, and that's it.
Who came with an idea, and how long did the service take?
The friend got an idea more than two years ago, and then I didn't pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demonstration of an application with an overnational reach, which targets mostly the travelling plane.
At that point, I told him I wouldn't be looking for an investor, but I would like to be the one and put in the savings.
The next year, development took place than we founded the Shippansee LTD for more credibility in London.
But this is not the version you're focusing on now.
No, we focused marketing on Czech Republic, where we're trying to trace the application because it all had birth pain, and it's still what to deal with and improve.
We are trying to respond to the reverse ties from customers and the foreign market we are not dealing with so much at the moment.
We know it's a long run, but we don't, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive applications, other two were in their way of upgrade.
The transport came when we thought that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn in Czech Republic.
The third application is local for the city.
But he can send a package to the exact address even to the second end of the world.
It works for the sender as well as the Transport, but the difference is that in it you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in your cell.
The application for couriers who want to eat it, we called the Profi Messenger.
So someone can make money exposedly by picking up packages around the city?
Exactly, the latest application takes off in Prague, like a taxizer, a student, a mother at a parent's vacation, someone who wants to get the way to work.
As everyone's fooling with those pokemones now, they can collect this all the same way.
A man sees where there are procurements in the city, comes to it, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and transported.
It's set cheaper than competitive services.
At this point, we're doing more web interfaces that will be difficult for shipping companies, they'll fill out the information on the web, or they'll make points on the map.
Then we are capable of using their service every month.
Do you now devote the project to a full job?
It's embarrassing us, but we normally have a job so that we can feed and develop the project.
There's no strong transnational investor behind us, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and another jumped into it with other incentives and ideas.
We are now looking for an investor strong enough to manage to cooperate with us, not the Czech market, but who should go with us to the world product with excusing the balls and become another giant player on the market, like AirBnB and Uber.
The historical part of Titanfall 2 should bring so forgotten pestrost.
This will fix the second part and solo game in it will be more sharp than in Call of Duty according to the first information.
The length will move around the standard eight hours and the filling shall be based on the concept of network fuel in the first part.
It is therefore possible to look forward to the freedom of movement, which includes the possibility of using a fighting titan.
In addition to the action passages, the game will contain levels focused on the reverse movement.
They'll remind the plots and include rebus.
Therefore, they are essential to the coupling of double jumps, running around the walls and the lane slide.
In addition, sometimes it will be necessary to eliminate enemies.
There will not be any maps that remind the blundering and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to lift and move the plots and close powerful doors.
That's what you're going to do.
The pace of the game should be oscylated between the furious action and the more calm moments for exploration of the unknown planet.
We're gonna play Jack Cooper's football game, dreaming about a pilot's career.
Cooper at the start of the campaign, along with Captain Lastimos, will ruin the alien planet of Tython, which are hostile soldiers.
And there will be no wilderness for him.
In addition, Lastimosa will crush death wounds in the crash, and Cooper will be given as a task to carry out the captain's titan.
His dream of a pilot's career will come true before he expected.
But the first step will be stealing the battery necessary for robot repair.
Cooper's calls with a titan will also be important.
It serves the players as a source of information about the military past, but at the same time, the robotic individual communication will be accompanied by humoral moments.
For example, when the titan will describe all the wounds that are threatening Cooper in the planned explosion.
The first information about the Titanfall campaign brought the Polygon server.
In addition, the results will be evaluated in two months and Bonusweb will bring you the first impression from the network game.
Titanfall 2 is coming on October 28th for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ mark will be alive, but the original publishing remains dead.
Swedish Nordic's company changes the name to THQ Nordic.
After the failure of the THQ issued in 2013, she received a number of its marks and the right to use the logo and the name of the company.
Nordic issued, for example, the Darxiders 2 Deatgnitive Edition or the Red Faction Collection package.
Furthermore, another 23 games are generated for publishing, and 13 of them have not yet been revealed.
Thirty years ago, at the time I retired, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found a 20 - year - old young man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first apparently she tried for a long time, then they went together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she was walking in front of me.
She's totally mad at him.
In those first days, even her voice changed, she had such a girl's, loved voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denyed it.
But I watched it all.
He was walking from work at half a quarter, so she always left at three for shopping.
She tried to see him every day.
Later, I realized they were meeting at his house, in the laundry room.
How many times I knew they were right there.
I got my keys, he was determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, at last, I've always been sitting at home.
I've never been able to go there, make the crucial step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife controlled me in mind.
Soon I think she found out that I'm controlling that I'm going to do what she wants.
And I really did it.
Maybe I'm just such a cockroach.
And the neighbors suggested that they knew about it.
I was such a fool that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if this all broke out, it would be bad.
That the family's gonna get into everyone, it's just a daughter.
So I've always delayed it, and on and on.
But once I went to his apartment to help me with something in the laundry.
He went there with me, and I told him I got anonymous, that he was meeting with my wife, and that he was telling me all about it.
I asked him what he would say to me.
He stood there, whispered his shoulders, looked at the ground and said no word.
Then I also met his wife on the way from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond to it, and she also didn't tell me anything.
No one said anything then.
I'm the kind of man who never went anywhere, having a problem meeting someone and finding a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I was still counting on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her all this and life's going on.
It wasn't like that.
And I've never dealt with all this in fact.
I still have it in me.
I used to show it to her quite often, but I finally left it for peace.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more than my wife's housekeeper.
She always did everything at home -- cooked, washed, cleaned.
She's working.
I think she always tried to make me no other reason to complain.
And you can say she's even good.
But sometimes I'd like to hug her, hug her, and she won't let her.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks what a happy marriage we have.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she loved me and she loved me, but she didn't love me.
And I see that he loves him so far, it's her god.
And I'm not sick of this life.
I told her once that I didn't want to live, and I asked her what she would say to if I finished.
I wanted to know if she would agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her, yes or no.
But she thought, and finally she said, "But there's enough place."
Prime Minister Manuel Vals wants to establish a new French Islamic Fund, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
After terrorist attacks, France graduates from the fight against radical Islamists and the government and the local Muslim minority calls for help.
"If the Muslims themselves do not help the State against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom of their confession," Prime Minister Manuel Vals said.
He is going to ensure that only spiritual education in France is preached in the country.
He also wants to stop the funding of mixtures from abroad, where money often comes from preachers filled with gigades.
By October, Prime Minister Vals wants to establish a new French Islamic Fund, which should serve as a bridge between the state and his Muslim people.
The new institutions will replace the current French Fund for Islam, which the Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin established in 2005.
It should have contributed to the transparency of financial flows between the meshites and the countries that finance their construction.
Soon, however, it was affected by internal disputes, and it never worked well.
"It's a total failure," said Vals.
The new foundation will apparently be the former Minister of Interior and Defence Jean-Pierre Chevènement, known as the secular state.
In France, approximately 2500 messits and prayers, some 120 of them serve radical islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities have exposed about 80 Islamic clergymen from the country and consider this step in several other tens.
This week, also, the German police have struggled against the gygadist.
The property reportedly recruited warriors for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a place where believers reportedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Right after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the French debate on a new institution that will replace the non-functional foundation.
All the other terrorist attacks have been speeded up, which radical Islamic Islamic people in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mixtures from domestic resources and also to supervise the property.
But it is not yet clear where he gets finances, although several proposals are considered.
One of them is a special fee for food hall, especially for meat originating in defeats under the Islamic principles.
This tax would be paid in practice by the sellers to hall food for granting permission.
Part of the money would then travel to the budget of the foundation.
The contributions of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French passengers who go to Mekka.
Every year, about 30 thousand of them leave from France to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, only preachers who passed educational programmes in the local universities should work in French mosquitoes.
Their preaching should therefore be in line with democracy.
The government also closes radical messengers.
"We closed them twenty since December and the others will follow," said Bernard Cazeneuve's Minister for Interior.
"In France there is no place for those who declare hatred and disrespect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was severely injured by an unknown shooter on Friday morning at the Shopping Centre in Northern Spain Zaragoze, says Independent Journal.
The shooting happened after the woman and her daughter left the garage spaces in her car.
The man was waiting in the car before the shopping center, where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, a man then turned a gun against himself, says Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an injured daughter, and an ambulance had to come for a man in critical condition.
The act took place about 11.00 at the central part of the autonomous area of Aragon, near the local university.
With appeal to the Spanish Agency, Europe Press writes Independent that the motive was likely unsolved by the recent divorce of both partners.
Whirlwinds with crustace, wakamy with rays, mirror and chilles with sauce.
The summer wishes for light, well-food foods, but we are the Czech rebels and we have our tastes and our head.
And so the summer barbecue smells a grilled neck, a beef, a pig ring.
Nothing very healthy, nothing very light, so sometimes except for salad or baked vegetables.
True, barbecue is savings for time and meals, and it is also a social matter and no one has to be closed in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives, how to make good tastes that are particularly special tournament, their preparation represents a small ritual, but there is nothing longer to cook, bake, bake, or choke.
And they'll contribute to our health.
Whether it is necessary for home sushi or sashimi, where quality raw materials and a couple of well - conquered griffs will be enough for the preparation to be entertainment and food itself a real exotic flavour.
Just like even easier rolls in the rice paper from today's recipe.
There's even a time-time harder cooking and rice cooking.
The paper can only be softened into the water for a moment and then it depends only on the fantasy of the cook, how she's going to play with fills and supplements.
It's not like a corn.
The benefit of a number of Asian kitchen foods is that raw materials are generally available today.
Inclusively loaded sweet acid taste, which is one of the basic tastes of sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but the right pink gari barrel has a unique pixant sharp and also a nice taste by a secret reception that mixs from several species of oct and marrow.
It is therefore enough to buy a bag corresponding size, and the appendix with proven antibacterial effects, supporting consumption and resistance against cough or flu, is complete.
Banana leaves.
In particular, they are used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures to serve and decorate foods within various festival opportunities and rituals.
Long beauty leaves are very widespread in a number of countries in Asia or South America, as well as "help" for the preparation of various baked, cooked and roasted foods that are packed into them as in the alobal.
The banana sheet then gives the food a specific taste.
We can buy in shops with exotic fruit and vegetables, even in advance cut in the form of wheels.
But only pick the leaves of the green, and therefore healthy, unbreakable and unsurprising.
Similarly, the preparation of a wakame salad, sesam and sesame oil is easy.
Because it can be bought again frozen.
Who often prepares her sushi, probably will know the rainbow of nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of marine seas, from which it is produced by cutting, lissing and drying the so-called Nori leaves – therefore payments intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame – darkly green grain growing in waters around the Hokkaidó island – it is also fresh and dried and is as popular as a fountain of nori.
By the way, who doesn't know the soup with the wakame, Asian women reportedly use it from ancient time to recover after birth.
And at all, this line has almost miraculous effects.
Clean blood, strengthens the blood circulation, even reportedly prevents hair greying and is literally loaded with mineral substances.
Dried and broken wakame also serves as spinnings, for example, to taste rice.
Fresh fountains first let themselves relax in the water, then swallow, put them in hot water and half minutes cook.
Then it colds in ice water, cuts out the middle ribs and continues to adjust, like the favorite salad.
But buying it is already finished, frozen, it's the easiest solution.
So it's just to wrap the roll with easy vegetable filling, flavory and light, full of healthy tastes.
Such a long-term bomb.
If you resist and don't throw a barbecue extra.
Eat healthy, easy and summer.
The Asians know how to do it.
A few special raw materials and a little skill, and you have an interesting fresh food that tastes deliciously.
And it's done once two.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots, 40 g white rare, 100 g green christ, 60 g salad corn, 60 g wakame and 60 g sweet chilli sauce.
Pearls of season, black spoons, scarf chilli sauce, 20 g manga and 40 g loaded gari brass, a little pini nuts.
Let's get our scrolls ready first.
We'll wet the rice paper for five seconds into the cold water.
Then we'll get him out and wait for him to get soft.
Meanwhile, in the hot water, we cook the baptisms shortly, and about three minutes later, we will get them to cold quickly into the ice water so they can not lose the color.
We'll put a supplement in the vegetables and pack it.
We'll make the filling out of the white rare, carrots and salad cocktails that we're cutting on soft powders, mixing them with a sweet chill with a sauce, adding a cut coriandr, mixing thoroughly and putting it on the rice paper.
In the banana sheet, we're putting the bachelors, we're going to add the scrolls, and at the end, we'll decorate the whole food with a wakame, loaded with a wakame, with a manga platoon, we'll smoke with a black season and add a few pini nuts.
Britain must satisfy the silver in the seventh rugby, picking Fiji takes gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain in the seventh football ends with a destructive track on the last obstacle, Fiji defeated the final match on Thursday night Britain at Deodoro stadium here in Rio high 43:7.
The Fijians performed a master lesson in processing, puzzle, swaps, support games, rushing to lion and brutal forces -- and gained gold, their first Olympic medal at all.
The defeat came with the unauthorized price of comfort in the form of a silver medal - for Britain the third day - and the British could be at their inauguration Olympic tournament of the seventh football, defeated New Zealand, Argentina and the South African Republic.
The victory of South Africa 7:5 in the semifinal the same day may have frozen in the final.
However, Fiji would also beat the 15-member team in full health.
It's probably not a comfort for the British, but they can be happy that at least one of them will have a gold medal around the neck tomorrow: the chief trainer of Fidjan is Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.
Great Britain has injured a piece of road.
Eight years ago, Ryan's leaders lost every match in Adelaide Sevens.
They've lost the only one here.
This defeat hurts, but progress is unsupportable.
Fiji began greatly, the invasions of the British reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and other colleagues, it was like running around a number of buses in the motion and the championships of the world cup led 5:0 when Osea Colinisau came out of the corner.
The timelight showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which it was conversion.
12:0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
Great Mitchell tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring the third, but only Fidjans slowed down.
In the seventh minute he threw Jasa Veremalua touchdown in the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another after return and the hours still remained more than one minute... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravowa then broke through the small Britains and stuck on the lion where he scored.
After the conversion to state 29:0, there was a break.
It was like Fiji was born for ragby 7s, while the British were still learning how to transmit.
It's just like that.
The British after half the time made massive changes, and the Fijani's effort stopped... for four minutes, which was good in comparison with the first halftime, until after the brilliant interior Fiji Josua Tuisova went on.
Dan Norton tried to get for the British an opportunity, threw the touchdown into the left corner to raised an 36:7. But the match has won the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands long ago and their fans sang, waving flags and dancing.
It was hard not to admire the completely excited approach of the Fijani.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame also made the next attempt to win the Fijians sweetened.
The whistle called, the Fijians hugged themselves, and the British fell on the grass totally defeated.
Even before the same day Fiji defeated Japan 20:5 in the semifinal, and the Great Britain defeated the South African Republic in a close semifinal - the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the first halftime to lead, but Dan Norton, thanks to his shiny work with his legs, broke the defense line and scored in the second half-time under the hook.
The great late puzzle of Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother from the fifteenth team of England, secured a victory -- and eventually a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired the fight of coach with cancer
You can't find more emotional gold on these Games - and that's what to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 penal exhaustions in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found further meaning in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Even though there were two seats, there were three votes in the boat. When the ship wailed at the level against the second Olympic gold behind them in the race of women's couples, there was still the voice of the still present coach, Robin Williams, who were the first women in the history of the British sport that achieved such a result.
Their advantage was absolute, totally their 39th race, where they remained unsuccessful.
What we see -- two excellent athletes flying on the water level with the elegance of the lab -- does not reflect the nature of victory completely.
For every gold medail from the veslovation, there is a batalion of helpful hands that part after a piece mean the difference, and no hands were helped more than the coach's hands 30 months ago that didn't know if he would survive this day when his cancer was found.
He said it was uncertain.
I suffered the cancer of the urine bubble that could be operated, and I took this operation.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It's somewhat to change your view of things.
The cancer was found to Williams in December 2013.
Fortunately, for the whole trio was that he could initiate treatment in the beginning of 2014, outside the season, and reduce the loss to the minimum - if that's what we can call it under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together quickly.
That was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time they said it was enough for a few steps.
That's how it started.
Speaking about yourself is a way, but this was a little harder.
Right after winning, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, spoke less than usually, as he tried to manage his own disturbance.
Stanning, the captain of the Royal Army Colonel, who has a mission in Afghanistan, said: “I was with emotions on the bottom this week, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much. ”
It emphasizes how much it means to me how much we worked with Helen and Robin, too.
Until now, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so he belongs to a great thanks, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't wish a better man for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose the only race in five years.
She put two of them in an impressive rhythm that their rivals could not compare.
Even in the final 500 meters, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began approaching, Stanning had a very large reserve with Glover.
We've focused at the moment at most.
Helen shouted: "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to let yourself abduct.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't want to achieve something famous.
We weren't looking forward to today's fireworks, we just wanted to hang well, go out and win the race, which we did.
Two people take a year to think before they decide what's going on.
Glover's marrying next week, her incoming TV accommodation is Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it would be my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London before they found out I was a Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It makes me feel much better," she said.

Prison?
Rather, let them ride people for free, the taximan says Rubesh to the breakdown lawsuit.
Six taxiers and former magistrate official in Prague are, as she said, accused.
You've recorded a number of reports in which you've discovered the fraud practices and those who are to be in the group that will be before the court.
You've been facing a few unpleasant fights with discovered actors.
How much is the report on the accusation of members of the organised group broken for you?
I was expecting it to happen to some court.
I'm mostly curious about a judgment.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
That's nothing.
They should primarily return all the money stolen.
And they should get them back so they can drive all people for free.
That's a little different solution.
Does that mean that you do not consider the possible punishment sufficiently effective?
It's enough for me that some of them are so scared that they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one does a penguin, another carries pizza, and one of them totally dropped out of it.
Prosecutors can teoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think that's an adequate rate?
I generally have a problem with liberation.
I think it's a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in that case, is nonsense.
Such people should return the company they took her.
For the fourth century, they did destroying our country’s name and stealing people.
So let's make a good card now and unload people for free.
I can't imagine anything else.
It would work as a publicly useful work.
As someone goes to gather waste, they'd get a car, and they'd ride people on Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll finally get a condition and they don't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He was studying at the Film Academy Miroslav Ondric in Pisco and then at the University of Tomáš Bati in Zlína.
They belong to people who in the Czech Republic started with viral videos and videos directly for the web.
He works as a editor for Internet TV Stream.cz, where he is participating in a number of series, is now preparing the show of Prague Guide, which is primarily designed to foreign viewers.
Those Rubes are advised to avoid the services in Prague as a form of brief reports, and they recommend that they use them without concern.
He used to film a series with names How for that, City of fraud?, Life in luxury, And enough! and Prague vs. Powder.
In the lawsuit, they are referred to as an organized group.
The police have been watching her for months.
Is that a network of cheating taxiers known as a mafian?
They're such sweet mafias, not the ones we know from Kmotra.
It's more about mafians - juniors, but they're organized.
It's just that they're watching each other's stairs.
The threshold's all broken.
I tracked that, for example, the main station does not like Paris, Pariska does not like taxiers waiting at Karls Laznia (disco club)
Everyone's just watching his own place, and every group is kind of organized.
Apparently, it's a confused network.
However, only seven people, six taxiers and one former magistrate official, who warned the driver from control.
As you say, the undesirable phenomenons from the streets have not disappeared.
So what is the percentage between the Prague fraud in the taxi service, according to your estimates?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still.
For example, I'm talking about Alesh Riyachek.
It's a man who's really dangerous - in his car he drives a telescopic earring, and every Friday and Saturday stands next to Karl's bridge and drives people.
When I last drove with him, he wanted me seven hundred miles in three miles.
His police for some reason didn't hold it.
They only chose a few people from the whole big group.
However, the same situation is also in other locations of Prague.
It is therefore difficult for seven people to erase the famous Prague barrier, which is apparently much greater.
Of course it's nothing.
It'll help, but all evil doesn't get cleaned up, that's true.
Are taxiers stealing foreign tourists still in the same places you showed in the press, Carl's bridge or Paris Street?
Yeah, that's right.
They stand in these locations every day and they break the statements every day.
It ignores the city police and the Prague magistrate.
It's not even cats anymore, it's total indifference.
Business of Prague taxiers in numbers
Still, some of them, being only a part of the group, will be brought to trial.
It's already a breakdown.
So I have to ask, do you feel satisfaction?
If I took it as satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, it was, and it would always be to make the center of Prague better.
And even if I feel like it's a little better, I'll continue.
You need to push the door on the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we still have to do something to remove him.
It can't be satisfied.
But it's not that way, of course there's more of them.
Are you still trying to confront them directly in the cabs?
Sometimes I'm doing test drives, and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week I caught one cab, by the way from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three miles, although he then claimed that it was a amount of 56 crowns (used a trick with a decimal line).
He had an argument, the cops arrived, and this taximan was so cute that he was still going to see those cops and asked them when someone finally gave him those 56 crowns.
Similar case.
A taxi carrier on the taxameter screwed a dozen and robbed tourists with 357 crowns.
Can you say that the drunkenness of cheating taxiers didn't come down even after you showed the faces of those who charged nonsense amounts for a short ride?
Their bravery is still incredible.
How did this taxi driver get 56 crowns?
The cops sent him away with the fact that they can't discuss with him at the scene because he put the account.
And that'll be, I think, the problem with that court (six taxiers and one executive).
On the one side there will be a taxi driver with his accounts on the other side of the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice, the magistrate shall not use secret tapes from the taxi vehicle as evidence in the court.
When I was filming pieces about their frauds, the taxiers themselves warned me about this precedens.
But I always wanted to use it to the press.
Are you worried that this reality could protect them from the court?
I hope every judge will understand that no taxi driver could ride in six or ten crowns per mile because he wouldn't eat it.
You talked about a trick with a dozen line, which, especially before foreign clients, cheating taxiers move.
Is it still current, or do this fígl still use after the publication of your news?
I think we've populated this trick by sending the show on the contrary.
I recently went with a taxi driver, praised in front of me that he was the honest taxizer.
But then I noticed that on the side of the taxameter was a black sticker.
When I asked him what it was, he said, "You know what it is."
If the convicted taxiers didn't work too much, can the court be warned about them with their colleagues?
Is there anything that can distract them from fraud?
You've been talking about the way you think they'll always find the way to cheat.
I don't think anything can disturb them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are fair taxiers who should be fighting more to get them out of there.
From my experience, I have to say that fair taxiers in Prague, fortunately, overcome.
But do they want to go against those who ruin the reputation of their services?
They're tasteful, but they're missing their mind.
They don't know how to walk, and they can't say exactly what they want.
When they organized this demonstration (for a proposal for general restrictions from the Primator Adriana Krnačov office), it was not very clear what they wanted.
They once said they didn't test against Uber that they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they claimed that they wanted more than Uber.
It just happened to block Prague and it was just the best advertisement for Uber.
How do you totally evaluate the access to the Prague magistrate in the solution to the problem of the riding?
It's obvious that the criminal police had to get into it to solve something.
The magistrate was short for it.
They had a mole who was making information there, which means that the taxi department had been doing their job for a few years completely unnecessary.
I hope that the official will be charged to the last check of all the lost controls to realize what he did.
That's the worst thing I think about.
I've even been with him on one control ride, which I've learned until afterwards from their schedule.
It's been months since the last series were published.
What's the response?
I mean, especially with foreign viewers, before the series is actually most focused.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I let the videos go.
And then when we're going to the Staremest Square, they're surprised that the same people that are seen in the videos are really standing.
The famous Prague celebrity.
I'm serious.
I'd build a plates around them so that people would look at them.
Museum of Communism directly on the street.
My last question is clear.
Are you riding a cab when you need it?
Sure.
I ride with services where I don't have to pay cash, but with a card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are many dispatches that are fair.
I took a cab on the street only once since.
The driver said, "Well, you have the courage."
Bem in a dress for an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxiers have been written in 2005.
The former Primetor Paul Bem went to the control ride of the Italian tourists in the same year, and at the first attempt, his driver screwed up by two hundred.
The editor Rubesh had worse experience.
The taxi drivers charged him for a ride from Staremestski to the Václava Square 820 crowns, which is approximately 195 crowns per mile, as the reporters calculated.
The Prague magistrate set the maximum price of 28 crowns per mile.
There are also other surprising amounts in a short story: for example, a two-mile road from Parisian Street to Truhlářska was 400 crowns tourists.
The expensive rides were also provided by taxiers waiting at Carl's bridge.
At the journey to an angel of 2,5 miles, they charge six hundred crowns.
Mramor is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and the longer, the better.
It's a good thing to do with pollution, even though sometimes the dirt has to be put down with scalpel, it's needed to be deepened out of the conversions.
It's not easy and it's not going fast, she's closer to her work, Vanessa Trost from Oldrichov in Hayah.
The hat down in front of her: the grave is constructed with a whiskey that needs to be climbed out and come down again.
"The restaurant should be careful, patient and unused at the work environment," she stated.
It's not far from her first restaurant work in Friedland.
For example, the stone elements of the fasada in the back tract of the Fridlant City, also restauranted Stupes of St. Mary Magdalena in Ticho, saint John Nepomuck in Fridlanta, Pietu in the Fridlant County Street, the Marian column in Fridlant, or atlants in the proliferation of bathing in the New City under the Smurk.
With the renewal of the Melchiora, Christoph and Katerina of Redern, it began in 2011 in Fridlant.
Now the surface of the stone elements of pollution and crust are cleaned, the relaxed stone parts shall be secured against the fall and the movement; either they will cocktail into the wall or to each other.
They are also waiting for treatment and preservation of the surface.
The signs on the grave will be posted again.
"Then it starts by staring the marbles on the plates with a steam of gold," said the referencer of the National Memorial Care of the City Office in Fridlant Vera Saturday.
There are no records from the past that the cemetery would pass through some repairs.
When they look closer, they capture the holes ripped in the marble columns.
They're hundreds of years old and it's about the remains after the decoration of the grave.
He was richly decorated, unfortunately after the Swedish arrival of the Thirty-year War, everything disappeared.
They literally looked at the grave, noted Saturday.
In the church the finding of the Holy Cross are restaurants with a slight overtake as home.
After the flood in 2010, a baptism, wall painting in the grave, and now the grave, was needed.
"We would also like to go to the vitrage in the future," Sabota said.
The church is differently in a very good condition, each year we invest money in maintenance and repair.
Restaurant work on renewal of the redern grave will come totally to 128,000 crowns.
They will be saved with funds, the city will not invest any of its money in this part of the renewal.
A hundred thousand crowns will come from the victory in the circuit of the Contest History City 2015, the remaining 28,000 crowns then is the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, stated Mayor Fridlantu Dan Ramzer.
The deputy decided to release the victory for the restoration of the grave.
The views of experts for future development on the selected foreign markets monitored by indexs and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) in the horizont of one month and a half of the year.
Low volatility and growth are overcome on the markets.
Who'd say that at the beginning of the year.
The American S&P500 index, which passed 12% of the correction today, is on a new historic maxime, and he has already accorded 7% since the beginning of the year.
Again, the iron rule is confirmed that traders should never go against the interests of central banks that have finally achieved their own.
In the situation where the American shares at the historic maxime are again disappearing, the volatility, which is currently low since 2014, where markets have grown satisfactorily and without fear due to the quantitative release of the US Central Bank, and where, as today, the volatility index (VIX) has been maintained stable under the limit of 12 per cent.
And not too.
Although the Fed markets continue to prepare for the progressive increase in interest rates, quantitative releases in Europe and Japan are fully streamed, and in the last week it also added the Bank of England to work, which will buy debts in the amount of 70 billion pounds in the next six months.
The new wave of quantitative relief, therefore, pushes so low profits even below and contributes to almost complete elimination of the risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
Of course that's a million question.
But at the moment there are no risks, the world's economy is going through almost constant growth without bigger disturbances, the situation on the commodity market and in China is stabilized and brexing is no subject, so we should probably not be too surprised if the American stocks continue in a peaceful regime.
It's a pity Juncker doesn't study Klause!
I am very glad my friend Michel Barnier accepted this important and difficult task.
I wanted to make this difficult work of an experienced policy, the chief of the European Commission, Juncker, when the French politics (really experiencing, because the exploited so many different cross-national political functions that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to look for) has appointed the European Commission's main negotiator for the EU's departure of the conditions of leaving the Great Britain from the EU.
Juncker's choice shook signs of hope that it is in the serious interest of the EU to seek with Britain the forms of future friendly coexistence.
But most of the British media accepted Barnier's name as Juncker's war act.
Barnier is a rocky European federalist.
Great Britain hates it.
As the European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), the reform of the European Banking Law was in charge.
The only enemy of the English concept of the free market and the capitalism model was captured by him.
The representative of multilateral regulations was a co-authorist of the concept of the banking union and struggling against everything that originated from the London financial centre of City, promulgated the legislation overwhelmingly tough regulations of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in a dispute with London, will be a hard, unbreakable and apparently irrespective negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
How do you not remember the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, which has contributed so much to reasoning, review and empathy of Prime Minister Václava Klause?
Thus, today the Czech Republic may be the closest friends and allies.
It's a shame that Juncker from Vaclavo Klaus - at least in this - hasn't learned.
It would be for the sake of everyone!
A earthquake around Putin?
The Master of Kremlu released his closest Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivanov from the position of the presidential office on Friday.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno.
The Russian media informed it by appealing to the press service of Kremlu.
Putin indicated that Ivanov was released on his own request.
During the meeting transmitted by Russia's 24 TV station, the president said that he was in contrast with the wish of Ivanov, whom he had spoken, to be head of the presidential office for up to four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The Exchange Report of the President's Administration, which is now led by Ivanov's present representative Vajno, is considered relatively surprising.
Ivanov, 63 years old, is named as one of the closest colleagues of Putin.
For example, this former officer of KGB in the past held the function of the Minister of Defence and the Vice-President of the Government.
He will now leave the chair of the President's Security Council.
Ivanov, at the meeting with Putin, said that the length of resistance in the administration of the Chief of the State is actually a recordman.
He spent four years in it and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that 11 people have already been treated in this function in 25 years since it was put in place.
Uncle's quit or debliss won't play the finals.
So far, none of the fifth tennis fights have been converted to the final participation.
As her first battle, Peter Quit, who was subject to the Portorican surprise of Monica Puig after the seats 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
Even the Czech deblists of Shafariva and Uncle followed the Quett after a while.
Even though the killers of the sisters Williams at the first set hit the win, they wasted two squads, and the Russians eventually used a hundred in a shorter game.
The second set then lost at 4:6.
Half success in the morning program in Rio recorded the Czech verbation: Skifar Ondrej Synek won its semifinals with a review when the second Damir Martin from Croatia defeated despite relevance in the conclusion of almost a second.
Good today, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as possible, said Sonek.
His rivals, unlike him, had to fight for the procedure.
So it's got some power to them, so it could be easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's gonna be easy, it's just playing my cards, said the Prague Ducla veslar.
Mirka Topink-Knapk, but she wasn't walking in Snyk's tracks.
Fifty-fifty-year-old vesslare in today's semi-final in her ride's fourth position, and on Saturday she's in the finals of the B and the fight at 7 to 12th place.
Baby from London doesn't do that.
I didn't go to the final for the first time in the Olympiade.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I've been on a quality race, and I've put everything I could do.
The competitors were just better, the Topink Knapk's headed in front of them.
She fought to the end and believed that she would get into her fourth games between the elite six.
The fight gave up just before the target.
I knew the girls were balanced that anyone could get out of this field.
I was surprised the Chinese woman had such a finish.
And I thought I could get to the final.
Unfortunately, today's life race, she told the master of the world of 2011.
Far behind the final gate in Rio, a young shooter Philip Nepeichal, who has not been able to get out of the qualifications this time, is a lingerie in bed.
The Nepeichal took 33th place in it.
The qualifications were better than the Russians.
From the first line, Sergej Kamenski came with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628,9).
Neichal's shot was 620.5 points.
The first time athletes talked to the Rio program, including the Czech seven-boyers, Katerina Cach and Eliška Klucin.
Cachs belong to the second discipline of the Olympic Competition 11th place, Czech recorder Eliška Klučinová is twenty-two.
Britta Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 inches as the second Belgian Nafissatou Thiam.
Both have taken care of history of the best high-level performance within the seven-boy.
They tried to jump 201 inches, but they failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
When we look away from the absurdity of such a question: the German company has been deeply self-reflexed, where Russian is not.
In both the great eurosian nations, dictators came to power in the 20th century, and regimes that were not human, brutal and horrible.
Russian Bolshevici have contributed to 94 million victims of communism, which is stated by the Black Book of Communism, whether it was a daily individual repression, aimed at hunger, incompetent leadership of war or non-human experiments.
In a non - human way, Nazis destroyed about 6 million Jews and the total victims of the Second World War, I estimate 60 million.
In the occupied or abandoned territories, the Germans and the Soviets were performing.
In Germany or SSSR, there were only a few individuals, but the majority of the nation participated either actively, passively or simply cowardly or pushing the head into the sand.
It's not just the specificity of these nations, but we are the Czechs like guilty.
In Germany, the Denisification, the Norimber Tribunal, immediately came to an end of the war.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they started asking, Daddy, Grandpa, why did you participate in such beasts?
How could you do that?
This brought a real reflection and the healing of the company.
The German elites have taken care of the prosperity of the country, the removal of poverty, the prosperity of their citizens.
Now they have other (optional naively idealistic) goals, but they definitely don't want to join Alsasko-Lotrinsko or someone - to revanš - military attack - may be recognized by everyone.
After the lost cold war in Russia, there was no big reflex.
The window of possible positive changes has definitely been closed at the millennium breakdown when the former KGB officer (sic!)Vladimir Putin has reached power.
A frequent criminal history is celebrated today in Russia.
The Patinovian Politics of Russia is a revenge, winning lost territories, humiliating the West.
Health, prosperity and the future of people of their own is no value for the summit.
Beat yours, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only for the decades of the despotical regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally less valuable - destined to Asian (see) tyranny.
Who benefits from the growth of tension around Crime?
Ukrainian army.
In the last days and hours, the situation at the Ukrainian-Russian border in the area of Crime has been worsened.
Who's the benefit of the growth of tension?
After the longer period of relative calm, there has been a further deterioration of relations between Ukraine and Russia.
The Ukrainian Party's cause has become Crim's half-ostroves, which was connected to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, the reports of both opposed parties are contradicted, and it is difficult to verify independently, so we only have the opportunity to think of an old-familiar question to whom it benefits?
According to Moscow's reports, there were terrorist attacks on Crime from the Ukrainian party, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and accuses Kreml of provocation.
The information on the arrest of Ukrainian special units in the territory of Russia has already come from the case of the Savchenka pilot that they were reportedly kidnapped in the territory of Russia.
If we joined the Ukrainian version, what would help Russia to improve the situation around Crime?
The simple answer is, in nothing.
The escalation of tension around Crime can only damage Russia, especially from the West in the form of another sanctions and strengthening the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, the immigration crisis in Europe has arisen from the situation in Ukraine.
Ukrainian leadership has already lost a full loan in front of its inhabitants when the current support of President Rashenko is moving about 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have been bankrupt for a long time without being generous financial injections by the EU and mainly the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to reiterate its country's clear attention in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation before the voters in his country.
President Porošenko and other members of the leadership of the power components want to show themselves again as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the Great Russia.
It is not only to hope that all those who are trying to settle an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not just soldiers, but all the ordinary people on both hostile parties and stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria showed inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, in Bulgaria, the monthly inflation rate of 1 % has reached in July.
This is the highest value for several years (from June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2 % was published.
The annual average inflation rate measured by the CPI index in the last 12 months (July 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous period of 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumption price index in July 2016 against June 2016 was 101,0 %, so the monthly inflation was 1,0 %.
The inflation rate from the beginning of the year (July 2016 against December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 against July 2015 was -0.2%.
In addition to the previous month, the growth of the roads of these consumption groups was observed in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic drinks (1.7 %), transport (1.8 %), culture and recreation (6.3 %), restaurants and hotels (1.2 %), other goods and services (0.3 %).
Price decreased in clothes and shoes (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and normal maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as the previous month, prices remained in alcoholic drinks and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
The U.S. Secret Services have been watching the hacker attacks of the Russians a year ago.
Information on Russian attacks came to the public last month when the Federal Investigation Authority (FBI) announced that he was dealing with a attack on the servers of the Party's Democratic Centre.
However, no official report is mentioned by the Russian share of the attack.
Moscow's share in the attack denied.
The report on the monitoring of the alleged Russian attack was strictly secret, because it would show that the US secret services are monitoring and discovered the way they do it and what resources they use.
They said two Russian rapporteurs participated in the attack.
New Cyber Safety Consultation
The Russian track track material was coded and access to it had only a small group of experts, Reuters wrote.
Only a small group of eight head Members of the Congress, called U.S. gang eight, was informed of public factors.
The heads of both Chambers Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, Presidents of Democrats in both Chambers Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and four members of the Defense and Security Committees of the Congress.
The official head of the Democratic Party, Donna Brazile, announced on Thursday that she was creating a cyber security advisory board, which would "restrain future attacks and ensure primary protection of the servers of the Democratic Party".
There was a dangerous parasite in the salmon from Alberto.
The Rider apologized.
Based on the incentive of consumers to health problems after consumption of the food of Losos wildly occupied - pieces 100 g, the date of consumption of 22.11.2016 was carried out by the Prague hygienic control at Albert's sales at the Vaclava Square and on Bridge.
The check found that the L23012562/T4 series with the date of consumption of 22/116, which the customer noted is no longer available, and therefore the product of the identical series with the date of consumption 11.12.2016 was removed.
Laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It's a parasite worm of the tract of seas.
It is dangerous for a man - larvas in the body or the muscle of fish are a strong allergen and a man eaten alive can break through the stomach wall into the internal organs, he stated Stich.
We apologize to the customers for the problems of this label product.
We immediately downloaded the series from the sale and for preventive reasons we also downloaded all other series of this item.
There was doubt on the side of the supplier we were dealing with and we let this product test ourselves, told the News speaker Albert Barbora Vanko.
If the customer bought this product, he can get it back in any of the chain shops and get the money back.
The larvas will destroy the freezing and sufficient heat adjustment
The seller was Nekton - Vrnjata.
The appearance of a dangerous product was informed of the Prague and Mediterranean Veterinary Management.
According to the food safety server.cz people may have a disease after the seeming of a parasite, with an Anisakiosis that is shown by severe stomach pains, vomiting and nausea, or disease can run unexpectedly, the CTK stated.
The symptoms are delivered for an hour to two weeks after consumption insufficiently processed infected fish.
After three weeks from the beginning of the larva disease, most of them will spontaneously leave the tract.
Adult worms and larves are sensitive to higher and low temperatures, so they are killed either at sufficient heat processing of fish meat or freezing.
The veterinarians have currently verified the salmon even with the recipient of the imported goods in the Mediterranean region.
Three of the five tested samples had parasites in them.
The consignment of 1700 products came to the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Management (SVS) at the beginning of April.
Exploded, in the total majority to the Ahold chain, was 919 packagings to date.
The download of unsold products from sales is currently being downloaded, said SVS speaker Peter Peichal on Friday.
The veterinarians immediately after finding positive samples prohibited sending other products from the warehouse.
Seventeen-year-old Britain wanted to get out of Raka, probably killed by a Russian raid.
After the initial enthusiasm and a fast marriage with a джиhadist who was murdered in the first place, there was a trip.
The expected paradise of chaliphate for British girls turned into hell on earth, from which there was no escape.
The girl was in contact with her sister Halima according to her relatives.
She repeatedly phoned to Britain and confidented that she wanted to go home.
Leave the Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They have orders without reason to shoot, quotes The Telegraph's family lawyer Tasnim Akunjee.
The latest tracks led to Raka, the girl's last responded from there.
Then there was only a report of her death, but it can't be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in East London.
They discussed together how she could get out of Raka and cross the Turkish border.
There they were hoping to meet their former student again.
But Cadiza was probably killed before she could escape, because the house in which she was delayed compared to the land in May, the British ITV News stated.
The television added that the bomb apparently ditched a Russian plane that attacked the IS garden in Syria.
You would take the blue from the sky just to get your child out of the dangerous area, said Tasnym Akunjee, a family lawyer.
In the week when (Cadiza) thought of escape from the Islamic State, one Academic was caught in an attempt to escape and, according to the available information, was publicly killed to death.
I think that (Cadiza) has interpreted it as a warning and has decided not to risk, according to BBC Akunjea.
The family would do anything.
Cadiza Sutlana and 15-year-old friends from Shamima Begum and Amir Abas were issued on the road on February 17, last year.
They only said at home that they were going out.
However, they headed to the Gatwick airport and from Turkey to the IS territory.
The girl's family according to a lawyer did everything she could to get Cadiz back.
You'd take the blue from the sky just to get your child out of the dangerous area and this family did everything she could, bound all the powers to get her daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking being captured by a lawyer.
The only positive thing he believes is that the fate of Kadizy can serve as a scary case for other girls, or even for boys who are going to freak themselves into islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases when people went there, they realized how things are there, they understood how far the promises of the Islamic State are different from the promises of the propaganda, and wanted to return," said Akunjee further.
The fate of Cadiza's classmates is not famous.
However, since they were also silent, their families must reconcile that they are most likely dead.
In jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go behind the nets and without committing a crime.
For centuries, the village of Inveray was a circuit center and a seat of the Duke of Argill.
Since half the 18th century, courts and basements served as local prisons were held in the city.
The conditions in which the criminals were living were sad and many prisoners tried to escape.
Many of them are successful.
That's why the city's representatives decided to move the prison premises to a new place.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more pleasant to prisoners, heating and gas lighting.
Anyway, it has not been in operation for a long time, because it has been concluded for economic reasons at the end of August 1889, since the smaller correction device was cost of operation and did not pay too much.
Stories of criminals and ghost hunts.
For the public the prisons opened a century later, visitors can compare the old building with a new building to make sure how different conditions were in them.
Authentic experiences are still strengthened by guides in the era costumes.
To see, there is also a torture room where visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to the criminal, whether to break fingers or to burn marks on the body.
In the context of the examination, tourists may be allowed to lock themselves in one of the cells, mostly because of the photos on the memory, or to mention the feeling behind the prisoners.
Besides, the Inveray prison is one of the most famous Scottish sites where it is reportedly scaring.
There have already been several groups of paranormal hunters, and the museum still allows people to come hunting some spirits.
This night, however, will be 300 pounds, which is about 9500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the municipality also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
"Animem" effect on Snapchat is criticised as Asian Caricature
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by animation, but some observers say he is racially insensitive.
The Snapchat application each day allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with the identity of the ways limited to absurdity.
You can make yourself ananas, a dog or a figure that's like coming out of the picture of Roy Lichtenstein.
The filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfishes every day.
Any mistake will be released immediately.
Snapchat filters have in the past been criticized with the accusation of the application promoting blackfaction or supporting white shades of skin as the ideal of beauty.
So when she offered this week to users a filter that made them squeaky eyes, scratched teeth and pumped faces, some criticists called it a racist charication of Asians - "yellowface."
And they asked whether these repeated dispute issues indicated a greater problem of society -- a problem with diversion.
In Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and the news, and the frustration rapidly expanded, and Snapchat said that the function was cancelled.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was designed as a manifestation of accounts to figures, not as a cartoon of Asians.
But to the observers who were witnessing racism, the filter reminded the painful stereotypes of action.
Others without a package comparison with the animations refused.
Grace Sparapani, a student of American art from Korea, whose tweet on photographs was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was “at least harmful and embarrassing. ”
She added that “it is difficult to argument against comparison the obvious Asian charication and the effects of the filter.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellowface, but that the yellow face is drawn into a disgusting extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
The American culture seems to have an infinite diversion and inclusion game, from the meetings of halls in Hollywood corporations and equipment that we all wear in our hands.
And a huge amount of young people in Snapchat - who are more racially diverged than their older partners - can mean that even more sensitivity can be expected.
"When one filter of Snapchat creates a picture that is insultable for a user," Catie Zhuová said on Thursday in the interview, "that's just a very difficult time for these things today, without notice, as it was before."
Katie Zhuowa, the product manager and the designer who works for the Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her account on Snapchat and invited others to do the same thing.
In the media and telephone interview article, she was convinced that the racial motivated problems reflected the lack of diversion in the Snapchat recruitment.
Katie Zhuova criticised the most white, totally male leadership of the company and the article ended the hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that there is no diversion between employees and colorful people at the moment they decide on these things," Zhu, who has Chinese-American origin, said, "or the colorful people are working there, but not at positions to feel safe or pleasant to talk."
Other observers share her opinion - the complaint that Snapchat left significantly without an answer.
The company does not provide the numbers relating to the diversion of its employees by having the Statute of Private Company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about racial origin of his employees, but according to the speaker's company, he recently accepted an employee who should focus on the inadequate population and internal inclusion management.
Zhuwa adds: “I am wondering if they really need other users who can say that it is not right, ” with the abolition of their account.
Army officers have declined the reporting information on IS, said the Parliamentary Committee
The Parliamentary Committee in the report issued on Thursday, stated that officers from the United States Central Command have changed the reports of the rapporteur's services to draw a more optimistic picture of war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the country's events.
According to the preliminary report of the working group composed by the Republican President of the Committee on Armed Forces, the Committee for Reporting Services and the Subcommittee for the Defence Subcommittee, it was found “extensive dissatisfaction” among the central rapporteur service analysts, according to which their superiority changed their assessment of the US efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as CentCom, is a military centre in Tampa, Florida, which is supervising US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press statement states: “The statements of the reporting secret services approved by superior officers of Centcom usually offered a more positive picture of the US anti-terrorism efforts than the facts on the ground, and were more consistently positive than the analysis obtained from other parts of the rapporteurship community.”
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our warriors are damaged when the superior political creators are presented with a mistaken analysis," Ken Calvert, Congressman and the Republican from California said.
Failure in leading Centcom reaches the top of the organization.
The 10-page report detailed the persistent problems of the central headquarters in the description and analysis of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although no decisive evidence is offered that the High Representatives of the Administration of Obama had ordered to amend the reports, the report states that the analysts had the impression that the leaders of Centcom were under pressure to present a more optimistic view of the dangers presented by the Islamic State or IS.
“In the first half of 2015, many press reports of the central headquarters, statements and statements from the Congress were significantly more positive than what events were actually," the report states.
For example, the representative of Centcom publicly declared that the major military attack on the capture of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is quite clear after months of investigation," said Ambassador Mike Pompeo, a representative of the Republican party from Kansas.
From half the year 2014 to half of 2015, the highest positions of the U.S. rapporteurs were manipulated with the outputs of the rapporteur's office in order to batalise the risk of IS in Iraq.
The Republicans compiled a working group after they learned about the concerns of the analysts that information of the rapporteur's services concerning the Islamic State is manipulated.
After the report published on Thursday, further investigations must follow more detailed examinations.
In the Centcom rapporteur's services, further investigation is conducted by the General Inspector of the Defence Department.
Democratic members of the Committee for Reporting Services have published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to certain conclusions of the Republican working group.
“In between 2014 and 2015 Centcom created a very narrow process for the compilation of information assessment on IS and Iraqi security components”, said representative Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and Democratic Representative.
According to Adam Schiff, this process has “incorporated the outputs of the rapporteur’s services, ” he damaged morality among the analysts and“ disadvantaged insufficient opinions. ”
However, Schiff and Democrats argue that they did not find any evidence that the White House would try to push Centcom's analysts to adjust their conclusions according to "suggess or political situation".
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, New York Times informed about the ongoing investigation of the General Inspector Pentagon, which was launched after the Centcom analyst's complaints.
Commander-Command Patrick Evans, speaker of Pentagon, stated in his statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the parliamentary report, because the investigation of the General Inspector is still continuing.
He noted, however, that “the experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex data, and that the rapporteurship communities and the Ministry of Defence welcomes a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security”.
The investigation has an impact on the question of whether the Americans leading bombing in Iraq and Syria are successful (the judgment now declares a growing number of defence representatives).
However, last year, the charges have raised questionnaires on the extent to which President Obama can rely on the fact that the central headquarters are sincerely evaluating military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lybia and other crisis sites.
The criticism of the reporting on the Islamic State reflects conflicts for more than ten years, when an analyst of reporting services to Centcom Gregory Hooker wrote a research work in which the administration of President George W. Bush - despite the objections of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted a little time to think about what would follow the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting the Icelandic Reporting Services.
Last year, the authorities announced that Hooker's team concluded that, despite the public declaration of the opposite, air strikes led against the raphineries of the Islamic State have not significantly weakened the financial resources of this terrorist group because the group has built temporary raphineries and oils on the black market.
The Times informed in September that the findings were not passed outside the central headquarters.
The commander of Centcom, gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then subjected to the criticism of the last year after many legislators found the testimony of the Senate with a too positive evaluation of war.
General Austin resigned in April, and in Centcom he was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States won the country's hockey in the fourth row, so today will be a decisive game in the United Kingdom team.
Katie Bam, in a fight against Japan, who ended by victory 6:1, shot three gates and only a day afterwards for the American female hockey team shot the first two gates of the game, in which America defeated India 3:0 on Thursday.
Five gates in two matches are a good memory, but Bama (27) said that she was not sure if something like this ever succeededed.
"I have no idea," she said.
I don't belong to those who record their gates.
But he knows this: Americans in the Olympic Tournament lead to the games 4:0 and share the first place in a group with the Great Britain, which remained unbelievable on Thursday after Japan 2:0.
Great Britain and the United States meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round.
Both teams have qualified to the quarterfinal and the fight will decide who from the group of six teams ends on the first and who else.
The first team will be avoided for a little longer to the strong Dans who are headed by the second group.
Whatever the Saturday match is over, the Americans have caused their surprising ride here, four years after they ended between 12 teams on games in London.
Bam was in that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took a hockey on the ground hockey for her first time when she was three years old (her older sisters played a twin in Drexel) and entered the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player at all.
The Olympiada escaped in 2008 because she didn't get to the final list.
Then it came in 2012, when neither she nor her team did much.
The next year, the English coach was named Craig Parnham, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bama said.
We didn't have a working rate in London like we have today.
We've made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bama started in the first half by shooting the gate of a beckend nearby.
India entered the game without victory in the tournament, but the team turned out to be surprisingly hard and kept the score 1:0 until the third quarter was finished, when Bamova used the opportunity.
She fled on the left side of the playing field, then knocked herself into the middle and shot the ball into the gate to get the Americans into lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last gate in half the fourth quarter.
The exclusion of the American branner, Jackie Briggs, who helped each of the three victories to a single gate, was at all the first time at the tournament.
It's in a great shape.
Just like Bam.
"We are now in a good place," said Parnham, but how good it is, it will depend on the result of the Saturday match.
Zen trampoline in the middle of olympic rage
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter how much time it is - it's olympiade.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro, it is to feel persistent, unanimous and obsessive competitiveness and efforts.
It's like the Olympic Factory itself would be a hot cafet colleague that is transferred from a shooter of swimmers, gymnastics and triatlonist.
You can't turn on TV, read the papers or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the queue in the café without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the embarrassment between Michael Phelps and Chad le Close.
And then it's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a baby of women in the faces, is on the olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names will sound in households in the main broadcast time between advertising and spots of sponsors, if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even a sponsor.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in the trampoline jumps.
The Olympic Fire doesn't light on all competitions the same.
Far from Wednesday, a little in the shadow are sports that are not generally recognised: air gun shooting, bullets, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and it will probably rule long.
But if I can appoint my extraordinary favorite, let me note of the spell of trampoline.
Although the jumps on the trampoline are the Olympic Sport since 2000, when the first time they were introduced at the games in Sydney, it remains after 16 years of intervention of this sport almost without notice - many people I asked, nor knew it was an Olympic sport.
It can be regional indifference.
The United States has never gained medals in the trampoline jumps, and until 2012 none of the athletes even reached the final.
The prices in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and the female category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will be bound by Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
But the jumps on the trampoline have another luck, partly because the undedicated ear would seem more suitable to the klaun university than to the Olympics.
I must admit I'm not an expert, but only a enthusiasm watching from the country.
It has a comic potential - comic vibration of infinite reflection - but also the freeness of gymnastics and diving, two sports that it combines in it.
The word “trampoline” is derived from the Spanish“ el trampoline ” which means “scotchboard”.
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that will shoot them up to a height of nearly 10 meters and show the compositions with several elements (salta, horns and combinations), before they finally land on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic Programme, they are evaluated according to the implementation, difficulties and “ages in the air”.
In Rio, there will be twenty athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic Road is forward.
Warriors for gold medal must go on, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes there and back, up and down.
It is also trying to reach not only the target tape or the starting wall, but as the television report states, another inventory line: the world or the Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, impressive, a little fanatic - and enough to lead the viewers to tears.
But I think it's somewhat exhausting when you're watching the olympics.
Jumps on the trampoline in this regard make a relief.
The path of the athlete on the trampoline is upward.
It's not a move forward.
He or she reflects, as if they were in a state of no difficulty like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again without an effort up.
Without competitiveness and of course it can not be difficult, but during the duration of the composition, there will be no rageous struggle to achieve the goal, no measurement of distance, but just perfect, free time and gravity.
This is just the closest time the Olympiade and Zen gets closer.
The qualifications and the finals of women are held on Friday afternoon, at 13 o'clock east, and the male competition on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will send the finals within the afternoon block, which begins after two days at 14 hours.
In the middle of the Olympic madness, they promise calm, pleasant moments that you probably overlook over the other fights.
And if it is to reach attention only by being subjects of loved views and materialization - as according to Wall Street Journal recently proposed by US gymnasts - then Logan Dooley is only waiting for their new fans who are catching the breath.
“Protesting generation” in Ethiopia, long-year ally of the United States
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators demanding political changes in Ethiopia faced the violent opposition of the government.
The witnesses claim that many protestants were shot during the conflicts with the police.
Is war threatened in Ethiopia?
In the past decade, it was one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with rapidly growing economy.
During the past months, however, the country has encountered conflicting disturbances that are spreading into more areas.
Only last week, thousands of people have gone to the streets who demand major political changes.
According to organizations fighting for human rights, the government's reaction was miserable.
The witnesses claim that the police shot and killed the crowds of unweaponed demonstrators.
In the circuit videos of protests, probably from the conclusion of the last year or the beginning of this year, members of the security forces are caught as beating young people gollows after they were forced to stand at the wall on their hands.
The High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights is now asking for a thorough examination.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together and to make a step forward will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa Project for the Research Group of International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second lowest nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
The US military and rapporteur services work closely with the Ethiopians to eliminate the danger of terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and a few of African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has developed in an impressive pace.
Her infrastructure has significantly improved - even a new pre-grad train rides in Addis Abeba's capital.
And the streets of the city are typically calm, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia could hardly be identified as a model of democracy - organisations fighting for human rights without standing to speak of government repressions - opposition in the country has been pressed, dissidents are effectively silent.
Many were expelled, imprisoned, dead or expelled to the desert.
However, this can change.
"When you suffocate people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a break," said Seyoum Teshome, who speaks at the university in Central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all youths.
He's protesting the entire generation.
The complaint is many and concerns everything from the ground disputes to the absolute control of the power of the coalition.
Following the last year's elections, which have been widely criticised, the ruling party and its allies received the last chair held by the opposition and now controlled in Parliament 100 per cent.
At the same time, pressure on the border with Eritrea is increasing. Conflict along this unprecise, the controversial border demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Anylitici fear that separatist groups, which have been morely oppressed over the past years, such as the Orome Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use the confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why now after years of smoking under the surface, these bitter feelings have reexploded.
The first is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopans can communicate through social networks up to several recent years when they became commonly available cheaper smart phones and improved Internet services.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as it usually happens during protests, many people can still communicate through the Internet proxy that hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians talked about how they gathered to protests.
There is further greater solidarity between Oromy and Amhara, two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromes and Amhars are not natural allies.
After the long age of Amhara, mostly from the Christian tops of Ethiopia, they came into politics and trade and used Oromes, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowers.
But that's also changing.
"We are on our way to united leadership," said Mulat Gemech, leader of Orom.
The greatest protests occurred in the areas of Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is illegally dominated by the members of the ethnic of Tigray, which forms about 6 percent of the population and controls the army, reporting services, trade and policy.
The third cause of anxiety is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, former leader of the rebels, was the Ethiopian president of the government for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he was subjected to unrelated disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see as a corner.
The analysts say he was especially able to detect the initial signals of dissatisfaction and use ambassadors to process and gain opponents on his side.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," said Abdi, analyst of conflict.
The new President of the Government of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was withdrawn from relative unknownity to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, which originated from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
The analysts say he has no confidence in the security service controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be another bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such anxiety in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what the analysts called the choices that the government took and stole.
It followed a hard intervention, during which many protesters were killed -- even less than in the past months -- and this period of anxieties went relatively quickly.
The development experts appreciated the leaders of Ethiopia for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pre-grad train and the measureable progress in combating poverty.
Of course, it is quite obvious that the progressive growth of disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop it.
And there's a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, the protesting in the Amharian city of Gondar attacked the business companies owned by the Tigers and the regret against the Tigerians on social networks increasingly.
Analysts say protests are putting into an uncomfortable situation of the United States and other Western allies.
The US government uses Ethiopia as a base for drone flows over neighbouring Somalia, even though recently declared that the base was closed.
While the West wants clearly to support democracy, he doesn't want his ally to fall apart in such unconstant areas at the same time.
"This," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of sharpness."
Donald Trump explains his statement of Obama and IS finance as “sarkasmus”
Donald J. Trump tried to wrap up the latest controversy that floods his campaign on Friday, saying that he didn't mean it seriously when several times this week he insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were “baseders” of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican candidate to speak clearly with the American public.
It also puts him in an inconvenient situation, who has been strongly defending him in a violent time and must explain that his notes may not be serious.
Following this proposal for a meeting on Wednesday night Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and insisted in the interviews that he really didn't intend to say that the President and H. Clinton IS created.
Of course, on Twitter's contribution on Friday morning, Trump declared he was only sarcastic.
The contribution was contrary to the claim of an old just one day when Trump said in several interviews that his accusation was serious.
When the conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump's note that Obama is trying to destroy IS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes when Trump tried to focus his campaign on the economy, while his preferences in pre-election surveys are declined.
Trump and Clinton took part in Michigan's duel this week on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to this topic again.
On Twitter he warned again that Clinton's proposals were connected to the increase in taxes, and he stated that some of her speech was boring.
Trump used sarcasm defense before.
At the end of July, when he criticized the wave of criticism, when he made a proposal that the Russians should broke into Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his note with the words: “I am of course sarcastic.”
This approach allows Trump to push the borders of political declarations and mitigate them as necessary.
"I think that this is his way of testing, to what extent some reports have been responded to his favourites to find out how they react, and according to the response, in one or the other way "subscribed," said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who watched the language that both candidates used.
But I also think that in his statements he is contrary and knows that they are sufficiently weighed to explain them differently.
Because the results of pre-election research in his favour continue to decline, Trump chose even more tone in recent days instead of mitigating things for general voters.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed that Tump is with a large distance behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very closely behind it in Florida.
Trump is at all trying to avoid apologies for the provocative statements he says, but he often accuses his criticism of mistaken interpretation of his words or the lack of understanding of his sense of humor.
But along with the fact that Trump faces increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes pointed out the uncomfortable situation of his devoted stakeholders, who must stand behind him publicly, whether his notes are provocative.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Prime Minister of New York, one of the most prominent Trump colleagues, had to defend a candidate on Thursday in a CNN interview.
"I believe what he says is a legitimate political commentary," said Giuliani when it was asked for Trump's credibility of the claim that Obama and Clinton created the Islamic State.
That's true in the sense that IS was almost unknown before Obama, a small organization, which he completely mistakenly called a new man, and it happened because he pulled his army out of Iraq.
Most ordinary republicans are trying to argument that the Obama government, in which Clinton acted as Foreign Minister, has allowed the IS to go through and not to manage the Middle East situation aggressively.
Before the Friday meetings in Pennsylvania Trump continued to squeeze the fire around Twitter for the communications means that they are overwhelming every word of his.
He laughed with “poor, pathetic ” television students who try to understand him, and said:“It can't do. ”
A number of democrats were screwed up with Trump's apology that it was just another proof that the president's office was not eligible.
Coffee was pushed from the price market. Now he returns to Greenpoint
The Cafe Verb Cafe was a messed place in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee was given for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a trade that Verb replaced in the summer 2014 - sells salads in the form of cakes.
The locals mourned as the last loss of the growing city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel is settled and from Verb is now a sauce store. ”
But if there's a change in New York, then it's also reopening.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
New Verb has wifi and accepts payment cards, but some of the original employees are working there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new Verba manager is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-year-old original cafeteria employee, who is also owner and the executive director of the new place.
In Verb he started in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of the customers offered him to pay a move to a new place, he said he would do it with joy.
Rodriguez (36) left many things as they were.
Verb still has the same cookie supplier and bought the same machine model for espresso.
Even again, he used lighting from the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new.
He started using new stuff.
There are sandwiches in the offer, eggs and cheese and toppings, such as caparies and roasted ashes.
You will also find a bowl with brown rice.
The coffee doesn't give you any more beer, but offer you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed the constant inflammation of original printers.
"A number of original customers also had to move out from Williamsburg for prices," he said.
Last week there was one of these customers, Rebecca Oliveir.
Mrs. Oliveir (34) lived in Williamsburg and often walked to Verb Cafe.
Even when the café moved to Greenpoint, it was coming.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out that what I like is coffee and culture in Verba," she said.
Now he's drinking coffee again, but on that day, instead of her usual ice coffee, she gave her mixed chai, another news.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-year customer, has been devoted to Verba since 2003.
They go before work and always order the same thing.
"Over quarter and eight every day, as clocks, I come here and already prepare my goose with everything and butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add to the offer of a new appliance.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but sometimes he gets bacon, eggs, and hooks on his mushroom.
Rodriguez said he didn't regret that the sauce store took his old place.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered him to make a special soap for Verb and to use filtered coffee from the coffee.
"I think we could still use it," said Rodriguez.
Also, the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint have accepted the coffee well.
One of the new customers transferred the offer to Polish and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to exhibit it soon to make his new neighbors feel home here.
The new place has more advantages.
The local producer of fruit juice wants to drag into the bottle and sell filtered coffee.
The cafeteria is offered to expand to the neighbourhood building.
Many customers are enough to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the café closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the coffee opened again, walking in and getting coffee, it's like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressive food from the crisis - in "Square Meal"
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was sitting in the Oval Bureau and lunching.
President Roosevelt tasted the chosen foods of the 5th Avenue, such as a puppy of muscles and a Marilandi copper soup.
But his menu on this day was more modest: eggs in the devil's way in a paradise sauce, potato pirrels and as dessert of swedish pudding.
"It was an act of cooking solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also the message of the Americans to eat. ”
A couple who lives in Brooklyn Heights is devoted to gastronomic history.
The last book of Andrew Coea "Chop Suey" was about Chinese kitchen in America, while Jane in her book "97 Orchard" tells the life story of the living house at the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work "A Square Meal", published by Harper on Tuesday, is history of American kitchen during a major economic crisis.
They showed themselves cooking solidarity and met with the reporter at Eisenberg's sandwich store, a small strict buffet in the Flatiron quarter, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and sandwich with olives, and Andrew (57) gave her cream, potato cough and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a mass carbanate, which, according to a couple, had been great to talk about food during the crisis.
"The carbinets were very popular," Ms. Ziegelman said.
He was selling a peanut, liver, and a fetus carbanate.
They were made of the surroundings and other cheap food that set the ingredient.
Stop the quantities that you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe's screwed up.
"They would lay in your stomach like a lead," he said.
In years before the crisis, an American kitchen, especially in rural areas, was given in a form of a buffet you eat.
Women's teams cooked for farm workers and breakfast, lunch and dinner.
They were the Americans who sent food to the hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" watches how the nation was dealing with suddenly not the country of abundance.
"It was the time when the food became a central, feared point for the American people," Coe said on the explanation why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Similarly feared was the new budget diet: The mysterious foods, such as carbanates and foods from casterels, were “amazing way to use the remains, ” said Ziegelman, because the chefs could hide neestetical sugars under a layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat - after years, the central point of American food - became a savagely assigned luxury.
The strange mixtures that were to serve as caloric and nutrition filling were preferred to taste or even healthy in the cooking.
During a study for a book containing recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a timely meal from a baked squirrel filled with butter.
"It was not the favorite increase for the evening table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman emphasized: “It was surealistic. ”
The swarm butter with a baked turkey is not going together.
It was typical for many home recipes.
So, as never before and never after, domestic economies -- including Louise Stanley, a wide federal office for domestic economy in 1923 to 1943 -- were driving country's food habits.
They provided recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, called women to take over the burdens of the budget, and squirrels, such as cream spaghets with carrots, converted into tasteful foods.
The book “A Square Meal” is a celebration of historical incentives.
First of all, the tastes occurred in the response of the government to its hungry citizens, such as the position of President Herbert Hoover "I will take pie."
While he publicly praised the simple iow farming kitchen of his childhood, he stood as an elected millionaire to which he became.
"The Council ate continental kitchens, such as fish with an oak sauce," said Andrew Coe.
He ate in a nearly golden room, he was wearing a smoking.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably make the same mistakes if his wife Eleanor didn't force him to follow his own stomach.
As the book says, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in the taste, which led to the fact that the White House “not only was the most disgusting food in the entire Washington, but also the most uncomfortable ways prepared. ”
A number of meal habits in the crisis went away as soon as the country regained its legs.
The link remains in our constant study of calories and nutrition values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
A couple say that during writing the book they had better understood the diet habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - for example why she couldn't throw out food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," Andrew Coe said.
Zegelman reminded: “The people of her were wrong. ”
There's been an accident with the branches.
When there were clean tables at Eisenberg, she and Mr. Coe pulled the dessert that they prepared at home: a fresh dessert that President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
"It's called Sweetheart cream," said Ziegelman, and she added that the common trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There wasn't any cream there, but squirrels, some flour, sugar, water, and cane.
Everyone unwantedly slippered the spoon into the dense brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was wrong.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as the right household, he said to his wife: “It would be good for some scattered hair.”
Europeans: Migrants go for dosages.
Most fugitives who are falling into Europe are coming for economic reasons.
Young Russians are making fun of themselves.
This is how the series would look if we took them.
A group of Russian artists who call themselves 2D Among Us makes fun of their homeland.
With the photoshop, it creates collagues that funny show how it would look if famous series and movies were filmed in Russia.
Gilead has the right to compensate for the costs of legal representation in the case of a patent against yellowness of type C against Merck concern
The Court of Justice decided that the company Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to pay the fees for lawyers, which were incurred in the process of the patent against yellowness of type C against the manufacturer of Merck & Co Inc.
In June, the judgment that Gilead was to pay 200 million for damage for the violation of two patents of Merck in connection with the very successful medicines of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the Federal Judge has discovered repeatedly illegal negotiations by Merck, except other lies under the oath and other non-ethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman stated in the record on Thursday that Gilead has the right to excuse fees that were made in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the new generation of medicines against yellow C, which can heal more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case comes from 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed that they owned the basic laboratory research for sophosbuvir, the active package of medicines from Gilead.
Americans supported military units claim that they have obtained full control of the city of Manbridge
The U.S. military units have received full control over the northern city of Manbage near the borders with Turkey after the last Islamic State warriors fled the city, said a speaker group on Friday.
Syrian democratic forces (SDF) now prosecute the city after leaving the rest of the radical group hiding in the city.
The units released over 2,000 civilians detained by radicals, said to the agency Reuters Sharfan Darwish from the SDF Alliance and the Manbridge Military Council.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching it," said the agency Reuters.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2%
Hillary Clinton published her tax confession for 2015, which states that the presidential candidate for democrats and her husband had a income of $10.75 million in that year and took a real tax of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton was dedicated to $1 million for charity, mainly to the Clinton Foundation Fundation (Clinton Foundation). Expert Bill Clinton contributed to the shared cash by a sum of almost $5,3 million for lectures, and former Minister of Foreign Adoption confessed the income of $3 million from the suppliership of Simon & Schuster's book on his work at the Ministry of Foreigns.
The Clinton co-candidate, a US Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, published a tax confession in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are still a model of financial transparency," Jennifer Palmieri said in the statement that helped Clinton with the campaign.
On the contrary, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and departs from his former promises that his tax confession will be published.
It is a habit that candidates for the President of the United States will publish their tax confession, even though the law does not imply them.
Trump, a New York trader, and his lawyers quoted the audit of the tax committee of the U.S. Finance Ministers as a reason for his rejection of tax confession.
"Your move," said Hillary Clinton's campaign branchman on Twitter and acknowledged a tax confession of a democratic candidate.
Michael Cohen, a special Trump advisor, said on Thursday CNN that Trump would not allow Trump to publish tax confession until the audits were completed.
According to Trump's criticisms, including the Republican candidate for the President of 2012 Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, they agree that its refusal raises questions about its net profits, contributions to charity, trade transactions and other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton is strong in the question and published a video on Friday, reminding the high position of the Republic of Trump insisting to publish its tax acknowledgement.
On Thursday, mention the issue in his speech to economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all other candidates have done to the presidential office after decades - to publish their tax confession," she said to people.
The Political Organization stated that Trump paid no or very low tax in the last two years of the 1990s, and New York Times publicist quoted a number of tax advisors and accountants who claimed that it could also be present.
Federal tax rates have become a theme in the president's election.
Clinton is promoting a rule named by a billionaire Warren Bufett, which would ensure that all those who make more than a million dollars a year will pay a tax at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet at the Clinton meeting in Omaza, Nebraska, where Buffet's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, called Trump to meet and exchange tax confessions.
Buffett said that he also passed the IRS audit and that Trump was “not afraid” of the financial office, but voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax confession back until 2007.
Clinton, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid a federal tax average of 32 per cent and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 per cent.
The tax confession of Clintons for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, it is only $100 in their income.
Their main investment was a low-invested mutual index fund, from which Clintons had reported revenues in dividends and interests of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or fireworks for the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Nature protectors in Tanzania use a non-ortodox way to prevent elephants from walking into human accommodations - throwing condoms filled with chill powder.
This procedure also proved to the Honeyguide foundation, which came with the idea a few years ago, along with the American Environmental Organization The Nature Conservance, this procedure promotes and trains volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, how through this unviolent procedure in four steps to protect their homes and fertility without hurting animals.
Many of them used spears before.
Friday is the world day of elephants, which is dedicated to protecting these animals.
“We have noted the change in behaviour in these communities since these... tools have been developed. People believe much more that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without hurting them," said the Executive Director of the Fundation of Honeyguide Damian Bell in the statement.
The first and second step is to light the battery and launch the elephant.
If it doesn't help him, it's going to be dismissed by the so-called “chilli cloud. ”
Chilli powder mixed with salt together with the petarda packed into the condom, its end is assumed to be seen only by the node.
When the condom explodes, a gentle powder from the chill will be blown into the air.
Most of all, one wagon is enough, and the elephant turns in another direction.
The latest option is the fire explosion that causes a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director rebelled to the Berlin Hotel for removing the code for calling to Israel to the "quest" of Arabs - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin caused a disturbance in the media after discovering that the hotel Kempinski Bristol in Berlin has no code for calling to Israel, according to the words of the employee on the basis of the “requirement” of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of a documentary photo on the holocaust Shoah, ventilated his frustration from the hotel Campinski Bristol in Berlin in an open letter to the German Journal of FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lansmann tried to find Israel in the list of call codes at the hotel.
However, the state was not listed among the countries where it could be called directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and deleted?
He wrote Lansmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers an opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
The director was looking for an explanation, and with a problem, he turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received, Lansmanna, according to his words, “shocked. ”
The hotel employee replied that the measures were “decidated after considering the management of the Campinski Hotels”.
The reason for this step of the director was even more disrupted.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that Israel's call code be deleted," Lansmann quoted in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, the Israeli Ambassador in Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, named the case “great shame”.
We were shocked and shocked.
It's a huge embarrassment about yourself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and in such a hotel chain is even more shameful.
There is no need for further explanation.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," he said.
The event caused a strong response online, people called it scandal.
Some believe that the hotel Kempinski simply "earned" in the demands of Arab customers.
“Shath to you” is stated in another contribution which indicates that the hotel located in the Kurfurstendam Noble Street stands near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel’s journal, the hotel itself quickly held any charges by saying that the event was “preview” and Lansman was“ apologizing. ”
“Never was issued a direct order” to include Israel in the list of call codes, quotes Suddeutsche Zeitung representative of the hotel Kempinski.
It adds that the call code was added to the list.
The police used tear gas and rubber missiles against the protesting Brazilian students
The confrontation of students and police occurred in Brazil in San Paulo on Thursday, when the students met at a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
The police used a tear gas and rubber missile against the protester.
The problem came out when the government's regular services tried to explore students, which ended by using rubber missile and tear gas.
A number of hundreds of students attended the demonstrations to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the suggestions of the Governor of the San Paulo Gerald Alckmina in order to save money, it is also closing nearly a hundred public schools and moving 300 000 students.
Some of the participants of the demonstration were able to see how the signs against the temporary President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest comes only a few days after the demonstrators went to the streets to support the President of Dilma Rousseff, when the senator decided her accusation.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian Ambassador in Iran, Levan Jagaryan increased after abolition of sanctions between Moscow and Teheran in an inter-year comparison by 70.9 per cent.
As the Ambassador stated, since the international sanctions against Iran were cancelled, the interests of Russian companies traded in the country have increased.
Russian companies renew existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Another expanding trade is of course one of the main priorities of bilateral co-operation with Iran," Jagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016 the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached $856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 per cent and reached $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
The jumping increase in trade ensured the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the Ambassador said.
Jagaryan also expects Russia to visit a recorded number of tourists from Iran this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran delivered about 35,000 visas to Iran citizens, mostly traveling.
In addition, Iran first arrived between top 20 countries according to the number of tourists who are coming to Russia.
It is safe to say that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia last year will be overcome," he said.
At the same time, Iran visits a relatively small number of Russians. The Ambassador hopes there will be a change.
"In particular, I can recommend visiting the towns of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the memories of ancient Persian civilization are well preserved," he said.
Scott Callum Skinner is rushing home after the British got gold in the cycle.
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the hall of glory last night in a male team sprint at the velodrom in Rio, when the trio team of VB defended the title from London 2012.
The 30-year-old man from Glasgow was in the role of the brake he took for his Scott Sir Chris Hoy, and a young man enjoyed the legend when he joined the target and stole the victory from the hands of the favorite New Zealand.
Britain won surprisingly four years ago and Hoy won the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And the same trick they repeated after the end of the modest sixth at the world's championship in the road cycle in March, even though Hoy had finished his career in the meantime.
The problem between Peking and London was the replacement for the specialised introductor Jamie Staff.
Hindes showed up just in time.
After leaving, Hoye also relaxed the place he tried to fill in Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search of potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was with Hoy a champion four years ago - and Skinner and Skinner reached the Olympic Record in qualification, but tricot took over the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was a little behind his bike, but Kenny's team pushed ahead and Skinner kept the lead.
The change of the strategy was a great part of the transformation when Hindes went to a higher transfer to slow down Kenny and partially even Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy was watching the race from his position of the BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes came out on the stage, he didn't let their eyes down.
Thirty-five-year-old Skinner, a relative from Glasgow, said: “It is a pleasant comparison. ”
I'm here to get the best of me and honor my name.
We created a Olympic final record and defeated the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After the triumph next to Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the road after a weak start.
Later he pulled the note back and the British rivals had no opportunity to appeal.
This time, there was no such problem around this victory.
Hindes said: “With all those British flags in the tribunes, I felt like London. ”
In the last three months, we all got together as a team.
We've lost many world races, so winning Olympiade is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for the nation who won seven out of ten contests in Peking and London.
If this is to show progress in the past five months, then we are waiting for five successful days at the vedrodrome.
With the form Kenny showed, it is not irrespective that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at the same time.
That would then be for Kenny - who is exactly the day of 12 years younger than Hoy, also has the birthday of 23 March (this date seems to be holy for British sports, on this day, Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - meant a total of six gold and one silver medal.
As much as Hoy got.
As next, Kenny will be involved in the sprint that begins today and lasts three more days.
An eighty -five - year - old relative from Bolton said: “I enjoy this one now.
The team race is always the best.
You win with the others.
To tell the truth, wining for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said: “When he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knight's title. ”
It was the only medal race that day, but Britain was waiting for more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were qualified as the fastest to the race of companies for four miles.
End with time 3:51.943.
The world record, which fell in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and finals (22:42) are held in the second day of the race to which Wiggins will concentrate.
Yesterday before the qualification race, he debated with the Commissioners when the judge called him to measure the height.
In a similar race of women, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavia World Record at 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on its strong team of road cycles and controlled the middle period of Olympic Games and gained a lot of medals.
After really exceptional performances showing total advantage in Peking and London, Rio expectations were reduced during preparation.
There were dramatic events on the background, not the latest resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April for the accusation of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the giant career, such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as the first night of race on the velodrome reports, legendary reputation seems that the team of Great Britain can provide a high performance with perfect time, could be reaffirmed.
The uncertain future of the tabernacle in Portland after the completion of the energy supply contract
The future of the portland aluminium tabernature in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain about the electricity supplied by the company and which informed the intention of one of the owners of the tariff contract to terminate the supply of electricity. All electricity supply contracts are expected to be shortened.
This step takes place after the government of the State of Victoria decided earlier this year that it did not extend the grants that the company maintains in the course.
The validity of the twentieth-year grant shall expire in November.
Alcoa Portland may be in danger of up to 2000 jobs.
When closure is closed, up to 2000 jobs - direct or indirect.
And since the tabernacle consums about 10 percent of the total electricity made in Victoria, it may occur to other lavine effects.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry tabernacle in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa company in Portland is prolonged and threatened to close.
This step follows several years of speculation on the future of the business, originally in response to a strong Australian dollar and recently due to race prices.
AGL, which delivers electricity from Loy Yang A in the valley of Latrobe Valley, said that it is expected that one of the other three owners will also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the race is the joint company of Alcoa and Alumina, the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the Portland race to continue to work, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the tabernacle will continue," she said.
AGL stated that the contracts were so-called “contracts” which were to enter into force since November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month reservation period, so their validity really ends in 2017.
‘AGL continues to assume that the contracts will be involved in profits for the fiscal year 2017’, said the electricity.
Any possible impact on AGL profits since the fiscal year 2018 is further limited by the strong view of the commodity market for large-scale electricity prices.
AGL stated that she already wrote the value of contracts according to her accounting books of $187 million “in case the termination would occur.”
The Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contract "does not affect its ... ability to operate the tabernacle or to secure electricity supply to the tabernacle".
The American company stated that in 2010, the Loy Yang contract was concluded for 20 years, which was to start paying since November this year, even though he still has to explain why it resigned from the contract.
The analysts are very careful about the possible closement of the Portland tabernature in Victoria and the Tomago race near Newcastle as a result of a weak economy in the sector.
The leader of AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts at the beginning of this week, said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago around 900 megawatts annually.
If both of these companies were withdrawn from the market, it would mean a substantial reduction in market demand [electric energy].
It wouldn't be good for us as a producer," he said.

Kendall Jenner (20), the model and the fourth daughter of the Mother-Manager clan, Chris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the title page of the light edition of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the Ambassador of Estee Lauder, who played a fashion week in Milana, Paris and New York, announced the news on her account on Instagram on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, I want to cry in view of this title page," Kendall wrote.
The discovery of the title page followed a bizarre (or simply the continuation of humor in the administration of Kardashians?) a video in which the whole family of Kardashian-Jenners (colour eruptors Rob and Caitly and all of them favorite uncle from the show business, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). They forgot on the envelope of their sister's sisters only so that the scene could end with a classic turn: they prepare a secret party.
It's an obsessed history line almost every "born" part of the child's TV show (Seacrest says: "You thought we'd forgotten about you?", with the honestness of the rabbit drawn at 8:00 a.m.), but Chris somehow needed to make sure that other girls in this public could be accommodated.
Because when we look at the light number of Vogue magazine, we must have entered the new era of Kardashian.
The older sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on the Vogue envelope (with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the text edition of the magazine is another league.
The light edition of Vogue’s magazine is the most selling number all year.
The publication, which is more like a book for advertising purposes than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of books (Fashionist calculated that of 832 pages in last year was 615 pages with advertising content).
The discovery of the star that appears on the title page is unexpectedly expected, so it is no wonder that in the past two years the photographs of the magazine fled before its official publication.
Between women who have appeared on the envelope in the past, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelist, or Kate Moss.
In recent years, more “celebrites that make models ” than“ models that are celebrites ” appeared on the title page.
Jennifer Lawrence, Oskar's owner and the Ambassador of the Dior mark, appeared on the title in 2013, a year later she had the honor of Lagy Gaga.
But even though it's very unlikely that Kendall -- which the magazine describes as a "proliferation model" of her generation -- falls into the first category, it will be in a very good society.
These celebrites are not relatives of famous people, nor reality show stars, or children today who know how to make a well cut video (although Jenner represents all this).
They are proofly talented women who are in entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the title page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career by publishing the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult for her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymore, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June and called them "the bitches of the moment".
These feelings were remorsed with the report that Jenner would appear on the Voge envelope.
But this dissatisfaction is not in place.
Kendall Jenner is on the envelope of the lighting Vogue.
It's a supermodel in the right sense.
He's showing for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you a makeup from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own payboards.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter that she took for the Love magazine.
And at a free time, it works in reality show, perhaps just as one of the ways to see Courtney and her children.
The Communist Law Assistance Centre will reject 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 most threatened citizens have been rejected each year in community law centres and in the sector themselves, they are about to influence further limitations of financial resources to the already excessive services.
In Queensland, three of the five people - mostly people in advanced age, immigrants, threats of workers, victims of violence and people without financial means to fight unfair relocation and similar - are denied since they are looking for free legal assistance and representation.
Communities' legal services, which are already so tense to crack, are going for further scratches.
Since June next year, these legal aid centres will lose another 30 per cent of federal finances.
The director of the Communist Law Assistance Centre in Queenslad James Farrell said that, according to the latest general report, the National Association of Communities Law Assistance was found that five thousand people were rejected annually.
Mr. Farrell said that without revoking the federal government's decision, the situation would be worsening.
"The Communist Centre for Law Assistance in Queensland is chronicly underfinancing, which means that thousands of people are rejected by the vital services they need," he said.
People who have escaped the relationships with the rape, people with excessive and disturbing debts, families passing through separation, workers who are unfairly released - all these people have legal dimensions, and this report shows that they have no chance to get the help they need.
The Federal Government will reduce the financing by 30 per cent since June 2017, leading to the need for further thousands of threatened people from Queensland to be aware of complex legal problems without help.
We call on the State Representative and Senator Queensland George Brandise to prevent this shortening of finances immediately to get the help they need when they get into legal problems.
In the past year, the Government of the State has received its obligation to ensure the financing of legal assistance until the summary of the national average.
Now it is time to look at the needs of the Communities and the community of their clients and the Government of Palaszczuk must invest in this important work.
The lawsuit of Donald Trump's campaign after a member of the headquarters reportedly targeted a weapon
New York: The campaign of Donald Trump was filed for alleged inactivity after they were informed that the Director of Operations in Northern Carolina in February targeted a weapon to a member of the headquarters during the ride of a jeep.
The incident was described in the court record, which was transferred by Vincent Bordini, former software trainer of the state campaign in Wednesday at the Charlott State Court.
Bordini said he was waiting for months to solve the situation internally before he concluded that “this is not going to happen. ”
The director Earl Phillip “signed the fingers of the gun, gave the right point on the trigger and directed Vincent’s head on the ridge, ” said Bordina in the lawsuit.
The record states that after the complaint of the local and regional campaign, Bordini found that at least four other people experienced the same experience with Phillip.
"The weapons must not be fired to cause damage," Bordina stated in the lawsuit.
The complaint comes only two days after the Republican candidate called on the president, when he said to the northern Carolina voters that the owners and holders of weapons (which is adjusted in the second addition of the Constitution), if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and able to appoint her judge.
Trump's campaign says that the media of his words had erected from the context and that Trump did not defend violence.
Bordini in the lawsuit requests a compensation from the campaign for immediate surveillance and Philip for the threat of personal security, illegal use of violence and emotional injury.
Trump speaker Hope Hicks did not respond immediately to the commentary's request.
The attempts to get statements from Phillip failed.
WCCB, a local reporting branch in Charlotte, announced that Phillip recently left the campaign.
No one responded to his innovative Consulting Services for a short time.
The Republican candidate for President Donald Trump is running a controversial election campaign.

Britain must continue to spread the Olympic Spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be the source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
For me Heathrow is hugely attractive, just like London 2012, when we have developed extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions will be able to gain from the Olympic Games.
Olympic games meant huge benefits for Startford and East End.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
Only for our local communities we create 10,000 new educational places, 40,000 new jobs and end up with the unemployment of young people in the airport.
Just like before the London Olympiade in 2012, there will be people who will think that the extension of Heathrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games and we'd be ridiculous at the world stage.
The doubts were wrong in 2012, and even in the case of Heathrow, it turns out they were wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is a infrastructure project, which is participating in many people and companies, not just a few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth by 211 billion pounds, to leave inheritance in the form of skills and employment both in the area of the airport and all over Britain.
We have an excellent team on Heathrow in the term and with the budget that introduced a programme of investment in infrastructure for 11 billion pounds, starting with a T5 terminal, which was selected by the best terminal in the world for five years, after the T2 terminal, which was built between the two most moving ranvees in the world.
Now they are ready to add a third ranvey, which costs 16 billion pounds of private investments.
The games in London in 2012 were an enormous success of Great Britain and I am convinced that the extension of Heathrow will also be it.
It's time to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, secure trade in the future and leave the inheritance of skills and employment that British can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of the branch board and former Deputy Commander for the Ministry of Finance Business.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in cat game and mouse blocking ads
From attempts to surround the advertising programs, companies that earn online marketing have become a cat and mouse game. At least one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop sites, Adblock Plus published a contribution on its website in which it states that users can update filters in their program and block the advertisement on this social network.
Facebook stated on Tuesday that his web site will change the code around advertising, so it will be more difficult for advertising filters to find out which parts of the website are advertising.
But Adblock now claims that the new codes have already been over.
The speaker of Adblock Ben Williams in a blog contribution wrote that “this is a war between the community open source of advertising and those trying to surround them, it lasts since advertising was invented” and that Facebook is likely to come with another own correction.
The fact that the company owner of the world's largest social network has been involved in the war only proves the great problem of blocking advertising for industry.
According to the study, the pagefair and Adobe has been performed by the Tkero last year and uses around 200 million people's advertising filters around the world - almost four times before it was in 2013.
Mobile ads now reaches 84% of the Facebook advertisement profits, every day Facebook from mobile devices visits 1.03 billion active users.
The speaker stated that the company is going against advertising filters on the desktop, because mobile advertising filters for mobile social network applications and Instagram are not working.
The advertising on the desktop still represents profits so high that Facebook decides to invest in it.
Facebook also stated on Tuesday that it would update a tool for "a preferred" to allow people to better control how the advertisements are displayed.
On Thursday, Facebook announced that the new Adblock filters are disturbing them because they could also block the content that does not relate to advertising.
"This is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem," the speaker of Facebook said in an e-mail statement.
The blocking of the advertisement is an insensitive tool, so we've better focused on building tools such as Ad Preferences that control people.
A woman was hit by a Swiss road car
The victim was lying on the road in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses of an event on Thursday in the morning, a woman who probably tried to commit suicide was caught on the road a few cars.
There was an accident on the A1 road near Morges in the Vaud canton short after midnight on Thursday.
The Vaud police stated in the statement that the actress of "desperate act" lied in the darkness of the road and cars her.
Clearly, the victim, a woman age 49, wanted to kill herself and hit a few cars, including a car.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers have already been heard, but according to the police, they still haven't been identified.
Criminal investigation was opened, “logical” step in such a situation, said for Le Tribune de Geneve legal representative Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to see if one of the attended drivers will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the attack?
This must be found by the prosecutor," Hofstetter said.
On the basis of two similar cases of the past five years, the drivers seem not to be responsible.
In both cases -- one of whom was a person walking along the road -- it was decided that motorists can't expect a walker who crossed the road in the middle of the night, as the papers stated.
Last year, the police officer was dismissed of the deaths of independence after she crashed and killed a man lying on the A1 road near Paynerne at the night in August 2014.
The court sounded like a 22 - year - old victim was drinking alcohol, and the road was desperate.
The Court found that the police officer - who responded to an emergency call - went properly and that the presence of a man on the road was “a very special and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information on the quarterly incident that occurred in Morges should log in to the police on phone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerant city.
Prague is the favorite destination of the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech travel offices and agency (ACHCKA) expects to be up to 20,000 visitors in Prague Pride to Prague.
On Friday, the executive director of ACCKA, Katerina Petricka, told it.
The sixth year of Prague Pride started on August 8, the festival approaches the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transexuals (LGBT).
Some 35,000 people attended the action last year.
"The dust belongs to the most popular destination of the LGBT community, which is for a high level of tolerance and a wide scale of specialized enterprises," said Peterček.
According to the research of directors, foreign visitors of the festival spend a average of 3100 crowns per person per day.
Gay tourists are available to support their travel special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafés and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
"The travel movement generally applies that LGBT clientel is very lucrative, he is interested in staying in higher prices with a high travel standard and wasting more than others," said Petřičkov.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium is also held in the festival programme this year.
It is presented by experts from the LGBT travel sector from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues by Sunday, August 14th.
The main theme this year is love, but action will also be devoted to several thematic areas of family, AIDS prevention and transgender problem.
The top of the festival will be a traditional guide on Saturday with allgorical cars, which will go from the Václava Square to Summer.
The promotion that thousands of people have participated in the past years this year will celebrate a minute of silence of the monument of the victims of the June attack in the nightclub in Orland, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Matt are celebrating forty years.
The unrestrainable boxes Pat and Matt, whose efforts are usually ending with disasters, have enjoyed small and big viewers for 40 years.
The pilot part of this evening series of director Lubomir Benesa had the premiere on August 12th, 1976.
With this animated series, now known by the audiences in more than a hundred countries of the world, the jokes of the artist and director Lubomir Benesa were drawn for the magazine with two boxes of Master Oagle and Sedlec.
Beneš then called for cooperation by the dramaturg of Jiri Kubic and the artist Vladimir Jirank and together created the film Kutjaci.
Today's shape with a yellow and red trick and a bullet and a radio came up in 1979, when Prague's Short Film began to create a series for Slovak TV.
The names of Pat and Matt then received the boxes in 1985, and this time they were filmed directly for the Short Film of Prague.
In 1990, Lubomir Beneš established his own studio of animated AIF Studio in Prague and Curich, where other parts were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, many of them participated in Beneš’s son Marek.
There is now over 90 episodes with stories of these boxes, which are never angry and are always filled with optimism, ideas and enthusiasm and eventually satisfied with their work, which gives a famous gesture "... and it is!".
Pat and Matt even moved from television screens to books, DVDs and toys or other toys with Pat and Mata are the hit of every toy.
Tale for Fiji and two-year-old Harmonia.
The end of the week is in the sign of a fairy tale, we have chosen one sport and one of your lives for you.
Both have a good end.
Let's see.
Fiji has achieved historical success.
What is the cause of the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
And for what things do people spend most on airports?
It's a Friday view from the world's websites.
The first medals from the Olympic Games.
Historic success celebrates the island state of Fiji.
The ragby selection of this island defeated in the final of the Olympic tournament of the seventh footby team of Great Britain.
It's the first medal that Fiji got for herself on the Olympiade.
Waiting for the profit of the first valuable metal took sixty years after sending the first trip to the Olympic Games.
Coach Fiji is a great success.
But it's ironic that it's Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the final, the British citizens could be satisfied, unlike their landscapes.
"Let's go play free and easy and see if we can handle the biggest game in our history," the coach said before the finals.
Finally, Fiji was sovereign and a small state with 900 thousand inhabitants now experiences an Olympic Tale.
The report was brought by the French journal Le Monde.
New friend and luck for a little girl.
The 2-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has lived without hands and legs for a new friend.
A doll who looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," a two-year-old girl said her mother to ABC News.
She added that her daughter loved a doll to take off her hands and legs and then sit together without protease.
Harmonia was diagnosed by meningitis B during a less than year of life, and the doctors only gave it a ten percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny and never gives up.
He's got an overview.
I saw her introduce her to the other kids saying hello, I'm Harmonie and I don't have hands, mother added.
Look at the joy of the doll.
What are we spending most on the airport?
CNN brings findings according to which people in airports will spend the most of them on balancing water.
The Hudson's Travel Travel Stores has published data in the last year, where it summarizes 10 products that customers in his airports buy most often.
The water was sovereign first.
The drinks were generally very popular, eight were placed in the first ten.
The ninth place acquired a large pack of M&M candy with coconut taste.
And can you guess who's closing the first ten?
As one of the above things, you can't eat.
According to CNN, it's the Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold in airports include New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Veslar sovereigns.
We're just going to win, they laughed Murray and Bond.
The veslars Eric Murray and Hamish Bond of New Zealand have sovereignly ruled the category of two without a controller for seven years, and their dominants also confirmed the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the first place, the unrelated couples have turned into a smaller crew after the Olympiade in Peking and since 2009 the broken competition.
At the Rodriga de Freitase lagun, they accorded the 69th win in a row in the quarter final.
What are we different from the rest of us?
We're just more nice, he joked Murray during the Olympic Regate when he was going to answer questions about the dominant of the New Zealand couple.
Honestly, we do nothing different from others.
We're just working hard, very hard.
And we're always trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their superiority is impressive even because they are physically different.
Murray is almost two-foot and stokile chamber, the academic looking Bond is five inches smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
Besides, they have different nature.
Bond studies and finances, for example, Murray has a charity boxing game.
He doesn't spend much time together because of it.
Eric's on the boat, basically, with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I have a tendency to think about what could be wrong, acknowledged Bond, who even at the press conference demonstrated that the dominant person in the crew is Murray.
He always answered the first and Bond waited for his opportunity.
But on the water, the rival is destroyed by peaceful force.
They drive their pace, and although often in the middle of the trail aren't headed, the opponents have not yet found a prescription on their progressive acceleration.
We're race on a two-mile track, and we never wanted to go the first mile back.
We're just trying to drive the tempo that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said a 40-year-old Murray.
With his four years a younger partner, he got seven gold medals for the world's championship.
They also triumphed in 2007, when both members of the golden four without a carrier.
Just after the unexpected failure, the larger crew in the Peking Olympiade decided to sit on a two without a controller.
Apparently, at the Olympiade in London, the dominants have opened their career and confirmed it in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it would be a damn hard thing, and we had to make sure we were mentally well, Murray said.
We know everyone wants to throw us out of the throne.
We've got the target on our backs all the time.
But we're trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
Climate model according to NASA: Venus was once resident
According to the design of a new NASA climate model, Venus was once inhabited.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute of NASA for Space Study developed a model for Venus's exploration using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate studies.
The model was designed to determine whether once on Venus, whose surface is hot, without water and swallowed CO2, could rule conditions similar to the earth.
Scientists have earlier suggested that a low rotation rate of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But according to the latest simulations, Venus could once be proud of a rare atmosphere similar to the Earth, turning slowly.
The model was also dealing with the previous topography of Venus.
The planet was probably more dry than the earth, but once there was enough water and geographical variety to rule life and protect against rapid departure.
Venus also used the sun, which was 30 percent more thunder.
“In the simulation of the GISS model Venus during slow rotation, it exhibits its daily side to the sun almost two months at once," the scientist from GISS Anthony Del Genio explained in the new report.
This is how we warm the surface and the creation of rain that creates a dense layer of clouds that behave as rain and the surface protect from too much solar warm.
The result is the climate with average temperatures, which are actually a little lower than at present on Earth.
The model composed the story of Venus similar to the evolution that the planetary scientists previously compiled.
Although Venus was probably inhabited in the past -- over a few billion years -- was exposed to too much hot and ultrafial radiation.
Her oceans went out and the water couples were burned with ultrafial light.
The hydrogen escaped and only the dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with the death effect of glass gas -- that is Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from the new climate model Venus in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned on the post coach of the Colorado Avalanche team
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday on his post of coach and vice-president of hockey operations to the Colorado Avalanche team, as a reason he stated that he was unable to participate in the decision-making process in the team's issues.
The executive vice-president/general manager Colorada Joe Sakic confirmed the step and stated that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have been a major coach and vice-president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," said the 50-year-old Roy in the declaration.
I've been thinking long and intensely about how I can improve the team, give him the depth he needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the visions of the coach and the vice-president of hockey operations are needed to be in accordance with the vision of the organization.
It must also have the opportunity to participate in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not met at present.
The Sakic, which Roye adopted on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his benefits from the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him luck in the future.
Roy was nominated for Jack Adams' victory as the best coach of the League during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to gain 112 points and the first place in the Central Division. But Colorado had been fighting with Minnesota in the first round of play-offs and in the past two years, he has always failed to fight after the season.
Avalanche team in season 2015/2016 reached a score 39:39:4 and missed five points to gain a second wild card in the Western conference.
The Branker Roy, who entered the Hall of Fame, won Stanley Cup four times -- twice with Montreal Canadiens and twice with Avalanche.
Oil platform workers in the North Sea renew interviews and interrupt the strike
The top representatives of the acting parties stated that the strikes due to remuneration for oil platform workers in the North Sea have been discontinued, while all parties disputed to a new round of negotiations.
Stamps against the company for Wood Group oil fields were sporadically held on platforms in the North Sea, operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
‘Wood Group and Union organisations of the Union and RMT may confirm that they have agreed to renew the process to address current disagreements’, stated in the declaration.
Starting next week, we will have a series of full-day meetings in the coming few weeks, where we will try to look at problems from the new corners.
According to corporate organisations, their recent action, which, according to their words, was first in over 25 years, to protest against remuneration, up to 30 percent.
The Wood Group has reduced rates this year and paid its suppliers in the North Sea about 9 per cent less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction of the rates of companies comes after a decade-percent reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company argues that other criterions would provide a place to deal with the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell expelled thousands of people from his payments and announced plans for leaving oil and land gas operations until in 10 countries for the modernisation of its processes - immediately after the mega fusion with the British Energy Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, the economic situation related to the June decision of Britain to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, a member of the Scotsk Parliament Dave Anderson met the committees to discuss one of the largest working disagreements of the entire generation that led to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, as he said, is vital for the economy in the region.
"In the North Sea and in the country we need an economy that works for everyone, not only for some," he stated.
For comparison, nearly $1.4 billion is expected in 2016 for new projects in the North Sea, while the average in the past five years was approximately $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in Pleyads
The latest mission of Kepler's space telescope to help astronomers is to obtain a nearly complete list of star rotation speeds from the Starcape of the Playade.
New data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the stars are rotating with different speeds, and how the rotation period relates to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparison of our results with other stars we will learn more about the relationship between star material, its age and even history in its solar system," Luisa Rebull, research worker in Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena said.
The Star of the Playada is located 445 light years from the Earth.
Many stars are now reaching the condition of adulthood and have emerged over 125 million years.
Now it turns the fastest.
In the immediate speed of rotation, these teen stars release enormous amounts of star wind.
Because these winds are moving along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slow effect on them.
Together with how the star ages, it slows down its rotation speed.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of familiar points on the stars -- similar to the sun scans.
According to the latest data on the speed of rotation, larger stars are rotating slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancemen, the bigger make piruets slower than those smaller.
"In the "balet" We see that slower rotating stars are more massive, while those who rotate fastest are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Starshop is so close, it serves as an ideal space lab to compare the quality of stars and speed of rotation.
"The feasts provide us an anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars," Rebull said.
There are still many things we want to learn about how, when and why the stars slow down their rotation speed, saying "will hang their dancing shoes on a shoe."
Rebull and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of the rotation of Playad in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is the qualification agreement necessary?
If I did not sign up, would the qualification agreement therefore not be closed, and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work after delivery without logging into specialization education?
It is my point that in the area where I want to work is now a free job only in a little remote hospital, but in about a half year, it could be relaxed in another place where I would like to work.
So I don't know how to deal with the situation about half a year, the question continues.
It's Mgr. Lenka Wolk.
No legal regulation does not establish a obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - hospital.
The qualification agreement is a legal institute governed by the Labour Law and may be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure the recovery of the costs connected with the increase or promotion of staff qualifications.
In the field of health, there is a long-term pressure to not close these agreements with regard to ensuring the working mobility of health workers and not all hospitals currently require this Agreement.
According to Law No 95/2004, the conditions for acquisition and recognition of expertise and specialised eligibility to perform the healthcare of the doctor, dental pharmacist and pharmacist, whereas explicitly apply that participation in specialisation is considered to be accompanied by qualification (none as an increase).
This means that the qualification agreement can be concluded under the law of work only if the costs are at least 75,000 CZK.
No legal regulation or no obligation to apply to specialisation education.
The Act only lays down the conditions of the application for the entry into the field of specialisation education.
However, according to the law, the physician is authorised to perform a doctor's call by graduating the necessary college study, even though under the law of the conditions laid down (in the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized qualification in the relevant field).
The Act provides for the situation where professional practices in other fields of specialisation may be included in the specialization education of the doctor, if its content and scope are in accordance with the relevant educational programme.
Theoretically, it would be possible to calculate the time deployed elsewhere, which would correspond to the situation of the questionaller.
However, given that I do not know the nearer circumstances of this case, it may be recommended to consult with the competent Ministry of Health (Scientific and Medical Calls Committee), as the Ministry of Health of the Law provides the Advisory and Consultative Service relating to the participation in specialisation and its progress.
The Advisory Service also provides the Czech Medical Chamber freely, which must be a member of each doctor.
The doctors in Syrian Halabu are asking for an intervention of the United States.
The United States has not made any effort to end the opposition (rebels parts of the city of the military) and to avoid their impact on the promotion of civilian protection, she quoted from the letter addressed to the White House of AFP.
"We don't need tears, sympathy, or even prayers; but we desperately need to create a wireless zone over East Halabe to stop attacks, and we need an international action that ensures that Halab will not be surrounded again," the doctors said.
