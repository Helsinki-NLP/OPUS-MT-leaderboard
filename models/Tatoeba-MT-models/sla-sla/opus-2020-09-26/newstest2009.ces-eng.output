The Prague Storm has fallen into minus by the end of the trade.
After the morning failing, the Prague Storm corrected the losses.
The transactions with the CEZ shares reached almost half of the common daily trade.
The Prague Storm was attached from the beginning of the Tuesday trade to its Monday crash when it dropped by nearly six percent.
This time it's behind the decline, the Wall Street stock crash.
In this way, the market's response to the outcome of the vote of the American Parliament of representatives, which refused to support the stabilization plan of the financial sector.
Discount of shares in Asia
The dramatic decline in Tuesday experienced shares in Asia's markets, even though the indexs were finally deleted during the day.
The Hang Seng Burze index in Hong Kong has declined almost four percent during the trade, but later some losses have been deleted and decreased to approximately 2.5 per cent.
The index of Hang Seng China Enterprises, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks in the Hong Kong Bureau, dropped by 3.8 per cent, markets were closed in Shanghai.
More than five percent were lost on the bureau in Sydney, but eventually losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The Thai-wain storm, according to the local index, dropped by 3.6 per cent.
"The timeout of rescue action in the United States is uncertain and will affect the financial markets throughout the world," said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Hong Kong, although it's part of China, determines the currency policy separately, that is, without depending on the Chinese central bank.
The interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
The American legislators should, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, quickly return to the negotiations and approve the proposal for support of the financial system.
Otherwise, they say they're threatening the impacts of other countries.
Blood bath of American stocks
The American Representation of Representatives on Monday rejected the financial system support plan for up to 700 billion dollars (about 12 billion Kč).
The lawmakers so ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the basic causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
The American shares experienced a bloody bathroom on Monday, and the main stock indexs recorded the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
Dow Jones' index declined by almost seven percent, and the fall was recorded in a similar range last in 1987.
The index was declined before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal was not passed, the index was found in a free fall.
Congress resigned: US government can pump $700 billion into banks
The highest representatives of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of a financial aid agreement for the US financial system.
The vote will be the beginning of the next week.
American legislators have made a breakdown in interviews on the approval of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system of $700 billion (approximately 12 billion of crowns).
But it is not yet victory.
Congressmen must conclude some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of law and vote on it.
The support plan of the financial system will be discussed on the ground of the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, the President of the Banking and Financial Services Committee of the Burney Frank told the agency Reuters.
In the Senate, the resources could vote about the plan, apparently, first in the Wednesday.
According to economies, the notification of the approval of the rescue plan should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
However, then there will be "extreatment" through the complexity of mechanisms to help markets to achieve in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our different views on how the package for market stabilization is to look like," Democratic Nancy Pelosi said for the Bloomberg Agency.
She believes that the final vote could take place on Sunday.
The lawmakers met with the American Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definite form to the government fund.
It should buy unproneguous hypothetical assets from financial companies that bring financial companies into severe losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the edge of a definitive plan agreement that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We need to continue with a healing plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis is significantly affecting the stock markets that are rapidly declined.
According to the Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a definitive agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to calm the investors before trade in Asian financial markets, which are first in the time zone where Congress decision might affect Monday trade.
However, it is not yet clear with certainty when the two American Congress Chambers will vote on the law, nor can the negotiations at the last moment lead to a problem.
The lawmakers hope that he will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law will still learn a number of changes.
The total amount for the aid of the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion should be available as soon as possible as President George Bush asked.
But Congress can block the relevance of the remaining amount if it has the impression that the programme does not fulfil its function, followed by another $100 billion and then the final $350 billion.
Bush assessed progress in the negotiations
Although the President may vet this decision, Congress may overvoke it.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme that was acquiring funds for the purchase of bad hypothetical securities, whose value has fallen down, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, was preserved.
"We've done everything.
The Parliament of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The progress in the negotiation is also satisfied with the US President Bush.
His speaker Tony Fratto declared that Bush is satisfied with the Saturday progress and appreciates "the two-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden drops
The President of the Bank Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the negotiator, said that the legislators agreed to be responsible for the monetary programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closing of relief, the timeline for financing of the plan.
The new law should also limit the so-called golden discounts for the Directors of Social Participants and establish a committee to be supervised by the Fund.
He should be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We worked hard on this and made great progress towards a agreement that will work and be useful for the market, also for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts on help for homeowners who have problems with paying.
The government should negotiate new payments for the mortgage that he buys in order to reduce monthly costs for debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological aid
The proposed plan, according to the main economy, Patria Finance David Mark is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to realize it.
"It is because it is not known which mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be purchased.
This will be determining how to divide the losses between the financial sector and the government," the iHNed.cz server Markek said this week.
If the plan is approved now, or at the beginning of the next week, it's not that important by Mark.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree to support this plan and devote it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement to be approved is the most important thing at this point," Marek stressed.
A fight on a knife blade: MP3 players against cell phones.
We'll advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
That makes it clear that it's better to buy just a phone.
Still, there are enough reasons to acquire a separate player.
The choice is entirely dependent on the way the use and the obligations of the future owner.
I guess it's hard for you to get a highly expensive gramophone home to listen to the latest album Maxim Turbulenc.
However, such musical products on the LP tables do not come from a quality perspective and there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you blame art rock, jazz or blues in your regulars, you probably dream of a gramophone like that at least.
It's the same with the music on the road, that's a compressed music, simplified - with music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For someone it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for the player, as well as Pink Floyd's fan, it may be hard to test the listeners for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
He also decides to endure batteries
Some top music players can do much more than just play music, but what most mobile players or accidentally.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to primary functions, phone calling and texting, he can play music and videos, both record, he has better, worse camera, and maybe he can navigate.
And if we take smartphones and communications in question, you'll have a little computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no refrigerators can grill and no television photographs anything.
Mobile university also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the sooner the display indicator will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy victims.
A few cell phones can play music for more than ten hours, mostly it's much less.
In this direction, music players (optional the easiest) are significantly more effective.
So count on cheap phones that they won't play you for more than a few hours.
If you call in here and there, take another charger to work for sure - that applies to more expensive devices.
In MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the worse will endure at least 9 hours of continuous operation for one charge.
Another problem happens when you record music into your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB converter, and not each of them can be directly connected to the computer without a special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers can handle miniature memory cards that are used in their mobile cells without reducing.
You do not need any special software for players except for exceptions (iPod).
All you need to do is fill the device through the USB from the computer.
Most mobiles and players already create a music library sorted by the name of interpretation, the name of Alba, the genre or the user's evaluation.
Some devices only show a tree structure of directories like the Windows Browser and some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with the operating system).
Players are eagerly handled, mobile mobiles are more skilled
When selecting a specific device, take particular care of the maintenance of the accumulator, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output, and of course also the comfort of control.
If you have music mostly in the towel and if you listen to it every day just for a little bit in tramway, it's enough for you to have any cell phone that plays MP3.
Which already can do almost any cell phone.
You don't even have to watch too much about what musical formats the phone or the player can do.
The MP3 will handle all and the complete majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
It belongs to the most widespread and, besides it, the total majority of the devices can handle music in the WMA format.
The AAC (form used by Apple and its iPods) is less available.
Better mobiles also allow for the purchase of music online.
All you need to do is visit the operator's (or other providers) websites and a song or album.
This service could already be a good argument for the acquisition of a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and mostly limited only to fast-coated radio hits.
Prices are not also lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this is the way to sell music (with the GSM, the Internet or the wireless Internet) will be able to control the music industry in the future.
Mobile most people still carry with them.
Whenever you get a taste to listen to something, you record your cell phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player is lying forgotten at home.
However, it is still important if you are always wearing listeners or at least the wirefree.
If not, you can use an integrated reproductor that has almost every mobile, but only the minimum MP3 players.
Probably the greatest advantage of music mobile cells will be for a lot of prices.
The cheapest is usually under 3,000.
In three and four thousand crowns, you'll already have a very decent walkman.
But mostly, you will be limited to the absence of output to regular listeners.
The best and technically the most equipped phones even with 3,5 mm hole for ordinary listeners are worth 15,000.
The benefit of players is, among other things, easy service.
The easiest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our choice) - players can really control everyone.
The minimum functions, the likelihood of control with the previously common tape or maybe the gramophone is obvious.
No collision in the form of an error on the mobile internet and subsequently the giant account for data transfer.
What kind of device to touch
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have slots on exchange memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even by buying the corresponding card you're going into two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models only cards with maximum capacity 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive can handle 8 GB memories.
If you already have a mobile and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, touch Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you belong to more difficult listeners, please touch the specialized phones - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsunga).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of service is thus approaching separate MP3 players.
There is also Sony Ericsson, whose phones from a series of walkman have the same user interface as separately sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category to four thousand crowns, but with greater memory capacities (up to 16 GB) and the maintenance of the battery (at 15 hours, up to 35 hours), will take you MP3 players from the above-mentioned marks.
The first virtual operator will arrive in Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in Czech Republic is relatively advanced and our operators offer practically all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, there's something we're missing here -- a virtual operator that would make these classicals screw up.
Maybe it won't be long missing.
About the fact that Czech Operators belong to the most expensive in Europe, we have written on Mobil.cz many times.
It also confirmed the CTU, which noted that the SMS price is higher than the rest of the Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission on Roaming Tax Regulation, there may be a paradox situation - for some Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than home.
How can prices in Czech Republic be held so high compared to Europe?
Answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to go into the fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxal, but we have three mobile networks and penetration over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to flourish the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The President of the Czech Telecommunications Council (CTU) Paul Dvořák, who has expressed himself in the past several times that there is no place for another operator in Czech Republic.
It's probably true that a classic operator with his own network has probably no too much chances (in the end, he'd probably just hardly look for frequency).
But there's another option - a virtual operator.
The entry of virtual operators to the mobile market has just brought a significant reduction in prices to which the classical operators had to respond.
However, before the input, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile marketed similar voices in Great Britain as us.
But it turns out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
Otherwise, we don't have to go too far for examples.
In February this year, we informed you of the launch of a virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
In just half a year, the operator was able to get over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator.
In addition, the Mobilking is behind the Penta financial group, which owns U:fona in Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to work effectively, they have much less customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively high costs on construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators are usually profiled as low-course - offer cheap calls and SMSs, which is often exported by a higher service offer.
So, for example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half cheaper than his competitors.
But as shown in the example of Mobilking in Poland, it may be a pretty good move and a bet on an uneven target group.
Because this operator is focused specifically on men.
"The right guys choose Mobilking - Operator who they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operated by this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if a concept like that in Poland could be caught with us.
The press speaker of Vodafon Miroslav Čepski doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentary approach on which most virtual operators are based.
Furthermore, it is relatively saturated in terms of the offer of services."
In Czech without a chance, mobile operators say
But it seems almost sure that if there's some virtual mobile operator in Czech Republic, it won't be mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations are not too hopeful in Czech Republic.
More likely, Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," she said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz Jan Studničkova, a press speaker of the Penta Financial Group.
In this way, she confirmed that existing mobile operators in Czech Republic are definitely not inclined.
Rather, he's trying to do everything so that no potential competitor can come up.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator is no longer available by the GTS Novera group that would like to make another step to become a real competitor of the O2 Telephone field.
"We are very interested in offering not only firm, but also mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
And the sooner the better.
We have been treating this option again and again with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have already managed to progress in the proceedings," Paul Kaidel, a press speaker, says.
So maybe it's shineing for better times.
From unofficial information, it seems we should wait for the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is carried out by an invisible silence wall.
"We do not believe that there is a space on the Czech market for a full virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific against other markets.
We have not yet been addressed by any entity with a complex and serious project in this area," said on his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sseń from the press committee Telephones O2.
The specificity of the Czech market is also appealed to other operators.
The press speaker T-Mobilo Martina Kemra adds in rare conformity with the O2 expression: "We have not yet recorded any life-specific and bilateral business project on which we could continue to build."
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network by the end of the year, a virtual operator will hardly appear.
At this point, we'd have to have a specific agreement on the table so that we can consider in this short horizont."
Waterfone is noting its attention rather to meet the requirements of its 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepski says: "We are open with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
That's what we think is the most valuable of the customers.
The main strategy of Vodafon in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of the next operator would result in increased competition, would result in a decrease in prices and thus to the decline of their profits.
Why, then, make such a competitor easier?
The fact that when the operators are concerned about something, they can pull for one rope, they also testify about the form of U:phone.
Probably the biggest pressure towards the CTU went through the U:phone from T-Mobile.
This is a publicly available information from the CTU website.
But now U:fon is a good argument why not allow a virtual operator.
Martina Kemra stated: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been enhanced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator to the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of the next player would put high requirements on it and especially on its services."
However, because of this approach, mobile operators are directly infecting the absolute non-interest of the Czech regulatory authorities.
It's not just the position of the CTU, which is unfortunately in Czech Republic - unlike the Great Britain and other excellent countries - has no power to interfere with the competition.
These belong only to the Competition Protection Office (UOHS).
But this one took his typical attitude to the whole problem.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator for renting the necessary infrastructure would be concluded.
No such contract has yet been concluded, since the offer of potential interesters was probably not sufficiently interesting for classical operators," stated Christian Chaloupa from the UOHS committee of external relations in our question.
It may not be surprising from representatives of the operators of this formed expression.
It is more than important from the Authority to represent the interests of consumers and, inter alia, to ensure that no one uses its position on the market.
Especially when Christian Chalupa adds: "In abroad where virtual operators usually work, we can observe that their market entry has contributed to reducing prices for mobile phone services."
However, apparently, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and price decline does not belong to the interests of the UOHS.
In the truth shocking on the whole case, there is a touching summary of three mobile operators that result in their reactions.
The question is, if it's just a coincidence, it's offered itself.
Just like the total price of gasoline in pumping stations is certainly only part of a coincidence and a hard competitive fight.
"The Authority did not find signs of competitive proceedings in this matter, and therefore there is no reason to interfere in any way.
No operators have a dominant position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their market proceedings.
The necessary instruments for the opening of the mobile market for virtual operators may also be missing the telecommunications regulator," Chalupe said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many dispute points.
Understandably, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the CTU, which makes telecommunications from the perspective of competition the only market.
Then, of course, no Czech operators have a dominant position on this market.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - the creation of a virtual operator is always necessary for the network operator's consent.
And the mobile operator - has a pretty logic - on his network monopoly.
So in a certain segment they must be dominant.
Even if we do not accept this argument, it should be at least warned that three mobile operators are doing the same.
However, the complaints of a number of stakeholders (including the GTS Novera) indicate that in the negotiations with all operators, they face very similar obstacles.
Muscleing responsibilities to CTU is then a relatively common trick in telecommunications that UOHS is giving his hands away from the whole matter.
We've met him in a few similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted novels of the telecommunications law have been extended to the CTU competitiveness in the field of competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
That must have the representatives of OHS know more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It works when no one's looking
However, without notice, there remains some pseudovirtual operators that have a few in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies who issue their own mobile phone services prices, but they are only partially public.
It's usually a company dealing with multilevel marketing.
The own mobile phone service offers Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others.
The prices of these companies are usually to the elected.
The magic is that the company is acting against the operator as a classic company customer that orders a large quantity of SIM cards.
As a significant customer then gets special prices (and other) offers.
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators are prohibited by similar selling.
"If cases that you're talking about are occurring, it might be a violation of the contractual conditions we're dealing with and which could result in collaboration with the company," Martin Kemr answered our question to this problem.
But it is unlikely that such activity would not be brought to responsible people from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of three companies mentioned may be thousands of customers.
No operators are defending such a procedure.
Because these companies have unnecessary profits and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepski notes on the possibility of problems: "The law allows similar speculation, however, the services of these companies are only used by the negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not conducted on their name, so they cannot have it fully as normal customers of mobile operators."
But that should be at least weird.
Furthermore, another question for OHS is opened.
If mobile operators close their eyes over a similar procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has a relatively strong power to disclose such activities, and if it does not want, it must not be satisfied with the explanation of operators that they have no idea of such things and their business conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be the dearest
As the text has fallen several times, the entry of virtual operators to the mobile market has brought a recorded reduction in prices for services.
But practically in all countries where virtual operators were created, classical operators tried to defend their creation more or less.
Jimi used arguments were practically identical - too small, if possible too saturated market, problems with quality of services, etc.
In advanced countries, however, in these moments, regulatory authorities have affected, not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Whether formal measures or non-formal pressure have achieved that the first virtual operator was created and the other were packed on it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are throwing the whole case as a hot potato.
From our experience, we can't get rid of the illustration in competences that they are more than fit in these cases.
But let's not throw the flint into the grain.
If the following information is correct and the virtual operator will appear in us very soon, the Czech mobile market may be dispersed again.
If one of the operators has accepted any virtual mobile operator, it is hard to remain inadequate to reject (discrimination) other interested persons.
And we may stop calling more drastic than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymna has four new versions.
Pick the best
Listen to the four new version of the Czech state hymna.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek presented the new recordings of the state hymna where my home.
Hymnu was newly recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the leadership of George Whitehead.
There are four versions - with male or female soli singing, in the congregation administration and instrumental text.
The singing was taken by Katerina Priestess and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the amendments of the hymna are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed server, you can listen to all four versions.
The whitehead considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymen.
He already told the Czech radio that he deliberately chose to sing salt variations of singers with young representative voices that are significant and favorite.
"In the beginning, I have also tried to ensure that the congregation has made clear dictions so that the text should be well understood to contemplate," he said.
The Czech state hymna will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where my home sounded for the first time in 1834 on the boards of the Construction Theatre in the original Czech game Fidlovačka Joseph Kayetan Tyl supplemented by Francesco Scroup.
She acquired popularity and people spontaneously took it as their own.
The first script of the song after the beginning of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became a natural part of state hymna.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the creation of a separate Czech Republic.
How does "new" hymna sound?
Prague MHD in Wednesday for the first time ties and chip
Wednesday, 1 October 2008, the past of the Prague Traffic Company is registered as the date when the meter, tramways and buses will enter the first passengers who will have electronic coupon in the pocket instead of paper tickets.
At this point, he can acquire approximately 10,000 people who own the Opencard chip card.
Travelers can buy 30 days and 90 days and annual coupon (this will be paid from 1 January 2009) and also let their chip card be recorded in the information centres and workplaces of the Traffic Business stations Museum, Mostek, Holešovice, Angel, Rostyle, Summer, Kobilis, Paradise Garden, Cacherov and Luke.
Coupons can be purchased from yesterday on the website www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers used the service in the afternoon.
Those who start using the Internet trade can definitely forget the outstanding windows in metro stations where they had to be regularly standing in long fronts on paper tickets.
Because the coupon buys on the Internet and on the Opencard card, they will record it in one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
"These places are available to travellers with a skilled service that will help interesters with the internet shopping and will also record a purchased coupon on their card," said speaker Martin Careful project.
Within the library, it will be possible to record electronic coupons on Opencard also in self-servicing machines mounted in several metro centres.
How do these machines look?
They are red, reminders of ticket markers, and passengers may have already noticed them in stations of the Metro Roztyla, Budjajevska, I.P. Paulova, Florenc and Vlatavska.
"There are five in the city now, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," complemented the Careful.
The shop will check the automatic driver's place
The automatic service that starts working tomorrow is easy.
All you need to do is put the Opencard chip card in them and the previously paid coupon will be recorded on it itself.
Electronic coupons have been paid not only in the capital, but also in its neighborhood.
In front of the trains and bus lines of 300 to 499, which are driven to the capital mainly in the Mediterranean.
"In the trains included in the Prague integrated transport, the guides are equipped with card readers, using which they detect the time and zone validity of the coupons," Philip Drapal explained the check of tickets from the Ropid organization, which comprises the passage orders of Prague mass transport.
Prigrad buses have card readers built in a cartridge at the driver's cartridge.
It is therefore necessary not only to show the driver's chip card, but also to add Opencard to the place on the side of the treasury.
This means that the driver will check the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If the traveller needs to verify the validity of recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking drivers for this information," Drapal added.
The travellers who do not ride by buses and will not remember when their coupon is completed may go again to self-servicing automates where the coupons are recorded on the card.
Here information on the validity of their documents will be shown on the display of the appliances.
Judges wanted a referendum after the United States
Sudetic Germans asked for the inclusion of šumava in 1945 in the United States.
It comes from a letter stored in the collections of the Southern Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patrons of the United States of America.
In 1945, accordingly, some groups of Sudetian Germans turned to the President of the United States with such wishes.
This is, inter alia, a letter that has been held in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the Southern Scientific Library.
The Germans from the Czech Krumlov request in a letter from the US President to prevent the return of the "forest pocket" -- taken by Hitler on the basis of the monk's agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the right situation and we want to be sure in the words that the American units come to the German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as the Liberators," the letter says in the letter signed by the words "The people who are fate of the Shumawa's heart."
Because the connection with Czechoslovakia is allegedly presented to the Sudetian Germans - with the knowledge of the Czech national nature - the hope of brutality, indispensity, disagreement, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter of the US President to take over the Sumawa Protectorate for the present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of the million people, you would acknowledge this territory to a foreigner who is intimidating and distorting minorities and nothing, you would not contribute to the United States' victory," the letter says.
The reason why the authors cannot be signed is, accordingly, the fear of revenge of the Czech oppressors.
If the President of the United States had allegedly doubted the views of the Forest Germans, it would be enough to organize a referendum in the Forest County on whether its inhabitants would become part of the United States or live under the patrons of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today’s knowledge of the history of war, some monuments have appropriately drawn the expectations of the Sudetian Germans.
Although the Czech Germans had to know at least that it would be their departure from the Republic, only a few of them accepted such a possibility at all.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate a certain type of autonomy to the Sudets.
Others believed that they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chaloupa, born in Czech Budjajevic.
He was in war as a Будay-German who was put on the Navy in Balt.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Holland, tens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, they would use the Czech," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia did not count on being removed from the Republic on the basis of Benesh decrees.
You don't think you'll pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive action aimed at safety on roads in Czech history.
It could still be characterized by an emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport plans to launch in Wednesday.
The Office of Minister Alesh Ribbica promises to rescue drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million will appear on TV, radio, cinema, online, and even on flights.
She should distract the drivers from the fast drive and alcohol behind the wheel.
And also remind them to be bound before they leave.
He wants to reach his conscience mainly by young drivers, motor drivers, walkers, and also by professional drivers.
And what's going to happen in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And that's the "blood" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think you'll pay!
The word "you don't think" is written by big letters on the Espeset.
And in the blood plate is the word "you pay."
This should symbolize that a person may pay his own life in a moment of immediate disobedience.
The freaks will "scare" spots until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the English countries where images with drastic images of victims of accidents can normally be seen.
It promises it will reduce the accident and the number of deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar and bee on drivers
"The driver's system of sugar and bull.
Sugar for them is that, for example, when they go to red, they save time.
The bee's a threat to a punishment or an accident.
The drivers must be reminded of the risk," says the transport psychologist of the hospital at Homolce Martin Kořjan.
And that's why the information campaign in the press is needed, and mostly negative advertising, it means psychologist.
It is already less efficient than that, according to him, tables that warn drivers of danger.
"If the statistical table warnings against danger are installed, it is likely soon to fly with the environment and the drivers will not be devoted to it," Korean warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The President of the temporary Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, spoke to return almost all the territories occupied in 1967, i.e. Prejordan, East Jerusalem and the Golanese heights, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
He did this in an interview that was printed by Jediot Achronot's diary on Monday.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, unless all of them at all," Olmert said to the journal.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to move the Palestinians a similar percentage (the land of Israel), because without that there will be no peace," he added.
He confessed that the possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want his tractors or buldozers to take over his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up the part of Jerusalem," he noted Olmert in an instant on two June attacks in the city where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "specific solutions for the temple Mount, holy and historical places", which lie inside the Old city.
"The one who wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he emphasized further.
Departure from Golan Heights
Olmert also expressed himself for Israel’s departure from the Golan heights, which he believed as an imminent condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some efforts from Damascus.
"I am not suggesting that peace with Syria be concluded only on the basis of leaving Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to gain Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with (Shiit movement) Hizballah; they will have to give up permanent support provided by terrorism (Shiit movement) to Hamas, (terrorism networks) Al-Qaeda and Gihad (Saint Wars) in Iraq," the Prime Minister stated.
Questions after an accident: Are the stewards in the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know them, walking on a remote bus is not allowed.
With regard to the tragic accident of the Student Agency near the Italian Padova, the question was whether stevards and passengers could move on the bus.
"If we want to comply with the law strictly and formally, the activity of the steward is in contrast with the road traffic law," the speaker of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka said.
The accident in which a twenty - year - old stevard died last week, apparently caused a truck driver who crossed the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, at the least safe place in the car, even though she had two more places.
However, the bus can crash, or slowly brake, even when the stevard delivers coffee or papers.
The role plays whether the bus is equipped by technical records.
If the bus is not approved, the passengers must sit.
The remote buses Student Agency have no stations; what Currently.cz also confirmed by the Director of Radim Jančura.
"We've dealt with the Ministry, and the travellers did not allow it to move at first.
Then we revoked it, and we grew up to let travellers go to the toilet if they have their seat," he announced his opinion.
The law does not know the stewards
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the stevard - no laws deal with this role.
However, no legislation does not even prohibit the carrier to provide services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of vehicle guide; it does not define its rights and obligations," the speaker Hanzelka provides less clearly.
The director of the Road Vehicle Management Board of the Ministry of Transport, Joseph Ponity, in contrast, considers that the issue of law is treating sufficiently.
"If the bus is allowed to stand in homologation, it is important.
That's what it ends," he says.
The buses are divided into urban places where the stations are and the limited maximum speed, between towns with higher speed permitted and remote spaces with highest allowed speed and seats equipped with security zones.
Like the plane, the expert says
Expert BESIP for transport security Jaroslav Gorin in the movement of stewards on the busboard does not see a major problem.
"The situation can be compared to the aircraft service.
It's not even sure when the turbulence comes, and the turbulence can be hit in the head."
"But if the bus has hardly stopped, of course the physical laws apply.
Just like the city bus or the tramway.
The security of the stewards must deal with the carriers with internal regulations," he says, and he also considers, in the light of the law, the problem is unsolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel service
A student of the Agency offers the services of stewards as the only bus carrier.
She's working for two hundred of them.
The director, even after the accident, does not consider their job as risk.
"But once I get the impression that the call of stewards is risky, I'll cancel them.
Coffee and papers can get passengers on the way.
It would also save the costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the absence of stewards in his cars, the Director of Asia Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of lines compared to SA.
"We don't have stewards, we've been up against it from the beginning.
Early or later, it ends with some fatal injury," he said a few years ago for the week.cz.
There has been an enormous tragedy
In the accident of a link connection in Neapole, a young stevard from Plzensk, who worked for the company for two years, died.
The Slovenian truck probably scrolled off without using the direction from the restraint trail and blocked the bus road.
His driver tried to avoid a strong maneuvre, but he disturbed the right front part of him.
That two selling places protected for the rest of the stewards would be sold, Janchura refused.
"These places are not reserved in remote connections, they're blocked."
The company is going to sue the driver of the truck.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait at the court's ortel, but expects the financial refund from the guilty.
Law adjustment?
In Irrespective
The accuracy of the movement of the stewards on the busboard could bring to the amendment of the law for which the 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport work over a year.
"No concrete conclusion she has come to.
The buses do not solve too much, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the road and the use of the mobile in the management," the expert Gorin said.
"The Ministry of Transport does not view the activities of stewards as a major threat to the safety of passengers," speaker Hanzelka concluded that the bus security control is in the power of the police and the labour security authorities.
Hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
The large words in the letter of the WestLB to the employees of this bank are not missing.
The link of the units of this Düsseldorf monetary institution with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank will create "the central institutions of the financial group enshrined to trade in capital markets", let's see in the letter that came to the public on Monday.
The WestLB, according to the letter to this transaction, shall enter the "set of competences" which provide long-term profits.
And they say that such a connection could be a decisive impulse for further associations in the earthly banks sector.
Such texts occur when the government wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult period.
The unstable WestLB is still under significant pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Social Office for the Monitoring of Financial Services, whose message to the country's government in North Porino-Westfall that it is time to find a solution for the future, is still fresh.
The link between Deka-Bank, which customers know for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever kind it will be, is spoken for a long time - even on the French side.
The Chief of Deka-Bank Franz Waas, during the presentation of seven-year economic results at the end of August, has heard that the compound of his banking house from Mainzer Landstraße with one of the earth's banks, such as Helaba or WestLB, does not make sense.
The Deka-Bank Administrative Council, which stands for one half of the Earth bank and the other union, has, however, authorized the headship of the WestLB interviews on joint business activities.
This could be business in the capital market or part of it.
However, the interviews have just started, financials are concerned.
About Deka-Bank, which belongs to its 3,000 employees in the financial market in Frankfurt, does not speak for the first time in relation to consolidation in the reliable sector.
In 2003, it seemed that the compound of Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba bank could have occurred.
There was nothing from this triple at last.
Shortly after the fusion plans reached the public, the Helab Bank's Helaba's participatory government spoke.
Both of the other bank houses haven't connected.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead won Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Nevertheless, speculation on the connection of Deka-Bank with the earth banks was repeatedly occurring.
However, in recent time, Günther Merl, chairman of the Helab Bank, expressed negatively to speculation on the link of his financial house with others.
However, it appears that independently it is convincing that the closerness of the various banking houses of the public-related sector is necessary.
Now, after the elections to the country's embarrassment in Bavorska, BayernLB's connection with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be first drawn.
That's not good news for Helaba.
If the pressure on further fusions should grow, the potential partners for such connections are gradually lost.
She would only play the second violin in the south, even though the financial crisis is facing much better than the bank houses in Mnich and Stuttgart.
The connection with WestLB again in the beginning of the year prohibited the compound and jury banks Hessen-Thüringen, which has a fifty-twenty-percent share in Helaba.
It would be the highest Nord LB.
However, geostrategic considerations of this species are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, the question is how much business models of individual institutions are dealing together.
In June, Merl declared that the crucial question of which business model should be secured by the future competitiveness of the earthly banks, the German union has not yet answered the jury banks.
All could also end with WestLB's distribution, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
Therefore, in the letter of the local empowerment, it also talks about trying to "complex solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect individual files to Deka-Bank, it will show time.
The second weekend of Octoberfest is known as "Weekend with Italy"
It's the first time for Elena, for Luca's third or fourth.
But this time, Elena's going to be his girlfriend, and they say everything's going to be different, she says.
A stronger beard stands behind them, at a 5-litre court of Kaiser, and two hundred tourists in the Oktoberfest proves how deep tone can deliver his throat.
Elena Luca slips first and then kiss him.
They arrived in Verona from Bolonia.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova station, they will leave this evening at 23.45 four buses with the label "Destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival 6.30.
Three buses are mainly the Italians, in one bus only Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans already sang with their flag, celebrating at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guard, that's nothing for Italy.
Marc, who has a long coat with an illustration of the skin and the glasses with wide silver rings, belongs to those three buses.
He's been riding to Octoberfest for five years, just three trips this year.
At night, over the day between beer stations, at 22:30 a ride back.
The night would only mean useless costs, says Marco.
The road costs 75 euros including a welcome toast with Kaiser beer, cooked exactly according to the Bavarian Law on Beer Cleanliness, Health Insurance and German speaking guide - Marco went to Frankfurt to the language course.
The buses are on their way to "Brennero" by the night.
Beer's not supplied, not yet.
The bus shuts up fast, the passengers sleep.
They're doing good, they're still gonna need their powers.
It's in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where on the highway number 8 pieces before Mnich's is doing another break and a lot of other buses with the Italian marking mark.
When Marc's group finally arrived at 6:30 in the morning near Theresienwes, there are about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and others are gathering together, Marco has the last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First of all: put on a yellow hat.
On the left, it is written "Octoberfest", next to Marco's internet travel address: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, when the door opens to the beer tent, run! Marco calls in the morning air.
Run! Go and take the places in the back of the tent.
"Not ahead that you do not interrupt, and not all the yellow caps on the same lavice, put yourself in the space!"
Maz costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the drinks.
"Let's show the Securities that we're acting nicely.
Once you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Third: "That's exactly the eleventh night!" Do you understand?
And up to Vienna, space with beer states.
On the road, one member of the group hangs the yellow caps as marks on trees, tags, and even on the electoral poster of one large bavorian party.
We need to prepare for retreat.
Like "Weekend with Italy" is known for the second weekend of Octoberfest.
The exact numbers of visitors are not available; there are about 50 thousand of those who travel through the Alps and fall into the beer flats, ten percent of all visitors said this weekend arrived from Italy.
The monich police lines will strengthen seven cops from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavorian Red Cross, which runs national statistics in which the Italians before the British (ca 60 interventions) and the Rakuna (about 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments are first place.
Especially favorite is the Hofbräu Stan in Italy.
Nightless night for creditors Hypo Real Estate
Last week, the Minister of Finance, Peer Steinbrück, stressed that the German banking system was relatively stable.
It is good that this policy has used the word "relatively" and has also included the fact that the German banking sector will not remain saved of crisis development.
'Cause the one on the last weekend came up.
In the Dax Index, a financial house that is specialized for the financing of Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive credit from the German banks' consortion of several billion for protection from turbulences on the market.
The person familiar with the situation on Monday told the agency Reuters that this loan aid would be up to EUR 35 billion.
The interests will have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from a really exhausted amount.
They say money comes from private and public law banks.
The background's the loss of Depfa's daughter's company.
This state fundant, according to a report on long-term projects for which he lended money, has refined extremely short-termly, which is now impossible because of untrust on markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve fell by 95% to 2.37 million euros and the share of its own capital was easily reduced from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The normal profits and net profits from financial trades, compared to the zero last year, the revenues from increased claims and certain securities, and the cancellation of the reserves for credit trade, decreased by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
It was only due to higher remuneration costs for the subsequent calculation costs for the restructuring of the former group of Depfa and the refund of interests under the tax regulation and the measurement of the trade for concrete enterprises was still moderate.
The former state fundant burned his privatisation in 1990 on the mortgages for farmers, which were then excluded from the service portfolio and further led by the Aareal Bank.
Since the classic state funding was too small, Depfa was engaged stronger in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint private investors and the State (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) projects and has been diverged internationally.
From the value of his daughter's company now, Hypo Real Estate has to describe something and these replies will have a "based material effect" for the calculation of profits and loss of the whole group, as some have let themselves hear uncertainly.
The fact is, dividenda won't be.
It has been shortened by two thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate is a significant financeer of state and infrastructure projects since taking over Depfa.
More powerful than other institutions depend on refinancing on the interbank market, as there are no customers' contributions.
After the fall of the American investment bank, Lehman Brothers almost dried out the source of interbank credits two weeks ago, because banks guarded the liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a year for part of Depfa's credit portfolio - approximately 50 billion euros - short-term refinance funds.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the financial need of the group is covered by this loan for a sustainable time and the company is protected "from the impact of international monetary markets at the moment to a significant extent of unable functions".
Other sources have been heard that the refinance is secured by the end of 2009.
The President of HRE Georg Funke said that Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use cash markets in due time.
The Social Bank and the Social Institute for the Monitoring of Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group on the market is now secured.
That's what shareholders and creditors of the bank hope for.
But in view of the dynamics and incompatibility of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the loan should not be completely exhausted.
However, it cannot be excluded from the opposite.
After the bank was standing before insolvency in the late afternoon on Sunday, it cannot be preliminary, a salvation to calm the passion.
The share rate has fallen by 75 per cent per EUR 3.30.
On the contrary, the bonding courses were well held.
While the preferential debts were practically not moved, the secondary courses are losing more significantly.
This concerns primarily the bonding former daughter firm Württemberg Hypo and logically bonded with the period of payment after 2009.
The obligations of Hypo-Real-Estate originally seemed to be an alternative investment opportunity for speculants, but their stability is necessary after a significant increase in the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which introduced it to the company by taking Depfa, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the emission banks, governments and less infected trade banks will be willing to support the system, it is possible to count on removal of securities within their period of payment.
But it may also occur to what almost no one is daring to hope at present - in the next 15 months, the financial crisis will be overcome.
However, in view of the reports coming at the same time with this partial restraint, the probability of a limited hope has now become just an authorised hope.
Especially for long-term creditors, it is likely to prepare a number of sleeping nights when they decide whether to give up their commitments.
Short-term investors can use the limit line at least to create the transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to rates of later years for the purpose of future tax payments from capital benefits.
Sylvana and secrets of the bento box
When the 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop's first day in high school in Tachibana, girls start to sniff: that German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from mang.
"The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I've been stuck on my way to school.
I live in the area of Tokia to Kawasaki and ride a 40-minute train in high school in Tachiban.
I had to find the road alone, fortunately, I didn't lose myself.
It seems that the beginning of tachiban learning is not given as strictly as our home in the lower Saska.
Students start meeting after eight and twenty minutes before nineth, start a short seat with a teacher, called 'Home room'.
But before teaching started, I was supposed to introduce myself.
I'm not the type of man who likes to speak in front of people, in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I haven't had a school uniform yet, I took my old dress of my host's mom, the blue, the blue shoes, and the black skin shoes.
So that's how I stood in front of the cage and tried to say everything right: "Syonara Wo Še Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and I'm birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy to learn the tongue two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were screwing, screaming and waving, and I still heard the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my mang.
It belongs to the basic word supply of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means "sweet, sweet."
Then I swimmed into my place quickly.
A girl next to me smiled a lot wide, thought it was a honour to sit next to her a foreign student.
The rest of the hour was quite calm, but when the gong contacted, they literally slept me.
They talked across each other and cheeping and asked me about the possibilities and impossible - and it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
Then they all packed up their bands on the break.
My owner's mom also made me a box like that for lunch -- and that's something else than a boring German meal.
I had herbal rice, little pairs, oak salad, fruit and some kind of tofu fish.
I don't know what I'm eating here in Japan mostly.
Those things look strange and tastes quite new.
Surely, everything's really good.
Well, maybe just on the salt, bro!
Benta in Japan's schools is not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives the boy a own-handed bento, which is particularly artificially modified in this case, and hopes that the boy at the holiday will know the boy closer about the break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm curious if I can see it here too.
'Why exactly Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
'Cause it just fascinates me.'
After all, I prefer to read manga for years.
And to get these comics and their culture better understanding, I started learning Japanese once.
So I was absolutely clear that I would have to come here sometime.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and habits.
And these are highly appreciated here.
On the one hand, Japan is the latest technologies and trends, and on the other is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything's so well organised, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
And rats have feelings
When a rat or a frog runs away from danger, does that mean that they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings.
But how would it be possible to check if they felt the same when they acted like us?
In the Internet magazine Edge, the contributions of known scientists have been published for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in his series represents the selected answer to the question "What do you think is true without proving it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else yet to prove it if we can't prove that other people have a consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, once we begin to devote to another species and open issues of perception or general awareness, we enter an inappropriate territory because the hardware does not fit.
When a rat gets in danger, he will do the same thing as many other animals: he will pretend to be dead, run away or attack.
People are acting similarly, and some scientists consider comparative subjective experiences.
I don't believe in that, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it easy to transfer our subjective experience to animals.
It is, however, because the areas associated with human consciousness almost always include side prefrontal cortex (for the purpose of its share in short-term memory and execution or management functions).
This large area is developed in humans much more than in other primates, and it seems that it is totally missing in other creatures.
At least in the aspects of our awareness that depends on the prefrontal cortex, among them the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that a person is different even from other primates.
Another dramatic speciality could hide the language element of a man: since so much of his perception is related to the language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, we could exclude animals.
But even if the consciousness of the language would not matter, it would certainly have influenced it, so the animal consciousness, whatever it is designed, would probably differ from most states of our consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to figure out how awareness is likely for other animals.
When, as an internal and subjective thing, it can't even measure, or because of a special hardware, analyze it based on our own experience, it builds us his research in front of major problems.
Most of my outputs relate to the content of awareness, but there is also another aspect of awareness that should be scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to explore animals in awareness regardless of their contents, and that is exactly what happens in the studies of short-term memory in primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But this approach to Christof Koch and Francis Crick focuses rather on the neural consciousness corelates than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical but may not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the non-frontal cortex for visualisation.
What is the result of feelings?
I bring them out that the emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain of aware of its own activity.
So what we call "safe" is a mental condition in which we are in when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its consequences such as physical reactions) uses the operational memory.
It is seen from this angle, feelings are closely linked to the areas of the cortex that are characterized by primates, and especially people.
In connection with language nature, there is a gentle distraction of perception, because by means of words and grammatics we can distinguish and categorize the states that we may assign them to others.
For example, Antonio Damasio believes that the feelings come from more primitive activities in the areas of cortex and the brain tribe devoted to physical feelings, like Jaak Pankseep, which is more focused on the brain tribe.
Since this network has not changed too much during human evolution, it could easily participate in the feelings of multiple animals.
I can't teoretically resist it, however, I consider it unproofable.
Pankseep argues that what the rats and people seem to be fearful to us are likely to feel both organisms as well: How can it be verified, the Pankseep further says whether the rats and people feel the same when they act similarly?
Swab runs away from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my perspective, the likelihood of behaviour can not only prove the compatibility of experience.
It is true that the neural comparison continues to move us: rats and people have similar brain tribes, opposed to it, or brains.
But is the brain tribe responsible for feelings?
And even if it was possible to prove it in a man, how would we want to prove it to the rats?
I think rats and other suppliers, perhaps even swabs (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are probably essentially different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special areas and languages), I'm rather emotional behaviour than emotional awareness of rats.
Anyway, we can wait for progress at the neuro level if we measure the same in rats and people.
Like rats, I don't study language and consciousness, I don't even test feelings, because I don't know if they exist.
It can be considered short-sighted, but I'd rather move forward than throw myself over the wall again and again.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President EUFA Platini: Grace of mercy for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that preparations will soon be directed by the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the EUFA decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to arrange ME with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"It's not amnesty for our country.
Work just started and there's a lot to do in both countries."
In the early implementation of the time plan for construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are disturbing.
It's even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will fall from eight to six.
"We can't waste time anymore.
We must now work as fast as possible," said the President of the Ukrainian Union, Grigorij Surkis.
"EUFA will keep tracking us."
The more radical step was agreed in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Union of PZPN was cancelled and replaced by the independent governor Robert Zawlock after several scandals.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sports, Miroslav Drzewiecki.
He said there is a "value danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," said the Polish press agency PAP.
"The President of EUFA Michel Platini has been assured by a letter that the preparation for ME 2012 will not be suffered by this step."
Several teams from the first league were only sentenced to a forced decline in the past season, and even had to be moved quickly to the beginning of the League.
Rebel Dennis Quaid returns a hit
She wanted to make a new film advertisement, talked about private things -- and now she has problems with her ex: the Hollywood star Meg Ryan spoke of her former Dennis Quaid as a marryer.
He's pissing and returning a hit.
Late war of roses in the former marriage couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce together these two Hollywood actors have led a disagreeable dispute - in front of the public.
Meg Ryan, in an interview for the American magazine InStyle last week, expressed the first reason for the failure of her marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She said she learned about the scope of fraud until after the divorce.
The inspiration for this mental strip was Ryan's PR work for her new film "The Women" - the story of a distorted marriage.
The reaction of Dennis Quaida to his presentation as a failing husband was significant: "It is mad," said a 40-year-old actor of New York Daily News that "Meg repeatedly chews the history of our relationship and adjusts it."
Furthermore, it's "politation suitable" that the common 16-year-old son, Jack, again, "was a public reminder of pain and radical changes that are divorced for every child."
While Ryan lives alone from the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became a twin father.
His consideration of prevention ends as follows: "My life goes on anyway.
I think I'm happy that I have a wonderful family that's doing great."
Prices of flights and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, years and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
The years in Germany were even cheaper in one current study by up to 50 percent.
The flights and accommodation in hotels have renewed - that is the result of the study of American Express travel provider and financial services.
The company analysed its data on the bookings made from the first half of 2008, and after prices increased in the first quarter, it discovered their significant decline in the second quarter.
After the hotel market prices grew over a few years, accommodation in many places has already declined.
Since January to March, prices have increased in 41 of 48 European cities in the average by 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, from April to June, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
The most specific trend was this trend in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay by 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
For the reason of this trend, American Express considers a weak course of dollar that caused the "decreasing taste of American tourists to travel".
The lower prices of hotels were also more infected than the industrial centres, such as Hannover, Kolin over Rin or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices were even recorded by 26.3 per cent.
Furthermore, the prices of the airlines showed a growing trend in the first quarter:
Because of the irritation of kerosine, travellers in the Economy class had to pay a average by 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, even 29.2 per cent of the gas sustained remote years.
Since April to June, the prices of airlines in the Economy class were lower than 12,5 per cent in comparison with the previous quarter, however, in Business and First-Class classes changes were less significant.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
Since January to March, it increased by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter by 23.6 per cent.
In the German national years, the quoted study has even decreased by half.
One reason for this price drop is slowing economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure because of the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalized the air traffic between the United States and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the disruption of non-exported airlines by air carriers and the high number of airlines that announced the competition in the first half of 2008 -- only in Europe, it was 24 airlines.
HSV defeated Glabach 1:0
Thanks to one branch and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the head of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to compile a working eleven.
He wrote Christopher Klein - to increase the Unsuccessful landing for representative Marko Marin.
This Glabach player joined the game too late and failed with a screwed balloon on the stick.
His message was precisely formulated and struck out of his mouth persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the hallway to the chambers of the Hamburg Arena.
A lot of things happened in the catacombs, the semi-time break ended, and most people were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger was a HSV physiotherapeutic for almost three decades and has more respect than a lot of momental actors.
So his request was also heard in the responsible place.
Coach's assistant Cornelius Jol attached and raised his finger on the match sign.
Cornelius is a brother of chief coach Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded like this: come here with the other goal!
It didn't happen to be done.
"They didn't look at everything here today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have been "wilding to be more relaxed."
At 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgers owe the head of Mladen Petrić (11.) and the circumstances that very weak Glabashans could not harm the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," summarized Martin Jol.
This Monday hamburger will celebrate 121 years of its existence.
So, on Saturday afternoon, the divers celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the arena, and the lively updated video table on the video wall, in which their team was listed as a prime minister.
It'll be a birthday without a good party.
"We know how to estimate it," said Marcel Jansen.
He thinks that the continuous table result symbolizes rather the unanimity of the league than the dominants of his HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Nevesa and Silva, Petrice Brancher and FC Bayern gained by Jansen - is still not able to shine.
"We need more empathy and more dribbling," Jol remarkably said.
After voting defeat
The Wall Street is spreading fear.
The first reports on the flood of the rescue package resulted in a decrease in Dow Jones index to 700 points.
It was the biggest loss in one day in his history.
Later, Dow picked up something again.
Approximately 20.30 showed this most important world burzing barometer of five percent decline to 10.579 units.
The Technological Storm Nasdaq was more than seven percent in minus 1548 points.
The worst was in Dow at this moment, which lost almost 14 percent, and the Bank of America lost about twelve percent.
None of the titles could be strengthened.
Goldman Sachs' shares lost almost ten percent.
A few days ago, great investor Warren Buffett had a share in this company.
As part of the rescue plan, the funds for the purchase of so-called corrupt hypothetical papers shall be provided.
However, the total amount should not be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, it is to be made available by the shares of financial companies that could be paid in favourable development of the course, thus reducing the burden for the state budget.
Active courses in Europe fall rarely
Miliard aid to banks in Europe and the United States does not dissuade the investors.
The course of shares of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly disconnected and downloads the index Dax with it.
The American Dow Jones index is losing even in spite of the planned relief of the financial market by the State.
Spectacular course losses Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank broke the index of German action (Dax) deeply into the minus.
The actions mentioned by the monk's real estate fundant lost, even though the rescue action of the government and private banks to three quarters of its value, Commerzbank lost more than 20 per cent.
Dax slipped clearly under the psychologically important limit of 6000 points and recorded 5 839 points with minus 3.7 per cent.
In the world, stock markets go to knees.
In New York, a business day at Wall Street began with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government's rescue package of $700 billion would not have to have an apartment sufficient to restore the financial markets.
Dow during the first time of trade, he lost 334 points or 3.3 per cent, and is 10 809,25 points.

Dark Matter affects the flight of space sondy
For years, scientists have not known advice with one mysterious phenomenon: dark material affects the speed of space sondy during the so-called swing-by maneuvre (gravity practice).
Experts are afraid that the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativeity would not have to be completely correct.
Almost 18 years, the universe of Ulysses flyed.
The guilt of the fuel leadership that will soon freeze is now threatening her death in winter.
Between scientists for years, one mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion - the anomaly of gravity practice.
The gravity practice is an air maneuver of space probes, where they gain additional movement in a gravity field of some space body, such as the Earth.
This means that the sondy can save a lot of fuel.
The European and American research sonda Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses sun sonda.
But what the scientist has stated for years in this case in impression: flying bodies do not act 100% as a person expects by the old good gravity law.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
Sondy are unexpectedly speeding or slowing down.
The physics have not yet been able to explain this effect.
He was baptized by the anomaly of the gravity practice.
Several experts are afraid that even the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativeity, which describes the attraction of the material by the curve of space, may not have to be completely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was wrong and is trying to explain the gravity practice anomaly by means of so-called dark material whose presence in the universe have been discovered by astronomers.
"The responsible for this anomaly could be a dark matter that could also be very close to the Earth," he says.
The existence of dark material is known by space researchers for about ten years.
It apparently comes from a gravity force whose effect on other space bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, she is completely invisible, which means that she does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, this dark material is a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt, abducted tourists are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the Italian Foreign Minister in Egypt was informed that tourists were kidnapped again on their own.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
The shooter said six kidnappers were killed before the release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
The ransom is already running.
The Germans repeatedly become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
The European tourists in Sahara are probably free.
The Egyptian state television, the Arab Television station Al-Arabia and Italian media informed the same thing.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, according to the Italian TV station Sky TG 24, confirmed: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages were released.
We're just checking their health status," Frattini said.
According to the Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians and one Romania and their eight Egyptian guides are fine and safe.
All 19 participants of the expedition to the desert are now on their way to Cahira.
The unjasted remains the background of the shooting before the hostage release: according to the statement of the Egyptian security worker, the kidnappers were prepared to terminate the kidnapping before the Judanese army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the ransom," a quoted worker said.
He said, "It was only the hostage to take over," when suddenly the "this surprise" came.
Judanese soldiers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt shot six kidnappers in Sunday and captured two of them.
The kidnappers asked Germany for a ransom of six million euros; the money was to be transferred by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The "El Masri El Jom" journal, appealing to one of the German mediators, stated that the release of hostages is stretching because the kidnappers are worried about their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release the hostages of a female sex after the ransom paid.
Men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to speak to this report.
Exploitation of fathers has led to suicide.
A few years of abuse by fathers led a woman to kill herself, sounded in court.
After he confessed to eight cases of sexual harassment, seven-fifty-year-old Michael Trerise from Stithians in Cornwall was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that Stephanie Randle regularly connected her daughter between five and seven years of age.
"I feel responsible for her death," he wrote to Trerise in confession.
The court also stated that Ms. Randle killed herself in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, April 1, 2007, aged 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise bound her eyes and then abused her sexually while her mother worked at the cabin.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the '80s and returned to Cornwall.
His own daughter went to Plymouth.
However, before the court, Ms. Randle, who spent a significant part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust organization, persecuted a spirit of abuse that had been committed twice a week.
The prosecutor Ramsey Quaife stated in the court that in 2006 the friends of Ms. Randle, who was also very committed to surfing and cycling, that she was "emotionally dead" and "renounced life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She's supposed to be strangled by the igelite bag.
Randle stood face to the father of his daughter, who wrote a confession, which ended with the words, "I bound her, and bonded her eyes.
"I didn't use it.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris told him, "You're a extremely strange feticist, and it must have been awful for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends by marrying the victim's life.
Even more horrible is the fact that if she hadn't done so, it would probably not have come to trial at all."
"Especially I would like to emphasize the consequences that, according to Stephanie's parents, your crime against their daughter in those years," he added.
"Oh, obviously she would be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
The official who lost the data will be accused of
The BBC found out that a government official who left strictly secret documents in the train in June will be charged under the State Secret Act.
The man concerned left two strictly secret documents in the train to Waterloo when he was temporaryly assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were reached in the hands of the BBC before they were transferred to the police.
It is at least a serious violation against the law mentioned and does not indicate a criminal intention.
The BBC writer for defensive matters Frank Gardner said that such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought that the matter was resolved internally between the Ministry and the government's Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed shall be accused under Section 8.1 of the relevant law, which is a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police of the Officer be accused on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Rapporteur Committee (Joint Intelligence Committee).
The documents he forgot contained secret analysis of Al-Kaida and the possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and moved from home to unknown place.
Social reserves face debt B&B
British social reserves may have to deal with more than 80 million pounds after rescuing the bank Bradford & Bingley.
The government has provided 2.6 million clients in Bradford & Bingley 14 billion pounds to protect deposits.
The interests of this loan will be paid to all companies that take customer contributions, including 59 social bases.
The Director-General of the Association of Social Bases (BSA) Adrian Coles said that the repository and their members must pay.
The 14mm debt will eventually be paid by saving Bradford & Bingley hypotheses.
However, the interest that is being concentrated will be paid every year to all 700 financial companies that take customers' deposits.
The Compensation Plan for Monetary Services for BBC confirmed that all 59 companies are founded in this number.
It's humiliating that these institutions that have acted respectfully... now must pay some accounts of those institutions that were not so far so respectable
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay proportionately to the deposits that it held, and that the reserves should pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest from debt will increase in 2009 to 450 million pounds.
That means that the repository will have to find 81 million pounds to pay interests from the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Business Association, said BBC is convinced that this is not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that have been treated respectfully during the housing market must now pay some accounts of those institutions that have not been so respectable."
According to BSA, no repository since 1945, when it appeared, has fallen.
"We will have to examine all aspects of this matter during the next few weeks in order to see what are the possibilities of protecting the communities and their members from the account that could be important," Cole added.
The interest paid in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, the interest will be paid for the whole year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since the social reserves are participating organisations without shareholders, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk betrays five pens per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
Jersey’s milkman announced that since Monday, he would increase the high-market price of his milk by five pens per litre.
This year it is the second increase in prices, after a two-pence injury in February, and it comes after the research carried out by the advisory company.
Little traders should decide whether they want to reflect on customers prices.
Before the February increase, the large-trade price of milk from Jersey last changed in 2002.
Bail for the Bangladesh Expressor is rejected
The Bangladesh Court rejected the request of former Prime Minister Shaich Hasína Vajida for bail release, which means that if she returns to the country, she can be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the accusation that she obtained from a certain businesser more than 50 million such (729 700 dollars) when she was a prime minister.
The case is one of the several accusations of corruption that are raised against it.
Chalida Ziya, a long-term political rival of Shaich Hasina, was released earlier this month on bail.
Shaich Hassina should return to Bangladesh during the next few weeks, but her party, the Lid League (Awami League), asked the local army to give her full freedom first.
Writers say that while she was released to a fair word so that she could take medical action from abroad, it is not clear if she remains free until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say that he is now appealing to the Supreme Court of Justice.
"The Supreme Court rejected the request of Shaich Hasina for bail with the fact that he does not need bail when the examination released for a fair declaration is already under way in a foreign country," said her defendant Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall revoke against the rule of the Supreme Court."
Her lawyers claimed that she needed bail to return from abroad to the country for the preparation for December elections.
The High Representative of the People's League said Shaich Hasina was to return home after October 17th.
She was detained last year after the army of the provisional government took over power, but she was released from prison in June so that she could go to abroad for medical intervention.
Shaich Hassin and Chalida Ziea both reject all charges against each other.
The fear of vaccination against the armor in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200 000 children have not participated in the recent general vaccination against the armor due to violence associated with Taliban.
The UN conducted vaccinations in six provinces last week.
But he says that for security reasons, she could not reach the children south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar.
The UN speaker stated that, even though Taliban's promises that he will not attack or protect them from thousands of vaccine workers.
BSkyB has lost the ITV judicial dispute
The BSkyB has lost a judicial dispute on the review of the Commission's Economic Competition Decision, which ordered the company to reduce its share in the ITV competitive broadcast.
The Appeal Tribunal for the Economic Competition of the BSkyB ordered to reduce its share in ITV from 17,9 % below 7.5 %.
The Commission has previously declared that the BSkyB share had a competitive fight and had a disproportionate impact on ITV.
BSkyB purchased in 2006 in a store which has resulted in the prevention of NTL, now renamed to Virgin Media, ITV to buy.
In April 2007, the Justice Trade Authority announced that the acquisition of share in ITV by BSkyB had caused doubts about ITV independence and called on the Commission for the economic competition to start the investigation.
The Chief of Consortion Virgin Sir Richard Branson, consumer organisation and Offcom regulator were all against buying.
BSkyB argumented that the forced reduction of its share in ITV was irregular and as a disproportionate solution -- especially because BSkyB said earlier that she was willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation of the American lawyers' affair
The US chief State Prosecutor appointed a special prosecutor to examine the release of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The Tah came in a situation where the report of the affirmation developed by the High Inspector of Justice of the Ministry of Justice criticised the activities of government officials.
The report criticised officials of the White House, lawmakers and former Minister of Justice Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by fear that the lawyers were removed for political reasons.
The Special Prosecutor, Nora Dannehy, will now investigate whether the officials who were interrogated during the investigation were lying to the investigators with a view to genuine justice.
In the report, General Inspector Glenn Fine stated: "The serious orders including potential criminal proceedings have not been fully investigated or explained."
The name of the Special Prosecutor with the power to force the Witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the American Ministry of Justice removed nine American lawyers in December 2006 from their functions.
At that time, the Ministry stated that lawyers were released for weak performance.
Later, however, it turns out that the release of the lawyers was not considered worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to the conclusion that the release was motivated politically.
Some of the lawyers were involved in the prosecution of highly built Republican Members and Senators, others again refused to investigate the accusations of deception of voters raised against the Democrats.
American lawyers are investigating and prosecuting lawsuits in government cases.
They may be released any time, but they must not be removed for political reasons.
The head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for release and finally resigned.
The number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice also resigned.
The report of the General Inspector was very critical in Gonzales' role in the affair, saying that he had "main responsibility" for release, "abdicated" from his leading position and in the event "nonetheless".
Other officials, including former High Bush advisor Karl Rove, were criticised for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's command will be evaluated
The Rock Star Meat Loaf gets one of Q Awards for its epical Hymne Bat Out Of Hell.
A singer who came to the ceremony next weekend in London for his special gold price said he was "honored" with a recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's hit album from 1977.
The nomination for this year is headed by the Coldplay Group, which has arrived in four categories.
Paul Rees, chief editor of magazine Q, said, "There are some songs that stand over such things, like time and genre, and Bat Out of Hell is certainly one of them."
A song written by Jim Steinman needed large vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was published in Britain in 1979 as a singl and reached the fifteenth place.
But Meat Loafho's Bat Out Of Hell album was held in the ladder for about nine years and sold over 40 million copies throughout the world.
The Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Aday - suffered in recent years of health problems, in 2003 he was also operated because of an irregular heart rhythm after he collapsed on the stage.
In 2007, acute laringitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
Later, it turns out he had a cyst on the sounds.
Circuit streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon to sell
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, roads and other earthly communications, some famous, other only benefits.
But even many veteran taxiers and long-year locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they never heard of it.
This little street is in East Village and leads north from the First Street - without getting into the Second Street - between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
At about ten and a length of 40 meters, it is more like a screwed passage than a cargo.
There are no signs with the names of the streets.
It's practically invisible in the common atlas.
Still, my street is a fan.
For example, the company Avalon Bay, the developer of recently built luxury buildings on the First Street.
He wants to extra Place newly extend and create a cleaner passage to shops and botiques that are to be opened in new buildings.
Other admirers are long-term neighbours who say they were shortly enchanted by the street simply because it was one of the last remains of the time the block was expelled.
However, the City Office for Protection and Development of the Facility, which has the street in its power, is not the least interested in sticking with it.
At the meeting of the General Community Land Committee, representatives of the City Office and the Avalon Bay planned to buy the street developer.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, circuit manager of the General Community 3, the Committee prefers a variety where the streets remain in the hands of the city and requested a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The town has only very few lands, and we would like the Extra Place to remain in its property," she said.
"The proposals for repair and management could be made, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that she wanted to lend a small street newly and plant places for a seating, from which several would use a café, whose interest in renting space the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at the meeting this month.
Michel de Milly, speaker Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wants to use the street, he doesn't want to own it.
"The main intention of Avalon Bay is to fix this empty street and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said and added that sales suggested the city.
Seth Donlin, speaker of the Institute for Conservation, said that the city really wanted to sell the streets, and pointed out that the task of his office was to develop property rather than to manage.
In comparison with his colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a small trail in history.
Some people think that the street got her name in 1802, when the large farm of Philip Minthorna was divided between several of his children and that tight country bar, no one had a right.
To Extra Place, the back door of the CBGB, a pancrock monument which closed in 2006, and the street is perhaps the most famous as the background of the photograph on the album of the Ramones "Rocket to Russia".
"This place was amazing," said Danny Fields, manager Ramones, who photographed in November 1976.
"There were garbages, broken clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some local, including bloggers who write about the examination of the East Village quarter, stand against the idea to sell Extra Place and claim that the piece of public property, being inclined, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a raritum - almost unchanged piece of town that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog named Jeremiah's disappearing New York (with the subtitle of "The Book of Repressions: Gore Nostalgic View of the City in the Dead Process of Death"), has raised a part of the story of Extra Place from the series Talk about the city that appeared in the newspaper The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow blind street, dark even in the day and limited by the iron doors of the warehouses and the windows that are scattered in the tracks, where the old papers are chasing a week."
Except for a few exceptions, the street of one recent night looked exactly the same.
The rat ran through the blind end of the street near the door that once led to CBGB, where today is a costly shop.
There was graffiti on the wall and there was an empty bottle of beer next to the fresh dose of the dropped newspapers.
A couple of past men said that the Extra Place was thinking a little bit, but they suggested that he could use some resistance.
On the contrary, Fields said that they think that some people underestimate the impression of the street in its current condition.
"The best years of my life," he said, "they were in dark, wet and gross places."
Billingvality debate: Division to English
In this edition, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the position of billing education candidates.
Lance T. Izumi, academic worker from California and Director of Education in the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-autor of the book "More than you think: why the secondary class needs to choose schools."
Effectively addressing the Spanish voters is an impressive matter.
The education agenda of Barack Obama just proves it.
Obama's campaign underscores that "Afro-American and Spanish students have a significantly lower probability to receive than white students," which is true.
In order to combat such performance differences, it promots Obama's educational agenda, particularly, "transient double-lingual education" for those who are just learning English.
The question of Barack Obama is, however, whether his commitment to billing education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Let's take the Sixth Street Prep, Charter Basic School in Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are totally Spanish from low-profit families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom just recently arrived, are only learning English.
Still, in the national mathematics tests in 2008, 100 percent of the fourth classes have reached the highest level.
Almost equal to 90 percent of the fourth - class students have reached the highest level in national tests from English and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by another method that Obama prefers.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and exercise, constant evaluation of capacities and access without excuses.
Next, Obama should note that, according to Linda Michaels, director Sixth Street, is a school educational approach for those who are just learning English, "A complete diving."
The diving to English emphasizes almost the advantageous use of English in learning.
Ms. Michaels, who is against Billing's education, said to me, "We have had a great success with a totally new student from Mexico -- after 12 months, you would have entered the class and not recognized who it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take school like Sixth Street Prep as a model, how should other schools look with great shares of Spanish and English learning students?
The results achieved by the school should be made clear from the answer to this question, but the education agenda of its own parties (National Educational Association is a long-year student of double-lingual education) and its own coherent support for double-lingual education impairs the prediction of Obama's response.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter when he said that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wishes to delete the performance differences, he should rather think carefully about educational models that work, rather than laughing and trivializing them.
The hole rapidly declines due to renewed economic concerns
The oil prices in Monday drastically dropped because of the fear that the American plan for saving financial markets would not have to restore the economy.
The prices of terminated oil trade dropped in the morning trade in the New York Commodity Bureau to 7% to 99.80 dollars per barrel.
Since Monday, the prices dropped by more than $20 for a barrel.
In the past two weeks, the commodities markets were shaken by financial concerns in Wall Street and two strong hurricanes in the Mexican Gulf.
After reaching maxim 145,29 dollars for a barrel in July, prices dropped earlier this month to almost 90 dollars per barrel, and then they jumped on the wave of the huge insecurity of the financial markets.
The investors reappeared on Monday, even after the President of the Congress announced that the weekend had reached an agreement on the biggest rescue plan in history.
This report was shaded by fresh fears that the financial crisis has been far away.
In the latest episode of the graduation, the government announced that the Citigroup Group is buying the banking division of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg government partially declined the European financial conglomerat Fortis.
The analysts of Barclays Capital said that the creepy weekends that led to the economy's saving plans were "reasonable to rebuild the mood on the market".
As the economic situation is worsening, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to fall down.
"Global stock markets, interest rates and currency rates have been very clarified," analysts from Deutsche Bank wrote in the report to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the diseases.
From a commodity perspective, our greatest concern is the extent to which the American virus will spread throughout the world and especially to China."
The analysts of this bank limited their expectations for the next year, since oil consumption dropped due to slower growth in the economy, and reduced their forecasts of gas prices for 2009 by about 20%.
Wild ride in the second quarter over the team's record
After he spent in Jets' dress in the last eight seasons more than anyone else, the defensive Shaun Ellis player thought he'd already seen everything.
Then on Sunday, he watched the development of the second quarter, where Jets turned the wireless game into a spared ride.
"I've never seen anything like that," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after Jets and the Arizonian Cardinals equipped their grim game with the dark clouds over them.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranues Colese to the 12-yard touchdown sprint, which perfectly prescribed the afternoon, where their gradually developing collaboration moved forward a mile.
Favre sent Coles in this quarter to the other two touchdowns, including the one in which he fell cornerback, and the next 10 seconds before half of the game.
"It was nothing extraordinary," Favre said about all his supplies to Coles.
"He's a hell of a good player.
We had great communications, whatever people think."
While Favre and Coles were throwing away, the defense attacked the Quarterback Cardinals Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a broken shot and returned him 32 yards to touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith set up another tape and captured it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to fumbl.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced was perhaps the best.
The Cardinal team got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely digs a 20-yard goal from the field, and he got the lead of 34-0.
That's the most Jets ever got in one quarter.
Coach Jets Eric Mangini, when he was invited to describe that madness, he said, "A second quarter or a third quarter?"
When he was told that both - Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without answer - Mangini said, "I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than the third.
A lot of points fell in the short time segment."
Restless Gebreselasia improved its world record
Haile Gebreselassie from Ethiopia again showed why many view him as the best remote runner at all when on Sunday in Berlin’s marathon he overcome his own world record and became the first man who ran 26.2 miles of long race under two hours and four minutes.
By victory on a pleasantly flat track at 2:03:59 he converted his preceding time for 27 seconds 2:04:26, who ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselasia, 35, created the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - overcome the world’s record or at least the master of the world at all distances from a metric mile to a maraton.
Last month, Gebreselasia left the Olympic marathon in Peking, because he was afraid - from the backsight perhaps too scared - that the polluted air would disturb his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sun and 48 degrees on launch, 55 degrees in target - he won Gebreselasia on Sunday with a blessed average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As the runners like Gebreselasia and Paul Tergat from Keny focused on the longer trail, the Marathon record fell over two minutes in the past decade since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the Sunday victory, he told Gebreselas to the journalists that he had screwed two weeks ago and left a week of training.
The break obviously bothered him rather than delayed.
"I'm so happy," said Gebreselasia to the reporters.
"All was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I was a little doubty today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticised - especially in Kenya, the East African Rival of Ethiopia - because he said he too much planned his races, generally avoided world maraton peaks, relied on guides, as if it was a race on the road, and built world records over the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's huge running quality.
Maintained at the rate of four Kenians reached Gebresela half in time 1:02:04.
After the leaders departed, Gebreselassia was persecuted by two elite Kenyan runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
Something before three miles before the aim of Gebreselasia last took away and fled Kwambai, who then ran the second place at 2:05:36 and thus improved his personal maximum by nearly five minutes.
Kamathi ended third at 2:07:48.
In the race of women, the seventh fastest time of history 2:19:19 Irina Mikitenk, a member of Kazakhstan, who is now German national.
Record time 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliffe from Great Britain.
Sixty-year-old Mikitenk won surprisingly last spring in London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She left the Peking games because of something described as a back wound, but she recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon that she used to run, she improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes.
The race ran smartly and thoughtfully: she let the ethiopic and Kenyan runners escape to a great scope, and then she dragged them about 18⁄2 miles away.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia arrived second in 2:21:31 and Helena Kipropova from Keni ended third at 2:25:01.
The pride and obstacles of the lives of black people in a separate city
Hidden between the widespread entertainment parks of the larger Orlando, a few miles from all the shiny, loud and giant, is a quiet city in which the pride and difficulty of the African American life is residing.
Eatonville, the first entirely black town, which was involved in the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no more as simple as she described in 1935: "Instead of five lakes, three croquets, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, acquiring quay, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a walking place.
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Jezonville festival of Zora! to present the gift of Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city that she described remains aside, even when she made a stop for tourists by includeing it in a florid tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project in the economic crisis.
It's still as independent, dignity and private as it was in the '30s, when Hurston wrote that the rural black people in Florida often resisted and did not share their real feelings with a white man who knows "on us so little that they don't even know what's going on."
Even today, in the year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion on races, many of the inhabitants here remain cautious to the views of foreigners.
"We take great care of how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lives here since the birth and is a member of the oldest felony in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a triumph paradox and effort.
It's like a historic model of black growth, and a community of nearly 2400 people, where poverty rate is double against the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also a shaded example of the Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes admired - which came from American slavery.
It's not too surprising that the inhabitants here are both proud and protective.
And the concerns about the idea of Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way Hurstons are called here.
She presented the world with her hometown through the heart books full of words like "Mules and Men (Mules and Men)" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God (their eyes watched God)" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the florid tourist guide changed the city of pieces into road 17, which leads through a frequently mixed center of Florida, in the scene of the black history and human drama.
With a diversion of a big bubb in her life and in the literature, Hurston’s reader took her to the first Yeonville mayor, Joe Clark, and then turned to more private places.
"Left next to the road," she wrote, "is a white brown decoration of a modern national school with well maintained courts and fields that Howard Miller always cares about, even though he can't read or write."
She also mentioned a new husband of the widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits in the clock hotel."
So, in just a few hundred words, Hurston Eatonville connected with self-authorization, but also with illiteracy, reconsidering marriages and sex.
This apparently wasn't a typical Fodor's carrier.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"The dawn said it the way it was," said ninety-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls' congregation, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang their beauties of the filthy songs.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
He still remembers Hurston as a chiper-school, which she often returned after her family moved to Florida Jacksonville.
Seventeen - year - old Augustus Franklin remembers that mostly when she landed in the city, she arrived in a huge Chevrolete, smoking and wearing pants in the city, which is proud of worthy clothes today.
Most of the inhabitants were fascinated, Franklin said, but a lot of people were screwed up.
"The people of Zora always liked to see," Franklin said.
But, he added, he sneaked on a chair at the back terrace with a view to the lake of Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "with never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor, and her books were removed from the press.
It seemed that Eatonville and the rest of the world forgot about her.
Although she was once a literary star, the current Langstone Hughes and the only blackman at Barnard College in the 20th century, she was buried in an unmarked grave in the Florid Fort Pierce, where she used to live.
There were no bigger sad rituals or public reading in Eatonville.
"I think that neither her meaning for the world nor her reference they understood at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of the biography of Hurston "Wrapped in Rainbows (Packed in spirits) published in 2003.
The change came in the 1980s of the 20th century.
The representatives of the Orange County wanted to stretch the city through a five-trail road instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local bicycle of the main road.
Orland's explosion has already pushed the interstate road No. 4 through the west edge of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still getting out of a complex historical period.
Needed integration, along with other things, ended relatively idilical isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, struggle for the mixing of races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"In that time, a bunch of white boys, they came and threw oranges and things on people who were sitting on the side," Franklin said.
"We had a lady who killed it.
They were walking out of the car meloun."
In the 1955 Journal of The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the requirement of the Supreme Court of Justice for Forced Integration and the decision in the Brown case against the education chamber she declared "for my race it is rather insulting than celebrating."
The inhabitants now claim that the degregation of schools, even though in some areas was positive, has reduced coherence in Eatonville and undermine the courage of this youth.
"The black children were used to hugs - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher tonight," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter Ella Dinkins and the executive director of the Eatonville Community (Safe the Eatonville Community).
It took until the teachers and students came from the same place, she added.
"You don't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher -- I mean, there's a cultural barrier there," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped to create a space for many more Zori Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who like her raised themselves over prejudices with light-conscious self-conscious and quote such as "How can someone vampire the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975 Alice Walker traveled to the unmarked grave of Hurston and began fighting for her reputation.
Five years later, Hurston’s favored biography of Robert E. Hemenway, who reintegned her into the American canon.
The highway project arrived just the moment the most famous daughter of Eatonville recovered the lights of the ramp.
The former neighbours of Hurston now considered her a rescue.
In order to show what can happen to its road, the community began to plan the Hurston festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inauguration action two years later, and every January many return to the party.
The state after a few years was withdrawn from the railway proposal.
"Their five railways were resurrected, you would say it directly exploded a real civil pride," Nathiria said.
Boyd said it simpler, "The dawn saved Eatonville."
Victory on the road project has helped to change the image of the city.
Foreigns like Rachel Munson, a lawyer who started to attend this church in 1993, began to appear in a larger number, and the inhabitants began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville joined the National History Register in 1998.
The new one floor library (naturally named after Hurston) was opened in 2006 on a re-asfalled and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today Eatonville remains a florid anomaly: only six miles from the center of Orland can sometimes act as a west street in summer rain, as small as it was founded with only 27 black families in the 19th century.
(Day is 90 percent black.)
With strangers who come to look for the story and the meaning of Eatonville, they are often treated carefully.
The permission for most interviews is necessary to have predefined and certain things - like wall paintings in the oldest Yeonville church that white people paint and show blacks in the fields - can't be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, courageous, self-determined teacher who likes the red system, still fear that their isolated community will not be well understood.
And even as the Hurston festival increased, home pride has also increased.
Especially young people seek Eatonville to see it as she saw all her race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse and equally proud, creative, workful, foolish and diversity as other American races and ethnics.
From the voice of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, he is aware of the sincere love for the community when he plans to return to Eatonville after high school to work in the local government or in the police he says she would enjoy some help.
And even younger, for example, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kennon, appear to have learned how to describe Eatonville right.
"Well, most people, when they just go through here, think, 'Hm, this city is nothing against the others," said Alondra Kenon recently Sunday after church.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a moment, it's a very nice town."
Here in New York we all speak gas-financial.
At first, nothing has changed here.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the news stations and the giant TV screens on Times Square, they wouldn't realize that they were in the middle of the storm.
They would never agree that in a glass bee of offices over their heads every day bankers and managers of investment funds that monopolize New York, the worst "worst day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers continue to screw metal wheelchairs after the walkers and carry the muffin bakers to breakfast.
The Spanish continue to move between the towers and wear, like human mules, fiftieth of scratched shirts hanging from wagades on their backs.
The office rats are still waiting in front of their morning bagel at the street dining rooms, and it is still not possible to acquire a yellow taxi day between the fourth and seventh afternoon.
It didn't seem like a crisis, until, with all the words of pessimism, I decided to set up on Thursday afternoon a debate account.
Even though I had timed this task to cover up with a late afternoon sit on my local branch JP Morgan Chase, about 20 people were waiting there in the queue.
Not before the treasury windows to pick up or store cash, but before the senior customers order check books, tourists ask for a trip to trade with the mixed goods of Macy's and new customers form accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, as I've learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker", came for the same reason as I did.
But they have already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places where they arrived, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Staten Island.
They chose money from so-called thrifts (a little similar to construction clusters), monetary associations and of those types of communities whose branches operate only in one country, and which claim to care for their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 of these banks had gone down.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets of $327 billion to the audience, and when the New York people returned home on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with assets for $440 billion, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
Workers of offices and businesses who were standing in front of me and fearing another collapse were moving their cash to the bank, which was considered a safe port, which makes most rescue on Wall Street.
The ordinary New Yorkers have learned gas financial in the last week.
Some woman in my local Chinese supermarket talked to her phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, the disturbing bank, and to her ultimate ultimate worker Dick Fuld with such a familyness as she was talking about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, a uniformed 50-year-old household of my ginz, changed the theme of our usual conversation - Brad, Angelina, or my food supply.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I now have my savings in the money market funds.
I moved it, I won't risk it."
Muslim graves degraded after Austrian right fracture
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, from the Austrian right side of Free and Philip Dewinter from the Belgian right party Vlaams Belang attended a manifestation presented in Antverps on Thursday, January 17, 2008, the organization "Mests against Islamization".
They carry the characters similar to the transport marks showing the mixtures overwhelmed by the red line.
The police accuse right extremists of the destruction of the Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend where the right parties have achieved enormous profits in general elections.
Over 90 graves on the cemetery in the city of Traun near Linze were sometimes severely destroyed between Friday night and this morning, and the police are convinced that it was an organized action.
Prosecutors have confronted certain graves of Jewish symbols such as David’s star, but the detectives are convinced that this could be an attempt to mask the motives of extremists leading to hatred to muslim immigrants.
It's not clear whether this incident was connected to the elections.
The speaker of the Islamic communities here said that they were "deeply shocked" by reports of inhumanity that came at the time the end of the Muslim post moon of Ramadan.
Austria, meanwhile, enters the round of searching for its own soul after the traffic went on yesterday's parliamentary elections.
Both extremely right parties who gained together more than 30 percent of the votes, the Free and the Treaty for the Future of Austria, led an anti-immigration campaign, and some of their slogans were convicted as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, Chairman of the Free Party, who won over 18 percent of the votes, protested against the chickens and burglars in the campaign, and even expressed his resistance to foods with a view to the relationship with Islam.
At the last meeting with the voters in Vienna, he talked about the "European Brotherhood" to prevent the rising of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prohibit the construction of minerals and minerals and argument that these are political symbols of islamising Austria and Europe.
The research and analysis carried out immediately after elections that have built extreme right to the position of the strongest political bloc in the country suggest that this change was caused primarily by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter must not travel abroad
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star, who was convicted for sexual abuse of children, forbidden to travel to France and Spain.
The officials issued this six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the monitoring authorities that he plans to travel across France to Spain.
The Kent police was authorized last Thursday after she gave the officials evidence of Glitter's previous judgments for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, named Paul Gadd, was not attended at the lowest criminal court of Ashford in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
He said: "After Thursday 25 September at the lowest criminal court of Ashford, the Kent police asked for a regulation that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the borders to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd didn't attend himself."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wanted to travel to abroad, as it recorded him in the record of sexual attackers.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He also has to transmit the scheduled date of departure to the police a week in advance.
If the obligation to inform the authorities was notified, he could be convicted for five years.
The Kent police announced that they would not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible routes across the district.
Kent's speaker's police said, "The Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our perspective, it is easier to watch someone who stays in Britain because we have broad systems that deal with potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting Kent's people is the highest priority for Kent police and we work carefully to monitor the behavior of recorded sexual attackers so that we can reduce any danger to the public at minimum."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after he spent 27 months in Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well, and he refused to leave London.
The Thai authorities did not let him go through the passport control and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22th, he finally arrived at the heathrow terminal 3 and remained there while his legal representative David Corker went to Uxbridg's lowest criminal court in West London, and at the same time he successfully demanded the order that he had registered as a sexual assaulter.
Glitter was previously imprisoned for the property of child pornography for four months in the United Kingdom.
The source from the Ministry of Interior said that Jacqui Smith, Minister of Interior, is calm and glad that Glitter was prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
"To catch the real nature, I'm photographing a master outside the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No patches, no calls or costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenca, disconnected from focusing on interpretation - just so I'm going to target a relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
On one side of the artist.
For the second, man.
Inseparable, if we pass private, in those moments away from the audience - then a confidential gesture can be seen, a depth summerly caught view, or a passionate gesture of hands that are untreated, because they are not going to come up on the scene.
The German Günther Bauer is in the "Flamenco-people" theatricality of performing with singers, dancers and guitarists with the less familiar face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer composes a unique flamenca iconography of different environments.
The exhibition that takes place within the Moon Photos of Flamenca (Mes de la Photographía Flamenca), "reflects the growing international meaning of flamenca," says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "may be any people, but when you look at the photographs, you will find that these are not typical images of artists on the scene.
These people portrait "on the street" are artists capable of passing passion, sadness, joy... and completely catching the watchers.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to photograph at the stage.
He's wearing his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of flamenco giants.
The enchanted festival "Cante de las Minas" began Bauer in 1997 a long way to portrait flamenc singers, guitarists and dancemen on the desk camera.
These are portraits that, by selecting a camera and material, remind you of a classic photograph.
The application of different styles is in contrast with the classic basis of the image and borrows it with the present spirit, which is the idea that, according to Bauer himself, reflects even flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but does not stop surprise and develop."
What distracts the viewers is not the effect of the dance itself, singing or games, but the personality and character of the artist.
Finding the moment we meet with the most important, the spirit that appears in the way of understanding, being and experience, it was and is the constant work presented during these days in the El Fotoma gallery.
The selection of nearly 70 photographed artists forms known flamenca figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyosová, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales or Vicente Amigo.
The project has become some kind of flamenca anthology and will soon be accompanied by a book edition that will contain exhibited portraits.
The portrait was brought by Bauer two years ago to the idea to repeat the "Portrates of sports veteran" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept of "Flamenco-people" is different, the photographer admits that "foot people, recognize them and have a chance for a moment, whether longer or just short, enter their lives - that's my passion.
I think in the photograph, the portrait is the most burdened genre.
Man meets or contacts people, personalities that he sometimes doesn’t even know or give him a few minutes for photographing.
Despite similar circumstances, I always try to realize my imaginations."
The collection of the current flamenco portraits called "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the Gallery El Photomata in de la Mata 20, equivalent to Alameda de Hercules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confessed that the novel he writes is "fuzzy"
It is played in the environment that he has not yet known, and is talking about events for his unknowns, yet Mario Vargas Llosa is going to successfully implement his new project - he is currently working on a romance whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived 20 years in Congo and traveled in Amazon.
The eternal favor of the Nobel Price for Literature yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia confessed that the project that is currently employing him is "thickness", and that "all conveys that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had reason, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I believe that I will end it once," he finished his contribution to the exchange festival of ideas, thoughts and words that he saw in the city of aquaduct around a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people during four days.
The author of the Romanian "Town and Dogs" was one of the main figures of the third year of the word's celebration and fulfilled the expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival for the favorite writer - old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" - filled the Theatre Juan Bravo in the last place.
With Felix Rome, who said it, he had an excellent audience that had run out like water for an hour - Peruan with amazing exactness and a notable dose of humor, remembering him from the original "incredible adventure" of "the pleasure of a passionful reader" and from the "power to live more than I have lived" produced literary mission; as complemented with the "necessity of inspiration" by writing "disciplinated", carefully repairing and overwriting; or as they influenced his writings, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what "remembering images" are the nose base of his stories.
Hispano-American Romanist admitted that "there is no way", how to find out whether and what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just entertainment, showing experience" -- emphasized Vargas Llos with his opinion that "to people act" and "force them to turn them out from a row," and called the writers to "do not be subjected to frivolousness" and "to take responsibility" of their mission.
Climateology is losing the celebration in Zooblanco - lacks spears
The show with spears closing the celebration in Zooblanco was cancelled yesterday morning after a confirmation of the notifications that the surface of the square is not in good condition.
That's why the company, along with Fermin Bohorquez, Pable Hermos de Mendoza and Leonard Hernandez, decided to cancel the bullshit matches.
The disadvantaged meteorological conditions have been prolonged for a long time, and two of the three celebration could not be fulfilled.
On Saturday, the rain was reduced by the progress of other planned bull games.
During them, the formation of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to build the bikes in the arena at Castillan.
But only on Friday was celebrated.
The winner became Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and rewards for dynamic and estetically quality performance was taken out on his shoulder.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante changed two wounds with a spear for greetings and one ear that brought him rather uncovered seats in the arena than the toreador art.
The worse was El Julia, who walked through the lous Llanos lousy unsallied.
In the second round, he had a sharp criticism since the majority of the population.
They ran checks in Alava in the van with two thousand pounds of hashis
In ten minutes, five.
Road control of Ertzaintz in the city area Armiñon (Alava).
The advocates stop two people riding in the van, and they want them.
The cargo, more than two tons of hashis, is not to stop.
According to the report of the Committee on the Interior of the Basket Government, members persecuted and detained one of the people who were riding in the van, a man age 38, identified as A.A.J.
The detainee was accused of corrupting drugs and fake public documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out road checks on N-1 in places where the border of the city circuit is passed.
They were going to stop the van for control, but the driver didn't follow the instructions, he fastened and slipped.
The cars started raising immediately when the vehicle stopped a few miles away, both passengers jumped up and fled into a forestry rain.
Ertzaintza's suppliers eventually caught one of them and took over 2 178 pounds of hashis, which suspects transported, as it appeared at the surveillance of Iveco Daily's supplies.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with the hash packages that were subsequently transferred to other police departments to detailed drug expertise and respect.
Furthermore, the police found that the registration mark is "discriminated" and does not agree with the data set out in the supplies documents, which was therefore detained, was also accused of fake public documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for the second suspect, who, as mentioned earlier, managed to escape so as to finally be able to determine the origin of the drug taken.
The detained A.A.J., 28 years old, was transferred to the police department to settle appropriate formalities before it comes to another investigation later.
Hero Heather Locklear detained at the ride under the influence of medicinal products
Hero Heather Locklear, favorite Amanda from Melrose Place series, was detained this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for a ride under the influence of drugs.
The Witness saw her performing extraordinary maneuvers when she tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito, told the magazine People speaking of California road patrols.
The witness stated that about 16.30 a.m. Locklear "whispered on the gas, dried in front and back and tried to get out of the parking site -- she took the sunglasses several times when she was moving. "
The witness, who didn't know the actress at first, saw Locklear a moment after stopping on the nearby road and leaving the vehicle.
This person also warned the rescue service because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found an actress inside the vehicle that partially blocked the cart.
"She seemed disoriented," and that's why the members took her to a specialized drug and alcoholic center to be subjected to the test.
According to the police speaker, the actress worked together and the excessive amount of alcohol was excluded again, yet "we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication, which was obvious to the officers at first sight."
Locklear was detained for suspicion of the management under the impact of the unspecified substance and was taken into custody at approximately 19.00, even though she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from the treatment clinic, where she was recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists on the IU of the angels to apply its powers in the cause of Silva
General IU head and Member of the United Nations left Gaspar Llamazares today informed that the final decision in the cause of the former Council board of Youth and the sports of the city in Seville Francisca Manuela Silva, who left the office last week after he was accused of the proceedings for the benefit of his family, will depend on the regional association of the party.
"I'm a too much federalist, it's an angelic organization to apply its powers," the Llamazares noted the negotiations to which the party will have to step towards the former member of the Sevil City Council.
The Chief of the IU, however, insisted that in the case of an investigation of the illegal proceedings that Silva has committed, it is essential "transparency": "IU has always been fighting for such matters to be maximally transparency."
He also emphasized that the party has a "strict ethical code for all public functions".
"Coat Blood" ('Sangre de Mayo'), Garcia's epic bet
José Luis Garci in the "Battle Blood" film (Sangre de Mayo), for which he was inspired by the National History of Benita Pérez Galdose, rebuilds the famous rebellion of Spain against the French -- it is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of about 15 million euros.
In this way, the film creator wanted to "implement the expression of figures and analyses of society", which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría during the presentation of the picture before the large team of interpreters.
May's blood with a metrage over two and a half hours will be placed in the movies this Friday, and in the future, more than four-hour television series for Telemadrid.
As a great fan of the literary of Galdose José Luis Garci claims that the film fulfilled the "child dream" for which Esperanza Aguirre owed him three years ago for the Autonomous Province of Madrid authorized the photo of the twoth anniversary of Madrid on May 2th, he accepted the offer that the history would come from the Episode of the National past.
The budget of 15 million, fully contributed to the Madrid Province, means Garcia's "one opportunity" to create an environment with the cultures and costumes corresponding to the image of "Spain Shooting, which was wrong in the leader for whom it was to fight - the fight for independence led by the Government of Ferdinand VII to the decline and remaining state," he said.
But the director regrets that he can't count on the financial support that had received from the films The Sad wing (Ala triste) or Goy's spirits - almost double of the May's blood - so he couldn't record some scenes from the scenario signed at the same time by Horace Valcarcel, with which he works almost throughout his film road.
The film director "Begun again" (Volver and Empezar) works as usual - on the scene along with the actors with whom he usually does not choose by casting, because it seems "happy" and also believes that "the part of the director's call is, inter alia, to go to the theatre and kine, and so find out what happens in the artwork he's dealing with".
Many of the actors chosen for May's Blood are already appearing in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellan, Carlos Larrañaga, or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Garci with four nominations to Oscar, one of whom he gained, is the view that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the same Blood of May, the Seven tables of the French Billyard and the last chosen Blind Sun, represents the young generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that "this is only going to appear".
Garcia doesn't expect any appreciation for this movie.
"You think at first you're working for what's going to happen, but then you'll realize that you're only working for money, so you'll be able to do another additional movie," Garcia explains with more than 30-year-old director career.
Isabel Bayon is renewing a spiritual reference to the Seville Dancer of Tortola Valencia
Sevill's flamenca dancers will give up hold of another Seville dance.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, from the father of Catalonce (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusanka (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the neighborhood of Trian, and when she was three years old, she and her family moved to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on the oriental dance.
She experienced a life full of passion, a pioneer of a woman's emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a buddhist and vegetarian and struggled for the cancellation of the corzet that prevented women to move freely.
The life of this woman affected by the dance and esthetic revolution of the Isabel Bayon International Europe.
"I wanted to work with Pepo Gamboa, and she designed this figure -- it seemed unbelievable."
According to the dancers, "we're not talking about her life, it's about the perception of the soul.
The names of her dance shows reminded me of flamenco rhythms.
So "baby dance" educated my guajira or "the dance of the snake" some tanga.
Her dance was sensitive and they told me that my dance of this esthetic was also answering," she said.
The presentation is counted by the involvement of two exceptional personalities: with Miguel Vedu, who will sing in one show as well as in "Open Doors" (La Puerta Aberita), and with Matilde Coral's Dance Teacher, who made an exception and joined her former chair.
"Matilde represents the senior Tortol, a mature figure.
I'm happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honour to me."
It also counts on music and guitars of Jesus Torres and Paca Arriagy, with the singing of Miguel Ortegy, el Pulgy and Moi de Moron; El Pajara, viola Rafa El Violy and collaboration of the Juanfry Juarez actors, "which is the role of an eternal guide of this kind of artist who are primadons with all and who are always in love with them."
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, which took place at such remote places as India, the United States or Russia, as well as all over Europe, because she usually stayed in London.
"I wanted to remind her, because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at some time, but no one knows her today and then less appreciates her creation," Bayon says.
The show begins today at 20:30 at the Lope de Vegy theatre.
The book "The New Married Day" closes the trienales
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of "The Newly married Day" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jimenez concluded a marriage with Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the programme coordinated by the Culture Council of the Autonomous Andal Government to celebrate "Trienale Zenobie and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized in order to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel price for literature and the anniversary of their death.
"Trienale Zenobia and Juan Ramón" is about to end with the new edition of this work, an international convention to be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel Museum House and the travel exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: One sunshine", which was opened in May this year, and after rounding the various angelic provinces, it should be moved to New York, according to plans during the congress.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalian Government also ordered eight hundred prints of "The freshly married Day" edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue to spread awareness of personality and the works of one of the world's anddolescent poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like herself so much anymore.
"God sometimes creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of the actress Sally Field, who cooperated with him on "No evil intention" and under the weight of awareness that Newman left, reveals his unhappy vision of the abandoned American movies and all of America.
Look at how long it took them to get Oscar.
And that he was retired since 2007.
And that it was known he was hardly sick.
Still, he was a boy for everyone.
"Every time what a person feels can't be expressed in no way, and I've lost a great friend now," Robert Redford said in the tears, "my life and my country were better because of it."
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or exaggerating.
The father of the film and the country died, especially in the dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, when American self-consciousness is at the bottom of the day when they desperately seek reasons for pride.
When the time is rough and people without virtue and just a bunch of those who are worth your admiration, you don't need to be Louis Cernud to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, he had almost a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a warrior for losing and winning cases, from the drug addiction foundation based on the honour of the firstborn son who died of overdose until his own sign of domestic food and biofood.
A full treasure for the country that cost a lot of effort to forgive self-suicide food culture.
The stormless wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, said that there was not one man who died, but a whole era.
Another Englishman, Oskar's director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was a top of his career.
Bad boy from Australia, Russell Crow, to mark Newman's trouffle as his biggest source of inspiration.
"This leather gave us all a pretty high patch," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the small ones who today have the courage to try to live like Paul Newman -- based on honesty and leads a serious private life away from cameras.
It's not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But fortunately, they are such people and Paul Newman is their model.
He divorced once, and since then he was married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, although he had more than enough opportunities to not be.
"Why should I go out to the hamburger when I have a filet at home?" he liked to joke.
Let him in heaven be proud of the conversion of his daughters and admirers on earth - in America, it is not too common.
They say, "of all the great roles he has made, he was the most proud of the role of a loyal husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a sacrificed filantrop."
Imperfect races in Olympic Madrid
Yes, many of us want the Olympiade to be held in Madrid, and after the unsuccessful year 2012, it may be 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we're going to run the race yesterday, I'm saying no!
He was spoken as a perfect race, and according to my judgment, he was the worst I've ever been on.
Such a dream of nonsense that right now, if there was an evaluation and I was testing, it would be clear insufficient.
But let's take a look at it from the beginning, pretty one by one.
The nonsense begins with a race number that makes a man run early.
That doesn't seem bad to me, but when a man goes there, let him give him everything (including a chip that is to prevent the overcompletion of the road).
Oh, no.
Here a man must first pick up a number (first nonsense, go there only for it) and (after the queue) what a surprise! - they had only a shirt of size S (second nonsense, because I need the size of XL).
Where do we live?
It's because of the crisis they decided to buy only small shirts because it's less substances and they're cheaper?
Okay, well, that's a little bit compared to what was happening on the race day.
Besides that it had to go very soon for the chip and the front insisted on it for more than 15 minutes, it had to give up the bag there.
For more than 35 minutes, it took a waiting time, which is on the race where 11,000 people are expected, something incredible.
So, as it was expected, the race started, and we haven't put the bags yet, and when it was done, it was much worse with the pickup.
Furthermore, the waiting extended 40 minutes of rain, leading to a general rebellion and attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will be inflammated tomorrow, and some like me will not show the right time in assessing the results due to the chip they gave me and which, I suppose, I have not seen the right start time.
Of course, if someone asked me about some perfect race, this one wouldn't have thought of me.
So I think we're gonna have to keep a well-prepared Olympic city alone.
Microsoft searches for reception (virtual)
At a conference on new MIT technology, Microsoft presented further development in a new system of recognition of images and human interactions in the way of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but capable of performing basic activities as calling taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger that would move throughout the company area) and see what he hears in the interview.
Thanks to the camera and the system that recognizes forms and faces, this "reception" can find out how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand keywords of their conversations.
He can also dilute the present according to the conversation groups.
In the demonstration video, the reception records a third person and understands that it is not part of the group that speaks to it and that it is not a company employee.
She's asking her if she's going to see someone, and she tells her she'll be dedicated to her in a moment.
It's all without a blue dying screen.
Fascinating.
But of course it's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, for example, a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, there was a lot of talk about changing the Microsoft strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers had only the most necessary, without the burden of commercial inconvenience, they would be five times more powerful - man, Steve, they would be cheaper.
Recognize as a bunch when we consider that Microsoft version of the version adds new functions to Windows and another "extra".
The change in direction would be a merit.
Microsoft is right, the operating system slowly loses its meaning and is also software.
When Google Chrome showed up on the network, I became one of those who joined the theory that it was the first Googlu step to compete with Windows.
Many have legally indicated that the browser is not a operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the necessary layer to understand between the hardware and the software.
He has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to the patience.
That's true.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think about the "death" of the operating system not as absolute truth, but relative to the truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system and on the contrary to more Internet browsers.
The computer is enabled to launch Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time every day on the Internet than around the windows.
What are half of the applications that carry out the system for?
There's less.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less hard, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here I have a little example.
I made this photo in one resort for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the drink machine that asked them to use their search tools: "Your search, our future."
In 2006, independent studies showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used to search on Google.
By the way, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed last week.
Not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, let's count until 2010.
In Microsoft, they will certainly try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone becomes more computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay for the delays of the expense.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso was wearing it on the Azurove coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one lighted in Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond, as well as Al Pacino in "Kmotro" Francis Ford Coppoly, and is also part of the muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle community uniform.
And if we want to go into the number of his life roles, we can go to the image of a typical muscle with a short wrist that raises the acts in the carriage circus.
It's basically nothing more than a typical cotton underwear, suitable and without gloves.
The English speakers call him "tank", but Le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels is emerging over all the others.
First of all for his crushed name - even when it is humanly called 'Marcel' - which is related to sport, because, as the legend says, it was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singing Edith Piaf.
"Marcel" emerges over other quality cottons, unisex cuts, distinguished shields and (almost not known) a belgic flag, which models have the most embellish tiles as a detail at the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company doesn't specialize only to tank tops.
He's also making mickey college, retro boxers, cashmir sweater sweater, cotton pants, marine shirts, children's clothes, mini shorts...
Thinked pieces for comfortable underwear.
Even though it's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother, and whoever will be a father, I don't care."
The great image of her sister did not stop her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, even though the small figures, is a woman full of life.
The new acts in the fashion are taking Cruz's sisters very seriously.
For Monica, it means much more than just that some beautiful, famous girls borrow their name.
In Paris, the promotion activities that Mango organized in its new seat were attended, and the announcement of the most important fashion prices that this Spanish company sponsors.
She's heartless and irregular, and she gets you close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce a new collection that we proposed to Sister Penelope for Mango for this year's autumn-winter season, and also attended the announcement of the second year of "Mango Fashion Awards" and the dinner in Opera for Valentina's honour.
So it was a difficult day, but at the same time an exciting day.
What's your new collection for Mango, for which you're working for the fourth season?
I and my sister loved movies from the '50s and '60s, and we pulled a lot of incentives.
I also love to go around the city and watch women walk dressed, combine their clothes and layers, and I do it very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, designer, so you're a very universal woman, right?
I think so, but at the end, it's all connected and has a lot of connections.
Maybe I liked the clothes from a little bit, I still wanted to go to my grandmother, talk in my aunt's closets and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation. It was almost better than going to a leak.
When I became a danceman, I always tried to look after how I was walking dressed.
You know that we dancers are based on how we're adjusted to feel good at our watches and tests in view of the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, you really get into the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionals.
You've been 30, you've been in a crisis lately?
No, I don't.
I feel better than ever before, I'm having 30 fun.
I find out that a woman's already done, she has experience, and she enjoys less mistakes.
I'm not scared of biological hours.
I've been doing what I want, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course I know I'm going to be a mother because my body asks, and I want to be a young mom, and I don't want to miss it.
With regard to my father, I'm not worried about it.
But one thing I know is, I'm gonna make my child feel happy and I'll raise him with great love.
With regard to the movie, you've got a few premiers of movies that you've taken last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to coming to the movies.
I'm from the theater world, so I'm very impatient and uncomfortable, I want everything right now, and of course it's not possible.
I'm looking forward to the Prime Minister "La ultima mountain" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see how you like them...
A few days ago, you had your premiere on the show moll by Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'd go up on a molo like a model.
Only called me Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and invited me to London to attend the beneficial show for her organization "Women for Better Life" and the clothes we've played -- I've also chosen two models from our collection for Mango -- and it was irritated, and the journey was transferred to this Naomin non-governmental organization.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
A lot of things are talking about her, and since I know her, I can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'll stick to the good thing he's engaged in.
She asked me to play for charity purposes, but if she asks me to make a stand, I'll do it too.
For the sake of women of the third world, I will do what it takes.
The drivers will have to install "alcolock" with alcohol in their blood repeatedly.
The Ministry of Interior requires that the driver with three administrative sanctions for the management under the influence of alcohol in his car install a system that prevents him from launching a drunk car or if he does not breathe.
The proposal has already been introduced in June this year and is now already included in the annual report of the High State Representative, according to which it is a pilot project that takes one year.
His aim is to restore the driver to the wheel, so the drivers will also have to graduate the transport overcome course.
In addition to this experience, the National Transport Safety Authority (DGT) and the Fundation of the Technological Institute for Car Safety (FITSA) will also participate.
According to statistics between 30 and 75 % of the cars accused more than once for drunken management again in this state shall be used as a volunteer.
Alcolock should prevent this, as it is a system attached to a vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the breathed air and prevents the start of the car if the driver does not breathe before or if it is recorded higher than the authorised alcohol concentration.
His price exceeds 1,000 euros and it would have to be paid by the guilt himself.
The study carried out in this sense in the United States in 2007 showed that for vehicles equipped with this equipment, during the first year since the introduction, the offences were reduced by 65 %.
In Spain, 115 people could be saved every year.
The measures shall be limited to the administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behavior before it becomes a criminal act.
In order to help its introduction, as legal adjustments can be implemented normally, the necessary amendment of criminal provisions requires a change in the law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in no sales version, even though some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles have already been already installed.
Tomorrow, the Congress will vote on the PSOE proposal (Spain Workshop Socialist Party), in which it is recommended to install this system in school buses, as it is in France.
In Mexico and no "peeptoes"
With British precision, at 17:40 as it was in the program, the presidential hangar landed at Benita Juarez Airport in Mexico D. F. A plane of Spanish air forces, where the Prince and Princess from Astury landed.
The sun just went down, but his lights still had to cover their eyes so that the next couple could be seen coming out of the plane.
The Spanish Ambassador and other officials were standing under the resignation.
A few hours ago, I asked a taximan on the street if he knew that the Spanish prince and the princess were coming to a public visit.
- Yeah, well, that's great, it's not gonna get to the airport to pick up people, she's out of here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she's been living here for a few years.
- Yeah, that's...
However, the Mexican press knows well who the princess and the princess of Asturia are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting at the hangar at the airport close to the red carpet and the military cordone, which forms 27 sea soldiers ready to shoot the honourable salve.
The Prince appears with a smile on lips in a dark blue color suit and a princess, very mediumly dressed and with sharp hair, has no common "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that in D.F. a storm threatens.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegation is waiting, they smile on photographers and unforceablely spot them.
At the door of the hotel, one of the four largest in the city, a Mexican television reporter is waiting for them.
Best funded fashion price
There is probably no more suitable place in the world to announce the fashion price than Paris and probably not a better designer and bonvivana than Valentino.
The company Mango just announced the second year of El Boton-Mango Fashion Awards to allow international presentation to new fashion talents.
The price is attached to the amount of 300 000 euros.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of the first year's year, last night viewed her proposals in Manga's exhibition at the Paris Bullwar No. 54 and almost cried with an impression.
Of course, it is the second largest business of this company in Europe and has just been opened on the surface of 1,335 square metres.
The biggest is in London.
Many events, together with the desire to thank Valentine's designers for having taken the presidency of the jury's competitive jury, caused us to eventually have dinner in Paris Opera Garnier.
The famously decorated chairman table looked next to the most famous Chagall's works even more amazing.
Nati, who had broken hearts of grief because of the recent death of her brother, did not show anything, had dressed this label and ELAH jewelry over whom the breath was secreted, and hung to her son Luise - almost two-foot elegant - accompanied Valentine at the table at dinner at his honour.
Andik, the boss and the owner of Mango, was welcomed, and as a gentleman, he remained with baron Rothschild without his sack, because they both offered them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who arrived in a store in - own-handed - pants and shirts and for dinner, changed into long black sexy dresses, touched the night walk after Opera at the escort of Goya Toleda, showed us a ballet test room and, remembering the other time, caught one of the sticks and marked "grand bee".
Ines Sastre didn't hold the palace on a search, but before she left, she showed us photos of her son on her cell phone.
On the other day of the morning, we could love the presence of Olivier Martinez - another young man riding on a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who came to the Paris Hotel with his own dress and towels and asked for no smell in his rooms.
Stars under the star Paris sky.
Oh làl, c'est la vie.
1001 - anti-contress number
Not 1,000, but 1,000 plus one way to forget about a chaotic and creepy daily life.
And so that it is not small, they are all summarized in one book that will bring relaxation to the book on September 30th.
The wake bells every morning at 7 a.m. as a punishment, but worse is to imagine itself absorbed in a rapid rhythm that brings current life.
The office is called tension and computer pain in the back.
Stress is a sickness of the 21st century.
However, there are no ways to combat daily exhaustion and difficulty getting away from the world of work.
No, that number is nothing bigger and nothing less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott outside the yogine position, classic massages and "spa" therapy on the pages of her book gathered all "menu" options adjusted by the taste and time options of each individual.
The Protitress book is called "1001 Relaxation Method" and thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK will bring peace to the bookshop.
If someone feels that there is no way to achieve peace in such areas as work or personal relations, the "manual" denies this view.
Furthermore, it offers further procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you don't have adrenaline in your veins that re-establishs the balance and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, disable and focus on reading.
Speaking of sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they're sleeping.
When it happens first, it may be frightening you, but it's actually irrelevant.
It's an inadequate sleep disorder called somniloquia.
She's quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely not one of you were told that he was talking from sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (e.g. once in life at high fevers), or with more regularity (each day, once a week, once a few months...), the second day the child remembers nothing.
There's not only one reason that would explain her occurrence.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, nightmares, enuresis nightturna (noc aid) or moonlight, but it must not be so.
As mentioned earlier, many of them may be accompanied by very high fever, stress, or explosive situations.
In any case, it's a little tested phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a quiet voice, speak individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (crying, crying, long speeches...).
In cases in which they show great strength, it would be appropriate to observe and consult an expert to see if he has no problem that causes great anxiety and thus expresses his concern.
We said that it was a harmless disorder, so it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep breakdown that can be treated (e.g. if it is associated with apnea syndrome or with permanent stress).
However, we can do so that we will have a few very simple preventive measures in mind, such as:
Try not to disturb the child too much before he goes to sleep.
So to seek peaceful games and avoid fearful or rather violent television programs or series.
In very nervous children and those who can relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep calmly.
When somniloquia appears, try to stay calm.
Remember that she is harmless for the child and that the other day she will not remember anything.
Useful tips
Don't wake him.
It's unnecessary because it's not conscious and you're going to stop him from sleeping.
Even when he speaks, he's sleeping, and he's resting.
Remember, if you seem to have a lot of trouble, it would be appropriate to ask for advice or to find out what causes such anxiety in your child.
If you understand what he says, avoid the temptation to question him and draw information from him.
It won't be helpful, because when he's asleep, he's not aware that he can arrange thoughts.
Besides, you will hear what he says, but you don't know what he thinks about, and why he says it, so be careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you're making.
Never tell the child that you can ask him about his secrets at night.
Not funny.
It's caused great anxiety.
Don't just worry, it's nothing wrong, it's just an episode that only takes a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeuseurn finally after a long thin period again found a way to win.
Without playing a great game, the yellows have created more chances and could win one of them.
The game did not have a confrontation in which the attackers were just hard to prosecute, too fast.
After the first attempt of the captain guests Kauffmann, who shot from the distance only about the hair passed the connection, he began to have Illhaeurern lightly above and first Fonderflick from the distance, then Hirne air, Romain on a long leg or also Diebold gradually came to irritate Dannemaria defence.
On the contest, the competitor built a defensive wave in the half of the field and left only agil Riahi.
The beginning of the second half appeared as a decisive, first due to two Dannemaria's chances with the names of Riahi and Temporal, then after the opening of the Illhaeurern score, which Marais took care of, well-situated for the processing of the ball reflected after the previous Diebold attempt (53').
However, the Golman Illhaeusern had not enjoyed much joy for some twelve minutes, he was forced to return to his dressing room and leave his colleagues in a weakness.
But Dannemaria couldn't get out of it and 11 of Illhaeurern, who just took a little off to "gass" defense, no longer caused any more trouble, except for the entire last seconds of the fight, when the ball after a great confusion flew very close to March.
Sarkozy goes in the face of angry fishermen
Before leaving to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a ride through Bretanj.
In order to face the demonstration of the force of the fishermen who have severely violated the availability of several Breton and Normand ports on Monday, the French President decided to go to Guilvinic port in Finistère to meet their representatives there.
The last named promised that he would be adopted "in a constructive spirit" and hoped "to come with specific proposals".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the "crisis committee" meeting established by the Breton fishermen with a view to obtaining measures against the rapid increase in oil prices that have reached the top of a range of €1.14 per litre.
According to the speaker of the Elysean Palace, David Martinon will "have to talk to them about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better ensure the conditions of employment and sailing mariners".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to fishers with inadequateness.
On Tuesday morning, they performed an operation "Helmage" in Morbihan and Calvados departments, causing a 10 km closet.
The recreation port in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-àla were not interrupted.
A filter barracks was carried out on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The Navy have proved their determination already on Monday, when at the dawn before the storages of the shipments of ports in Brest and Lorinth burned tyres and palettes, while in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc were demonstrations.
The movement extended to other ports on the coast of Atlantic and Manche channel, like Sables d'Olonne in Vendee, where traulers remained in the port, or to Le Havru, where about 20 ships blocked the operation of commercial ships.
The fishermen from Turball and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique during the evening stopped the blocking of the important raphineries Total in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they eventually decide to act to the ministerial meeting.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" on Tuesday is to decide how to continue on the approached journey and to participate in the prepared meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the State fishing committee, which did not support their movement.
"The stop will continue" because "the fishermen will not let go from nothing" and "they don't want to get to Paris," said, for example, Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorinth Fisheries Committee.
The fishermen of the boat that do not pay oil tax are currently approximately 50 cents per litre, however, believe that the boat's profitability threshold is achieved only when oil is below 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman Great
Unforgettable representative "Butche Cassidy and Kida" died as a result of cancer at 83 years of age in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes presented the legend of the film and the politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at 83 years of age.
Embraer maintains its supplies for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft producer relies on the van of 215 aircraft this year, through the threat of the recession that is rising over the world economy.
The fourth air constructor in the world, Embraer, maintains its supplies for 2008 with 215 applied devices, confirmed by his President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer added 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian constructor promises much from the Chinese market, especially on the scope of its planes from 30 to 120 seats.
To this day, Embraer added 41 instruments to Chinese clients within eight years.
They say the AIG considers 15 % of its assets
The American International Group insured by the American Monetary Authority is considering to move over 15% of its assets to pay $85 billion given to him as a reservation, says the Sunday Financial Times issue.
AIG is ready to examine the sale of most of its activities outside the life insurance in the international field and retirement activities in the United States, specifying a journal quoting the sources of close to the ongoing negotiation.
According to FT, the Administrative Board met on Sunday during the evening to examine the eventual approach.
AIG could not be obtained from any confirmatory declaration.
Activities that AIG is going to exclude include its branch of air leasing International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the insurance insurance provider of Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of real estate and investment in private equity, is provided by the FT.
No final decision on these steps has yet been taken, FT continues.
AIG must quickly obtain cash in order to pay the loan of 85 billion, provided by the Federal Reserve Bank, with the risk that the US authorities will have 80 % of the capital, which will at the same time distribute to the proper ratio of the current shareholders.
Paris. Analysis of the historical meeting Morning Meeting
The New York Bureau recorded a history decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, which is an unseen loss nearing 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777,68 points at 10.365.45 points.
The biggest point failure in his history (about 684,81 points) recorded on September 17, 2001, on the day of renewal of the trade after the terror attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index with the prevailing technological component lost, according to definitive data after the completion of the trade, 199,61 point and fixed at 1 983,73 and the expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 fell by 8,81 % (i.e. 106.85 points) at 1 106.55 points.
A discontinued since the beginning of the session, Wall Street literally failed after the unexpected rejection of the plan for the rescue of the Banks of Representatives, a plan that was to allow the markets to be recovered with a little stability.
228 votes against and 205 for representatives refused to provide the Secretary of State Treasury to Henry Paulson the means he asked for.
Two Republicans of three rejected his plan.
"It is a bad signal sent to the market that sees that Congress is unable to adopt a plan," Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial believes.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added and expressed concerns that the project adopted in a few days would not come "too late".
"If this project is really condemned to fail..., the chafet will be immediately transferred to the Fed (American Central Bank, Rect. Red.) and to the other central banks to explode the crisis, which would more reinforce credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, head of the Global Insight Economy.
And with the emphasis on the urgent situation, Piegza stated that in the United States, "every new day brings down one financial institution".
After the Friday crash, Washington Mutual organized the bank's bank-based activities by Wach's rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly revolved and demanded immediate intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which suggests that markets are not dealing "only with the American crisis, but with the world crisis", analyst from FTN Financial added.
Shore of bonds has grown strongly.
The commodity rate for 10 years dropped to 3.632% on Friday night, 3.827%, 30 years to 4.161% compared to 4.357% of the previous day.
Obama won on points in the first TV duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House followed the second debate, whose task was to find out who John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The commanding states of the Republicans and Democrats were not surprised when they both declared their victory in a television duel watching a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that the performance of John McCain, as appropriate, was not "brilant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before presidential elections, decline in research.
The Gallup's Institute, whose public opinion survey issued on Saturday, gives Obama five points (49% vs. 44% for McCain), believes that the democrat is the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters that are currently concerned, Obama is a winner for 39% questioned, while, according to the CBS research, 25% contributes to McCain's victory.
Obama should be able to confirm its leadership on Thursday by means of an alleged good performance of his co-candidate Joseph Biden, during the first and at the same time, the only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's talented," Bill Clinton noted, however, on the weekend.
The seventy-seventh McCain systematically raised his unsupporting experience in foreign policy fields, while stressing the "naivity" of his rival in the questions that formed the core of the first conflict.
"Seems Senator Obama didn't understand... that there was a repeated accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to become president," he also assured.
In such a spirit of attack, they have been brought from yesterday to the Republican television spot.
On the contrary, Obama stressed that he represented the future.
He didn't lose his head, and he turned out to be short and precise.
He raised his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama yes," he answered the democratic spot on the weekend, which counts that the Republican does not take sufficiently into consideration the impact of the crisis on the "permanent American".
"When the ninety-minute debate of John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday before 20,000 people gathered at the North Carolina's electoral meeting as a rain.
He didn't even say words as "medium-class" or "working." The financial distribution clearly benefits Obama, which the Americans consider more eligible to save the economy on the edge of the ruin.
"The next week could be a crucial turn," the influenced democratic Senator Charles Schumer estimated yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama with the "economic transparency" that Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis in 1998.
For a candidate of democrats, the current disaster is "the final verdict of eight-year-old bad economic policy, as George Bush operated and supported by Senator McCain".
The Senator from Illinois reaffirmed that, through the unexpected Wall Street jumps, it should be able to reduce the taxes of 95% of the Americans, and also warned that the realization of the country's eventual energy independence by promoting renewable energy sources is its priority number one, together with the introduction of the health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates carefully avoided issues relating to the plan of financial assistance of $700 billion (470 billion euros), which was adopted by the Congress last night and which is strongly unpopular.
"What are you, have you noticed that there were some choices in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday night at the main square of Belarus' capital to reject the results of parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarus gathered on Sunday night immediately after closing the election rooms at the main square in Minsk to protest against the irregularity of elections to Parliament.
Although no results have yet been announced, many young people have come to protest against the regime of President Lukašenk: "dictator, demision".
Some admit that they didn't even say, "What would it be if they were doing what they wanted with my voice anyway," said one young man.
It is not believed that this regime, which has acted favourably to foreign observers with a view to renewing negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to turn towards democracy.
The sanctions, among which the prohibition of visas for 40 white-rusian seeds and the freezing of certain assets, could be cancelled if the elections are considered to be pure.
It wasn't the opposition.
"We were kept away from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the summary of votes," complained Juri Potemkin, speaker of the Union of Democratic Forces, a variety of the twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change," stressed Alexandr Millinkievic, former opposition candidate in the presidential elections in 2006, and the leadership of the pro-European movement, "because it is important who counts the votes, and it is a powerful power in us.
If any opposition Members get into Parliament, it will be appointed and not elected.
However, their entry into Parliament may mean a television, a meeting in the regions and draft laws."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in political functioning, because "the dialogue with the European Union is needed to be launched.
Because if our economy, deeply owed by Russia, comes to a crisis and we will not reform ourselves, it threatens us to become a Protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, who monitored the elections, shall not declare the elections valid.
It stresses that the participation seems to be too high and that the general introduction of early votes (26% of the voters in Minsk) has opened the path to all possible manipulations.
"What are you, have you noticed that there were any choices?" the social-democratic leader Alexandr Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was no leg in the electoral rooms.
And there will be at least five opposing Members in Parliament, those who most agree with the regime."
The night's silence has been regained by the October Square.
On TV, President Lukašenko and members of the Central Election Commission are congratulating on their success.
Interview - Blood that is sure again
Hema-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of the foundation yesterday and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly rejoiced, since Hema-Québec became one of the most reliable and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
First of all, he regained confidence in the public, which was seriously shaken after the scandal with contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, the state blood reserve managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Committee was contaminated by the virus of immune deficit (HIV) and the hepatitis virus of type C.
In view of this drama and the wave of disappointment, the Canadian Government began a public investigation in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which was intended to explain the circumstances that led to such tragedy, and to formulate recommendations that such a disaster should not be repeated.
While Judge Crever deployed the report, some provinces introduced a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Québek, Gélinea's committee took this role.
After Gélineau and Krever's report, two suppliers in Canada were established: Hema-Québec, who was supposed to provide Québec, and the Canadian blood company for supplying all provinces and both territories.
"When Hema-Québec started his activities in 1998, barely 38% of people had confidence in the québec blood system," Dr. Décary recalls.
"The situation was embarrassing.
With a consistent effort to increase the safety of blood products and the continuous work in this area over the next years, we have regained confidence in the public," he says and he proudly adds that at the beginning of 2008 Hema-Quebek trusted almost 94% of the québec population.
Dr. Décary, however, does not lose from the sight that "true is something very fragile."
Hema-Québec has already applied the principle of caution since its establishment on 28 September 1998.
"Then we were witnessed in Europe in many cases of human illness of crazy cows, new varieties of disease called Creutzfeldt-Coob's disease," said a woman leading by the company since its establishment of 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could spread with blood.
We were therefore based on one of the basic recommendations of Krever's and Gélineau's report, according to which when we do not know and when there is a serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jacob's disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, must be taken exclusive measures.
In April 1999, we therefore rejected the blood of people who have stayed in the United Kingdom for more than one month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that this disease was transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that it had a sense to stick to the principle of caution."
In 1999, a much more precise technique for the detection of HIV: tests using Nucleus (NAT) that allow the donor blood to reveal directly the presence of the virus itself, not the presence of antibodies on which the tests were used earlier.
The NAT tests have reduced the deaf period that occurs between the patient's infection and the moment our blood techniques may be discovered by the first virus, explains a specialist.
We were able to reduce this period for less than a week.
We have intentionally reduced the risk that some donors could be infected without knowing that and without finding out.
This improvement has significantly reduced the risk of AIDS through blood transfusion.
The risk of getting the blood contaminated HIV is exposed to one of the 12 million people today.
"In other words, it means that before someone gets HIV, 12 million blood products will be distributed.
Given that Hema-Québec distributes 400 000 to 500 000 blood products annually, it will take 24 years before the first case of transmission of HIV through blood product occurs.
I think we can get in complete calm today or prescribe blood transfusion necessary to heal," said Hema-Quebek's head.
"The call for the next decades is to keep our products safe.
We never know what an illness element can occur in the system.
Last year, a chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which is similar to the Western Nile virus transmitted to blood by insect stabbing.
It must be constantly careful," continues Dr. Décary and stresses that, in addition to safe supplies, Hema-Québec must also count on supplies sufficient.
"The need grows because the population is getting older.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or blood platelets.
The ageing of the population has also consequences for the network of blood donors, which is in the average only 3% of Québecans allowed to donate."
Each healthy person is at least 18 years old, corresponding to the criteria of permission, but he can only give blood once in 56 days, which means six times a year.
14% of the people offering blood is not accepted in the average because they are, for example, AIDS or malaria, and if they visit the country where the winters are planted, they are excluded for one year.
"We can maintain a condition with these 3% that meets the needs of hospitals.
Failures are very rare.
Members of the donors' network should, however, be complemented in moderate ways of ageing and no longer can provide blood.
However, persuading people to give blood is difficult, especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so untied today that we can only find an hour so we can donate blood," Francene Décary will conquer.
With the annual budget of 297 million dollars Hema-Québec delivers not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplantation, heart cloth, eye bulves and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before they are stored in Hema-Quebek, which also manages the only public blood bank from the puppy rope in Québek.
The puppy rope that has previously been considered biomedical waste is poured with blood rich on tribal cells that may serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated our thousands of blood samples from the puppy rope to the bank and we assume that we will take them over a thousand a year.
At the beginning of the next year, we should start offering them for transplantation," states Dr. Décary, which program of blood collection from the puppy rope describes as a very favorite program.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they have no access to it," because Hema-Québec does not have enough resources to offer this complex and expensive program to all hospitals in Québek.
Football - Impact in semifinal
Impact Montréal last night at the Saputo stadium during the second and simultaneously decisive game of the quarterfinal game played at the total number of gates qualified in a semi-final round of the first division of the USL, thanks to victory 3:1 (4:3 is a goal balance at both matches) over Sounders from Seattl.
An advocate Antonio Ribeiro gave a decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the two sideless first half visited the host David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, the remaining two goals of the montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could deal with Matt Jordan for Sounders.
Recall that on Friday during the first of the two quarterfinal matches, Impact suffered in Starfire Complex in Tukwila at the Seattlu's predecession 2:1.
The Impact will measure in the semifinal with Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder equipped in the home game deficit 3:1 and finally won 4:3, however, Whitecaps went into a semi-final round with a total number of gates 5:4.
The Impact should meet with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series of matches will be confirmed until today.
Shortly - Kovalev's winning goal
The first attack three Canadien is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alexe Kovaleva, Tomas Plekens and Andreje Kosticina in the Centre Bell last night encouraged the attack to conquer Canadien 3:2 on separate attacks.
Kosticin, the biggest star of confrontation, shot a goal, Plecanec accompanied two assistants and Kovalev made one fee in this fourth victory of three-colored of six preparatory matches.
Kovalev secured victory by giving one goal during separate attacks.
"I'm not ready yet," said the Russian.
"I need another game to feel good."
"In the first third, he tried to handle it too much," Guy Carbonneau noted.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the match.
He had a nice applause."
Charest bets north
The Prime Minister does not exclude that it will cause early elections by the end of the year
Just after the Liberal Parti liberal convention, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Québek, where the new Minister for Health of Yves Bolduc (leftly) is running in today's supplementary elections.
"Shut the border of our last large northern border," is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday visually bound in the conclusion of the Liberal Party of Québek in Lévis, without telling details.
During his speech, pictures in some image mill were drawn behind his back.
Three huge plates were run by a slip with amazing photos of hydroelectric barracks, down, Québek from the view "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Excellent funds, as in the pre-election period.
At the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would call early elections on the autumn, even though he noted that he had a very loaded program.
"Plan North" forms the fourth dimension of "vision", which the Prime Minister is planning for Québec, visions of "new economic space", which includes the agreement with France on the labour force, the Contract between Canada and Europe and the Ontaria agreement.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - Northern Territory at the 49th equation - the Prime Minister recently often mentioned in his statements, it has never been a subject of presentation.
However, the Prime Minister has limited himself to explaining why the North represents "the nail with enormous potential", but he has not stated the term, investment height, nor a clear priority in future projects.
He mentioned several approaches to points that could continue to be divorced: especially water plants, forests, but particularly the mine sector, encouraged by growth of developing countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
North, according to Charest's calculation, contains "nickl, zinc, copper, platine, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "land twice the size of France is in us," is in Québek.
And it's not just with us, but it's in us," he stressed, as if he wanted to show that he was calling for a national founder's myth.
Québec was built largely in relation to the North, raised by the Prime Minister: hunting for gold in Abibi, québec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after he shut up the theater to see a huge map behind his back.
North, 70% of the Québek territory, includes the part of the Labrador, which Québec has always demanded, has accurated the premiere during the press conference.
"It's one of the traditional attitudes that have repeated all the governments of the real world.
There is one border line for which the Convention has no longer existed, and if an appropriate opportunity, in the name of the government, I will reconsider this position," he stated.
Otherwise, "the climate change is also necessary to reconsider our vision of the North," he declared when he spoke of the north-west transition, which will be opened for a year as a result of the drowning of ice creamers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that taking the territory becomes an obligation.
What about the inhabitants of the territories, the original nations and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said the québec government would be very careful with them and that their project would be useful, especially young.
Two former ministers of two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ex-pequist Member of Ungawa), have already launched negotiations with about 30 communities.
The inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoât Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Free and Natural Resources) has an important position.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a big meeting, "not necessarily summit," but a moment when "the joint vision will be drawn."
The development of the North should last in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North plan will be "communically designed, structured and gentle to the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a vision of Liberal Prime Ministers that were in front of him.
"As for the Liberals that have before us, we have changed our minds to change the challenges in a new opportunity for growth and development."
This was, in the end, one of the still shaken themes of the weekend, which was started with a large cocktail on Friday, which raised the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage to the front of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted suggests that Beauharnois be baptized at the Adelard-Godbout district.
"After Godbut, who founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who had performed the Clidno Revolution and the Nationalization of Water Electricity, until after Bourass, who created James Bay, was able to create the future," Jean Charest said.
On the press conference he replied to another authority, this time conservative, even though the "Roads to the North" John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
When the arrival of the Eastmain1a-Ruper arrived, he emphasized the Charest that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I only say it between us, but I plan to be on it," he conferred his membership, causing considerable applause.
The same Prime Minister, who said in April, that in 2008 elections would not be, and no doubt even in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of calling elections on the autumn of this year, which allows him to take the law.
However, he stressed that his programme was loaded, especially the mission of the Federal Council in China and the Québec-New York summit.
The weekend convention provided the boss of Liberals a platform for some nationalistic resolutions, in particular certain "specific efforts to change the constitution", which have passed very easily: PLQ (Liberal Québek Party) requires special recognition of Québek's "specificities" in the Constitution.
It also wishes that Québec appoint a part of the members of the Canadian Council for radio and television broadcasting which should have the right to veta in the case of decisions adopted in Québek.
On the opposition side, the North Plan was adopted skeptically in its main characteristics.
The Chief of PQ (Parti Québecois) Pauline Marois retrieved the North Québec Development Policy, launched by Landry in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal Government got to power in 2003, it denied the fulfilment of this policy.
If she had sticked to her, "we'd be on today," Marois noted her candidate at Jean-Talon (where the elections are taking place today) Frances Mercure.
ADQ said she would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"But we wish it wasn't just a theater," explained Sebastien Proulx, the leader representing Maria Dumonta, who is coming back from holidays today.
Letters - Dishonored Countries
It was Vic Toews, exminister of "justice" (o irony) in Harper's office last summer, who allowed himself to say Louise Arbour for Canada "shame".
In such a way to shuffle a woman who has led an unconsolidable fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration, it tells a lot about the premier's surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have a government ahead of us that, as the only part of all Western countries involved, did not bring back to the government of its national prisoner in the concentration camp of Guantanamo.
A government that does not even take into account that when acts to be committed to him, Omar Khadr was a young adolescent.
The only government that, though Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves the rotation in the non-human conditions of a child soldier.
The only one that counts on the parode of justice to judge the guilt of the defendant.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty international and in particular the Association of Canadian Advocates defend the repatriation of Omar Khadra so that he can wait for a fair process in Canada.
The same government closes her eyes before torture: she doesn't care about this young man being psychologically destroyed, and it certainly lasted, after all these years of anxiety.
We don't realize this, but we're just witnessing the erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy" words that Harper has so much flavor and which sounds so empty from his mouth.
There is no more moral time: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to treat him wrong, to imprison him according to the chief's liability of the minor government so far (as after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find a salvation in the country that reports the Honor, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has denied what created the reputation and seriousness of our country.
Shame is, Mr. Toews, in this renouncement, not elsewhere.
Views - Orwellovski Discussions of Barrick Gold
In September 17, Le Devoir printed a letter from Patrick J. Garvera, the executive vice-president of the Canadian mine company Barrick Gold.
With Orwell's logic, it confirms that the biggest producer of gold in the world has launched the persecution of three authors and the poor little insulting booker in order to invoke "transparent public debate" and demands six million.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of an injury to honor, but the law.
It's not surprising that Garver will totally mine this fundamental resolution.
Or is it for Barrick Gold the best way to lead a public debate, to the miserable of anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Regardless of the process, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable amounts to be prepared to defend and fight in a very unbalanced fight against the army of lawyers supported by nearly without day-to-day pockets of the mine company.
The tactics in these unbalanced struggles are generally often in the destruction of the defendants in order to prosecute a commercial procedure that will embarrass the mouth of the counterparty and also scare anyone who is brave to devote this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he had to present his view on the whole matter to the public opinion.
In contrast with what happens in several countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada, there is a debate under normal circumstances in exchange of thoughts, not in the wounds.
So the mining companies did not have enough to open their books, their documentation and make a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent scientific teams that could bring light into the whole matter.
However, Barrick Gold seemed to not trust in public opinion and rejects petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada.
Maybe Garver could explain how he can demand "public debate" and condemn the opinions of the same public?
It appears that this word in the Vice-President world only refers to fatly paid lawyers, not all Canadians; that is quite a narrow concept of this concept.
In democracy, they have the right to speak.
Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or he doesn't want to understand - that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so in particular because he rejects the brutal ways of the mining society.
The public is ready to hear and judge the matter, but on the basis of civilized exchange of arguments, not within what many people consider as a persecution, where the lawsuit is to be stuck with their mouth (in the context of its persecution of "public debates" Barrick has just issued an official call to authors of Noir Canada to inform them officially that they should stop using this term...).
If we miss the surreal Garver's speech, the prosecution of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on universal freedom of research and searching for truth that is essential for each democratic society.
It generally denies the right to quote trustworthy resources and the debate on facts and interpretations that represent the basis of intellectual activities.
If in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss the subjects that do not like rich companies of this world without being exposed to a repeated persecution, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparency debate, it could form it if it was followed by the scientific standards used by Noir Canada.
He has the right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has already been able to run debates and disagreements and deal with conflicts.
The excessive complaint of Barrick Gold clearly shows that despite what he claims, it does not have the least appetite to lead a transparent debate.
For the university world, it is a loss, as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures that would limit such an unauthorized prosecution.
Operation to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
Bush's administration and transfers to the Congress, both the Republicans and Democrats, eventually reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest rescue economic plan from the great crisis since the thirty-years.
The new version of the plan to reduce the financial crisis that has been clousing Wall Street through $700 billion must still be approved by both Congress Chambers.
In particular, it assumes: better control of the selected representatives of its applications, new mechanisms to ensure the payment of funded public money, new measures to capture the quantities of houses seized for non-payment, and also the right to monitor the amounts paid by the managers of the companies saved.
The US Minister for Finance Henry Paulson, President of the Parliament of Representatives Nancy Pelosiová and the representative of the Republicans at the work table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news yesterday a few minutes after midnight, after the two-day negotiating maraton.
"We have made great progress and have come to an agreement that will be effective on the markets," said the representative of Bush's administration, Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done so that real economy and common Americans are safe against the crisis just in Wall Street," the democrat explained.
"If we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and the violations of the daily life of the Americans will be enormous," said the Republican Judd Gregg.
During the last hours of the negotiation, the maximum turnover of fear of the effect that would be further failure to investors.
The time limit was the opening of markets this morning.
Both candidates for the US President were invited to negotiate later, and both expressed themselves rather for an agreement, but not to mention their dissatisfaction with the need to avoid such a extreme solution.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama has added the completion of the agreement on certain measures, in particular the aim of which is to allow the owners of residence, and the remuneration of the employees of the companies saved.
"When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the inresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on television waves.
His Republican competitor John McCain, who was asked by another station to vote for the proposed plan, said, "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The thick qualities I've read [indicating] that it's something we'll all have to spend and that will be able to move on.
Choosing inactivity is simply unacceptable," he said.
The aim of the 700mm plan is to buy for the money of the taxpayers of doubtful claims and risk and unproof assets of US financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of the crise of the crushing bubble on the real estate market, which first led to a decline in the risk hypothetical loans (subprimes), then a further, more wider form of loans (PCAA) was transferred to the freezing of cash and banks and financial institutions.
The breakdown of the first draft agreement last week, the Republicans are conscientious.
Since the Democrats have come to the fact that some "toxic" assets of companies with difficulties will only be guaranteed by the government but will not buy them, there is a belief that the unexpected situation is exhausted.
In an effort to accompany the contrary views in the Congress, measures were accompanied that the government would be able to introduce new fees that would help her retrieve its contribution if, as a result, the programme had to take the losses for five years.
The new plan counts on the contribution of the first amount of 250 billion to which another 100 billion will be added if the president considers it necessary.
The contribution of another 350 billion should be approved by the Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will receive shares in saved companies which will pay dividends when it is over.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the procedures for removal of property related to loans relating to the plan, as well as to determine the limits for the assessment and compensation paid by the business managers infected.
The engineers of the plan would like to fail the vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate in the Wednesday.
Despite all the effort that has been made, it is not yet certain whether their plan will be green.
Because yesterday, the votes were raised against this project both in the Republican and the democratic camp.
"It is absolutely obvious that Washington can't hear you," the Republican Scott Garrett, member of the Financial Commission of the Assembly, declared at the address of the voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there's a solution.
However, earning on taxpayers is not a solution."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, a congressman's congressman's contemporary group called "Sceptic Committee", presents the whole thing differently, but it comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred respected economies professors, among them three Nobel Price bearers, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to rush too quickly and carefully examine which way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe has reaffirmed that this crisis is a global crisis.
After the extraordinary meeting, three countries notified Benelux the partial nationality of the Fortis Banking Group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion USD).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Lucembourg has become necessary after the French Bank of BNP Paribas announced that it departs from the purchase of its competitors, which is at the border of the decline since the loss of 2 billion euros (2.9 billion USD) in the result of a risk loan crisis in the purchase of property in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, among the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insuranceers.
"We won't get this money," the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Bos, said yesterday.
"In return, we get election law in the bank and influence.
And that's exactly what the households and the households can evaluate today."
On the other hand of the La Manche channel, it seems, the British government has launched another bank infected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from the Bredford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion USD) were credits for the purchase of real estate.
According to his notification yesterday, the Spanish Bank of Santander will redeploy the branches and accounts of the British bank's clients.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has to nationalize since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icons
His beauty with the nipples' eyes long represented his trumf, according to other weaknesses.
Did this American actor get out with a charming smile from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity, and the inconvenient talent that were his own, also distracted from the power category that produces real stars.
But what a runner on a long track!
Paul Newman died on Friday in 83 years at his ranch in Connecticut as a result of lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the fat years of American movies.
Less magnificent than Brando, who was similar and long as his rival on the film platoon, Newman was a more careful actor, certainly slightly, but also the apostle of freedom and disturbance of the dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, his father was the German Jew and the mother of Hungary.
From these European roots, one of the famous faces of the American dream was born.
No excessive ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because it appeared in this whole country in love with self made man, a warrior in the Pacific, who was injured in battle, who studied activities in Yale in the early 50s, then visited New York Actor's Studio and celebrated a triumph in the theatre, television and starts in the movie.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car raceman, who was a second in the 24-hour race in Le Mans in 1979, and also a sexual symbol, even though since 1958 he was a model couple with a actress Joanne Woodward.
It also leaves sharp places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged stars, allergic to the scope of its own show-business, which will always remain to a certain degree of mysterious.
A decent man, in the most gracious words of sense.
The departure of Paul Newman this weekend caused the turning to the lovers of the movie, while his great role is competitive with the black memories.
After it, more than half a century is defiled by a constant transforming American seventh art.
A young man who refuses his sensitive wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the Cottage to the burned roof, the Tennessee Williams adaptation of 1958.
From the less ancient past (1990) we think of his sensitive Mr Bridge, disturbed at the advanced age of marriage, which did not fulfil all the expectations.
So many other Pauls of Newmans went into history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, erupted, violent, unforgettable delikvent from Somebody Up There Likes Me (In hatred) Robert Wise, the role designed for James Dean, was taken after his death, which Newman introduced in 1956.
Sympathy gangster in the completely great The Sting (Podraz), Oscar for the best film in 1973.
The bitter and revenged ball player in the amazing The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same figure in The Color of Money Martin Scorsese, which will bring him the only Oscar of seven nominations in 1987.
This face traveling for ages, it was him.
And he's still.
In his professional route, they compete with different eras.
The young people know him primarily because of the Slap Shot George Roye Hilla (1977) of the role of Reggie Dunlop, a non-traditional hockey coach.
The fans met him again in 1994 at the Hudsucker Proxy Brothers Coen.
He then closed his career by the boss of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike several film legends, which had soon left the work, Newman remained in the business for a long time, even though he condemned Hollywood with his goldes, quantities and departures.
The French filmer Bertrand Tavernier considered it "lively subcontracted" in his performance, assuming that he pushed it too much on the pile.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, who was part of the role at the bedroom, profession was not always so gentle.
The first lovers, however, played less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lumps and despairs, whose desperation and rebellion reflected in his perfect characteristics.
As director Newman revealed little famous pages of his shameful sensitivity.
His film, Rachel, 1968 (by the novel of Canadianka Margaret Laurence), played the main role of his wife, Joanne Woodward, presents a sensitive woman's portrait full of melancholia.
His son Scott, who was lost for overdose, was filmed Harry and Son in 1984, a work full of shame and grief.
In the invasion of the honours that Newman received yesterday, his great friend and former combat Robert Redford (grated together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) mournedly said, "His presence made my life and this country better."
generosity, love for life, such are the main qualities of the dead actor.
If we miss his legendary career, there is also a great fighter for civil rights, ecology, an independent film, a opponent of Hollywood's destruction.
We were used to see the vineyard bottles, sauce, cookies and other foods, which could have seemed pretty intact, although it was the beginning of the gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to his Foundation for Hard Childhood.
Newman was so, rather than letting himself whisper in glory, he engaged in society in the last moment.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: "Everything and until the end your father was grateful to his happy planet.
I was honored to be here."
And for us, it was an honour to watch the path of life so clear and generous American artist.
And besides, the end of the end, a model citizen.
What was made in the factory on the factures Zuschlag & gender?
Shortly, 8 October, the criminal proceedings against Janos Zuschlag and his companions will begin.
Politicians and his associates are, in addition to other criminal acts, including fake leaves, accused of the fraud of a long-term and systematic criminal organisation, resulting in extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecutor, they used money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and the fulfilment of their tasks often provided by fictional invoices.
Money from the state and self-sufficient - by a scope of approximately 65 million forints - traveled parts to the Fiatal Baloldal Box, partly in the pockets of individuals.
The way the investigator also informed was that the money obtained in public competition was collected on the basis of the facts under which no real countervalue and the commitments adopted by the mergers were never obtained.
According to the lawsuit, a lot of factures were fake.
The printing of these invoices originated from the Josefvaros market, the round slip was made in Kiscunhalas.
On the names of which companies are to make invoices, they decided, inter alia, on the circuit road across the northern shore of Balaton, to which Istwana Lados Janos Zuschlag sent.
According to his testimony, he was first appointed to see pensions and restaurants.
In these cases, he asked for accounts for his consumption, according to which the invoices subsequently produced under public competitions issued by the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the respect of the Principal Administration of the capital.
In most cases, Istwan Lados and his companion, Andras ürim, who, according to our information, most often wrote reports needed to obtain subsidies.
Lados looked at a beer on his study road.
According to the two factors issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, this host food equipment was provided for the ninety-dimensional group of Biztos Pont.
But, according to the claim of the manager of the company, so many people would not at once enter this device.
It was also incorporated by the formal and content errors of the invoice presented in summer 2002 by a foundation named Jobb Jöväert, later Együtt and Harmadik Evezedert.
The Pension in Badacsonytomay had only three rooms, and more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, but the invoice was placed by a hundred and thirty guests.
However, the printers with a rich fantasy have exaggerated it even when they introduced a company that also devoted hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in whose accounting according to information provided to the State representation, documents called Jobb Jövèwert and Hoppa were not even figured.
The chief of the company Gyõzü Farkas for hvg.hu said that when he was called to the prosecutor and showed his invoice, he immediately knew that it was false documents.
"The name of our business and our tax number were in the wrong place."
As he added, other than formalities did not agree that, according to the invoice, there were only 11 rooms that have no so much capacity.
Furthermore, food has been indicated on the invoice, and their restaurant has not worked for a long time.
The jealous invoice producers did not even make sure that the viewed Budapest travel office organizes only foreign roads, and on the cash-payment invoice, which was also inconsistent with the invoice practices of the company, put an associate service to Hungary.
Furthermore, as a result of the investigation, they also indicated the VAT in the document, although the organisation of roadways to countries outside the European Union has been released from the VAT.
On the four documents presented by the Jobb Jövıèért Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. did not agree, inter alia, on the amount of VAT. However, the invoice made was not included in the company's activities of the 25%, but 15% of VAT, but only printed invoice.
Furthermore, the "distributors" of the invoice may have been decorated by the examination of the State representation, as the operation of the road transport of goods which the company originally based on the investment consultation did not perform.
The factures issued by Együtt and Harmadik Évezediert and the mergers XXI. Shazadi Culturelis Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false, but also failed because of formal deviations - the unsuitable form of invoice and the irregular stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k.s. or the Sport camp in Kunfeherto, whose representatives denied that they would exhibit invoices.
For example, counterfeiters did not notice that HIB s. r. o. from Nyiregygaza was in the time (2001) when the group of Fiatal Varosert was eaten in the elimination, and that is why, according to our information, the liquidation Commissioner of the company also denied that the paper was issued.
The factors were exhibited consciously
The second group of invoicers are those who knew they were to exhibit a fictional invoice.
The Base of Eséla Budapestert issued accounts for approximately four million forints for Harmadik Évezediert, at the request of the organization Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjou Shocialisták.
The leader of the Collab s. r. o. was charged to issue a positive account one of the accused Ludovic Györfi.
With Zuschlag and his companions also cooperated Biogate with. r. o, currently in liquidation, which provided the Fundation Jobb Jöväert and the Commons Atlash and Vörösfeny in 2003 with invoices of approximately five million forints, which were not the actual economic activity.
Not even the money movement, since the invoices created have been postponed later, which, however, the organization has forgotten to state in its documents.
Another group of invoice firms belongs to those who have been linked to the accused.
For example, Iwan Kubatov was an authorised representative of the Ukrainian director of Delta Trió s. r. o., dealing with engineering materials and motor vehicles, with a seat in Budapest, where the company is not to be found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued a number of invoices for the sale of the calculation technology of approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found by the investigation, the Kyscunhalas company Cash Investment s. o., which has been liquidated since 14 September 2005.
The operator of this company was a man from Romania who was supposed to transmit letters on the company as well as Ivan Kubatov in 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted that on behalf of the company, he issued invoices to the communities of Atlash, Hoppa and Együtt and Harmadik Evezredert and himself accepted their countervalue.
On the request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian walls were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
None of the companies actually worked, according to the accused, because they hadn't got jobs.
However, his businesses were useful for him, because on the request of a joint defendant, Zsolta Szente, who also prepared their foundation papers, exhibited on behalf of the companies of the Atlash and Y-Generacio connected to Zuschlaga.
In the name of companies Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave Kubatov organisations a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The state representation considered that Kubatov was 10 per cent of the amounts listed on invoices and VAT.
In order to exhibit fictive invoices, this time for the biztos Pont selection procedure, a man also used Szi-Beri k.t.
In January 2006, Y-Generacio and Schövetség and Modern Magyarorshagert submitted proposals for the public competition of Mihalye Tancsicse (TMA), publicly useful socialist parties organisations.
They acquired 500 thousand forensics, but the amounts did not expend on the objectives set out in the procurement.
In order to make it clear, TMA submitted five positive invoices from the Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices have been found at the home survey at the office of Arpada Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the calculation, a part of the accused will probably describe the process of the production of invoices, as she has already done in the prosecution.
It may be more interesting if everything decides to reveal itself the main defendant Janos Zuschlag.
Because his deposition is not too detailed, and although he promised several times that he would expose everything widely, he has not done so yet.
The question is, if it's in his interest - in exchange for a large part of the damage, 50 million forints, maybe socialists made a deal with him and Zusi will take it on.
At the end of the time, he could have been insulted, since his requests to mitigate the conditions of his detention, that is, to be placed at home, remained unheard.
While the perpetrators of the economic offences who have committed much more damage that have not yet been replaced may walk freely or at least wait for the end of the conduct against them in their homes, he does not have that option.
Psychology of trumpfing: Why are we spending more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, to overvalue the goods.
Neurological and economic foundations of this famous - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been able to reveal researchers in the field of neurology and the economy of the New York University.
According to their study, published in the Science magazine, people do not want to remain in the eBay auction competition, so they prefer to pay too high price.
The research was trying to map this "play" scheme in the nervous system through the experimental auction.
One group of volunteers betted, the second group participated in played auctions, using a method of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) examining the active brain areas of the experienced persons.
In both games, participants could win money, however, at the auction game, whose important element is to overthrow the other side, began to work intensely under the brain root, called striatum.
This brain area plays aside from many other functions of the "settlement" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, the price streaming can be explained by researchers by trying to avoid a rapid reaction of the uncle.
In order to support their theory, the members of the research team conducted a number of economics of financial intersection investigations.
Under different conditions, three groups were condemned against one partner.
The control group was simply informed what the actual value of the product is, and they made bets.
Furthermore, the members of the next group were promised that if they won the game, they would be rewarded for another $15.
The third group received $15 before the auction, but in the event of the loss, its members lost the money.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, everywhere in the fact that one was emphasized as a win and another loser.
However, the members of the group playing "protect the loss" were willing to go higher than it was in the control and "victory" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
"The result cannot be found out of no previous economic theory.
Because they have explained the phenomenons observed at auctions of joy from victory and avoiding risk.
When neurologic viewing methods helped us to solve the dispute between these two theories by now reaching a third explanation," Andrew Schotter, professor of the Economic Faculty of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you find a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is reported among the main causes of death.
The number of household infections of hepatitis is estimated to 100 000, but only seven thousand of them are treated.
The name of hepatitis is the summary name of infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, the inflammation of liver and yellow, however, the originators of the disease and the disease caused by them differ from each other.
The hepatitis virus depending on the originating diseases is distributed by two main ways: hepatitis type A and E of poisoning equipment (e.g. infected foods, water), hepatitis type B, C, D and other blood and body fluid viruses (sperma, sheep secret, slines).
Travelers should in any case be protected by vaccination against virus A and B, no vaccine against type C virus.
The symptoms of hepatitis A are shown two to three weeks after the use of infected food, usually associated with impairment, weakness, stomach difficulties, vomiting.
Then a yellow, light stool and dark urine will be created on the skin and the eyes white. The treatment may take two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people die in the world of a more serious type of disease, a liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only every tenth infected medicamentally is treated.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it may lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most infected with their illness don't even know, the originator of the disease destroys the liver cells, so the first symptoms will be delivered in many cases until 20-30 years.
Therefore, there is a very important time prevention, regular depisation.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more frequently than in the average: among people who have produced blood transfusions in 1991, between drug users and people with tattoos.
Currently, the global number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C 200 million is expected.
Since the disease can prove a routine laboratory examination, a person should, if any symptom of unknown origin is recorded, turn to his practical physician.
When early discovery, the disease is healable, the virus can be removed from the body, preventing infections and preventing cancer.
30. September is the world day of hepatitis, which was first organized by the organisations representing the diseases in the world in 2004.
His goal is to note the chronic hepatic inflammation caused by these viruses, the causes of its origin and the importance of early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God doesn't hurt so much?
According to recent research, faith in God works as a certain analgeticism that could make death easier for Catholic torturers.
The scientists of the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, investigating how faith affects humans in the god of understanding of pain, informed the British Journal Telegraph.
In a lot of bizarre research, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were failed by electric shocks, while everyone observed the painting displayed by the Virgin Maria.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much pain.
The examination of the human brain has also shown that the Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for the control of pain.
The study is the first of the series of studies that are attended by scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university.
The test was completely tested by connecting a sparkling tool with electric shocks to the left hand of the test subject.
Students asked the participants of the attempt to observe closely two paintings: Sassoferratova Panna Maria, originating in the 17th century and the Lady with the linearity of Leonard da Vinci, drawn in the 15th century.
The authors of research hoped that the view of the Virgin Maria would cause a certain state of godlyity to believers, while Da Vinci’s image was chosen because it was not too different from the first, and it was a calming impression by them.
The test subjects spent half an hour in the MRI scanner, and during this period they received in four of the following parts of 20 electric shocks, while separately watching the picture with a religious or general theme.
The Catholics claimed that when they looked at Miss Maria, they felt "safe" as if they were "settled" and "relaxed, filled with peace."
When they watched the picture with religious theme, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they had Leonard’s work before them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who has also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved by any very impressive image, even in the atheists, just a proper photograph needs to be found.
"We should find a picture that will be very positive, from the position of the mother or father," said the psychologist.
The English Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the research results.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases also change our personality," Wright added.
After such great results, it is only the question of how the painting of the believers would be affected if they showed them some madonna from Leonard or a painter of a similar caliber.
Would it mean a view of the quality Virgin Maria to achieve even better results?
You're what you're gonna share.
On his tenth birthdays, Google can announce that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above their head; they know where they were on holidays, for what professional examinations and what they are interested.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, that's still not enough.
However, with regard to skeptics that are parallel with orwell's dark vision, these are not the very clear feature of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently expressed for the Financial Times Journal that the main objective of Googlu is to collect more personal data users, which is necessary to ensure that the founders of Googlu are able to keep their original intention, which was: "Let's set up all information in the world!"
According to a confessed representative of Googlu, the company stands after ten years of world-born work just at the beginning to work with all the information.
On the question, what's going to happen in five years, Schmidt answered that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What am I going to do tomorrow?" or "What work would actually be useful for me?" - on such seemingly simple questions, however, the software will not be able to answer until they know enough information about the users.
Not all users of the Internet know well that during the Internet searches are accurately captured the search words and what IP addresses were searched and on which site the interested people have moved after searching.
Thanks to the Personalized Search Service started two years ago, for example, users can keep the history of their surfing, they can look back what they were looking for and what they clicked on, and then in a long-term perspective they generate findings adapted much more directly to them - on the same logic will also be based on the Recommendations Service, through which the system will offer us products and services and services that have been preserved on the basis of the previous and preserved preferences.
What if my data will be used against me, what if someone look at what I care about? - ask users who are afraid of the Googlu data monopol.
In most cases, the scope of potential power represented by the company, the anti-reaction does not cause guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power in users of the Internet.
However, it is confirmed that all the demanded expressions are not only captured but in reasoned cases can also be issued by the third party, in such legal cases, the personal rights of the Internet users do not provide.
The most famous example of the recent time was somewhat coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the community's sites of Orcut, established by his way.
However, Internet users who are concerned about personal rights could still breathe in May when the company with an EFF's electronic rights organisation successfully proved its truth in the fight with the FBI: Google cannot be forced to provide any information in the future by any member of the Constitution to provide secretly requested FBI.
(The same time, the Federal Government has successfully combated nearly 50 000 web addresses and thousands of searches that it has obtained with an appeal to strengthen the adoption of the Children's Protection Act, however, it has not been able to obtain lists of the search items of individual users, respect for the full list of web sites and key words covering the period of two months.)
Google's view is so disagreeable: it's biting by those who fear to provide their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be using Google services, exposed to injuries, and act against it with a revolt that belongs to transnational companies with a conservative image.
And in the meantime, the American geek culture and its wild quantity, grouping around the excited computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, sees a new generation of large-fire, "corporation now floating" in contrast to his rival of Microsoft, regarded as Windows as the world's winner, as they both fight for the same goals.
This can be caused by the fact that Google does not require an identification code from his users and does not want money after them for its applications; open, free and constantly fresh information source and software packages work as much more available, youth, "cool" than the practice of the official software giant.
However, this can also be caused by the geeks of exactly understanding a very problematic relationship with the Internet and personal rights that has brought with themselves one of the most conclusive keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Because Web 2.0 is nothing but cooperation, that we deliberately keep tracks behind and use the communication channels we have, and although their range is in each other, the element remains the same: we show ourselves.
A average young man can take a profile immediately on several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which can easily connect to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm application, recording his listened music, all of this can be connected to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, with a blog on which his latest photogalleries will automatically appear on Flickru or Picase.
But we can learn about many examples of which it enlightens: a girlfriend in the morning when looking at the flood of photos of common friends, easily find out with who her freaking friend spent the evening, or the company can only expel his employee because on his blog he will calculate his sincere opinions on top leadership: one is certain, the concept of private life has been fully overrecognized today.
He who lives online life consists of what he shows himself, so we can define the basic thesis that is hiding behind today's youth behaviour.
And who wants to hide something or at least avoid the Google monopoly, has the option (e.g. Scrooglem, who uses the Googlu search system, does not deliberately leave tracks).
For example, a few people are not intentionally registered on community sites so that they can not be found. Online applications Googlu from the text editor to the photoeditor and the reporting portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and which will not make us the most quality profile.
The public opinion is very secretly expected when Google shows teeth.
The supplier has its current value of $156 billion higher than IBM (140 billion), Intel (124 billion) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), the adWords/AdSense investments and services that have been initiated with an accelerating rate seriously disadvantaged life not only to Microsoft but also to many other software designers.
Critical observers, however, also find contrasts that act with disturbing impression: the top leadership, for example, totally rejected the protests of employees after doubled the fees for the company school, any frequent daily eating of employees, according to the management of the company, was too expensive, but all of this was lost by the fact that Google had been declined before the Chinese government in 2006, and in the sense of their agreements, it filtered every finding that causes good taste, respect for the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal rules of the company sounds that it is never forward to the new services, only when it can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the next months and years can avoid the world in new places: while some believe that the Googlu project focused on scaning and archiving books and magazines is acquiring such dimensions that the company will soon be dealing with the U.S. Supreme Court, others are afraid of its health system, in which we can compose a complete health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is composing a genetic database, then it can serve as a good default material as well as for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the famous novel of Corya Doctor's "Scrooview" describes the future with orwell's reminiscences, in which a person can only get closer to the scaryly closer with the data from Googl.
Double killer from Ozza helped remove the traces of two youths
Two youths heard the police in the case of double homicide in Osda, according to reasonable suspicions, helped to remove the signs of this crime, said the speaker of the Bureau of Borsod High Police Directorate on Tuesday.
Persons have been acknowledged and are currently accused of helping the criminal offence.
Both youths, according to MTI, two girls are pursued on the loose.
Assistance to criminal offence is punishable by withdrawing freedom for up to 5 years.
The suspect of double homicide in Osda, a 23-year-old man here, was taken into temporary detention on Sunday.
He's suspected of a crime before planned multiple murders for some reasons.
During the investigation, a 23 - year - old young man owed a 53 - year - old man a greater amount.
The suspect didn't want to pay his debt, so he dragged his creditor to the last Wednesday shop in Osda, where he killed a man first and then his nine-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, a young man was preparing for the crime of crime in advance, which also demonstrates that he committed a murder weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
The weapons and the circumstances of its use are investigated by the police by the involvement of experts.
Warsaw's storm offered to buy a Prague Storm
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - offered a warsaw bureau of valuable papers for the purchase of a 100 per cent package of shares of the Prague stock market.
Luwik Sobolewski, the President of the Warsaw Bureau of Price Papers, confirmed the offer made by the Polish party, even though the Czech Republic had already excluded the Warsaw Bureau from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Bure.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Bureau is to stand.
99 per cent of shares is in the hands of the Polish State, which wishes to sell 60 per cent of the securities in a few months.
As the Czech Economic Journal of E15 writes, the offer of Polands represents the highest amount that has been offered to interested in the Prague Bureau so far.
According to the Czech lists, the Vienna Bureau of Price Papers, the transatlantic stock burze Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, the London Bureau and Deutsche Börse.
The chief of the Prague stock bureau, Peter Koblic, expressed last week that the warsaw bureau of valuable papers would be the worst new owner of all interested people, and did not exclude that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague stock market in the future.
The value of the Prague market of valuable papers is estimated by experts on the stock markets of 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders agreement, approximately 90 per cent of shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock market is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25 per cent, followed by the Czech Republic with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. and L. with 13.5 per cent.
About the financial crisis from the view of European Letters
In their Tuesday comments devoted to the international financial crisis, the front European letters already remind "second September 11th".
For the global financial disaster, we can thank the American President, charged by Roman La Repubblica. The president was not even able to even settle his own party to support the rapidly paid draft of the law, which aims to fix this desperate situation...
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, reminded of the billionaire and the investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about the second September.
The part of the Madrid press also sees a guilt in Washington.
According to the Journal of El Mundo, the world economy has led to the deficiency of political leadership.
The danger of the American financial system is continually increasing, which will eventually pay the whole world.
But after the vote in Congress, Bush's plan was not perfect, but Washington is in danger of not offering a political solution to the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just the moment there is one of the greatest changes in capitalism history.
The threat cannot be further reduced, indicates the Geneva Journal Tages-Anzeiger.
Single States can still throw a rescue circle to incurring monetary institutions and taxpayers can save them from crash.
However, if the bones of the domino are falling down, there will be no longer enough money or any other improvization.
In a long-term perspective, Member States of the European Union should be transferred through their national egoism and united control of broken financial markets.
Only on Monday, the posting monetary institutions received more than 100 billion euros, reminds the Vienna Der Standard, which fears that, as Americans, they will have to reach deeply into the pockets and European taxpayers, are still more real.
The European Union has not dealt seriously with a crisis that as a tsunami as an old continent.
"Savingers" must not be waving hundreds of billions of euros right now, but it would be good to determine firmly, in which case it is reasonable to touch the money of taxpayers to prevent even more damage.
Intelligent car imitates the fly of a bowl
What would be the best way to develop technologies capable of preventing collapse if not imitating detectors of obstacles in the world of nature?
For example, in the bees.
The default strategic idea of a surprising project presented in the Japanese CEATEC vegetation was the nursery of the Engineers from the Nissan flickers. It was how to build a new generation of systems that prevent batteries.
In collaboration with the Tokyo University, Nissan was designed by a biomimetical BR23C management system, robotized miniauto equipped with bees' properties, with a final purpose to help create a system that can eliminate all the crashes.
"After the flight, every bee creates its own personal space of the oval shape, which is actually very similar to our security package," explained Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General for Technology PR and Research and Development.
The important role plays complex eyes that allow the bees to see in all directions in a visible angle more than 300 degrees.
The complicated eye function was copied by engineers after the idea of laser remotecomer.
It identifies obstacles at a distance of up to 2 metres before BR23C in the visible field 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the deck microprocessor, which immediately turns into an operation to prevent the crash.
The obstacle is captured during the second breakdown, then the robotized car starts to imitate the movements of the bees and turn the wheels needed to prevent the collapse immediately change the direction.
Unlike any existing system, this instinctive maneuver is being carried out in a completely instinctive manner.
"If it wasn't, the robotic car would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshijuki Ando, head of the Mobility Lab and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internally protective package, which is currently considered to be inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bees do to avoid the next bees.
This process may not take longer than the eye blink.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot go up, down or angle, it can only be two-dimensional and only in a direction to turn wheels.
Instead of infinite possibilities that are offered to bees when avoiding, only the possibility of rotating, acceleration and slowing was applied in the case of a robotic car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have higher energy density, which means they have longer life than lithium-iont variants.
According to Andoa, it is an important instinct, intelligent response, not the ability to process, so less data storage.
This mechanism must process and respond only on several arrival signals per second.
It is not necessary to store them and respond through intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it is constantly used only a memory of a few kilobytes size.
He doesn't need memory with giga or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step to develop technology that serves as an immediate avoidance, which, according to Nissan, could get into series of manufactured cars within ten years.
Another possibility of applying may be the connection of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the engineer to a given final goal after avoiding the lying obstacles.
The damn dear child has a name
The Economy Saving Package Act of 700 billion dollars to be divided into several payments and aimed at buying unquality bank loans is already written.
In the first round, half of the amount will be used.
Following further negotiations, which ended until Saturday after midnight of the American Eastern Time, the representatives of the Congress had come to an agreement within a few days of a debate on a total of $700 billion rescue package, the Reuters Agency announced.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosiová, the Democratic President of the Parliament of Representatives, which remains only to write the agreement.
The compromise on the package also supported both Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
The Minister of Finance, Henry Paulson, said on the result of compromise, "The program will work and be effective, but further steps must be taken."
The written form of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. of Washington Times (on Monday at 2:00 a.m. in the middle of the medium-European time), however, no special rise in the markets.
The proposal for a legal standard hearing on behalf of the Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act 2008, which the programme is to be established, will be voted first on Monday, then a series of representatives in the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and then the news of the agreement were welcomed in the White House.
"We are satisfied with the progress made at night and we appreciate both parties' efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," said the speaker of the White House, Tony Fratto.
The programme is definitely different from the original proposal of Bush's administration, in which it was intended to allow the total amount of $700 billion to be allocated to the purchase of unqualified valuable papers provided by the hypothecles.
Now it can be spent in the first round of the amount of 700 billion, which is that 250 billion will be used immediately after the case is expected in the Congress on Monday, and the Ministry of Finance will buy valuable papers secured by mortgages, which are estimated as unquality, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will then depend on the president's decision.
The programme will be monitored by a special congregation whose member will also be the President of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The second half of $700 billion will depend on the next Congress decision.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactics: he can also buy incremental loans, mortgages and valuable papers secured by hypothecles, respect for other "toxic" loans.
The redemption may also take place within the auctions directly, the competent representatives of the Ministry have communicated.
The Legal Standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in the insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance will guarantee funds that constitute a cause for concern, which will pay the price of the expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means to meet the urgent requirements of the US financial system for up to 700 billion dollars, whether it is a large purchase of bad funds, their insurance or preventing the systemic risk associated with a decline in some of the large monetary institutions.
"We shall take the necessary steps to be prepared to introduce the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
The boss banks who have gotten into trouble and are waiting for State aid can count on the fact that the government will reduce their distractions -- which in the foreign slanguis is simply called "Gold Deprivation".
Their payments will only be limited in certain cases, and these restrictions will also depend on the way they assist the ministry.
The constraint essentially means that if the Ministry buys in the auction, a tax leverage will be declined on gold drops if the falling bank directors are not sent directly to retirement.
In the case of direct redemption of unquality loans, the government will aggressively step in the interest of not excessive management money.
It is necessary to add that the existing gold falling contracts will not be changed, the restriction concerns only new contracts, which should be a further stimulation to participate in the programme.
"The first case in the American history will be in force when legitimate restrictions on the remuneration of the Directors of the General", commented the provisions of the Chairman of the Committee for Financial Services of Representatives, Democrat Barney Frank.
Besides, the State in the banks participating in the programme will be entitled to acquire a share, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as once the economy and the saved bank are in place, they can also earn on this transaction.
The proposal plan contains that in the next five years, the President must submit a proposal to the Congress in order to determine how taxpayers can recover the expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, on both sides, votes expressed in connection with the doubt plan have also appeared.
"American citizens did not ask us for this, because this is not what the dollar of taxpayers will protect," the Republican congressman from California Darrell Issa said.
His democratic colleague from Ohia Mary Kaptur believed that the provisions were insisted on those who were responsible for Wall Street crashing.

In the sector of production and divorce of electricity, gas and water, which is largely weighted in the industries of the country's industry, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, in particular by the continuing impact of the officially defined gas prices from 1 July.
In the 12-month comparison of domestic retirement in individual sectors of the processing industry, prices increased most in the oil processing sector (32.4 per cent).
In the co-operating sector, 13,2 per cent were observed in the field of production of foodstuffs, drinks and tobacco products which have a decisive weight, then 11 per cent increase in prices.
Prices decreased in the production sectors of textilies and textile products (2.5 per cent) and the production of electrical machines and devices (0.3 per cent).

In the consumption sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, in energy processing and further processing sectors prices have not changed since the previous month.
The largest increase in prices due to the same month of the previous year was observed in the processing energy and further processing sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the consumption-producing sectors, we have measured the increase in prices of 6.8 per cent, in the case of material assets, decreased by 1.4 per cent.
The export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints were increased by 1.1 per cent in August, in the 12-month comparison, by 3.9 per cent.

Next year to the United States without visas?
According to Kingy Göncz, it is a great hope that around January 12th will enter into force the American and Hungarian Agreement on Wi-Fi, the Minister of Foreign Affairs has spoken about this in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her opinion, "It's almost all that matters now if an electronic road permit system is built in time."
At the same time, she noted that part of the new system would not be allowed to enter, however, tourists will have to be registered before leaving.
The representative of Hungarian diplomacy has been continuing in Washington since today.
He meets the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, who will transmit the Middle Cross to the Star of the Order for the credits of the Hungary Republic, and conduct an interview with the advisers for foreign policy of the presidential candidate of Barack Obama and the Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are for a package to save the bank
Barack Obama and John McCain, presidential candidates of both U.S. parties, have in the same way guaranteed their support for the government package for the saving of $700 billion, but they are also politicians that require the demision of the Minister of Finance.
After a several-day marathon of the negotiations of the Congress and Administrative Representatives, it was announced on Sunday early morning: a basic package for the saving of banks was concluded.
The financial package, which aims at translating the Wall Street crisis and the freezing credit market, has become a central question of the presidential campaign.
As Obama, as well as McCain are referred to as more suitable for both candidates to bring the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the freshest research, how they got forward to the economic issue, Obama again gained some advantages and the McCain's incentive, which was secured after the Republican Convention of the Nomination of Sarah Palin to the Vice-President post.
Obama expressed on Sunday at a pre-election meeting in Detroit hope that a package law of 700 billion will be adopted by the Congress quickly.
He emphasized that the proposal contains passages concerning consumer protection, which it also supports.
"We must act immediately, responsiblely... to your places, savings, the whole industry, the stability of the whole economy is in danger," he said before the 35th thousands of people.
He didn't miss the opportunity to call McCain's economic imagination older.
McCain, in an interview provided by the ABC TV station, explained, "All will be a little cause... but nothing is just a way."
As the Republican Senator stated, the proposal sets out the establishment of a committee supervisor of the Ministry of Finance and the restrictions of the derogation for the top representatives whom he insisted.
Obama for CBS station declared that McCain had no more role in negotiations, but he was with the minister in daily contact.
The President of the Parliament, Nancy Pelosi, on Sunday, reported that the Parliament of Representatives may vote on the proposal for the law on Monday.
Overview of the printing of the German Language Area
The right camp is unbreaked, only the voters inside it have become more self-conscious - so it analyzes the weak result of CSU in Bavorska Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent red-black coalition.
Der Speegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet issue of the left German rapporteur magazine, Franz Walter discusses in his article entitled "Bavor Revolution eats its father" causes of dramatic defeat of CSU.
According to a famous politologist, the erosion of CSU began a long time before his office took over the sad duo of Beckstein-Huber.
Christian socialists have been renewing Bavorian for decades -- and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The processing of the period is the problem of all Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
Debakl was not completely surprised for CSU, but on Saturday the process was completed, which could be assumed for almost ten years: an uncontrolled hegemony of one country.
The CSU landed at 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 50s of the age of 50 under the 50 per cent border, in 1998.
This was repeated three years ago in the elections in Bundestag in 2005, which is still in the so often mentioned Stoiber period.
The reason for modernisation is that the CSU has consistently performed and consumed its parents in this country.
Sociologists have predicted this for 40 years, but they have been very mistaken. Secularization, education results, residence of the Germans from the east and north in the developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not have been without the consequences of the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization is linked to the growth of opportunities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The right camp is unbreaked, but the voters inside it have become more self-conscious, critical, more self-headed.
It is also obvious that the CSU has been the most distant in recent weeks; people in a free job, animals, individuals with maturity and high school education.
The CSU support has already dropped under 40%.
Die Presse (dipresse.com)
The Conservative Vienna Journal in its article entitled "Who, with whom?" The Presidents are restraining the coalition" devoted to the confused internal political situation resulting from Austrian elections.
SSPö wishes to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP provides for the incorporation of SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ appears to be open to all the proceedings, greens don't want to deal on the coalition.
The elections are behind us, everything turns around the coalition now; the debate held in public law television has not let the presidents of the parties look much into their cards.
The President of the SPÖ Werner Faymann confirmed that he wishes to deal with ÖVP.
And SPÖ wants to show that the cooperation of both parties is certainly possible - in some countries of the United States and in social partnership.
The question of whether he can introduce a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the ÖVP, as a vice-cancer, has left Faymann open.
As he expressed, Schüssel-Molterer's course was invoked for every fall.
The repetition of this direction does not come into account.
Moltherer responded to red offers carefully.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann trys to interfere with internal affairs of ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses opposition, or enters the coalition, it is yet completely open in the side, these questions must be discussed within the ÖVP.
The President of BZÖ Jörg Haider again appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black coalition, we are ready to take the government's responsibility," Haider said.
Blur: The charmed circle of poverty and segregation should be broken
Today, in Paris, the European summit of equality, which this year hosts France, the current presidency State of the European Union.
Livia Jaroková, the Member of the European People's Party for the Movement of Fidesh, as one of the main speakers of the professional lecture in her message addressed the fee, paid attention to the segregation in school, because it is one of the most important injustices affecting Roma children, and also the most serious obstacle to their application.
He launched a summit - on behalf of the French Presidency - Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Špidla, European Employment Commissioner, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
They are settled between the invited government representatives, European social partners, the most important European organizations for the protection of rights and civil associations acting in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the European Embassy Group, Fidesz Jaroková noted that the Romas are primarily expelled from the European labour market of their low education.
"The largest majority of young Roma does not have high school education and, as a result of the bad quality of basic education, only a small part of them can achieve higher degrees of education."
The Jaroc emphasized further that education as a fundamental human right has a key role in applying other human rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children may be a strengthening of the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the messenger, it is necessary to establish awareness of these links in the widest circles - between Roman and non-Roma children.
As soon as the Roma student starts school, it will have a greater chance to become a productive member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they contribute to the national budget.
"Roms are the right to ensure the right to quality education and guarantee the elimination of their quality and separate education," Livia Jaroková emphasized.
The Member states that cohesion of the European Union is needed with a focus on the objectives and negotiations to accelerate the processes of desegregation of schools in the immediate manner, which is essential for the correct compliance of existing and planned anti-discriminatory regulations.
"It is necessary to break a charmed circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, it is necessary to provide Romanian children with the possibilities given by a democratic space in order to be able as full citizens to participate in the future of Europe," Jarokova required.
Everyone in the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" is guaranteed the objective of the European Summit of Equality, held annually since the last meeting in Berlin, to ensure a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and to remove discrimination at the level of Europe and individual Member States.
CSU: temporary mercy
The destiny of the Dua of Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the shameful election debacle, the debate on personal questions has not yet been deferred.
The chairman of the Erwin Huber and the prime minister of the country, Günther Beckstein, can still stay in their seats, the question is, as long as this mercy will last.
The fate of the Tandem, which has suffered a catastrophic 17% loss of votes, will decide on the last October weekend of an extraordinary convention of the party.
Members of a very criticised dua, in any case, have heard that they will not be able to catch their posts.
They tried so to calm down the angry members of the fraction and base, who, due to the loss of absolute majority, demanded a day after the "bavorian cunami" exemption of personal consequences.
Five years ago - the truth, even under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber standing on the top of her career - she won the Christian-social Union 60.7 per cent, now, a year after the push against Stoiber, but only 43.4 per cent.
CSU has been a producer of 18 percent of German GDP "control" in Bavaria for 46 years.
Although conservatives continue to have a key importance for Hungarian economy, high position, they will, in the future, be forced to coalition.
One of the first signs of reorganization within the party is the fact that a member of the tight intelligence team starting a prosecution talk on the possible coalition of the monk government with the liberal FDP, the respect of the right-oriented assembly of the Free Elector, will also be the Vice-President and the Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, who is considered to be the possible successor of Huber.
It is irony of fate that Gabriela Pauli, at the candidate of the Free Electors, had come to the scene, whose performance against Stoiber was used by duo Huber-Beckstein to carry out a puff, but then with ambitious community politically made an unmilosrdly short process.
The leaders of the CSU are now focusing on how to stabilize Beckstein.
During the transitional period, the active role will also occur to Stoiber, who has already made the background threads, the former Earth Prime Minister, and the former CSU President, called the most boring day of his political career on 28 September.
On Monday, Huber took a few notes to the CDU address, and he believed that they would have earned much greater support from the Sister’s party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning for CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the elections in Bundestag on September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become a candidate if the CSU, which played a significant role in the national success in 2005, will not be able to put together with the common forces.
According to Merkel, who has hardly hid her disappointment because of the fiasco, there will be no loss of CSU positions that have a negative impact on the Berlin large coalition.
Which is of course relative: treatment of injured CSU will not be easier, and the crisis of social democrats continues.
The SPD has reached 18.6% of the worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lucašenko: Opposition - 110:0
In the Sunday elections, no opposing ambassador has reached the Belarus Parliament.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukašenka, however, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE) by the illegitimacy that occurred during the compilation of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the 110-member Legislative Assembly of the 10 million country has missed the opposition well for ten years, the opposition associated with the United Democratic Force (ODS) before the elections yesterday was seriously hoped that Lucašenko, which had left on the basis of a change in the constitution in the 2006 debate process, and the fourth renewing of its presidential mandate, this time "lets" to appear in the parliament to a number of opposition Members.
So the OS dropped from the previously considered boycott.
In the background of the opposition expectation, Beltransgaz, the owner of the countries passing through Russia, was increasingly dependent on Belarus, who wanted to improve relations with the European Union, where, for the reason of the Belorus political establishment of a valuable as anti-democratic Lukašenko and other high positions, politics are not allowed to enter.
On relevance earlier, the OSCE emphasized positive movements, not deficiencies -- for example, the ban of a third of the opposition candidates.
The Monday lightning report of the OSCE, however, had comments to the campaign during which the opposition candidates could not be found in the press, in particular to the fact that the opposition could not be present by compiling votes.
At the same time, the opposition can only feel improvement in the political system: political prisoners were released and Minsk is willing to start with Moscow and smaller confrontations, where he refuses to accept from Georgia the South Osetia and Abchazia, even if Russia, with which Belarus forms a Union State, has considered these territories independent for a month.
"We have made two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU began," our newspaper Alexander Milinkevic said.
According to the opposition candidate from the presidential elections in 2006, it is desirable that this remains, even though "the power has been feared to let into an unsignificant parliament of a single opposition member".
In view of the results of the opposition, it does not plan protest action, rather try to deliver its message to the voters on the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we must print opposition lists in Russia, distributing obstacles to local authorities, however, I see that the change is increasingly supporting more people, even among elders," said Milinkevic with the instruction that Lukašenkov's regime, which considers the greatest success of creating social security, does not consider the correct or officially supported layers of pensioners.
"For the debt of the country and the growth of a trade deficit, it is only a matter of time when the social security of the 'related silence of the cemetery' will fall," Milinkevic judges.
In contrast to opposition policy, Russian observers of elections evaluated as democratic.
The Head of the Community Mission of Independent States Sergei Lebedev of the Russian Rapporteur Agency Ria Novosti said that "man does not believe in words but acts", so the absence of opposition is nothing but evidence of the maturity of the Belorusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today's breakfast before work"
It's the first time in the history of the Palace of Chigi, which was introduced by the turning doors at the arrival and leaving of employees.
But from today on, this new measure will start to work against the wise people, against those who fly and then go for coffee at worktime.
The news against the lenaches was presented today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renat Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Presidential Council, Maure Masi.
"The turning door - says Brunetta – are a tool for better work, higher performance, more presentations and more services," the Minister states.
"The new period of responsibility and transparency will be opened.
It's reformism," Brunetta also stresses.
We will complete the introduction in all buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi, "the choice of the turning doors is also important from the symbolic perspective."
No objections were made by the employees, the Secretary-General assures: "The procedure was common with workers and cooperation of all."
Just, no more breakfast at worktime; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a real cappuccino at seven o'clock in the morning."
During a conference at the High School of Public Administration
in Rome, the Minister will eventually notify that within three months, the absence of public personnel for disease decreased by 50%, which means 60,000 more people at work more annually."
And it adds that it is necessary that Italian public administration become more effective
"His payment dynamics, explains the Minister, has doubled in the past 8-10 years, given the private sector and is far higher than the inflation percentage."
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees met to reject Brunette's rules of decree in accordance with the Codacons supported application.
"While the Minister for Public Administration presents today the numbers relating to the lower absence of work in the cause of sickness – the consumer's Association writes – the nation of 'pious lenoches' is increasing constantly.
In Italy we have thousands of productive and correct employees in the public administration who have gathered to declare war to the illegal standards contained in the decree."
On Tara will be protested primarily against the exclusion of supplements to the hospital which depends on activities; the extension of the time where the sick can be verified in what time the control visits will be performed and against other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Work injuries, Napolitano: "Resolute Prevention"
Every day in Italy there will be 2.500 working injuries, three people will die and twenty seven remain permanently disabled.
The Inail values confirm that in 2007 we have approximately 1.200 deaths due to work damages.
These values indicate the seriousness of an indication that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost double death compared to murders.
In order to renew the attention of the institutions, social and information funds on this dramatic problem, Anmil today celebrates in all Italian regions the 58th national day of the victims of working injuries established on the second Sunday in October.
"The alarming data extended by Anmil and the same tragic reports of these days confirm the importance of the safety of work," confirms President of the Republic of Georgio Napolitano in the report sent to President Anmil, the National Association for Disabilities and Disabilities for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of the State expresses its alive admiration to the continuous joint efforts to ensure security in jobs, to protect injured workers, to help victims and to participate in public opinion."
"Orriginally a disturbed 'dost' was raised, sincerely divided by the face of tragedy, which causes disturbance in the media and public opinion, but the daily fact offers us again dramatic cases, even repeating in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not conceal that "there is no doubt the issue of sources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Special importance is acquired by numerous initiatives in the field of school so that young people facing the world of work can gain clearer awareness.
It is necessary to note this phenomenon, not to give up because of its disturbing social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The Chairman of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber emphasized, "how the deaths resulted from a working injury creates an absolutely critical social condition, as it insults the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort towards the necessary ending of this condition."
"As for working injuries data, they seem to show a positive turn, but this does not deny that the number of deaths due to work injury is as alarming as again," President Anmila Pietro Mercandelli reiterated.
"We wouldn't just want this "depreciation" effort to lead to less attention, because just the moment he gets his attention, there's a tragedy.
"We believe that generally it is not enough to stop the problem of injuries and there are many activities that may affect this problem.
It is necessary, according to our opinion, to emphasize Mercandelli – to increase controls and inspections, but also to engage more in the field of training of workers from the age of school."
"There is still a need for further efforts -- he added -- about communication and public opinion collaboration.
But it is essential for more sense of responsibility by employers against the phenomenon, which represents an exceptional social phenomenon."
Mercandelli eventually declared that it was a progressive degeneration of the right to compensation for the victims and the "sustainable care" to which the system has been receiving in recent years.
"The purpose is therefore to return the insurance guarantee to the employee," he added – because the fate of those who injure themselves may not depend on spontaneousness or gifts from time to time by lawmakers."
Mp3 players accused, exposing risk hearings
Listening for a long-term loud music and using transmitting musical devices as Mp3 players can blame the persistent destruction of the hearing.
According to today's notification of the European Commission, which quotes the opinion of the Committee on Science on Health Risks which have recently been raised and identified (Csrseri) Eu.
"From this scientific opinion - we read in notes – shows that 5-10% of those who listen to music for at least five years using transmitted musical devices, weekly more than an hour a day and maintain a high volume device, risk the lasting loss of hearing power."
"I am concerned that so many young people who often use transmitted musical devices and mobile phones at high acustical levels can unconsciously damage their hearing in an unregulated way," Meglena Kuneva admits.
"From scientific findings, the leader continues, there is a clear risk and it must be reacted quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to stimulate consumers and publish these information.
We must continue to verify already existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding so that they will become fully effective and keep their steps with new technologies."
Brussels requested the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem in view of the high use of transmitted musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed the noise of this origin.
"Scientists – concluded the Eu Executive Officer – confirm that it is necessary to worry and now the European Commission will check together with other members and parties that have raised the problem, which measures could eventually be taken and thus better protect the children and young people from the noise of which origin are transmitted musical devices and similar devices."
Currently, there is a security standard that limits the noise of the transmitted musical devices to 100 dB, but increases concerns about hearing damage, which can be caused by excessive expossion of similar noise forms.
It is very possible to limit these damage by looking for solutions such as the reduction of the level and the duration of exposure.
In its conviction, the Scientific Committee, Eu, states that the users of transmitted musical devices, if they use a volume of music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, will exceed the current valid limits corresponding to the noise allowed to the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions over a long time risk a lasting loss of hearing after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices and their quantities can be calculated between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu.
Rome, Alemanno leaves a free progress to the Commission for the future of the capital
We'll start today, we'll close in March, we'll have the sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli workers "The Commission for the Future of the capital of Rome", which met this morning in its new village behind the Caracall Bath.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the Handbooks for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the General Council will assess the analysis and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with Campidoglia and his council Gianni Alemann.
"The Commission is completely independent and all political, social and cultural thoughts are included in it – he wants to emphasize Alemanno – he will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by the political decisions that remain Giunta e General Council.
It's not about exchange of functions, but only trying to have some place to process a large project for Rome.
In March, the work will be completed and then dissolved, because these institutions must have a precise time term.
In June – the Mayor announces – we will present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome."
He who accuses the Commission of insecureness, given that its opinion will not be binding, Alemanno answers: "All matters to the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are qualitative, as well as the Commission Attali proposals, and I am confident in Rome, its benefit will be crucial.
Too often, politics are overwhelming on daily problems and urgentities that are sometimes incurred.
On the contrary, we want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
Furthermore, Mayor Rome wants to emphasize that "this Commission is not either a useless business or bluff: it is completely free, Roman citizens will not stand either euro and serve to reflect and engage the best intelligence that the capital has."
For Alemann, essentially, "needs to have a strategic plan as a default point, neither definitive nor immediate to allow our city to afford an authentic rise at the level necessary, and to think with the united spirit of his future."
The future that, as defined by Mayor Rome, "will not limit itself only to the current general border, but will look far further" not only in the option of the future metropolitan city and its legal statute, the capital, but "also includes the role that Rome can and must perform as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
A famous American president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be another anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decided to decite the US economy and maintain relations (as today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam."
The attacks on Obama are growing just when the election date is coming.
One lady from Miami wrote on the web, "This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has a courage: he thinks he will get to the highest position of the nation, who has two governors everywhere and five black senators."
In fact, these attacks don't say much," they are clearly racial attacks, and they do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? Then we have research; they all say Obama will win and with a great impact.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart, not by the brain.
One newspaper from Mississippi, from the south of the United States, wrote a comment: At least once in the cabin we know who will give his voice to the American patriot.
One side of American mentality that remains squirting until the last moment.
Say what you want, we'll finally take care of it ourselves, who we'll check out, whether Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear that if he had to win Obama, we would have left America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain success of the black candidate.
But over all these views for democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
They asked 1500 people: What mistakes did Bush during his mandate? 80 percent replied: Iraq.
America's changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent him home with a bath in his ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were saved, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq became most of Bush's weakness.
Whoever enters Georgia W's place will have to perform a huge task.
The economic collapse of the United States has also been felt by journalists: in the newspapers there is an investigation period, and many accuse the Internet, the " killer" press.
The PEW Research Center asked about the state of their profession and assumption of the future.
Well, today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the questions openly did not say that they were less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem is money for American journalists, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is the crisis of a destroyed economic model.
Besides, the sketches carried out in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put together the papers are a huge problem.
According to the questioned journalists, this is a problem that needs to be resolved if we do not want traditional journalism to be changed in the way a wide public understands it.
The American journalist is making it clear, but complex pessimism.
Six of the ten press journalists and seniors are convinced that the journalist is in a bad way at the national level.
There's a 65% performance group in the local area.
Printed against the television.
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the web goes.
The bigger publishing will run the way to the Internet, which many view as a "slayer" press.
"Economic pressure", which journalists are noting, has increased by 79%.
Five hundred questioned journalists admitted they're declined to technology in hope that for their journalist, they'll do something good.
The biggest disadvantage in American journalism is among those who run the newsrooms – that means the leaders – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are certain that their reporters share their values, while at local level the value falls to 23%.
This has something to do with a certain job for someone.
The leaders who think they're losing the job within three years are 47% nationally.
As for journalists, they're moving to 30%.
With regard to the "specific work" regarding the staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of the journalists are working on the contract.
In such a giant nation as Usa, with three hundred million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TV and Internet employers often offer what they want, so they are questioned to take or leave them.
The leaders receive almost always huge wages and the editor can also earn $10,000 monthly off pension and insurance.
As for vacations, argumentation is complicated: a number of days after the first year, a number of days after the third year to reach 15 days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own acknowledgement, often ill during one year.
It's just a climate issue.
UNIPOL: RICH SUD, COPOLA COPOLA LEAVE IN GROTTAFERRACE
The President of the second Criminal Senate of the Rome Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the application of a businessman with realities of Daniel Coppoly, who asked him to move from his city, Grottaferraty, to the apartment in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in connection with the anti-booting of Unipol-Bnl sales.
During the process on his own costs, he received release from home prison last week, which was transformed into forced permanent stay in Grottaferrat.
His lawyers, Michel Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked the businesser with realities to change the place of residence from the village city to the capital.
However, according to the Court, this movement (protected by pm) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence that accuses him.
Ellites in danger
This phenomenon has been shown a few days ago, when the Comora of representatives voted against a rescue plan to grant $700 billion to the White House: a significant part of the Americans was more interested and interested in the punishment of Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, who informs us that the current crisis is dividing the Republican party, constantly more divided between its old East Coast soul, a mild, mild, incorporated to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which is contrary to conservative, enemy to "them from Washington" and the world of finances, stronger in most countries in the middle and south.
The soul that arrogantly showed myself by the vote I spoke about at the beginning.
But this is just an example of changes, major changes that the current economic earthquake already shows : not only in the United States, but in the entire Western, and perhaps not only here.
As in Usa, as well as in Europe, the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of phenomenons that have been in the incubation for a long time, which are exhausting and finally coming into light in the new climate.
The first of these phenomenons is the renewal, the special recovery of the market, the double category of State-Power in relation to a certain re-economic renaissance.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking financial institutions which, of course, have strong bonds in abroad, but mainly include the largest budget of people and families living in one country, in one country.
Which created a political problem at the same time for those leading him: it means how to respond to the problems and protests of people and families, which are, inter alia, voters.
In fact, the crisis appears economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
The political internationality seems to be significantly out of the game or that there is nothing to add: the obvious evidence has given the European Union, which is divided as always between different interests and various state strategies and which cannot be decided for one common political line.
So everyone is waiting for an intervention of the government of each country, the rescue plans, the recovery of the market, the new rules and the main division of funds: when we get in trouble, only the States have economic resources, the amount of financial resources to be able to make it all right.
Also own the necessary funds and authorisations to use them: two sources of enormous value, under certain circumstances where no market and no international organisation will ever be able to disposal at a similar extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the national-national element is, at the end, in full conformity with the increasing importance that the last economic progress is trying to contribute to a strictly linked factor with it: territorial nationality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we entered the kingdom of the site, more sophisticated technologies, material, while we were convinced that world finances were already pre-determined to rule the world, we realized nothing of the fact that our future would have to be increasingly facing such little undependable things as water, grain, oil.
All things that would have been said can be transported from one place to another, but in any case, they are connected, absolutely, to the limited area, the territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler, surely has a lot more cards in the handcuff than who's not eating and who's lucky to live in a place without grain, without oil and no water.
I'm getting to the second news that predicts breakdown.
Who speaks of the territory, the state, the government, is inevitably talking about politics, that is, leadership.
In view of the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be created.
On the one hand, awareness that the objective requirement of authority leadership is a request for someone who can take the situation.
On the other hand, the wave of discreditation against existing leadership, in particular economic, which appeared equally unsuitable and full of dark places.
And together something even deeper and in a sense of disturbing: discreditation, impatience, feeling of incapacity and absence that is trying to control the entire ruling class in the western countries.
Because it appears to be increasingly widespread in the population's mass of convictions than their actions are the same as thoughts of popular elites, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the right sense of the word that elite has already overcome its time and is indifferent to the opinions of most.
The requirement for leadership simply feeds from underground one branch, but the strong movement to remove ruling classes and traditional political arrangements is manifested in sudden elections' resistances or in unexpected changes in collective moods in the last and last time, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavorska to the fall of labourists in Great Britain, to the rebellion of American Congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the winning of the right in Italy).
We have the impression that their traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremony, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have increasing problems to understand, so represent, which, not from today, is created in deep layers of Western companies, and that the economic crisis reinforces, grows, potentially overfall.
Before this, it would be excessive to speak of a permanent "mass rebellion".
But surely we can't say that means having really open eyes.
Super glue for walking around the walls
To overcome gravity laws thanks to the super stick and in the future walking around the walls like the Spiderman.
This is an object of various American research centres and now the team of four institutions has very closer to it.
Scientists managed to keep a stokilogram body sticked on the vertical wall with a sticker of just 2,5 square inches.
STUDIUM – American Science magazine published discoveries of some researchers in Dayton, Acron, Georgian Technology Institute and Air Force Research Labs.
The material that has invented the team of researchers is the development of materials already existing that use a special structure of carbon, called carbon tubes.
"The foundation of glue can be seen as a series of pipes laying down as a set-up spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgian Technology Institute in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the legs of the gecon, covered by microscopic hairs that allow the animals to ensure a perfect match.
The tests carried out on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper showed that the new stick is ten times stronger than the feet of these plazas and at the same time "is easily off the wall", explains Liming Dai, researcher of the Dayton University.
"This material could be useful as a commission stick" adds Liming Dai.
Hopefully to walk around the walls like Spiderman? Hopefully so, but researchers are thinking of much less fascinating use as the connection of electrical devices, because the cotton carbon tubes are the guides of warmth and electricity.
Other applications may relate to air space engineering .
No super heroes for now.
FURTHER STUDY – Also the University of Berkley, California, is investigated by a new glue.
In one article of the American Chemical Society, California scientists represented a glue formed from microwave as hair cleaning themselves from dust by moving to the table to keep perfect adhesiveness.
Medicines: Never with juices
Watch the grep, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks that are primarily consumed during the summer, because they are refreshing and filled with vitamins, together with some lifesaving medicines, their use is changing increased or reduced effectiveness with serious health effects.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, would emphasize the risks of juice both finished and fresh in combination with the use of some medicines, at just the 263th national meeting of American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, to abolish their useful effects and to expose the health of patients of the risk.
The grep juice has already been accused of increasing toxic effects of some antiaritmical medicinal products, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihystaminic and neurologic medicines to the toxic level.
MEDICINAL MEDICINALS IN RIZIC – The Italian medical agency reported it in the information bulletin two years ago and embarrassed doctors and patients to not underestimate the danger of this mixture and to take care of what they drink in case they take medicines, such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NEJEN GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that suppress medicinal products.
Long list of the effects of grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the Challenge of Michel Carruba, the Director of the Pharmacological Division of the National University in Milan: "This appearance is mostly announced to the various international and national pharmacist agencies which eventually arrange and exchange information instructions for medicinal products.
So you always read the illustrative tickets of medicines that you get and if you encounter something incorrect, don't worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification," an expert for Ansa's agency emphasized.
Nobel for Economy Paul Krugman
The Nobel Price was assigned to American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and location of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenian who is teaching at the University of Priceton, who is a famous editor of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important criticisms on foreign, economic and political steps of Bush's administration.
A few months after the assassinations in September 2001, the day he crushed Enron, Krugman foretold in one comment issued in New York Times that the second event would be, in the sense of the consequences of the history of the United States, much more important than the first.
The prophecy that had caused had no disputes, which had been evaluated to him over the years, but it turned out to be precise.
"I am surprised and shocked with the speed of the collapse such as Enron and Worldcom disappeared from public interest, Krugman declared at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Binio Smaghi from the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is a “econom of great importance”, but also a popularist who has“ve a very aggressive style, especially critical against the excess of Bush's liberalist administration”.
Open Office, we have the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package here.
It is the day of publication of Open Office.org 3.0, an open source of personal production, which aims to invade more users, from household to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative of the more famous Microsoft Office.
After about a year's work of voluntary workers controlled by the SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows wide public with various news: to welcome the screen and to the revised and improved opening windows, additional, far more important, such as the compatibility of Apple Mac OS X operating system and the support of the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the last standard version of ISO.
The emphasis is also placed on collaboration with the Office package 2007, Open Office is able to open the document with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are specific features of some models such as how to reduce PowerPoint's presentation dimensions, useful for example for transmission by electronic route, or the possibility of transfering the PDF component into a graphical model and maintaining the original appearance of the page.
We can still create documents "PDF hybrids" that are like the typical graphics of Adobe format and have the properties of the table processor or the text program.
Cooperation is a element that has obtained many improvements within the application programs: in excellent ways to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, each colleague has given one color to comments to make it clearer identification in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working on the transfer of certain Open Office functions on the Web (on the cloud) and should stop the definitive result in the next weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0/download300.html, has been added to the English version of the mirror since Friday.
Besides Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
Furthermore, the installation cd may be sent home or to workplace on request.
And if the theme of freeness can be a trigger to expand households, it's just the business area of Open Office a lot of bets, and it can already count on various projects implemented in public administration and schools.
And there are no offers of training, consultation and assisting services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacement Word; Calc is a table processor to replace Excel; Impress for presentations similar to Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, eventually, is a graphic model.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads, and when we consider that we are nearly 3 million and 600 thousand today, with the issue of a new version, this assumption could be overcome.
Also the Kohl results are positive, it's a fourth doping case
New positive case on the last Tour de France: this is Rakusan Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third classified and winner of the shirt of the best top.
The report quoted the L'Equipe journal pages.
The 26th-year-old Kohl is the fourth rival for Cera, Epo third generation, after the Italians of Riccard Ricco and Leonard Piepoli and Germans Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples fall into those carried out in the last few weeks of the Laboratories of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabra.
If the control analysis confirms the positiveness on Ceru, the Rakun loses the third place on the Tour and will have to face two years of disqualification.
The report on the positiveness of Kohla on Epo third generation confirms the French Anti-Doping Agency Pierre Bordry, who announced the Associated Press that he has already informed the results of the Austrian government authorities.
The 26-year-old Rakusan was situated on the degrees of winners behind Spain Carlos Sastro and American Cadel Evansem, also obtained a shirt of the best top.
Immigrants: New York Times is so sorry, is it Italian Rasist?
Italy "as a land of immigrants only in the last home has turned into a priority target of immigrants" adopted with resistance.
This converts a beautiful country to the nation of racists? This is what it is about in a long article in New York Times, which devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy, and started with the case of young Abdul William Guibre originating in Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan because he stole a box of cookies.
This case shows what New York Times defines as "paradox to the north": the northern areas are at the same time the ones where more integration and more work are registered, but also "the strongest anti-employment opinion in the country and the strongest support of the North League".
To confirm the increasing tension between Italy and immigrants, NYT quotes cases of tolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castle Volturn.
Not just that.
The new legislation required by Lego, which is trying to stop immigration and facilitate exile of illegal immigrants, is also quoted as an example of changing climate in Italy.
The tendence emphasized both by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after he met Benedette XVI in Quirinale, asked the state and church to work together on the defeat of racism."
Students with expensive rent victims - up to 900 euros per room
The rent market for university students doesn't know a crisis.
According to recent studies, Sunius, rental committees, renting a single room can stand up to 900 euros in Milana, in Florence 700, in Neapoli 650, in Rome 600.
"Jev has already achieved such dimensions that the entire students' layers have lost the right to study because of the total too high prices their families would have to bear," explains Sunya, Laura Mariani, head of the Studies, -- a large demand of the students has deformed the market in such a way that it has initiated the price growth process that also increased to residents."
In most cases, rent offers include several offences: contracts freely, unregistered, without limited rent, related loans.
For Sunji, it is necessary a special intervention that could regulate prices through the tax revision.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milana, in the area of Brianza, there is a need for a single bed of about 450 euros, a single room is paid from the minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) over the average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to the maximum 900 (in Vittoria zone).
In Florence, there is one bed in the average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in zones near the university, 250/280 euros are needed for a double bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single bed.
In Rome in central university zones (San Lorenzo, Pyazza Bologna) they want approximately 600 euros per single room, 450 beds in a double bed.
The values are a little lower (550 euros per single bed) in zones near other universities (Ostience and Cinecitta).
We will save only if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 per single room of Prenestine, Centocelle, and so on.
In Neapoli, there are 300/450 euros for bed, room from 400 to 600 euros, with highest prices in Zones Policenico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Barra, they want 250/350 euros behind a bed, at least 350 per single room.
In smaller towns, prices are definitely lower, but they have greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where the most frequent rental for students from countries outside the European Union, one other anomalies are finally recorded: an increase of about 25-30% of the fee they want after foreign students compared to Italians.
Goodbye to the old cinema, Paradiso, cities ruin historical halls
Kinematographic historical halls are closed in favour of Multiplex.
"The place without movies is as blind, it's like a face without eyes."
The picture offered by the director Giusepp Tornator successfully documents what is happening in the large Italian city centres and rural cities.
The process of cinema constraints, the birth of large multisals in the suburb and the next disappearance of monosals in central urban zones is one of the events that seem to be inevitable and invertible but also has all signs of true cultural crime.
It's like we're losing a friend, a friend with whom we shared a piece of journey and a lot of emotions," the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that had won Tornator Oscar 20 years ago and a great price of jury in Cannes, and who told the poetry of a village movie and grief about the way of life that the movie probably lost forever.
The values obtained by Anecom, the main operator's association, are clear: in the last five years, the doors of 316 kins of traditional tips have been closed, and the highest account paid mainly the halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milana, Neapoli, Bologni and Rome, 6 less in Torina, 5 in Palerm.
Among the most infected regions, Emilia-Romagna is in the first place with the loss of 82 movie halls followed by Toscan (44) and Lombardia (41).
And the proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is a multiplication, these three Italian regions have registered the highest number of new kinematch multisals: for 195 paid more in Lombardia in the last five years, about 81 both in Toscan and in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian procedure has developed unracionally," says Paolo Protti, President Anecu," it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that these existing people will survive, because when one cinema closes the city, not all its visitors are willing to move into multiple.
Then let's not even talk about insufficient funds for operators: the previous state debt is approximately 10 million euros.
For moral and ethical terms, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
In order to support the sector, it would be necessary between 16 and 18 million euros a year."
Interesting is the Bologne case, the first Italian city that is concerned with the closing and which decided to find an exit by signing the protocol between the municipalities and the Anec, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small movies both in the historical centres and in the suburb.
Among the standards planned are tax relief steps for operators and benefits for the audience with regard to mobility: the viewers will be able to light into the area with limited transport and will have special prices to stop and on certain parkings.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures."
However, it is certain that in order to be able to stand against the great power of multiplication, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more difficult.
The defense of the traditional cinema is the theme that has always been important: closing the Super movie in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescentship, was an excrete that convinced me to create "New Cinema Paradiso", which I've been thinking about for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I've been walking before the Rialt or Quirinal in Naziionale Street, where I shared so many emotions that I don't have to look at the signs of black dust, I'll turn on the other side."
Liaison between politics and the mafian group 'dranghett, Mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The oldest of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the elections of the city's office according to the interests of the Pyromalli Mafia Group."
The charges that the Mafia Directorate in Kalabria against the Mayor and Deputy Gioie Tauro Giorgi Dal Torrione e Rosari Schiavone, and mayor Rosarn Carl Martellim, who was imprisoned this morning for external collaboration with the mafian organization, are difficult.
In the liss also, Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, the lawyer, the namen of the boss, already accused of committing mafian crimes, sentenced to award 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral standards, as well as a healthy mind," states the state representatives when two local administrations expressed their willingness to pay consultations to the attorney Piromalli.
"So the Mafia group would allow -- the judges – officially enter the city offices and facilitate so great possibilities for the control and governance of public administration."
The President of the Kalabrian Regional Commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and organized criminal subworld are many in its region: "There are areas where mafia focuses stronger than in other, where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have a lot of local politicians who resist the pressures of "andranghetti, heroes who are still improper."
The prisons of this morning follow after the July last year's imprisonment, by which the police showed that the Pyromalli mafian group had been finally intervened .
Since the end of April last year - the City Council of Gioia Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason was also expected to be linked between organised crime and local administration - local politicians were eliminated by functions in the general administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of Christian democrats, who was elected by the head of the right center after a closer choice in May.
He screamed about the scandal when Prefectura ordered the reconciliation of the general council.
He called on the responsibility of the Deputy Minister of the Interior, Marco Minni, and accused him of all of it for political reasons, but the judges in the detention Regulation signed this morning explain that the mafian group had grown even so far that he asked for a change in the road project A3.
From other interrogations ordered against Dal Torrion, the public prosecutors, showed "willing to move the rights of the entrepreneur, the representatives of a larger group very closer, as it is generally known, to Piromallimu and to adapt the elections of public administration to the interests of the Mafian group".
When the energy comes from the waves, they enter the big game.
It is an infinite bed that covers more than 70% of the earthly surface and now it begins to be discovered by large world energy companies.
The waves, streams, flows, the flows are new sources of unexhausable energy on which the vision of the coloss like Chevron, who is now trying to pull hands on these sources.
The possibility to create energy from sea movements has been studied for over a hundred years and in the 1970s, research has been intensified in connection with the first oil crisis.
When about 1980 oil price decreased, the idea of the use of marine energy went side. But now the environmental organisations and the new increase in oil prices gave the sector a new impulse.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 declared that approximately 15 percent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea waves.
This quantity would be a double energy which is currently produced in nuclear centres.
Besides, there are streams and flows and fluids.
The giant attacks.
The sea-based company was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build equipment in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it seemed to be a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more companies are more than more than traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies -- speaker of one company, which is connected to the United States oil coloss, in the economic daily Wall Street Journal -- and thinks about the possibility to cooperate with us."
Cooperation that we consider applies to obtain permission from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of the Sea Energy Project in Alaska.
We can't underestimate this signal, especially if we take into account that the Alaska of the United States continues to weigh oil and President Bush has recently arrived with a plan for new routing.
In addition to Chevron, the sea power trails and Verdant Power Inc. From New York and the Ocean Power from New Jersey and the invested sums, even though they are not detailed, show a growing interest in observers.
Technology, because it's necessary to develop.
Experts are talking about technology that is still in the first place because they do not know what effect the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
Meanwhile, the facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and it does not seem to cause great problems to ecosystem.
However, for more energy production, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on the media.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of combats that are connected between each other.
The force of the waves that moves up and down is changed by using wars and cylinders to hydraulic pressure within these fights.
The pressure turns the turbine that delivers energy to the generator.
Energy gets on the beach of submarine cables.
For now, there are four such type-approval facilities at the stage of projects, which are only waiting for federal approval and part of the energy could serve for military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdant Power is now making energy for the Shopping Centre and Parking by using six pdmore turbines in New York East River.
Water movement during the influenza and the flood causes the rotation of turbines that this rotating movement feeds the generator.
Verdant expressed that they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorization for the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the flood, and after the flood.
Special interest in this moment deserves the potential for aflow and fluid, they say in the Institute for Electric Energy Research.
Although it is an unrelated factor, aflow, and a flow are more predictable than wind, sun, or wave, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
Just in the energy of the influenza and detonation of States like New York, Maine and Alaska, even with other coastal states already invested $7 and a half million in 2008 and foretold up to $35 million for 2009.
