You're very pale.
She hesitated for a moment.
Could it be done?
I live in Istanbul.
Can I ask you a question?
I want us to be more than friends.
Can you explain to me?
I bought some food.
All things come to the end.
You just saved me a lot of time.
I wouldn't hurt them.
It was so cold that his teeth crushed.
What's your name?
Where's your dog?
This is the beginning of the new era.
He was Layla's dance partner alone.
A little bird told me.
Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he needed my help.
No doubt.
Just tell Tom I called.
We could use some help.
It was love at first.
Stop.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom's still frustrated.
I'd like to buy a dog.
Tom made it clear that he wouldn't do it.
Infrared and ultrafial airs are kinds of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit down for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
"Learn from your mistakes" and "Experience is the best teacher," they say, but on long ways even the best teacher is angry if he or she has too much to teach in a little time.
Share the tickets, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
There's almost no violence in that city.
They already have one.
You really don't have to do that.
Is your watch right?
I hope it'll be a dry time.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunch tomorrow?
At least 50 passengers died.
It wasn't my fault.
I know him well.
Are they in love?
No one knows what's going on behind that door.
I know everything.
How could I resist?
I bought a lot of things.
I'm just not very happy.
Let's see you, Tom.
There's no rule without exception.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
In our world, education is disappointing.
The first thing my mother said to me was, "Are you crazy?"
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Mario bought a microscope.
I've never been camping.
I only listen to you.
She's rarely mad.
Why do you want to hurt me so much?
Based on what we know he's innocent?
Did you wash the vessels?
When he returned from his duty to Afghanistan, Tom was chased by nightmares.
I made my decision.
My hands are cold.
Thank you so much!
The best lecture you can attend is what you don't understand.
It won't have any effect.
Don't blur.
Do you have the right one?
I need your help.
Don't you like swimming?
I'm a responsible person.
We have wine.
I wrote his number on a piece of paper.
Add more water.
How was your day?
What Tom suggests could save time to all of us.
Italy is a half island.
Beautiful!
He's pretty busy now.
We're not proud of it.
It's a Cuban cigarette.
That's his car.
Of course!
Tom cooks potatoes to make potato salad.
Everybody else.
Sign here.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what that is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
This is my wife Edita.
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Anyway, you're wrong.
It's hard to give up long-term love of one.
Tom likes extreme sports.
The strong commitment to the environment is not compatible with large investments in oil and gas.
I have a white horse.
Good luck!
Let's talk about this during lunch.
Where did you get that idea?
Say hello to your friends.
That company's on the lying legs because of bad debts.
How did I miss that?
Is breakfast involved in the price?
Tom said Mary was driving the car.
Tom hates strangers.
Fuck you!
We need to respect our personal rights.
What's that thing and your right hand?
Can I call you about 2:30?
Anybody in Disneyland with me?
Why is the picture of trains so interesting?
I don't usually write such songs.
It's really so simple.
That was a funny mistake.
What are you even eating?
Don't talk.
Call him whatever you want.
Don't run in front of the rude!
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do that, but he failed.
Jumi will be a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother is Yugoslav.
There must be a better way to do this.
That didn't matter to me.
He loves me tomorrow!
It's too loud for me here.
Tom must have tried to clean this up without a soap.
The rain was so rainful that we decided to visit him the other day.
I'm glad Tom won.
There's no one like you.
I don't want to work under these conditions.
Happy Christmas!
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
His disobedience pissed her off.
She refused my proposal.
The trains in Serbia are very slow.
In that case, let's go.
Tom wrote a long letter to Mary, but he didn't send it to her.
Gymnastic is his strong side.
He has a good memory.
Tom was fired.
The ends of the cold trunk.
Tom's not very nice.
He found himself a hero of a hero.
I really need Tom here.
I believe you're honest.
Come play with us.
Do you know Tom ever lied?
Mary's a Catholic, but her boyfriend is an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you are.
I'm proud of you.
I saw Marcus' house.
Tom arrived this morning.
He's pretty busy now.
Who is this man?
Here's some good news.
Refugees are welcome.
Many economists deaf about the fact.
I'm proud of my family.
Tom seemed very confused.
There was a list of available candidates.
How deep is that lake?
What year is your car?
What's your name?
You have three cats.
Tom never said anything about it.
You're too young.
Don't get distracted.
Tom never asked why.
I wouldn't hurt you.
We do not have such an example.
Come here.
Tom will know.
Her passport was stolen.
I know who killed him.
Did I ask you?
You can't touch it.
I've seen a lot for now.
Turn around!
Be nice.
What should I see?
It stinks.
It took four pounds of gold to get the winning medals.
I'll have dinner at seven.
Give me the sword.
He's not smart enough to collect numbers in his head.
Watch out for me, and I'll take care of you.
You have to trust me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you familiar with the man concerned?
Would you like to talk to Tom about me?
I bought this yesterday.
How do you say "cat" in Spanish?
We have to act now.
I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of dying.
Everybody says that.
Speak clearly.
I haven't seen him a long time ago.
We're here to play golf.
I haven't seen her a long time ago.
Actually, I've never met Tom.
Don't yell.
This one is unique.
I'm too old for something like this.
We're just gonna follow you.
Knowing yourself is very hard.
Save energy, you'll need it later.
This was a pleasant experience.
Tom's in the garage, working on his bike.
You're just shot.
My income decreased by ten percent.
You'll see her.
It can be hard to visit an unknown territory.
They're ready to talk about the problem.
A buried cheese.
Okay, you don't have that.
Finally!
Tom appreciates modern art.
After a long consideration, I finally randomly did things.
It's good.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen often?
They were walking along the beach.
We're reducing.
Can you talk to me?
Reduce the TV.
I'm wearing my shirts on my short sleeves.
Old people often talk to themselves.
Tom was hoping to become a famous writer.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
Tom showed me the poems he wrote when he was a teenager.
Where's Avis Shatter?
Don't be a droom rapist.
Tom could tell us how to do that.
I'm just leaving.
Tell him I'm innocent.
She spends three dollars a day for lunch and dinner.
I'll see you in your dreams.
Come in here.
I'll be home tomorrow.
I think you're stupid for that.
I've seen a lot for now.
I feel bad because I lied.
They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
The lawyer's task is to prove her client's innocence.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom will remember.
Why doesn't he just tell Tom?
If there's no porn with that, the porn will be made with it.
Canada is a hockey country on the ice.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean up your room?
Tom's saving so he could go abroad.
I don't intend to change.
I want to go to Bali.
You can do it if you try it.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
All right, what about you?
This is no doubt an extremely uncomfortable situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She's jumping every morning before breakfast.
This time it leads to town.
I'm not happy with that.
I burned my tongue.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't talk.
We had a bad fight.
What did science ever do for us?
Stop watching TV and start learning.
Turn left.
We don't know our neighbors.
You'll find the book in the library.
The police found the money stolen.
I've never seen that before.
I arrived here a few minutes before you.
Fantastic!
I didn't do that either.
How much is the bottle of beer?
Where's Tony?
I'd like to talk to Tony.
I'll be back later.
You smell nice.
It was obvious that Tom didn't want to kiss Mary.
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
That's the table.
Flowers flowers.
That's a shame!
His brother is a very capable doctor.
I'm sick of arguing.
I've got enough space.
What are you gonna do today?
I'm just thinking loud.
Don't yell.
I can't stop thinking about stolen money.
That train's over you.
Come see us.
Young man is often unthinkable.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not angry with anyone.
They need each other.
Let's get something to eat.
You think so?
Can we agree that we don't agree?
I'm trying to be careful.
It's always trouble when it's about my child.
Not yet.
She wants to study abroad one day.
Check this out.
Come fast!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of the painful memories.
You're absolutely right.
I don't know.
I'm convinced.
Add more water!
The music is important to me.
I worked on it a day in a day.
Do you have your favorite?
Please come.
Take it easy!
No one has a soul.
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
Where there's grass, there's no water, there's no water, there's no grass.
My friend got 95 points on the mathematics test.
Tom didn't let anyone else in the room.
Better sweet than forced.
I have a lot to do today.
You're in trouble.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
In Russian, there is no word "free."
I thought you'd be busy.
It's great.
Could that be true?
Quiet, Tom.
That bag is mine.
Tom left before I arrived.
Tell us a story about ghosts!
I hope Tom's safe.
We talked about it all night.
I want to live in town.
What are you gonna do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's get away.
That must have been hard.
Your wish is a command to me.
I'll call her tonight.
I had to make some hard decisions.
Tom's Mary's grandfather.
Ammonia is a base.
Check it again.
Are you honest?
That made sense to me.
She's been trained in the United States.
Tell me what I have to do.
Open your mouth!
Nothing's been told to me.
The fire expanded to the next building before the firemen arrived.
Tom didn't make friends as easy as Mary.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Bad time stopped me from leaving.
Tom bought the papers.
And that's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
The black smoke came out of the chimney.
I know a gentleman.
You'll never catch me alive!
It's one of the largest summer music festivals.
I was honest and honest.
It's time to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for a book.
Close your mouth and sit down.
What's this?
He took off.
Tom fell asleep again.
Don't move!
He's an American.
Tom's only talking to Mary.
No doubt.
The first lesson is easy.
You've been so fast.
Tom's gonna work.
I got off the train.
We're brother and sister.
I'm pretty good at doing more things at the same time.
No one is as fast as you are.
I agreed to buy that.
She's a bad mood.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please be honest with me.
Are you sarcastic?
Let your imaginations go.
All right, what about you?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove that?
You can't get in that room.
What did you do to me?
It's all here.
Why me?
Tom and Mary were wrong about it.
I'm not as tall as you are.
How many years have you been since I last saw you?
If you do it, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
You're a soul melem.
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I should never get involved in your stupid business.
The light's gone by itself.
Tom begged Mary to give him another chance.
Ask the cop!
We have five fingers on each hand.
We cooperated.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's saving to buy a yacht.
Everyone except Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
What are the papers writing?
The system has completed the repair after three years of volunteer work.
I need your signature.
She called me very late last night.
I had nothing to do with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
Naoko lives in a white house.
The new branch towards Haugesund will become the main effective road link to Oslo and East Norway for the entire Western region.
You failed me.
Good afternoon, how are you?
She got four e-mails.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom suspects Mary and I have something to do.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your age.
Tom managed to find Mary's house without trouble.
It's not easy sport.
Bitcoin's a crypto.
I'm just not gonna do that.
You shouldn't have bought that.
It's their right to vote.
It's hard to say what I think.
Tell me where you are.
Are we going to see Tom again?
Turn right on the next corner.
My mother cooks for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
The woman's eating bread.
I listened to music.
Are you involved in this?
Do you know why I'm here?
I hope he won't notice my mistake.
I must have eaten something bad.
We're leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Tom can't swim as he used to know.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Both answers are possible.
Tom's working too much.
Avoid the addicts on the color dilutor.
I liked that one.
He didn't hide his disappointment.
The boy has a horse.
Do you like roller-costers?
We're out of food.
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
It's a good time today.
Can you laugh at Tom?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
Springs of all countries, united!
I'm very impressed.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend a meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did that.
Italy is in Europe.
How many people were there?
I'm sure Tom's gonna miss me so much.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were kidding her.
You have the right to be happy.
I don't think anyone knows.
You have to work more.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom was turning around the room, not able to calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I found an empty cage.
Rest, Tom.
What does he want to do?
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come in sometime?
She wonders how it's possible.
Santa lives on the northern floor.
He was born in Ohio.
Please go.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You chose a beautiful one.
Look at how much she is!
I was trying to be nice.
Mary's a wedding planer.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to interfere?
I have difficulty talking about my feelings.
I'll give you everything you want.
That's their book.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were kidding her.
I'm not sure when Tom will be here.
You should come home.
Alice was smiling.
She can't bribe.
Will you turn off the light?
I'll save you.
I'll let you know.
We can look at Tom in a suit, behind a black big piano with dramatic finger moves, creating a very pleasant music that is very pleasant to listen.
The strong winds broke a lot of tree branches last night.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
We need to prepare a field for negotiations.
Shouldn't you be preparing for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
They laughed for his mistake.
The way to a man's heart leads over his stomach.
Every ship needs a captain.
It's time to get up.
The house is built with a brick.
I didn't write this.
I went down to the wrong bus station.
I can't without feeling partially responsible.
People were good to me.
I know this is weird.
Tom's out of the vision now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary will leave today.
Have you ever tried?
Dr. Jackson has a good relationship with the patient.
My father lives and works in Tokyo.
Are you a student?
Can I scratch for a cigarette?
I could go with you.
Take a little.
Come in.
Burg Kalifa is currently the highest cloudstone in the world.
How many covers are on the bed?
You really don't have to do that.
Why are you so smart?
I'm cooking lunch.
I wonder what Tom is planning to do.
I was fat.
You need to know how to read the notes in order to extend the choir.
Tom's drowned.
They wanted an apology.
Where was I wrong?
Our school was founded in 1990.
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you later.
Why me?
Obviously, I was too optimistic.
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in the house.
You're not finished yet?
You're very unsuccessful.
He's making good money.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
The zoo is closed on Monday.
That's the point.
Knowing foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It's very natural for human beings to always take advantage of the interests of others.
I'm eating here.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I've got a lot of things planned for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
He was pronounced captain of the football team.
Why are you still awake?
I was attending school yesterday.
Tom's doing what he's told.
I'm still working.
Desperate, insensitive children can sometimes grow up in sociopates.
I'd like it to be with you.
The police's job is to stop and investigate crime.
Can you give me the remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
After you.
We all work too hard.
I'm Ricardo.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom's learning very quickly.
You're different.
She's not aware of the hate of others.
This will make our job much easier.
He loves football.
What time can you come?
The monks were able to play tennis in the monasteries.
No one trusts him anymore.
Keep the kids away from the drugs.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I was wondering if I might have a dream.
Everything's changing in time.
No one's going anywhere.
The game can be delayed until next week.
I have a soul.
Drive to work from an hour and a half.
It's right.
Your time will come soon.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do that.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorce.
He's here.
I'll come up with something.
It all started a year ago when he came home.
Play it again, Sam.
You're drinking coffee?
Some of us think that such views are just crazy.
It's working.
Someone could be hurt.
Tom didn't write any letter to Mary while he wasn't there.
We're sick of you.
You're not gonna be able to handle this job.
We all know Tom was guilty.
She's a Chinese woman.
I don't want a vodka.
We need to be reasonable.
I'll be back.
Look at these.
He needs it.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom pulled the thicker end.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
I'm more worried about you than about the future of Japan.
I couldn't feel sorry for him.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a mild torment.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's okay.
I've read about a hundred books before.
I've promoked to the skin.
Come play with us.
And that was just with great pain.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Not a lot of people know it exists.
Did you write the number?
That's not a reason for panic.
I only got 20 points on the mathematics test.
The worst headaches have been caused by insufficient ideas.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I married.
Explore this.
What's your name?
They're trying.
My future is in your hands.
He's a liar, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
Tom's cold blood.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him a day earlier.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
Can you distinguish the silver from the cossiter?
Hands up!
I'm not practicing as much as I should.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
She's not speaking English, it's not French.
That's so sad.
How clever!
You should know better.
Shortly speaking, I disagree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not having fun with anyone, are you?
She's a teacher.
Without water, it's impossible to live.
I've been playing piano a long time ago, so I can still do a little bit.
Is this your glass, or your sisters?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter represented two generations.
We finally arrived!
He's in good hands.
He drew himself to work in the garden for two hours a day.
Apples and circuits are presented, not gold and green forests.
I'm resting my legs.
Professor's excuse is almost perfect.
Do you want to learn something specific?
I really like to practice.
I love you!
I'm really proud of it.
We were in the last place.
I've contributed.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
I can read German, but I can't say that.
That doesn't look like you.
She has achieved her goal.
I'm twice older than Tom.
Crazy has crossed the border.
Isn't that black?
This isn't a child book.
You're absolutely right.
Come sit next to me.
We know we're better than that.
It's like I don't know that!
Let's not talk about this now.
Have fun.
It's time to break up.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
They know you.
He was the son of a rich merchant.
The meeting statement is ready.
I said I'd be waiting for you.
She looks good for her age.
What's this?
What are you even eating?
I don't like being convicted.
I have an appointment tonight.
Tom enjoys fishing.
A man hopes as long as he's alive.
Be careful.
Let's discuss options.
Don't worry, if you help me, everything's gonna be okay.
I've been screwed out of miracles.
That was a funny movie.
We just saw her.
Bitkoin is a crypto.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom's gonna take care of this.
Go check it out.
Some of us hate that.
"This came for you." "Oh..." "Oh, do you remember the one she sent to you when you asked her to give you the pictures of the Eplexe's brother?" "Yes." And then she told you to write the criticism of Mac's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent the criticism of Mac." "Yes." "What did you tell her that you learned from it?" "I realized that Philips' s scratch is persuasive, but not deceptive; and that Rerity is a severely charge of things that I think she should do as a friend."
I always liked horror-films.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I overlook that?
I don't want to take you any more time.
I'm only going to church for respect for my mother.
It's better to live one day like a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.
"Has he explained?" "Yes."
Not every light of magic.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
He killed himself.
I was very excited.
You don't have to eat right before you get to bed.
Tom's gonna wait.
What's going to happen now?
I need five more minutes.
The students didn't know how to answer.
It's ashamed of lying.
I'm not a nightbird.
Did you get the package I sent you?
I'm not a doctor.
My baby wants to talk.
It's good to see you again.
Tom bought me a VIP ticket.
I'm fat.
I'm the one who should do that.
Tom's gonna call.
He fired the torch before he got into the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a very good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom quit college.
Why do you hate me so much?
What am I doing here?
Tom will understand.
Those girls are very busy.
Give us some room.
There's the truth about what Tom says.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your screaming.
Get out!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make way.
The horse must have screwed up and the knight fell off the horse.
I didn't forget.
There are islands on the sea.
I'm looking into it right now.
The mini skirts are again modern.
What are we actually looking for?
She has achieved her goal.
Tom can do what he wants, for me.
Tom said he needed money.
Tom was pretty good.
Hurry up a little!
He couldn't understand much of what they said to each other.
This medication will make your headache easier.
He disappeared without a lead.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what both of them like.
We've been sitting together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He's never going on the train.
He's dependent on Starbuck Coffee.
The book's on the table.
Two sides will make speeches this week.
I plan to give my son a computer at the end of the month.
The paper's stronger than the paper.
Why did you shave your beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
Fadil changed his mind.
I've never noticed that before.
It's happening.
We know who he is.
I need a cab.
I saw the cat.
I'm in the gips.
Mom just went to shopping.
It's her, isn't it?
I'm proud of you.
I'm always nervous about passport control.
That needs help.
Protect yourself.
He got a cab to the hospital.
This overcomes all the borders.
My house is looking south.
I miss you so much.
Do you know how to jongle?
Don't touch the lion while he's sleeping.
Tom's unpleasant.
Could it be alive?
Did you just meet him?
Honestly to be, I don't know.
It's your choices.
That makes sense.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.
I saw the dogs.
Maybe she has other plans?
This isn't a sentence.
Thank you all for coming.
The patient's breathing.
Thank you all for that.
I don't see anything suspicious.
This evidence doesn't leave a place of suspicion, this can't be the original Picass.
Am I so different?
He concentrated on it.
Whose manuscript is this?
I have to go.
It feels good.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Let's have lunch here.
It's a window of glass.
I'll find the money somehow.
I shot a bear.
I'm sad to leave.
This fish is big.

Tom was very happy when his team won.
They decided to get married.
What did you two do?
She's Argentina.
I doubt Tom is at all interested in trying to learn Russian.
I'm afraid you understood this wrong.
I know those girls.
What's this?

What's your name?
I'm done.
The man is part of nature.
I wasn't very impressed with that.
Tom wanted to see Mary's room.
I left Tom 2013.
Do you know anything about Tom?
I'm drinking coffee.
Pick one.

I'm looking for a job.
I'd better go with Tom.
Let's try it.
I'm leaving it to you.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Tom really knows a lot.
That needs a dream.
That's what I have to tell Tom.
We're ready to go.
I don't live in that city.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
Tom's no longer a child.
I thought you'd be busy.
Don't move!
I'm vegetarian.
It's my habit to do that.
I have a sharp knife.
Tom asked me if he could use my computer.
I took him to the most expensive restaurant in campus.
That's very nice of you.
I've heard this joke before.
I think I missed something.
They were flying from Berlin to Istanbul.
Send Tom in.
Tom asked me some questions about what just happened.
I'll let you know.
I reacted instinctively.
The answer to this question is simple.
I'll make sure that Tom has everything he needs.
I'm deeply embarrassed.
Mom just went to shopping.
He was naked and boss.
She's just out of my league.
What are we actually looking for?
I want to be with her.
Why are you all in shock?
Apples are red.
Why do you think so?
Schools and roads are services paid by taxes.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Don't push.
Looks like we're just the two of us.
They don't pay you enough.

How long did Tom have it?
Mom, I'm hungry.
We all want to see a movie.
I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.
We can save some time if we do what Tom suggests.
If you want to talk to a lot of people, you should learn Esperanto. Why is this language? Because it is beautiful and stimulating our learning at the same time. The international language is very important because there are so many people from different countries around the world. Besides, Esperanto is not only useful but also easy to learn. If you learn Esperanto, you can travel to many countries. Come and learn!
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
Did you sleep?
I'll take you to Tom.
He's watching the olympics.
Could that be Tom?
A little bird told me.
I have three beautiful grandchildren.

You're good to everyone.
Tom showed him to heaven.
I didn't care.
That's not true, is it?
She has twenty children.
Tom said he didn't see anything weird.
I think we'll get to Boston before darkness.
You never arrived in time.
That sounds like betrayal to me.
I'll try not to disturb you while you're studying.
Life is short.
What was I supposed to do?
Why do you think Tom would do that?
They'll know.
I didn't have a good time last night.
You're innocent.
All the participants gathered in the main hall.
Don't exaggerate.
Hey, relax.
I'm sure you're very busy.
When Marcus came, I slept.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Tom's going to move forward.

Tom was totally scared.
Whose guitar is this?
Greece has many islands.
This won't hurt anywhere.
We have to run away.
The thief ran away.
We can't stop Tom from doing that.
I'm not selective.
Eat everything.
That's what I used to do.
Get out of here!
Tom's still at work.
Tom wasn't very good.
You better think when you close.
Anything else?
Anyway, you're wrong.
You need more than coffee.
That's normal.
Are we all here?
He knows a lot of people.
I'm turning around.
I feel bad because I lied.
Tom stood in pain.
Anything or nothing.
I left my credit card in the house.
Everybody says I look like my father.
Do they love each other?
I've contributed.
I'll sign it.
Shame him.
Exactly.
We hope you like it.
Let me in.
Will the future be like scientific fantastic?
It just happened again.
How long have you been here?
Tom's rich and free.
The book is dry.
My mother bought two bottles of orange juice.
What would you like to know?
Live long and feel good!
We met each other in London.
That's not exactly my job.

To be honest, I don't know.
Can I get your e-mail, please?
I hope she'll be fine.
The wind calmed down.
I can't make him happy.
This is communism.
There are subtle differences between these two pictures.
In my bedroom, I have a mirror from the floor to the ceiling.
I wish I had remembered that.
Don't sound like that.
What can you do?
Excuse me, can you repeat that?
Get out of there.
Scientists interpret it in a different way.
When can you come?
The Festival was held in Latvia.
Life starts then, when we figure out who we are actually.
We're what we are.
Your time's up.
Some people, regardless of their age, don't lose their beauty.
Where did you get that idea?
She let me go.
You didn't answer the question.
We're in.
Let him pay for what he did.
She also loves books.
I'll stay home tomorrow.
No one's coming to save you.
I don't want to do that.
Tom always bothers me.
I have a good vision.
Are you ready?
She's proud of her talent.
This box is almost empty.
You can start right now.
Are you done?
You need one of these.
Sit down.
I'm impressed with you.
I can't decide where to park.
Cool!
Failure is a spice that tastes success.
How's this your fault?
Security has been increased in the city.
My wife's name is Lidia Zarubowa.
Cheers!
Tom will stay.
Who discovered that island?
That boy's talking like he's an adult.
The carrots cost three dollars.
My bike is new.
Tom told me today he loved me.
I doubt Tom knows that.
Can I escort you home?
I've already tried that.
Go upstairs.
There's no parking allowed.
I'm running early.
Tom thinks the same way.
This is what it says:
It's so important.
Turn left.
No way!
How long have you stayed?
Tom's a passionate bike.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
He'll be here soon.
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
Let's take a look.

Tom's family used to move.
Will you join us?
What did you learn today?
We liked food, especially fish.
And they lived happy for the rest of their life.
Tom's too poor to hire a lawyer.
You're very rude.
Don't be disgusting.
Read this.
I walk like a penguin.
I'm interested.
What's the problem?
He's not a doctor.
Tom was accidentally made.
Marcus became a Uzurpator.
Is he a handsome man of Arab or Hindi?
Let's meet you for a drink.
I'm forgetting where I leave my hat.
It's sunny today, but cold.
He screwed up again.
I want to see the ocean, too.

I'll try.
Am I ever wrong?
What's the name of that restaurant?
It's official business.

The temperature of the sun's surface is about 6000°C.
He asked himself a lot of questions about Islam
If we leave right now, we'll get to Boston by 2:30.
What did you two do?
Where's Tom going to sleep?
Emily was surprised.
I'm not ready yet.
Why would Tom want that?
It's hard to figure out what really happened.
She passed her fingers through her hair.
Tom's working hard to stand up with his family.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Tom's downstairs.
Tom says he has four houses in five different countries.
We arrived at a hotel in Rome.
Let's see what Tom says.

You want to meet him?
That's better.
Look over there.
In the morning, we found a screwed dolphin.
I'm reading this book.
Just tell me you're okay.
Please take this little gift.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I'm not afraid of getting old.
I don't fully agree with you.
There's a lot of possible answers to that question.
Let's eat ice cream right now, before it's soaked.

I've done it with a hard heart.

Have you seen anyone there?
Of course!

What if I'm right?
I'd like to know how to paint like that.

I had trouble dealing with this problem.
I don't know what it's not, yet or just before, it was good, but several times when I was trying to make a role on the site today, I couldn't do it.
Do I usually seem happy?
I went there with my will.
You think better when you close your eyes.
That's absolute truth!
They really meant that.
Have you ever been here?
I want your opinion.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
They're all here.
We're almost done.
Maybe they need something to eat.

Please be honest with me.
Tom stayed a few days.
Tom could be here.
It's good to have a daughter.
Tom's been complaining all the time.
I don't know if I'll have time.
I'll do everything for you.
I didn't understand the question.
It was just a matter of time.
Don't mess up.
You should be able to change.
I'm happy.
Does Tom have a cable?
I don't want to live in a big town.

Why should I tell Tom?
Let your imagination go.
Tom knows the names of all his customers.
Tom's keeping over 80% of what he's earned.
Are we safe now?
We're what we are.
He's not honest at all.
That's wonderful!
The note's not yours, it's hiss.
We need to act now.
Mother's a woman.
That's great!
Tom knows what he likes.
I'm discreet.
You helped me a lot.
What was I supposed to do?
The password is Muriel.
We visited the hipodrom, visited the horse race.
Identify yourself.
I'm really happy about that.
One day you'll understand.
I was looking for you.
Thousands of thousands of elephants were killed annually for their white bone.
It just has to be like that.
I'll come when I can.
Don't get dressed.
It's not all the gold that shines.
Are we all here?
The girl's seeing the boy.
That's great!
We need to focus on our virtues.
How fast!
The dog is mine.
He's been living in Istanbul for years, speaking Turkish very well.
Goodbye!
She never saw him.

Luckily, I survived the accident.

I'm not giving up!
Tom fell off the truck while feeding Irvasa.
Tom became a ballman, even though his parents wear it they wanted.
The whole house's burned.
I think we've met before.
I've been wrong before.
Can you tell us more?
Tom knows it's over.
It's treason.
I'm not late, am I?
Let's go get Tom.
Tell me where you live.
There's a mistake in the sentence.
You don't remember anything?
Are we ready to go?
Tom's drinking a lot.
I'm not here.
That's quite a problem.
Tom was sitting on the grass under the coconut tree.
Everybody laughed.
I'm more creepy than I look.
I don't want you to see me naked.
Can I go?
Tom doesn't like to do that.
Excuse me, who's this woman?
Do you have a copy?
Come help me.
I barely got out of the house when she started raining.
Tom likes to be busy.
All right, as always.
First of all.
Tom's just lazy.
I'm a little bothered.
Does that mean you love me?
Is Tom eating fish?
The garage was frozen.
Check this out.
Mary is a married woman.
Is there any proof?
You have to be strong!
It's never too late for learning.
I'd like to rent your cheapest car for a week.
Are you ready for more?
It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Do you love me? - He asked.
I told Tom you were in Australia.
Tom's turned the blink on.
Tom always makes me laugh.
She rarely, perhaps never, goes to bed 11 hours ago.
Are they all crazy?
What are you even eating?
It's not a problem.
Everything happens for a reason.
How weird he is.
There are four people in my family.
Are your languages relative?
That bag is mine.
I'm pulling the line here.
Tom has all kinds of problems.
Attention to school rules.
Keep digging.
What school did you go to?
A few trees fell during the storm in our neighborhood.
Can I hear another one?

Tom had to rewrite the composition.
You want to get involved?

Tell me what this says.
That's not a threat.
He lives alone in the woods.

He's good.

I'm not upset anymore.
Did Tom change his mind?
Get out of here.
Do you think what she said was a lie?
His younger brother is a famous footballer.
I was too busy.
Would you rather speak English?
Get lost.
I already ordered it.
What are you teaching?
How does that work?
Will we see Tom again?
You're different.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
That's my job, not Tom's.
Tell me what that is.
He's delayed his departure until tomorrow.
Tell him I'm innocent.
You're doing good, just relax.
I'd like to help.
It would be hard.
She's making his meals.
Where did you learn English?
Beauty lies in the eyes of the observers.
How do you feel today?
That needs a reason.
Okay, what's a secret?
I watched Tom die.
Are we starting soon?
Did you see me dancing?
Tom obviously was here early this morning.
I think it'll be a nice day.
I'm starving.
Naoko lives in a white house.
Tom's drinking beer.
Tom's playing piano very well.

You're just shot.
I'm here for you.
Have you ever heard of something like that?
I'm not rich enough.
Leanne has blue eyes.
Seniors should pay their hats and dresses.
Does she see me?
Don't move!
Tom was guilty of everything.
I've been training for months.
Did you bring a fan?
What was the plan at all?
You need to be here at half an hour later.
Do you speak Chinese?
Tom said no one was hurt.
Maybe Tom was involved.

I saw a Nile horse in the zoo.
Aren't you from Australia?
It's the size of the third city in Serbia.
I think about Tom sometimes.
Are you both drunk?
Please be honest with me.
It's hers, isn't it?
She's griefing my life.
I've never been home for a week.
Don't go out tonight.
Open fire!
She's my professor.
It's not easy to entertain Tom.
I told Toma to wait.
He's a man of word.
I'll see if Tom can help us.
It broke into two parts.
Please hurry.
Smoking is forbidden in every part of the restaurant.
They're digging a hole.
Muriel's 20.
Have you eaten anything?
I'm in the mail.
Did you go to see Tom?
Attack!
Tom's gonna make it.
Why are you acting like a child?
That's exactly what the doctor ordered.
Could you read it?
It's a window from the glass.
Are you done yet?
My knife is sharp.
Does Tom have the key?
The doctors look at the X-ray.
Don't talk.
Don't stop.
Are you sure this is safe?
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know.
You'll be better in a few days.
That's what Tom would like us to do.
He tried to kill himself.
Tom said I should ask you.
Everyone knows that.
She enjoyed the party yesterday.
Just tell me the truth.
Birds sing.
Be careful: We write nationality, days in the week and tongues with a large letter in English.
I love watching you work.
Birds fly.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not upset at all.
As far as we know, Tom is guilty.
I love you.
Tom's a book mole.
I changed my mind.
The problem is, it's too expensive.
Many would love to be motivated, creative, thoughtful creatures, only if they could get that chance.
I've been thinking a lot about what you said.
Did Tom pull out the thicker end?
I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of dying.
We like him.
That's a good answer.
You sound tired.
Tom was wrong about that.
I don't need anything.
Tom always makes a mess of things.
He ran.
That's not the right thing.
Please record everything I say.
Without torture, there's no science.
I wish you could sleep.
Maybe you can't hear me.
We're barbecue.
I'm mad at you.
I thought you were married.
I'll find the money somehow.
I assumed you were busy.
He's not a scientist, but he's our friend.
I hear Tom's interested.
We should move forward.
What are your ambitions?
I don't like eating a white bowl in the morning.
I think Tom is very smart.
Do you really want to learn another language?
Fish, please.
I think I'm fat.
I think we were lucky.
Don't talk.
Does French learn in your school?
Come get a drink with me.
If I could understand, I'd say so.
You're running.
I did my first step.
Stop screaming.
It's Saturday.
They were evacuated to the American Polish Hospital.
We'll run in the park.
How far is it from here?
You can't sit next to me.
I'm not happy about that.
Could you read it?
Will you dance with me?
We need to call Tom.
Tom's not strong enough.
We need more flour.
Tell me what he says here.
And Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I'm staying.
His way of speaking bothers me.
I've never thought about it like that.
I know Tom let you down.
He's always unsatisfied.
Tom was severely hurt.
My shirt is not dry yet.
If you need help, tell me.
I did my first step.
I'm still a little tired.
I'm sure there's a better way to do that.
First leaves at 17:30 and at 20:25.
That was a little weird.
The plants are growing.
Does that read and write Japanese?
Tom put a ticket on his desk.
I called him.
It was just an accident.
Tom never even saw us.
Mom, I'm hungry.
I don't intend to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
It usually works.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
I locked the bike.
And now the word from our sponsor.
I'm not very satisfied with the condition.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him as a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad to be here.
Stay calm.
I'm armed.
Tom can't stop.
Our eyes can't see infrared lights.
It's time to sleep.
Tom's very intelligent.
Can I replace this?
Tom wanted to have a more beautiful cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.
Did you bring a phenomenon?
I already ordered it.
We'll never know the reason.
How are you feeling?
Everybody tells me I'm weird.
Bitcoin and etherium are virtual currency.
It's all very cheap.
Anything you remember can help.
Many predictions are not realized.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm still wrong.
Turns out it's true.
I'm sick.
Did you get the book back to the library?
Fadil wanted to steal Danie's money.
Tom likes a good party.
I don't care what he says.
Mary knows all about the latest fashion trends.
He's a man with many talents.
Where's the smoke, there's a fire.
Tom was Mary's first love.
The proposal was implemented by voting hands up.
He often quotes Shakespear.
Keep listening.
Tom may have to stay here for a few days.
We know her.
My father doesn't like football.
This hat is from Australia.
The accident happened on Sunday at 3:00.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Go take a look.
That doesn't affect him at all.
I thought food was great.
Fifty families live in this small village.
Tom is an activeist in his community.
I'm deaf and nomine while I eat.
You look fat.
Tongue learning is not easy.
You got a headache?
You have to learn English a step by step.
That's better now than he was before.
Tom and Mary are different as heaven and the earth.
Tom asked me about the opinion of who will win the race.
Man has a lot of desires that he does not really wish to fulfill and would even be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only wishes, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment for him. One of these desires is and the desire of everlasting life. If it was fulfilled, a man would become completely sick of everlasting life, and would want to die.
Water is fluid.
Does Tom really speak French?
I can't trust him.
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car alone.
She's taking care of her old mother.
Italy is far from Brazil.
Tom had the same problem.
Don't laugh.
My wife's father is my girlfriend.
I want to live in town.
Tom and I just wrote a few books together.
I think this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.
There's news.
No one really wants us.
Everyone paid for it.
Be careful.
Yogurt was made of milk and cream.
I'm alone.
All right, what about you?
Don't drink water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
It was just the beginning.
The book's been sold out.
The price of gold is changing every day.
Be nice.
Look around!
Tom married.
I could come with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
He's a scientist.
You have no permission to enter that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is it interesting to paint trains?
I hope you like it.
Welcome back.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a screw.
We can't go back.
I'll take a shower.
What are you planning to do this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Can anything be more romantic?
Betoven wrote nine symphonys.
I'll hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
That's not our business.
Do you like costumes?
Why do you ask?
I saw Marcus' house.
At least he's honest.
It's really pretty bad.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't follow us.
And you, Brut?
The house in which Atturk was born in thessalonic.
People are wrong.
Snow falls.
I thought you needed help.
Does this make sense?
I like your glasses.
He was chosen to be president.
He has two cars.
That was three months ago.
I know your name.
Let's hear your excuse.
Dad said no.
They formed a swim team.
Tom took the package to the orphanage.
Keep digging.
Tom jumped up and down.
Tom's dog was lying.
Don't talk.
This information is confidential.
You taught us that.
Nope.
Go find something else to do.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
You're not leaving me, are you?
Don't exaggerate.
I can't approve this project.
Are you sending a message to Mary?
I'll keep your place in the first row.
Mary's pushing her kids to play football.
Are they here yet?
Don't forget to give me my pen back.
Little flowers flower at night.
I was counting up to 200.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
One day, you should try.
I'll stay home with my grandmother and grandfather for the weekend.
What have you concluded?
I prayed for you.
No, that's all.
Come to my house.
Tom's on the edge of the nerve.
The bathroom's upstairs.
It's Christmas tomorrow.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom cheated on you.
Tom reads a lot.
It's just a few minutes from here.
What do you know about me?
He wants to work in the hospital.
I'm not saying anything.
I got off the bus.
You're average students.
In a childhood, many violent criminals have tortured animals without reason.
I'll live in Cambodia.
How long are you gonna be angry and yelling at us?
Please stop here.
How much does that really matter?
Do we want aperitive?
Tom's always complaining.
If you want, I'll teach you to play ukuleles.
I'm already used to it.
It's not that bad.
Looks like she was offended by what he told her.
I like to play the music that my friends wrote.
Tom admitted that.
I was there twice.
Deeds say more than a word.
Is this where Tom sits?
Enough!
It's hard to work with you.
Tom's got a pinch.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
I'm guilty.
Don't answer.
Bring some wine.
Things aren't always the way they seem.
Show me the photos!
It's necessary to destroy a few old houses.
What were you doing?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom sneaked into the party.
I'm so tired I can't learn.
I've never seen his face.
Tom's very careful.
When are you going to go?
This report has not been written well.
I want a new bike.
She stresses that this last move of the government has a multiplied meaning.
They say love is blind.
Tom arrived this morning.
It took about a year.
How did I miss that?
Tom didn't answer me.
The five brothers worked together at the farm.
It could be a trick.
The company is known by its high quality products.
Don't forget to smash yourself with the sunshine.
Tom didn't try to deny Mary's judgment.
Tell me what this is.
Thank you for accepting my request for a friend at Facebook.
His hair was covering his face almost all over.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh country in the world by size.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clean the snow off the roof?
I'll pay you back.
Why is he here?
A student from Oslo who fake his diploma to enter college was convicted to prison.
Tom knows it's over.
I wish that had come to my mind.
Tom made vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You were really nice to me.
I'll finish reading this book.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the vessels?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I normally look happy?
It's not the issue of the essay itself, but all these tormental questions and the explanations of the words make me crazy!
He's here on the weekend.
I'll be back next week.
Looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
I really want to see her.
That was a lucky shot.
I thought Tom was incredible.
I've never seen anything like that before.
I'm buying a lot of things in that store.
Did you get the package I sent you?
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
He started screaming.
I'll come when I finish my homework.
Clean up a little.
Can I use your dictionary?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people love chicken.
Is Tom crazy?
I didn't do that either.
Are you ready?
Let's take a look again.
The last time I went to the beach, I burned hard.
Stand back.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Watch out here, Tom.
We've fixed some damage caused by spraying stones on your car.
I've become a retirementary after 40 years of work in the office.
Why are you suddenly curious?
His girlfriend didn't provide support.
I just had a bath.
Do you doubt me?
Luckily, Tom didn't hurt himself seriously.
Generally, kids love sweets.
Tom's gonna cry.
We need your help.
I think we've eaten enough.
You scared us.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try in your way.
Tom decided to take a day off.
How could I resist?
Gold is much harder than water.
The phone is a wonderful device.
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car alone.
One language is never enough.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
This is the address.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I married.
Don't let anyone in!
What would Tom think?
We're not going into that.
It happens to everyone sooner or later.
This is my question.
Hold on, Tom.
Tom definitely pulled out the thicker end.
Follow me.
I don't care what your name is.
He's not equal.
It's all right with me.
Obviously Tom's sick.
I started learning English when I was twelve, and then I was interested in languages, but not in that measure. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; so, it's time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember that song.
I'm Ricardo.
I need a honest girl.
She's a starter.
Are they still here?
I'm sure Tom's gonna miss me so much.
Tom won't run away.
I'd go.
I'm not taking bribes.
Get down!
Tom couldn't stand it.
Anything you remember can help.
You'll be better in a few days.
What language are you talking about?
It's not something to worry about.
I understand they're a trunk in the eye of those like you, but this is just poor.
Tom's gonna make it.
There's no free lunch.
And what if I'm a homosexual?
Nevertheless, he will certainly come.
Please leave this place clean as long as you wish to find it.
We'll go through the jungle somehow.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
We can only do that.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
That's your life.
What's your name?
I understand.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I'm crying.
I sympathize.
Stop regretting yourself.
He'll be done soon.
Learn yourself by doing it.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
The police are chasing me.
Have you seen anyone there?
Anyway, you're wrong.
They won't take it.
There's no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
There are all kinds of flowers in the garden.
No one said anything.
The book's on the table.
He's a real aristocrat.
I'm doing my job.
It's all quiet again.
I didn't make it.
We know.
Tom's going to a graphical design school.
He lied to you.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always unsatisfied.
Music is his passion.
You should face reality.
Light waves pass through space and different materials.
We managed to escape right in time.
I'm tired of it.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
Cartage must be destroyed!
How much does that cost?
I want to talk to Tom about it.
We have some options.
It should work.
She hated him.
As far as I'm concerned, I don't oppose your opinion.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I could talk to Tom.
It just happens.
Take a little.
Who knows what's going to happen tomorrow?
I'm hungry of this running.
I'm a translator.
It was hot in every sense of that word.
Spider me a pin.
He talks about others so he'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused that he didn't even know which question to ask.
Are you ready?
Find Tom.
It seems okay to me.
Whatever you think?
You changed my life.
We'll get through the jungle somehow.
Reaction is not always the best way to act.
I'm not going to tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to take him to the airport.
The Committee recommends that those who have complained should be compensated with a proportionate part of the annual compensation for interest.
Tom was buying time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of overreal.
In theory, it's possible, but in practice it's very difficult.
I don't have time to write.
It's time to get up.
It was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
That's my money, too.
Anyway, it's over.
Tom's upset.
Remember the file names before attempting to reproduce the deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom ran down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.
Only a vodka from Russia is a real Russian vodka!
I wasn't nervous about it.
Tom said he wouldn't be waiting for us.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
We won't let you die.
Many things go out of my hand.
Tom wants to teach his children the importance of work.
Tom was always a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Is it yours?
Tom is one of the best attorneys in Boston.
How much am I gonna get?
How many close friends do you have?
It's happening.
How long do you think Tom was preparing for an exam?
Some book that describes miracles of nature.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You don't have to be hit by stones in the glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
He's breathing.
I tried to get Tom home.
I'd get involved.
You can't touch that.
Don't be a scratch.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
Mary is a retired nurse.
I'm probably not watching TV tonight.
Did Tom pull out the thicker end?
Give me all the money.
Mer was very supportive.
That's nice shoes.
The girl's seeing a boy.
We also call Robert Bob.
It's very hard, almost impossible to find an apartment in Oslo.
My French still isn't very good.
They're teachers.
The government fell after the vote in parliament.
You're not funny.
Tom left instead of Mary.
It's not yours, it's hiss.
It happened right here.
He was driving a car on the street.
I don't know well Latin.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I don't speak Japanese.
He didn't understand anything.
I'm waiting for my turn.
That's not the main question.
I've been shaken by a lot of news.
The girl eats bread.
I don't speak English.
You're not the one who died.
Would you rather tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
I'm a woman.
Tom asked for help.
It's not like that.
They know you.
I've done every test.
What are you gonna do today?
What's up with you?
I'm gonna kill you!
I was cold as a syringe.
There's no point just to wait for something to happen; you have to do something right away.
Here's the key to my apartment.
It's a area with a lot of new houses.
I can't believe all this.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
The snow was falling yesterday.
We walked through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid one backup key in his garden.
Let's pretend we're aliens.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I went out to the wrong bus station.
I wrote this song only for you.
Your house, your freedom.
Have you read the Holy Bible?
And if I was rich, I wouldn't give him the money.
Are we safe now?
Stop it!
We've been studying all afternoon.
Are you going to send this as a mail shipment?
What are you suggesting?
They say love is blind.
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Watch out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
The room is dark.
Come on, give me that.
Are you blaming me?
I wish I was beautiful.
For some strange people, the knowledge of some language is kept secret.
I don't intend to change.
They slowly moved forward.
Why is love so heavy?
I survived.
Do you know how this machine is used?
I'm late, right?
Don't be distracted.
Blue stands for you.
Come visit us soon.
Have you been in an accident?
What are you and Tom doing?
Tom's worried about what could happen.
He was a honourable man.
My father doesn't like football.
I don't know if I'll have time.
I went there voluntarily.
We're all out of alcohol.
Card, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
Something was lying on the ground.
Children are flowers of our life.
Why are we laughing?
My friend lives to God behind his feet.
Do you think Tom would like to go fishing with us next weekend?
She screamed him, but he didn't hear her.
Water is life.
What are you gonna do today?
He will probably win the championship.
After silence, what precisely expresses innocent is music.
Tom looks like a banker.
That's Tom.
It's not over until it's over.
Tom still looks worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary's a very shy girl.
Where's the vodka?
Tom doesn't have any such problems.
You can't hide secrets from me.
It just happened again.
There's a hard day waiting for you.
It's good.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I'm not going to participate.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be fully satisfied.
Tom and Mary would be a beautiful couple.
How do you say XXX in the Dutch?
Don't work too much!
I'm so fat.
Let's stay in there tonight.
I thought Tom was incredible.
People don't always act rational.
I didn't do that either.
Did you pass the exams?
We'll have to walk now.
I'll release you.
I sincerely support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
How about we make a group on Facebook so we can discuss learning foreign languages?
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Did we agree?
It's not that bad.
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Stop smoking.
Tom went that way.
You owe me an apology.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom was afraid of me before.
Tom whispered something to Mary and she smiled.
But why?
Can I take a look at your ticket?
What's going to happen now?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
They set the library with new books.
It's clean.
How about some chocolate cheese?
Today's your daughter's birthday.
Will anyone tell me what to do?
Obviously it's a knocking error.
Your book is double bigger than mine.
We're both not rich as much as we want.
Tom wouldn't be pleased.
Tom has a nice garden.
The cup of coffee cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?
It's useless to be associated during a student life.
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom's got a disgusting hair.
I've seen enough for now.
That's what I hate.
We'll miss you so much if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's going to happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom's gonna take a look.
Tom ate a sandwich.
Here's what I think.
I want to go.
I could go with you.
Life costs are growing.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you deactivate the bomb?
I think Tom could do it.
I need five more minutes.
He's asleep like a baby.
I bet you know who told me that.
Mary used the apples that Tom gave her to make an apple butter.

Tom's a little worried.
Tom's the best student in class.
How is this your fault?
My phone number is 9876-5432.
Why don't you just tell Tom?
How did I overlook this?
This is a sentence.
Life is cute.
That's my cat.
What do I write here?
I'm deeply embarrassed.
My father bought me a book.
I'm adaptive.
Citizenship is a prerequisite for voting.
How many times have you been here?

I'm ready, bro.
Please push as strong as you can.
This fish is big.
Send me some sugar, please.
It's nice to be needed.
I hope we figure this out.
We all have to resist this.
Where's the teeth pasta?
Mrs. Klein is 80s, but she's still very active.
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
Trust me.
This is my computer.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our manager came to a good idea and we made a great plan.
We know enough.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired that I can barely keep my eyes open.
The gardening's fun.
It's never too late for learning.
Bring me some sugar, please.
Come quickly!
You cover your mouth while you're coughing, sneaking or yelling.
Where did you find the keys?
Did you ever hang a video on YouTube?

Just give me the money.
She's pregnant.
Tom gave me a few books.
Don't let Tom find out.
I can't wait for Monday.
Have you been here before?
Does Tom have any experience?
I don't understand.
Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
How much is this rainboat?
I'm getting on her.
Tom made his job in the kitchen.
I could kill you now.
Mary used walking sticks that helped her climbing up and falling in the journey.

This lasts forever.

Flowers have been fully introduced.
"How old are you?" "Sixteen."
I like this book at least.
Blue looks good for you.
How did you do this?
Tom wasn't as handsome as Marie said she would be.
Give me that other box.
Tom has an older brother John.
I'd accept it.
People are complicated organisms.
They'll know what to do.
Why did you keep quiet all the time?
He took off.
He saw Leila's reaction himself.
I have a laptop.
Can I ask you a favor?
He ran away.
It was fun celebrating together.
I'm afraid I dislocated my right shoulder.
Stretch!

Mayuko was avoiding a hard job.
She has short hair.
Drive a lace.
I got my right hand stabbed.
I don't know much about you.
Did you do anything?
You taught us that.
You can't talk to her.
You should probably talk a little slower.
Happy mother's day!
I need a beer.
You're not funny.
Everyone appreciates Henry.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.
Does that happen often?
A bird told me.
I couldn't see who it was.
I feel safe with you.
Crazy!
You're paying me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You should talk to me.
The chairman opened the session.
It just wasn't our day.
It's rained.

I miss you so much.
Since the message was in French, I read it easily.
This may hurt a little bit.
They can speak a little Spanish.
Finish this.
Tom tried to answer Mary about that.
Can you give me some water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
Everybody's gone.
I'll learn more hard.
I'm hurt.
I bought them to you.
Is the world unfair?
None of us saw Tom do that.
Do you love your mother?
I'm Tom's grandfather.
And you're wondering why we can't stand your company?
The more I know people, the more I admire dogs.
You wrote my name wrong.
You're different.
Tom can't stay.
Shame her.
I have two cats.
It was about a thousand people.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
His girlfriend didn't provide support.
I had dinner with him.
I didn't care about that.

That was hard for me.
The teacher gave me the longest chapter.
What did you find?
You're made for me.
He needs it.
Apparently, it's a typefiller.
Are we done?
Does he see me?
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom got into Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a little bitch.
Control yourself.
I've been tired a lot, but I'm fine.
The butter was made of milk.
Tell her.
I'd accept it.
You're my luck.
I'm waiting for a bus.
Bad things will happen.
You're wrong.
A few trees fell during the storm in our environment.
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere before.
Everybody smiles.
I didn't know you were so rich.
We listened carefully to not miss any word.
Do you have problems understanding what women or little children say to you?
Looks like Cathy loves music.
He refused to comment.
Imagine yourself in my place.
Can you prove that?
We're trying.
I'm giving up.
You disappointed me.
Tom looked mad.
Don't exaggerate.
I'll have work tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
Excuse me.
I haven't been home yesterday.
I'd be grateful if you stayed by tomorrow.
I'm sure they need you.
He's everything, just not fair.
The bullet smashed the helmet.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think my writing's doing very well.
Tom's no longer a member of this club.
Show me the pictures!
That helps us a lot.

I'm not worried.
It's helping.
Dima slept with 25 men during one night and then he killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I didn't think you could do that.
We're just gonna follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we arriving soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I'm sure you two will agree.
I hope I'm not the only one who's gonna be there.
Are you angry about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This makes me very uncomfortable.
We're from Russia.
The costs will grow soon.
I work at language school.
Did I really be so happy?

Is that yes or not?

My car's in the garage.
Give me another example.

I'm in a hurry.
We're done for today.

I'm not gonna say anything.
The room was dark.
He's going home.
That could be a weapon.
Put the book on the top shelf.
He's asleep.
I can't fix the car alone.
I'd better go with Tom.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
Shouldn't you be preparing for school?
I want to feel important.
A second later, his lips screwed into a vicious smile.
My mother was an alcoholic.
Mary's enthusiasm for course fell down when her favorite lecturer moved away.

What would I do without you?
Was Tom here when we arrived?
Was I really so happy?
I took off my wig.
I don't have anyone but her.
You're unconscious.
Tom won't be happy to hear that.
Tom was called by his father.
That's new.
Did he really commit suicide with that?
I'm going to get some sleep.
What was I supposed to do?
Don't approach my wife.
They'll know what to do.
Do you have a copy?
I wasn't really a friend, I was just pretending.
Did I drop that?
Please sit down.

I didn't mean to drag you in.
Are we safe now?
Which one of your friends will come?
Can you explain them to me?
I've seen Tom dancing a lot of times.
They work together.
You tried.
The toy store is closed.
I'm taking you to dance.
I'm a student.
This is my e-mail address.
Tom might try to convince Mary to do that.
She's making elephant mosquito.
You told me not to lie.
He used to be a member of social elite than a representative of wide mass.
I'm scared.
You tried.
His opinion is reasonable.
Help us reach our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
Can you read that sign in front of us?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't hurry.
Give me the pen.
Your answer is incorrect.
Just tell Tom I called.
There's no answer to the question what's best, because it's always individual and depends on the situation.
Tom thought Mary was cute.
Be careful.
I'll probably never use this again.
I don't have a ticket.
Bye!

You look like a very smart person.
It's incredible.

You're a man.
I was ready for that.
Show me the papers.

I pulled the bullshit out.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
Tom's gonna pay.
Tom lost his job.
The money season's over.
I like cable kitchen.
I'll start with a beer.
Thank God.
Did Tom give you that?
She spends holidays with her uncle.

Ladies have a privilege.
I'm motivated.
What's your name?
What a tragedy!
We're here.
It's mine, it's not hiss.
Knowledge makes us free and better people.
Don't talk.

Without you, I feel lost.
I have to plan everything.
I'm going to the car to the city, so I can drop you on the road.
This may not be enough.
The party is at Tom's house tonight.
You've got that nicely.
Why do you need so many shoes?
Everything you have will have you one day.

Do we have any of these?
Is this your suitcase?
It's for me the Spanish villages.
This town isn't big enough for the two of us.
Tom stopped for a second.
Because of the bad time, the plane's late.
Explore them.
I'm in a better shape than you.
I'm not so worried.
Come on, get up, Tom.
Better a worm in your hand than a pigeon on the branch.
Do you have time to lunch with me?
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
I think it's possible to do that.
Tom thinks I don't know what he said.
I'm going to get some time off.
I'm pretty happy now.
It's as hot as yesterday.
He first did a preliminary test with a new electronic alcohol test before he was sent to laboratory testing.
We were walking through the park.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Look around.
Come to my house.
It was a stressful day.
Her name is Lucifer.
Don't move!
Is it clear?
Are these your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom was looking closely.
Let us help you.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom doesn't know French.

Let's continue the debate.
How much do I get?

What the fuck?

Check everyone.
Tell us a story about ghosts.
I couldn't feel sorry for him.
Check everyone.
I was sick and I had to stay in the house.
The session's over.
I burned bread.
I have a lot planned for tomorrow.
We need to follow Tom.
Why are you acting like a child?
Tom saved $300.
How does she look?
What's the Wi-Fi code?
I'm pathetic.
I can't wait till Monday.
Come with us.

I'm hungry like a wolf.
Just serious questions, please.

I need to sleep.
Tom usually comes to school before any other student in the department.
I'm touched.
And if I was rich, I wouldn't give him the money.

Why?
"Where should I sit?" "Whereever."

She gave me a contradictorial answer.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
He's wearing a golden chain around his neck.
I'm very proud of it.
Atturk was born 1881, in Thessalonic.
At least Tom's honest.
We've been very worried about you.
The kids were thirsty attention.
It's hers, isn't it?
I want to answer the last question first.
Did you tell Tom this?
We don't know our neighbors.
It's only five in the morning, and it's already a light outside.
I hate mathematics.
What's your aunt doing?
If there is, the crossover with that will happen sometime.
Tom does well French.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
Sea get out of here!
Tom's screwed up.
I know this is weird.
Please go on.
He never overcome his son's death.
When are you leaving?
I'm just doing my duty.
Tom's gone.
Everybody's been sitting.
If you don't have anything else to do, then the Greek island number.
She's always wearing wooden clothes.
Good always wins evil.
Will that almost solve the matter?
I don't care what he says.
Mary put the ring on her finger.
We've already decided not to do that.
I'm really proud of Tom.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Tom seemed older and mature than the other boys.
He's an American.
It'll take forever.
The top of that mountain is flat.
She smiled.
The gifts of Vishnua are called the Vishnuan; the gifts of Shiva are the Shivans.
Tom would like to know if you'd like to come to this party.
You're grown up.
I totally lost the flow of my thoughts.
Two bags of cement will be enough.
I've never regretted that I did it.
I'm convinced.
Do you speak Roma?
Tom came to see me yesterday noon.
Hello, buddy!
Tom's still at work.
Did you sleep enough last night?
This must be a place.
If you don't be a good girl, you won't get a birthday present.

"I think the ending is ugly," he said. "Well, somewhere in things that people make I want to see scars, failure, mess, distortion."
Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I refused Tom.
I'm not 100% sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
That kid kept crying for hours.
I'd buy that one.
This overcomes all the borders.
I have a headache today.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
I want to go.
Obviously, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
The French is his mother's language.
Her words pissed him off.
I was laughing.
It wasn't too hot.
I'm totally out of money.
I almost forgot my passport.
I was looking for you.
Tom reads a lot.
Enough!
I hope you're not talking about me.
Who swords, from swords, and dies.
You're good to everyone.
I'm usually not so busy on Monday.
Both of my sisters are teachers.
Looks like it works.
I don't live to eat, I eat to live.
Tom seemed very confused.
I'll be home tomorrow.
The teacher explained the meaning of the word.
I thought you couldn't do that.
They've done an unpredictable job.
He's overwhelmed with a drink again.
Just tell Tom I called.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "if not Q, then not P."
My wedding must be perfect.
Move it.
She doesn't like to tell her what to do.
We should learn.

We don't have another choice.
When this is time, it's best that you sit home and don't go out.
The man's character is his destiny.
I think Tom's hiding something.
Play it again, Sam.
Tom made Mary do it.
Tom, I need your help.
I brought you some coffee.
During the observation power experiment, Tom couldn't describe any picture from the wall of his living room, even though he lived there for two years.
I've never seen Tom this busy.
Looks like you're not all yours lately.
She's pretty good.
I definitely had luck.
I hope that's true.
I wonder whose sentence is this.
Tom was buying time.
Everybody kept their breath.
Read this.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember the name.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
That's not funny at all.
I called him.
How many calories does that sandwich have?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
What'd you like most on the way?
I like to watch you work.
Tom suggested that Mary go to the doctor.
I hope we'll visit Peking, too.
I'm going to get some refreshment.
You're my inspiration.
This time I abstained from commenting my loved friend.
I agree.
Some Mr. Itoh wants to see you.
Be careful.
She'll pay at least $50.
Did anyone call me?
We'll have lunch together at half one.
What's her name?
I'm still a little tired.
I think I'm gonna get shitty.
I'm vegetarian.
The picture is in this book.
That he seeks to maximize his own interest, happiness or security seem very natural for one human being.
I can do it like a joke.
I'm not singing.
It's weird that no one knows the victim.
We're out of here for five minutes.
I have a few gifts.
Sorry I'm late.
Translation is not as easy as many people think.
Tom would never admit that.
It was just the beginning.
Did you finish your homework?
Over the last few days, I've been doing research on money earning through the project, but I think all options will require a sudden change in my way of life, which is an uncomfortable thing.
Is everything okay between us?
I've never camped.
I thought food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the years on the tree we broke and discovered it was 30 years old.
See you later, Tom.
Do you want some fruit juice?
Let's schedule a meeting.
I pissed him off.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
Tom still looks shaken.
I'm a very sad man.
Boston is a great city.
We hope people will like it.
Maybe they're leaving tomorrow.
Come here, I want to show you something.
I'm remodeling.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That's interesting.
They're afraid of me.
I was happy yesterday.
You're my sun.
I really liked Tom, too.
He loves rituals.
No one helped us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you been living here?
She divorced her husband.
I'm here.
I want to live in Brazil.
Get help.
I didn't ask you to do that.
Tom writes a letter to his shirt every week.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
Mary's Tom's daughter's unit.
He still has no experience in this job.
Can you help us?
Will you relax?
Tom encouraged Mary to write about his experiences.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
I changed my mind.
Based on the data I've given you, what story would you have come out with?
Who can't be proud of being Serbian, with their historical highest achievements - the slaughter of heads and genocides?
That makes him simpler.
Do you know how to deactivate the bomb?
Will you invite her to the party?
Where did I leave the keys?
I'm a big football fan.
She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your own brother.
Tom lost his feeling.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
He's not missing anything.
Tom's gonna take a look.
I'm wondering if anyone could help me.
I'm surprised.
Everybody was smiling.
I miss him.
You should spend more time out there and less inside.
Tom played the strongest ticket.
He left his family and moved to Tahiti.
I've been playing golf with Tom a lot of times.
You underestimate me.
What's your favorite youtube-video?
Millie's listening to music.
The sea is green.
I don't have a guitar.
Are you going to report me?
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Tom said we should stay here.
We're close friends.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
We just started.
My friend can speak to Hindi liquidly.
Yeah, isn't it great?
Please, get away.
I like Tom, but he doesn't like me.
Where can I find a tourist office?
I'm comfortable.
I've already written a part of the report.
I just finished it.
We're talking about a wolf, but a wolf on the door.
Don't stop.
Please come see me tomorrow.
I have an impression that he knows the secret.
It was a little weird.
Tom won't take the exam.
Will you do that to me?
I really enjoyed it.
No one has died... yet.
At my beginning, it's my end.
Can we, people, cook grass and extract food ingredients from it?
Why don't you play with the others?
How would you translate that?
It's almost half three.
We have three dogs, one white and two black.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom wrote a stick on the ground.
Don't you want another glass of milk?
Enjoy yourself!
Who is she?
I bought this yesterday.
The chances are against me.
I'll quit.
Kids play outside.
It's all right with you.
Do what you want, I don't care.
He expects us to help her.
Who are you?
Call me any time, I always have a crying shoulder.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you understood me wrong.
That's good.
I don't want to bother you.
Tell me what's going to happen.
Tom's seen enough.
Thank you for coming!
What's your blood group?
Are we leaving soon?
I found his book.
They're selling sugar in the store.
Tom and Mary were watching the sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does that sometimes.
Do you have any news for me?
I'm thirsty.
It's our duty to help them.
He didn't do it on purpose.
Thank Tom for your help.
Simplicity is the highest level of fidelity.
What did you both do?
Happy birthday!
Time remains bad.
Photos of nature and animals, painted in complete silence and calmness, are real artwork.
My mother died the day I married.
You want to meet her?
I'll never mention this again.
We're out of food.
You don't have permission to get in that room.
You're the boss.
We have two children.
I think Tom's careful.
Oh, no!
I forgot the baby's surveillance device.
Tom's upstairs.
He's kind.
Just relax.
Smoking is forbidden in every part of the restaurant.
You don't have to come to the office, take your day off.
The white family will come to Tokyo at 11:30.
What did you do to me?
Enjoy it.
Let me write your steps.
Tom's probably still hiding.
This is the beginning of the new era.
Mary looks sweet, whatever she wears.
Shit happens.
Watch out!
Tom has failed to provide any evidence to support his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You don't even know his name, do you?
We don't need to look from high to poor.
You have a bad nature.
Is this your phone?
I'm on my way.
They divorced after the anniversary of the marriage.
This house was built by a famous architect.
He was worried about the child.
I bought this yesterday.
I had a very bad day.
The whole country's talking about it!
I'm not a good swimmer.
Does he love me?
Tom made a omelet.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm disgusting.
I was happy yesterday.
The way Mary blew the door, Tom realized she was sad.
Wife and wife should help each other as long as they live.
All we need is water.
I wonder if Tom likes dancing as much as Mary.
What would you like to know?
It's not the best time now.
He's no longer a child.
I'm trying to get a futon at least twice a week.
My education made me what I am.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Wherever I go, I'm there.
You want to join me?
Leave the book on the top shelf.
You stole my idea.
We could be happy here.
He's very educated.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
He screwed up again.
Is that what it takes?
Take everything.
You tried.
Our yacht club has ten members.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
Mom, that aunt and man hold for their hands, they're very good friends, aren't they?
Can I send you home?
I just saw Ambassador Saudi Arabia resigned.
Be careful.
Maybe something's wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open that.
I've had trouble dealing with this problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
I have one brother.
You're the most boring person I know.
Contact Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you such information.
I didn't do that.
I have a few friends.
I have to look for her.
I can't wait.
I'll check it out.
Tom was shocked.
Just a second, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom wants to know when you'll be done.
Call me.
Tom still looks shaken.
That's what the doctor ordered.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "(no P) and/or Q."
He speaks English.
I'm writing a message to Tom right now.
That's an exception.
Tom came here a little sooner than usual today.
Do you believe in eternal life?
I could eat a horse.
Actually, I never met Tom.
What's easier?
Tom asked for an increase.
Fadil wasn't in the house.
I've never noticed that before.
This should work.
Where have you been all afternoon?
What do you have to do?
I always liked Tom more.
Where was Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought the papers and read them on the train on his way to work.
I have home ghosts.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cookie for Tom.
You're funny.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
The horses sleep standing.
Let me try the other one.
You work slowly.
I didn't do that either.
Stories of Snory Sturlusson talk about the spread of Christianity in Norway by violence.
Answer me right now.
Feel like home!
Students didn't know how to answer.
Did you know that before?
I'll try and convince Tom to do that.
Am I so different?
I'm screwed up.
I assumed you were busy.
From when do you run?
That elegant, golden chain with hearts is a necklace that's gonna shake your world.
Your answer is correct.
I love Leanne.
Everything happened by lightning speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
It's been raining.
There's milk in the fridge.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Take more.
You're irrational.
I'm angry.
Don't argue with me.
The holiday dinner was held in the White House.
Planning should be left to me.
You can avoid a lot of trouble if you just do the right thing from the first time.
Mary jumped from the window to the river.
She cried.
The doctor's on his way.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
He invited her to a date.
We all have to die.
Who are we?
Does Tom really speak French?
A bill, please.
Brocolate is one of the healthiest kinds of vegetables.
I'm scared.
I'm great.
Can you enjoy this book?
Serbia's capital is Belgrade.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
John and Mary always walk with their hands.
Don't worry, I'll translate it for you.
Where was I wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I missed so many opportunities.
We heard she was crying.
It helped me a lot.
You don't have to yell.
Give me another case.
Tom still has a little time.
We don't have a choice.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Tom was more than generous.
She's violent right now, she needs to be avoided.
I just slipped it off.
I'm sure it wasn't intentionally.
Tell him I'm innocent.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
I'll visit him in a few weeks.
Italy is not Greece.
It's for my friend.
They don't speak English.
We've lost ourselves, haven't we?
We won't let you die.
Did you go to see Tom?
What's that?
He surrendered.
I can't wait forever.
This is the beginning of a new era.
America is a big, friendly dog in a small room, every time she waves a tail, she breaks a chair.
I don't have a ticket.
The doctor's working at the hospital.
Nothing happened.
I baked an apple pie.
He has a good reputation.
You'll be famous.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Welcome to Tatebe.
Everything's different.
What's your Bosnian name?
The truth has to be said.
Look at how much it is!
We need to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, he's working on his engine.
Is your car blue?
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted to have a bigger ship than his brother.
Tell me what that is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
He lied to you.
How many mosques are there in Istanbul?
He's late for an accident.
For breakfast, I'm always eating fruits and eggs.
Do you think I'm a dictator?
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom put it to us that he doesn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
We suggest that water quality be checked once a year in pipes, twice in the well.
Dear God, it's really hard for people to turn your attention to one or the other thing about you, your attitudes or your appearance, for example.
Don't be late.
What did you say?
Tom could have done better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I was thrown into a big nothing.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of the dogs who lay.
Are they still there?
Tom didn't write to Mary for a long time.
That story tells us interesting facts.
"Yes, orange juice, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.
Can I just interrupt you for a moment?
I hate science.
Students didn't know how to answer.
Do you have a book?
He has two cars.
If you don't mind them, they won't bother you either.
It's a good intention.
I've been thinking about it before.
Men stay children all their life.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
Come on, admit it.
We're so different.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
Girls were sleeping.
I'm just looking around.
Where's the beach?
Do you want to know something specific?
Welcome.
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
I'm tired.
You don't have to tell me twice.
Interability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I have no idea.
Tom was seriously hurt in an accident.
Two-thirds of the students were at the meeting.
My mother's not like other mothers.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
That can't be true.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You're opening the door.
That's good.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
Don't give me that gun.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Did you see my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.
Do you speak French?
I'm objective.
Nine of the ten voters believe that Mary is the most suitable candidate for a new leader, but Tom won't vote in these elections.
I bought flowers.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
She came back from the hospital.
I'm probably not gonna read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
He asked me to help him.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
What's going to be now?
I brought a cup of coffee.
Make a place.
Tom is also very famous in Australia.
Someone called.
Be careful.
Winter is the time of snow.
What's the name?
What are you gonna do with Tom?
How are you?
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful with your wishes.
Tom's a third year student.
Who's going with us?
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
Who are you really?
How it came, that's how it went.
Give him time.
Whoever waits, wait.
I'll have to say, yes.
We were never separated.
I'm 30.
Give me my bottle back.
I'm really happy to be here.
What the hell is wrong with you?
The doctor carefully examined her.
At that moment, it exploded with a big blast.
That's exactly what I said that would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91 percent of the Norwegian population are free from drinking water from surface sources.
It's hiss, isn't it?
What's she drinking?
It's artificial tears.
Tom's very rude.
Don't forget to write a date.
She doesn't speak English.
Clean this mess.
Could you read that?
Try it again.
It's totally normal.
How's your life going?
It's said a new restaurant was built.
The price of this book is five dollars.
I want a sword like this.
Can you keep secrets?
Tell her.
I assumed you were busy.
Move quiet.
When the fire exploded, he slept greatly.
My older sister sings well.
I never thought about it.
A childhood sickness blinded her.
Some friends can't be replaced.
Although the existence of this phenomenon is speculation, there will be evidence that will support it in the future.
Quiet up there.
Tom explained the details, but I still don't understand.
I'm from Croatia.
I want some cheese.
That wouldn't like it.
I'll have to change my habits.
I met your father yesterday.
I'm really curious.
Are you a man or a woman?
Tom parked twice.
Do you know Latin?
Will you help me?
How are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
Come back.
What are you gonna do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Everyone has the right to protect moral and material interests that come from any scientific, literary or artistic works whose art is the creator.
Tom signed the bill.
There are islands on the sea.
I've never had trouble sleeping.
Tom's hiding under the table.
I didn't see anything.
How many books can I take at once?
She went out for a walk.
Any other possibilities?
The amount for the work done and interest in the investment capital was a few million.
Champagne, please.
I can't wait tomorrow.
Is the coffee good for you?
You never know what's going to happen tomorrow.
I'm the one who pays.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need a drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I disagree with you completely.
It's a nice day today.
Do you keep this place for someone?
How are you these days?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I really think that we women have an additional sense.
Week is seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about it.
Will you come to Tom's and Mary's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
Croatia is a country in the southeastern part of Europe.
I'll be back late.
You're a little liar.
The sea's up, the sea of people.
I'll send a letter to my brother who lives in Sappora.
A politician had sticky fingers because 5% of each contract ended in his pocket.
I'll stay with the baby if you want to go.
I don't read novels.
I thought that was my job.
I'm a professor.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he read.
There's no reason to panic.
He didn't even hear Tom hates us.
I don't want any beans.
Where do you live?
It's been a long time since I sent a letter to anyone.
What's the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom turned off the engine.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
I just thought about you.
Don't argue.
Did you write a report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he had no choice.
Can you leave, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
American English is not better than British English.
Tom works about nine hours persistently.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
Not everyone could hear what Tom said.
Why would I want to kill you all?
Tom decided to sell the car.
I'll take a shower.
I'm happy.
It's mine, it's not hiss.
We have four hours of French every week.
Let's start now.
I can't think about it while I'm doing it.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
Fadil demanded Denmark's money.
It's our only hope.
I got up on my left leg today.
He broke into my home.
The bathroom's upstairs.
She took care of her son.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It's a typical gotic church.
It was an audience presentation.
Let me show you why you don't have to do this.
Is this your notebook?
We kind of survived.
Tom wasn't practicing.
Thank you very much!
Keep the remnant.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should do a test again.
Why would Tom surrender?
Europeans have gained advantage over other civilizations 500 years ago.
It seemed to me that Tom didn't do what he should do.
I'll pray for your family.
Tom chased the flies.
He suddenly stopped smoking.
I can't remember what I was eating yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
Tom asked Mary to deny the word.
I have a cat and a dog.
Sarajevo is Bosnia and Herzegovina's capital.
The cup is on the table.
That makes me very angry.
Is there still light outside?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
Don't thank me.
I assumed you were busy.
Do you agree?
Would you like me to look at your house?
You have to control yourself.
What's the difference?
I recognized him at first sight.
The French are our friends.
That's very nice of you.
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.
If I love you, what's that with you?
I wish that had come to my mind.
I'm drinking milk.
Tom managed to get in the house through the window.
I saw the cat.
She doesn't speak English.
I saw the cat.
There's snow falling in Paris.
I hope Tom will be back safely.
I have no idea what was happening in his head so that he would refuse such a favourable proposal.
I just got up.
How's it feel?
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean up now.
You tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and walk.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom's strict but fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us had a potato salad eating.
Come alone.
To be a good kid, you need to go to bed and get up early.
All right, what about you?
I mean to go abroad.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I promised.
My family goes to Italy every year.
It's not a simple sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be a Lezilebovic.
That's how it was supposed to be.
I eat a lot of meat.
I don't like working.
Tom's a screwber.
The future looks dark for Edmond Dantes, since he became the victim of the conspiracy, he was convicted to betray and sent to jail for life.
You're irrational.
My French is bullshit.
We survived somehow.
She covered her disappointment with a smile.
Mother chose this curtain.
We're both not rich as much as we want.
It's hit.
Can you let Tom know I came in?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
I'll give you the money tomorrow.
You need one of these.
Is he a teacher?
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French myself.
I like walking.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I asked Tom to wake me up at 2:30.
Tom's thinking the same way.
That's his weak spot.
You're one of us.
Faith can move the mountains.
She's in the grave with one leg
Tom just told me the opposite.
Louder!
He was two years younger than I was.
I'm compassionate.
Tom's unsatisfied.
That would be a pleasure.
He's crazy like electricity.
I'm sorry I didn't answer your letter before.
Don't drink water from the dirty glass!
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote.
That doesn't scare me at all.
We didn't play well.
How old are you really?
Someone's here.
Tom asked me if I was sleeping at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
Here's her picture.
How can I forget those days?
I'm thirsty.
A friend of mine studys abroad.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Who's your favorite wrestler?
Nice to meet you.
I didn't want to hurt you.
This place looks quite different from what it was before.
Is it yours?
Why are the rabbit's ears big?
I'm a runner.
I don't sing.
The souls don't exist.
I want to help.
I know how to do that.
I shot a bear.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's really an idiot.
Yeah.
Come see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
I love this song.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's the best thing to do in the walk.
You're working too much.
This one's cool.
Not a word to anyone.
I just enjoyed it.
That can be trusted somehow.
You're a teacher.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Cade.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
I'm sorry, I'm late for a meeting.
What we need is a responsible government, what we have is circus.
I'm sorry I tried at all.
That river looks tiny, isn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this composition.
Five hours in the morning in Brazil.
Tom suggested that Mary would do it.
Is this your phone?
We hate Tom.
This one's cool.
Tom cut the tape.
Do you think the situation will improve?
Who is she?
Tom was arrested three times.
This isn't so funny.
That's a big secret.
Mary said she'd find out the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't increase her salary.
That's not learning at school.
Is it clear?
I don't get out tonight.
"Will you think?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Fish can't live outside the water.
I have a book.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
Stop resisting!
I'm cold.
I'm so busy that I can't help you.
I have two flowers.
Move!
Please wait a second.
I'm not gonna do that!
I'm tired of arguing.
Are you a maniac?
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
They're good people.
She's a singer.
I like to watch you play.
That's great!
I'm trying.
I definitely had luck.
What first song have you ever written?
Tom could get upstairs.
I just want to get out of here.
Denmark continued to follow Fadil's example.
A large number of words are borrowed from foreign languages.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I'm mad at Tom.
Every other day, Bill goes fishing.
Don't let her get you out of this good chance.
What time are you breakfast?
Be careful.
He's in the first year of college.
I looked for grape juice.
I meant my family.
The colorless green ideas sleep pissed.
Can you make Tom laugh?
Because of the bad time, the plane was late.
Can I take your dictionary?
My liquid knowledge of language is enough for many situations, but not to express my, often contradictive, emotions.
I was in a great mood.
I'm a professor.
There's nothing to do in this town.
Tom's a scrubber.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the shelf.
I often feel a heartbreak.
Tom's undercover.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of a snake.
I know that girl somewhere.
I slipped once.
Show me the photos!
She imagined to be a nurse.
I'm sorry I'm always interrupting you.
Tom's risking everything.
He's a man of power.
That's wonderful!
I'm lousy.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it in time?
It's weird that the mailman hasn't come yet.
Try to do one thing at a time.
How do we prevent that from happening?
His novels are favorite among young people.
There's a cat.
I hope Tom will remember this.
Did I really be so happy?
Soon I'll buy a boat.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
She was surprised to hear the news.
He's not an American, he's an Englishman.
How do you say "thank you" in Japanese?
There were no injuries.
Did you ever get a fast ride punishment?
I'll be right upstairs.
We have to go.
Tom's a mechanic.
His accident taught me a lot of things.
Are we ready to go?
Why?
The storm should not affect our plans.
Tom's a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There's no girl on the Internet.
She tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and walk.
As most of the 18-year-olds, Tom is not sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi wrote a lot of musical works for a fagot.
The Secretary of the United States, John Carrie, broke his right bone in a bicycle accident on Sunday in France.
Where is a lot of grandmothers, they're kids.
Tom's tense like a string.
Never lose hope.
Sounds simple, I know.
It was just a slipper on the cake.
How long has it been since you stopped teaching at that school?
Tom seemed very confused.
The results were incredible.
Pick one.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes have screwed up.
Have you completely recovered?
He got what he wanted.
I'll listen.
The job has already been completed.
Tom spoke very loud.
She's drinking like a smoke.
Don't move!
There was an accident recorded by the observer.
Did I miss that?
Are you happy?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship has gradually turned into love.
There's an excuse in China that you can't judge a man by appearance.
It's in vain.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the dest side is in New York.
They need each other.
What the fuck is going on here?
There are indications that the reception, which is known by its luxury meals, this year will be something more modest.
Did you report to the police?
He surrendered.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
What's wrong with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom will do that.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which direction are you going?
I'm sorry if I disappointed you.
Violent criminals were often rapes in childhood.
Meet me with Tom.
After a long consideration, I finally randomly did things.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who saves the words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to me for dinner yesterday.
Look what he's like!
Living truth.
You're very inappropriate.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now it's a great time to buy one like that.
You're absolutely right.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom got out of it.
Tom's been involved in people who should never have been involved with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and write.
Tom's ruthless.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's the problem you have to solve on your own.
I was overwhelming.
Termites eat a tree.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom put the book down.
This should work.
You failed me.
You don't have to judge a man according to his appearance.
It's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thank you for your e-mail!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
They'll make speeches tomorrow.
What's this?
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was going to be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as his weakest member.
I've been there before.
Me, too.
That's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
So what are your plans?
The kids are sleeping.
That was very good.
You need a temporary bridge.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
This town, as well as many towns in England, has a pretty long history.
Tom closed the door.
I didn't have fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Where's your stuff?
Tom worked very hard and broke a lot of money.
I don't like being socialized.
Tom's alone in the living room.
He lived a simple life.
We offered help.
It was a dark and storm night.
It smells delicious.
The first phase is over.
You'll be famous.
He's got a lot of money, even a surplus.
We're glad to have you here.
Can I have another glass of beer?
Tom was sure of himself.
Sit down for a second, please.
It's Copacabana!
I wonder how Tom feels.
She's taking care of her old mother.
You're the most boring person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I have plants.
I bought a dozen pens today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Does French learn in your school?
That can't be true.
Tom looked left and right before he crossed the street.
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom's gonna recover.
You're important to me.
I don't expect anything from you.
Go straight.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't get into it.
I'm used to nobody likes me.
The brakes scratched.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
It's just like a beans.
I'm a little worried now.
Do you have a stable relationship with the boy?
Tom still knows he's saying the song he wrote when he was 13 years old.
It's empty.
Did you see Tom leave?
Be careful.
How would you translate that to you?
I'm ready to pay you well to do that.
Where did you get that idea?
What are you talking about?
That was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
Many admire him.
I hope it'll be a good time tomorrow.
Maria screwed up.
Let's sit down.
Come and look.
Tom really seems familiar.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
I'm giving up.
Do your kids have their own rooms?
Tom kept all the letters that Mary sent to him.
Go swim with Tom.
He's safe.
Tom died in his dream.
The woman's shiffoner is not full without a small black dress.
I can't sit quietly.
Finish this.
We don't have a choice, but kill.
Where's the bathroom here?
Happy Christmas!
Tom helped me save a penny by telling me about a cheaper place where it could be bought.
I owe you an apology.
There's nothing else to do but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's been working his whole life.
Knock it off!
Where are you going?
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
I need to fix my watch.
Tom will live.
Please read between lines.
You won!
That's a bad sign.
I understood wrong.
Tom had dinner with Mary.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really so happy?
I'm good with the kids.
I'll be late.
I had a quick lunch.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the road.
You should leave Tom a message.
You always lie to me.
Just in time!
I want what you want.
Health is a wealth.
Tom has a family now.
That doesn't surprise me.
As far as I know, he never came in time.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
The boy throws a stone.
Can I call you in 20 minutes?
The wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
As little as we know about her origin, at least we can be sure it's the pilot Evangelion.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got into the bus.
Can you leave us alone?
I almost forgot my passport.
Why are you doing this if I can ask?
Yelen's faster than stronger.
People used to write books to knocking machines.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
I live in Sarajevo.
I reacted instinctively.
It's a toilet.
Tom doesn't see anything wrong with letting Mary learn how to drive.
Are you coming back now?
I want to fuck you.
I hope it's not.
Give me one example.
How could I hate Tom?
Wear this.
How barbaric!
What day is it tomorrow?
I've always known that.
Tom thought I was you.
I'm looking forward to your letter.
When the cat's gone, the mice runs water.
We need this from Tom.
The emperor and the Spanish king are ruled by Japan.
It's Ali's book.
Will we see Tom again?
The world was alone the edge of nuclear war during the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962.
Have fun while you can.
I'm sure I'll win on that tennis match.
Are you dyslexic?
Melanie's drinking milk.
Where did you see Tom?
It's all quiet again.
I'm engaged.
Can we order, please?
What's he doing?
Otherwise, what's your address?
What I saw was depressing.
They laughed at me.
I'm angry.
Take it easy, Tom.
Can you give an example?
I don't intend to go to Busto with you this weekend.
He stole a very precious diamond ring.
That's my cat.
Tom's drinking like a smoke.
It's like old times.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Is that what you want?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't exaggerate.
Look at that.
We have your size, but not that color.
That doesn't look like you.
He's always here between 5 and 6:00.
Tom was received to the hospital.
I hope I can do that.
I don't like stubborn people.
Seating all day is bad for you.
The rain season begins in June.
You always do.
It's totally normal.
You're out of luck, Tom.
The wall seemed smooth and invasive.
Do you hear anything?
He has two cars.
Tom's probably gonna still be mad.
He greeted us and left.
Welcome to Tatebe.
I see, I don't see.
I'm bleeding.
I'm glad you answered.
We're close friends.
We can't be friends anymore.
In the future, many workers will be replaced by robots.
Tom was totally drunk.
I admit I'm wrong.
This house belongs to him.
My father listens to classical music.
Who?
How many people live on Earth?
I'm a little worried now.
Come again anytime.
We're from Russia.
Have it to be yours.
Which I should do my free time.
We need to keep working.
We had a terrible fight.
Who ate the last doughnut?
Are you free tonight?
If I love you, what's that with you?
You don't speak English.
They handed hands.
They recognized Tom.
Tom was afraid of me before.
Everyone you meet leads a battle you don't know anything about.
I'm afraid of death.
Don't run.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
Tom's my older brother.
One man was arrested and accused of a deliberate murder of 25-year-old Mary Thompson.
Come on, you two.
The movie was inspired by a novel of the same title.
Peter loves Jane.
Is this a real diamond?
I don't want to be cruel.
Are you free tonight?
Do you have time to help me?
This is clear by itself.
Tom's mad.
Tom's gonna make sure he gets here in time.
Tom says I'm too aggressive.
What does that mean?
We'll never know the reason.
My favorite teacher was Jackson.
Tom's tired.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
I have to do what's right.
I like to watch you dance.
They replaced coal with oil.
John came to Japan yesterday.
The snow fell.
We've already decided not to do that.
How can I say that in your language?
That's not a good sign.
He's a doctor, and also a writer.
It's her, isn't it?
We're retained.
I don't live here.
I gave my mother nineteen flowers for Mother's day.
I hope you like it.
This ticket's worth a month.
I didn't tell him you were here.
No one knows what's going on behind that door.
I think Tom's pretty angry.
I'll get back to you as soon as I get there.
Turns out the price was lower than I thought.
Some think that spontaneous human burning is really happening, but I'm not very sure.
Who's going to read such a fat book?
Good to see you again.
We'll visit you sometime.
I disagree.
You have to focus on your virtues.
You taught us that.
Tom can't get to work today because he doesn't feel well.
I'm a terrible writer.
We could achieve what we started before.
They live in a white house with a fascinating brick on the corner on the left side of the street.
I'm sure Tom didn't intend to hurt your feelings.
It's too loud for me here.
I'm alone.
Why are you acting like this?
I'm really upset about it.
Tom's alone.
If she was a little more patient, she could have done it.
Whatever you're doing, don't laugh.
Why don't you tell me what's really bothering you?
I don't understand why Tom would want to do that.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
I'm not sure what time I should be there.
Don't open it.
Tom's already here.
I work at the hospital.
I already told Tom that.
They sang hawaiian songs.
Tom spoke almost crying.
He's not missing anything.
We live in the atomic age.
Die!
I can't wait.
Norway surprised me.
My uncle has a big family.
I never liked biology.
It was necessary to do many things about preparing for the trip.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I had lunch with him.
I'm tired of arguing.
Little kids don't know much words.
Where is she going?
Mary's making money for life sewing.
Don't drink water from the dirty glass!
We won!
Tom ran inside.
Where's Tom going to sleep?
How does Tom do that?
All their efforts were in vain.
Did you sleep enough last night?
Tom asked me if I wanted to go to Boston with him.
The only word written on the page was "Frog."
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Do you speak Italian?
It wasn't the only reason I left Mary.
"Do you have a nickname?" "Yes, Rick."
I've stayed.
Tom ate a bowl of pie.
Who told you to write with your left hand?
You should have told me.
Don't exaggerate.
I don't have anything coming out of my hand today.
Really?
This is Brian Rock.
You can do better than that.
Tom's not an expert.
We came to London to look at the comedy.
Why are you alone?
Undertaking government officials fled the country.
How much blood did the injured lose?
I won't bother you.
Two guys ran out of the room.
It's never too late to learn.
Please come to my house for a while.
We need to find them first.
This one's pretty cool.
I have strong reasons to believe that my son Sergio Melo today, on May 11, 2014, registered at Tateba as 20,000 members in Sunday!
I think it's perfectly great.
Tom was very scared.
I speak Bosnian.
Are we coming soon?
Snow falls.
I didn't recognize the melody.
I'm from Turkey.
Just tell me the truth.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
That's when I didn't speak French.
I spent many nights scratching in bed watching television.
The guard's out there.
Do you have any rooms?
Can I call about 2:30?
I'm really lucky about that.
Well, that's what happens.
That's a nice sweater.
Actually, I don't like Tom so much.
I didn't really want to do that.
Tom didn't see anything.
You're stupid.
Tom looked a lot different after the scratch.
Tom called Mary for dinner.
We're not staying here.
Interesting.
Music, after silence, is what approximately shows inexplicit.
We've been walking all the way to the next station.
I have two daughters.
I really didn't have the money.
Tom's down to hide.
Have the courage.
Let's rest for five minutes.
I believe science.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
Don't complicate it, Tom.
She smiled.
Just give us a chance.
Be careful.
Tom went out on the stage.
Tom's getting nervous.
Take another one.
Two men were partners in business.
I'm learning now.
I almost forgot my passport.
There's a story that this house has been employed by ghosts.
Will ten thousand yen be enough?
I'm not used to it.
I have to do some more things.
I trusted you with my secret and you betrayed me.
I read Chinese solidly, but I can't write it well.
I can write a message to Tom if you want.
Why don't you take off the sweater?
I wonder what Tom intends to do.
I can't cheer him up.
There was a lot to eat.
This hour is cheaper than that.
Regular use of agrum will reduce pores and refresh the skin.
Eva gave Adam the apple of knowledge.
Looks like most people are barbecue only in summer.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
When did you come home?
He asked me to help him.
This is not true.
I did my first step.
This is easy.
I know as much as you do.
They're terrified.
They're just trying to help.
Tom told me he wanted to be a doctor.
I owe my father what I am.
Emily's English.
I asked him a lot of questions about the ecology.
Why are you still awake?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in town.
I thought you were going to the Boss bus.
Let's go for a walk.
Can you keep a secret?
I thought you already took care of it.
I remember everything.
Don't stop.
Tom was shot three times.
Don't cheat.
You never know what can happen.
You do good to those who hate you.
I slipped once.
Good afternoon, how are you?
He doesn't speak English.
What's your favorite TV star?
Tom fainted.
How was your day?
He's not the type of person who's stealing.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
We can talk about it in the future.
We won't let you down.
Don't waste the words in vain.
We don't have a lot of visitors down here.
I love him, but he's pretty often too sensitive.
She divorced her husband.
Many languages of eumefism describe death and dying.
Did you do that on purpose?
Don't get caught.
I wish I could take a picture like that.
I'm loyal.
Tom likes cheese.
What did you say to Tom?
I know this will cause you more trouble but nothing can be done.
You have to let that go.
What's your job?
Tom hasn't written to me for a long time.
Tom never told me what he wanted to eat.
Could you read it?
I didn't want to hurt you.
Hello.
Tom's gonna work.
Tom's alive proof that you don't have to be smart to be successful.
Tom's a busy guy.
You look very pale.
This is a good textbook.
I lost my mind flow.
Do you speak Italian?
Tom pulled some personal ticket.
You embarrass her.
My phone will be shut down soon.
Tom convinced Mary to invite John at the party.
Wait, what are you trying to do?
Let's stretch the legs.
I'm going on my way.
That'd be all for now.
Interestingly, he'll be here today?
The powerless must be protected from the mighty.
I don't know if these languages are relative.
I thought you'd be busy.
I want to hire a car, please show me the price.
How long does the turtle live?
Didn't you do enough?
I'm very optimistic about this.
I think Tom was trying to impress me.
They appear here to enjoy a fountain with ice, beer and a trip basket.
Tom told me not to do that.
We went all the way to Boston together.
How long have you been a teacher?
Weapon manufacturers should donate their money to organisations that can help countries in war.
Do you think I should write Tom?
We don't have a example like that.
We found footprints in the sand.
We ran out of the building.
All right, what about you?
There's no free lunch.
Mary's a very individualist girl.
We can't let our emotions ruin our actions.
She's my professor.
Tom and I have been close friends for years.
I think this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.
Tom knows what he likes.
Tom was very sleepy.
This building will be built in town.
Come closer.
Come on!
What are you reading?
How many phone numbers does she have?
Dad, can you read me a story before I go to sleep?
Don't go out tonight.
Don't bother!
Can you wake me up at seven tomorrow morning?
She's always going to work at 8:00 a.m.
No debate has been completed forever. It will always swim to the surface again.
I eat a lot of meat.
I'm just a average girl.
It works slowly.
I'm a starter.
This tea is good.
I miss you so much.
You cover your mouth while you cough, sneak or yell.
I'm ready.
I'm against war.
She's walking.
She's got a nice patch on her.
Tom didn't give me that.
Do you know how to deactivate the bomb?
I've already tried that.
You're my mother.
Italy is not Greece.
I'm just not very happy.
I don't live in this city.
I bought this yesterday.
Do you speak Greek?
I'll cooperate.
I hope it won't rain tomorrow.
Give me one example.
It all happened with the speed of light.
Battle!
That's really nice.
They called me worse.
How did I miss that?
I'm not surprised.
I kept your place next to me.
Looks like the victim tried to write the killer's name with her own blood.
Being powerful is like being a lady, and if you have a need to tell people that you are, then you're not.
Tom could have something to do with it.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
What's your story?
Where's Lori?
Have you been in an accident?
I'll tell Tom if I don't forget.
I'm leaving.
I pissed him off.
That's very rare.
I pretended not to see.
I was trying to be kind.
Can you ask her to call me?
I pretended I didn't see it.
Did you see my dogs?
It was dark.
Don't yell.
You know your rights.
You can't get in that room.
That's the point.
The whole city was under water.
I didn't know where I was from.
Don't go in, I'm naked.
What are they calling him?
Tom tried the button.
Can you add salt?
I'm ashamed that my son did such a thing.
Success was just partial.
He's always going to work at 8:00 a.m.
I'm not 100% sure.
Want to bet?
Tom didn't like his nose's look, so he did a nose surgery.
Beth told Chris to take a bath or she won't go out with him for a meeting.
I didn't tell her you were here.
Tom bought a drink for everyone.
He describes the flight detailedly.
Tom knows the Secretary of State.
Tom just got home.
Stop smoking.
The insurance's overpowered.
Don't answer.
I have aunt who lives in Kyoto.
Ladies first.
It can't be hard; otherwise, women couldn't do that.
I'm glad people saw that.
She's not ugly.
I'm sick of his preaching.
No one would talk to me.
Peter and Lech are also good friends.
I didn't tell him you were here.
I have a gun.
We're overpaid to the papers.
Tom seems very nice.
We all live under the same sky, but we don't have the same horizon.
I can't imagine doing that.
My father has a good job.
He has a good memory.
Tom has a good mentor.
I came back today.
Here's a little secret.
How much money does he earn a month?
What a stupid question!
I'm anxious.
We protested peacefully.
Mary was angry as a rice.
Get up and introduce yourself, please.
We all want to see a movie.
You have to solve your own problems.
Where do you live, Tom?
He was happy to laugh.
Tom has good notes.
That's not a reason for panic.
I'm glad Tom won.
Tom celebrated the mature anniversary last week.
I'll sit down at the table there.
Why are you so good at explaining things?
Turn left.
Who's first?
Don't get tired!
Your book is twice as much bigger than mine.
My third husband bought me this.
I know as much as you do.
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
I'm thorough.
Let's take a look.
Tom writes something to the diary every night, no matter how tired he is.
Have you planned something special?
My parents died.
Most scientists believe that this is caused by human action, by dropping methane, carbon dioxide and other glass gases from the time of industrialization, but still, a few other scientists doubt this.
Will I be replaced?
Earth is a planet.
I can resist everything, except the temptation.
It's all we need to do.
I paid for it.
Again, please.
I didn't say I did it.
They know you.
You were right you should be worried.
I'd like you to watch my dog while I'm out.
I'm confused.
She has a good heart.
Did you bring a fan?
How much time do I have left?
Can you explain how to get to the airport?
I'm not taking the job.
I'm intrigued.
Does that happen often?
You can't rely on Tom.
You're a little reminder of Tom.
Everything's normal.
If you do.
Did you write the number?
You're under oath.
I fainted.
I wish I knew.
I haven't seen you here before.
I don't think so.
There's about 300 miles from here to Boston.
Tom asked me more money than he really needed.
Tom managed to save a little money.
I'll get out of work early today.
Are you enjoying your business?
She was wearing a black hat.
Are you looking for something specific?
Her composition is very good, except for a few mistakes in the excuse.
English is considered international language.
Don't worry!
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
I'm a monk.
I live in Boston right now.
Ania has black, and Magdalena's blue hair.
Why did you decide to stop using Twitter?
I'm not a philosopher.
Am I a suspect?
I could help.
For God's sake!
Didn't you do enough?
All animals are equal.
I doubt Tom will give you the keys.
I didn't give anything.
I feel like it's going to rain.
Caroline's sad because she can't get pregnant.
He has a few friends.
Did you sleep?
I don't want meat.
What are you hiding now?
Stop trying to make me guilty.
Tom looks a little embarrassed.
I am indeed happy for that.
Drive faster.
I'm trying.
I have no idea what he's talking about.
That's definitely not a reason to worry.
I took off my wig.
My life was good.
It's my cat.
There's a large amount of smaller mistakes and minor misunderstanding that distort the meaning of the original sentence.
I haven't had any complaints before.
I know skiing.
He's standing there.
Are you afraid of rats?
I was at the reception.
He's known as a great painter.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
Now you're lying to me.
Did Tom ever answer you?
Go look for Tom.
Tom did his best.
Shoot your feet!
"You serious?" "I'm serious."
Why are you angry with me?
I'd be more comfortable in the morning.
That didn't like the way Mary spoke to him.
We need to find out.
You're sad.
What's your name in Bosnia?
Tom needs to learn more if he thinks to finish his class.
I'm sick of fighting.
I wrote a song about what happened here last year.
I can't try it!
It's too easy that way.
Where did that come from?
I'm not going to tell anyone you did it.
The bears are very dangerous.
Really?
We know you're a coward.
I bought some books from the bookstore.
We had to call the police last night.
I'm worried about you.
Have they ever experienced a car accident?
She's Prime Minister of Finland.
Please come pick me up.
I like how you arranged your apartment.
She decided not to go.
Tom traveled to the legendary Orient Express from Paris to Istanbul.
You're lying!
It's fish.
Tom already knew about it.
I did it, didn't I?
No one noticed she was away until the meeting was over.
She's honest.
Who's running a meeting today?
How did you find out where Tom is?
You're not rational.
These are my best friends.
Don't go through that with me.
Give me a day or two.
She confessed everything.
Tom used to drive a bus before.
Do you want some coffee?
The fall of many birds move to the south.
The forbidden fruit is always the sweetest.
That article was written in English.
Some of you need help.
Sugar has replaced the honey as a sugar.
You're just gonna make a big mistake.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I'll go.
What's all this mess about?
Can you please turn off the radio for me?
There's a bus station near our school.
Don't drink water.
I'm adopted.
No one knows what's going to happen next.
I've made my decision.
Do you have a copy?
Next Monday and Tuesday are holidays.
We're going to the movie.
I don't understand why they're so good friends.
Dan's lingvist.
I wouldn't hurt her.
This is a book.
In this stage of world history, in America there is no such thing as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is no one who is daring to write his sincere opinion, and if he would have written it in advance, he would know that it will never appear in the press. I get regularly my wage to keep my sincere opinion out of the newspaper for which I work for. Many of you are also paid for less than 24 hours. The job of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to write what he honestly thinks, he would find himself out outside, looking for some other jobs. That I have allowed my right opinion to appear only in one publication of the newspapers for which I work for. We have been fired from work in less than 24 hours. The job of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie, to disturb what he thinks, on the streets, to ease the monster before whose legs is, to sell this country and its people forfeit us, we know nothing for our daily and our people are awake to the same.
I'm not worried.
The bedroom's upstairs.
It's mine, it's not hiss.
I could use some help.
What's wrong with you?
I wasn't too surprised.
Tom couldn't get Mary ready a cake for John's birthday party.
Tom's writing very well.
Tom's embarrassed himself.
I watched Tom die.
She hated him.
It's my favorite shirt, and I always wash it on my hands.
You kind of let me think you want me to call you out.
It is recommended that you do not write your passwords where others can see them.
That's so funny.
Look again.
How could I do that?
Did you eat anything?
Tom gave great support.
The silk is expensive.
What are you gonna do today?
I'd rather not be involved in this stage, thank you.
It only happens occasionally.
I know your face.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
I'd like to tell you the truth.
I'm not sure Tom wants to talk to me.
If you're out, please close the door.
I can't believe I forgot.
Taxi's expensive.
Open up.
Do you love your mother?
I didn't know much about Australia.
Tom's gonna recover.
There's no use trying to persuade him.
That's right.
Let's be friends.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
You'll probably never see me again.
The milk path is a huge belt of remote stars similar to our sun.
Who's that?
I could talk to Tom.
Naoko lives in a white house.
I thought you were happy here.
I thought Tom was doing fine.
I could come with you.
I'm excited.
I invited him.
He's a man with great experience.
Beautiful blonde sunned on the beach.
The logic is obviously your stronger side.
We're trying.
Luckily, Tom didn't hurt himself seriously.
I need your help.
Stop!
The airline will make sure to send your baggage to the final destination as soon as possible, or later if that's what a passenger wants.
I was just too busy.
Beautiful flowers have the hardest thrones.
What's this about?
I'd like to kiss you.
He owned a lot of land, once a long time ago.
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
Tom was laughing at the idea.
She was wearing impairable clothes.
I'll be right there.
He was terribly thin.
I'm sorry.
How did she look?
We can't go back.
He told me I was cute.
The coloseum was used until 217. But then the lightning hit him and burned.
My father's so old he can't work.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
How desperate are you?
It's time to go to sleep.
You're absolutely right.
I think he's an enemy.
You deserve it.
I'm working.
Does Tom have a lawyer?
You changed my life.
Can I take your dictionary?
He ran away from her.
If a man has a right to live, then he should have the right to death.
All teachers were young and loved teaching.
Faith makes miracles!
He kept the air.
Tom's a knower.
Congratulations!
The bird on the roof is a crow.
My house is far away.
I've never really been anywhere.
We're in a difficult situation.
I'll check it out now.
Check it again.
Come with us, please.
Sammy's missing some board in his head.
You don't look very well.
What's the name of that restaurant?
How do I call a cab?
There's a lot of beautiful parks in London.
Tom kissed his anger.
I've got a back ticket to Tokyo.
When did you come home?
They know you.
You didn't answer the question.
This dictionary has written 1,000 words with all of them must be remembered until July.
It's too loud for me here.
There's a good chance we're gonna win.
We have to go back.
Do you think it's possible to pass all the tests?
It would be different.
They're all there.
Is that your car?
Did you bring a phenomenon?
He was naked and bossed.
Did you talk about me?
Tom's gonna give up.
You got a headache?
I can ski.
Why do you think that?
It's snowing today.
You should write a message to Tom.
I've got a headache today.
She insisted that he would go to the hospital.
I think Tom pulled out a thicker end.
It doesn't play any role anymore.
I'll fix my homework tomorrow.
Get help.
Tom's suffering from chronic pain.
By the way, where do you live?
Tom installed solar panels on the roof of his house.
I want you to find out if Tom and Mary are planning to be alone here.
He lives in England.
It's awful down here.
Who wants to talk to me?
What a shock!
We tried to stop Tom.
Love and be loved is the greatest happiness.
Get out of here.
I'm guilty.
Who wants to talk to me?
Bring backup.
He was two years younger than I was.
We just arrived here today.
Come stay with me.
Bring me her head.
I didn't wear an intrudable clothing.
I thought you wouldn't want that.
When she was in Los Angeles, she had at least six different businesses.
You're embarrassing him.
Because of her physical deficiencies, Mary uses a stick to walk when she's out.
You can just tell us the truth.
The door of the office is yellow.
I think Tom needs help.
I'm usually not in the office on Monday.
Dad, can you read me a story before I go to sleep?
Lemon contains lemon acid.
We'll never catch Tom.
I have a lot of friends.
Croatia was so beautiful.
I ruined school.
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
We'll stop it.
Tom wants his money today.
Are you finished washing your dishes?
Can I use your phrase?
Is it yours?
You told me that before.
Are you honest?
Tom thought Mary wouldn't have to do that.
Tom works as a waiter, but he's looking for a better job.
The road's straight.
I need more coffee.
TV's not involved in electricity.
The house is made of bricks.
Everybody's lying.
Damn it, can you imagine how much they smelled?
Do you love your mother?
You should get a new car now.
I made my first step.
I'm downstairs.
Be tolerant.
What's going to happen next time?
Do you want fruit juice?
Tom's the best student in class.
I assumed you were busy.
Go away.
Tom changed his name.
Can you help us?
I wasn't nervous about that.
Are you coming back now?
My name is Hashimoto.
It's comfortable.
He lost hope and killed himself with poison.
You spyed on me.
It's night.
Better ever than ever.
We're never going back there.
Are we going home?
And if I was rich, I wouldn't give him the money.
I was wrong this morning.
You can do better than that.
Is everything solved now?
Did you see my dogs?
Stay calm.
One day he'll be mine.
I have a few friends.
Give Tom a drink.
I'm tired of it!
He walked despite her disdain.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom knew French.
I feel a sharp pain in my stomach.
You have to lie down.
That was awful.
Can I replace this?
They didn't know me.
What a nice car!
There are islands on the sea.
Are these bananas mature?
You're sad.
You're very rude.
I could kill you now.
The soldier wake Layla with a stroke.
I know what you're probably thinking.
Tell me why you did that.
Can you take me to the airport tomorrow morning?
Please kick as strong as you can.
I won't let you do that.
I think I can save you for a while.
Then I'll see what I can do!
Would you like some more tomato juice?
Maybe it's not enough.
That really liked his job.
Are you done?
I agreed to buy that.
Can you come?
Yes or not?
Speaking English is fun.
Postmortem showed it was drowned.
Tom's gonna die.
This is what it says:
It was serious.
How was the French class?
Someone probably told him, but that wasn't me.
The butter is just unique.
Without torture, there's no science.
Stay positive.
The city was damaged during the war.
I pissed him off.
Give yourself some time.
Tom can't even write his own name yet.
Feel like home.
Thank you for the information.
What's your material status?
They need each other.
Was that what he was mistaken?
Just slowly, but hurry up.
The rumor has spread throughout the city.
Time's flying.
Some Mr. Itoh wants to see you.
The cat is not a man!
I'm doing a lot of things good.
I don't like to be surprised.
Come here.
You should eat more vegetables.
The best way to lose the pound is to eat less and exercise more.
This is gonna be a fun weekend.
What's your name?
Tom's going to think about it again.
It wasn't too cold.
Tom wrote me over 30 messages yesterday.
I hope she won't notice my mistake.
I bought a cactus.
I'm a little worried now.
Now we need the truth.
The game's over.
Is that a bird?
Did breakfast be calculated at the price?
Pick up Tom and let's go.
Is everything okay between us?
The ship is landed in the port.
Aren't you from Australia?
He raised the trophy high.
What should I say?
Tom was giving great support.
We finally arrived!

Do you agree with that?
Where's the museum?
We just had dinner.
I'm sure they need you.
That's good.
You're one of us.
Do you have a dog?
I saw the cat.
Why is love so complicated?
I've been there before.
Tom's book is at the top of the Christmas selling books, and it's hard to get some books out of her position.
Tom's working for Mary now.
I'm armed.
Is it necessary to make such a noise?
Sammy's missing some board in his head.
I have an old bike.
Did you wash the vessels?
He didn't come to the last meeting.
Good morning!
Give me another reason.
Let's have a drink!
Your secret is safe with us.
Am I wrong?
You need a hobby.
I assumed you were busy.
On the next crossroad, turn right.
I told you it didn't work.
And you, Brute?
Are you dyslexic?
I wish I knew.
I'm often borrowing books from Tom.
Change your clothes.
That's all I could find.
A large group of people gathered.
I'm working on my project.
Everything is well prepared ahead.
I'm not counting on that.
I don't know what that is.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
He's poor but too proud to ask for help.
"Who's in the car?" "Mary."
They gave water to their horses.
I went down to the wrong bus station.
I'll give you everything you want.
Girls were wearing grass skirts and they had flowers around their neck.
Can you call a doctor?
The world is unfair.
Do you know she likes animals?
Tom's the only feeder in the family.
Maybe he's already gone.
He started yelling.
Don't be rude to me!
You're wrong.
This could take weeks.
You can format and configure a table for cross budgets, insert and use ordinary tables, diagrams, formulas and functions.
I'll stay at the Hilton Hotel.
Which one of you will come with me?
Come to my house.
Call me anytime, on my shoulder, you can always cry.
I'm reformed.
What's going to be next time?
Mr. Wood came to the door and told Tony's mother.
The doctors are still trying to save Tom.
No one believed her.
He doesn't even know French.
We've seen the bird feed his young ones.
Detectives are still investigating.
Tom was pretty nice.
This sad story was written when Tom was exile.
Tom's not like the other boys.
We'll take the stairs.
She's drinking like a fish.
I'm sure I'll win on that tennis match.
Do you have anything to say?
Get changed.
We should have brought another bottle of wine.
He was dressed like a woman.
Men want to feel desirable.
She tried.
You shouldn't send that e-mail.
You don't mind, do you?
How would you feel if your wife left you?
Can you prove that?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's easy to write with this pen.
Tom called his chroom Cookie.
Are you ready for more?
Don't change your opinions so often.
This pen's not working.
Did you see me dancing?
I don't like to learn at this kind of hot.
I'd rather not be involved in that right now.
Tom closed the fence.
I had dinner with him.
There's nothing to do in this village.
I really hope I'm wrong.
Are you busy here?
Tom used to play a guitar.
He's a man of experience.
I'm actually a nice guy.
That's what both of them like.
It must have been awful.
Your plan sounds great.
You sound surprised.
I'll borrow you a workbox if you promise me you won't write anything on it.
My friends live in the same house as I do.
There's a lot of bad people in the world.
Did Tom find him?
Are they in love?
Where do we meet tomorrow?
The house is in his possession.
Tom saved Mary.
What do we want?
Tom's deaf as a gun.
Latin is the language of the future!
I think they're all ready.
"Have you seen my phone?" "It's on the table."
You'll see her.
Tom has a dark secret.
Have you had anything to eat?
Let's make it clear.
Stiglić is a very interesting bird.
It doesn't make sense to wait.
The connection between the personality and the blood group is not scientifically confirmed.
I thought you were married.
The cat went under the table.
I'm singing.
It's Tom.
Your house is big.
If you spend a lot of time in there, you can exercise your knees as high as you can walk or walk in the place.
You're everything for me.
I want to marry.
Hold my backpack.
I checked some things.
Tom knew Mary didn't love him.
I'm not singing.
It was love at first.
I'd like to kiss you.
Kids play outside.
Are you coming soon?
Many young Romans have gone to Greece.
The plan was dismissed as irregular.
I don't want to go to school.
Did you manage to do it yourself?
The working group dealing with data transfers, managed by Ben Manny, will hold a meeting on January 14, 1999.
Some say if you hit the rain slide, it'll start raining.
At my beginning, it's my end.
I just arrived.
I have to go to the mosque.
I mean, so I am.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
He knew how to talk to young women himself.
What should I see?
Did you decide what you're going to do?
Don't get tight!
Tom knows knocking very fast.
I can't answer you right now.
Are we all here?
I'll be right back with your order.
My sister's playing with dolls.
I want a sword like this!
Identify yourself.
Take the money.
Tom still looks surprised.
I'm saving to buy a new saxophone.
Don't give up just like that.
He soon recovered from shock.
I give you what you want.
It's a pure escapicism.
Who did you write a letter to?
Maybe I'll need help.
Karin's Austrian.
Does this mean you don't love me anymore?
I'm not a specialist.
I'm bigger than I look.
No one's here.
Tom's youngest daughter is his favorite.
You're sad.
Tom bought the papers and read them in the train.
Focus your camera on the flower.
I won't be home next week.
When I was a child, I often visited him on Sunday.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
That would be okay.
What do you call it?
Welcome back.
How does Tom know French?
I like to watch you work.
Answer me now.
There's no politics established.
Write what I tell you.
The rain finally stops.
I live in an old house.
Redheads are driving me crazy!
Do you love your mother?
He finally met my request.
It was a big explosion.
Tom blinked.
I didn't walk out today.
Did they tell you the reason?
Can you spell my name?
Look at this.
I've got aunt who lives in Kyoto.
She was saving her alive head.
What wine do you have?
Do you think she did that?
I think we should call a doctor.
Life in Tokyo is very expensive.
You're awfully early today.
We caught Tom at work.
We need to be realistic.
She took off her clothes.
Tom's house is for sale.
Tom wasn't satisfied with the results.
I hid under the table.
They keep me hostage.
I think this is obvious.
Emma was very impressive at the party.
Maybe Tom wasn't hungry.
I've been there before.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Tom asked Mary how she liked a new job.
I'm a big football fan.
What are you going to do with all this?
Mary's making money for life sewing.
Can you give me some water, please?
Where's your friend?
Terrorists released hostages.
I don't know what to think about this.
I don't like it.
Tom's used to winning.
Elementary, my dear Watson.
Tom's not sure what he wants to do with his life.
Tom asked Mary if he could borrow her English manual.
We're here to get you.
Call security!
My scarf is blue.
The land is too small.
I'm intrigued.
What do you believe in?
What do you want?
The medication should not be mixed mostly with alcohol.
The bakery's next to the mosque.
Did you see who it was?
Try this.
When I woke up, snow fell.
Some people, no matter what time they are, don't lose their beauty.
Tom adopted a Russian sentence.
I played golf with Tom a lot of times.
Don't talk.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
That's pretty extraordinary.
Tom fell down with his shoulders.
There's gonna be bad things going to happen.
Why would Tom come now?
I panicked.
Come on, try it now.
We'd better get in there.
Actually, I'm not sure.
Explore her.
I'm very impressed.
She was dressed in red.
I should talk to my dad about it.
What does the Sovietologist study?
It's all a big joke.
Tom was talking about music.
Where's the dog?
Have you completely recovered?
We argued a lot.
Tom's still hiding.
All right, what about you?
We're the same soy.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom doesn't know French.
Keep working.
Hope gets lost when you experience a difficult situation and a senseless hamper.
I was laughing.
You have to stop smoking.
The new constitution will not solve Egypt's problems.
Solar energy is a clean energy output.
Tom's not as old as Mary.
It seemed to me that Tom didn't do what he was supposed to do.
I'm not lying to you.
Did you see me dancing?
Better shut up!
Tom and Mary decided to adopt John.
The baby's asleep.
Did you eat anything?
Tom's not in any danger.
It's too easy.
All men are the same.
He's no longer a child.
We're almost done.
Is it clean?
They haven't wake up yet.
It's all free.
Welcome.
We don't have another choice.
I've never really been anywhere.
He's always losing his cell phone.
I'm angry.
My friend was shocked when I told her.
I think Tom could do that.
I'm thinking about going to Australia, too.
I'm sure Tom will win.
Are the Americans really so individual?
I asked Tony a question.
You can go play with your friends when you're done cleaning the house.
That's my problem, not yours.
Tom came to Mary's birthday party.
What's your specialization?
He couldn't laugh at her jokes.
She released the bird from the cage.
I'm twice older than Tom.
You're the love of my life.
Tom couldn't talk to Mary, and he couldn't influence it.
And now, when I remember everything I've experienced, I really learned a lot of things.
That's exactly what I wanted to say.
I wasn't too surprised.
I saw him pulling something like a towel out of the box.
What's your name in Bosnian?
Do you know how this machine works?
Tom managed to find a job in Boston.
You're my luck.
The team is as strong as his weakest member.
Thank you very much for everything!
I've never camped.
There's a lot of unfair people in the world.
Don't yell.
The cat is not a man!
When was the last time you heard from Tom?
Hungarian's not easy, but he's beautiful.
I don't really watch TV.
I love France.
He's good.
Did you know that?
I think so.
Are you ready?
The money's talking.
He's my rival in business.
I prefer a tent with a storm cover, along with the crossed sticks for stability on the wind and snow nails, and this has to be a two-style tent.
Tell Tom I'll say hello.
That's very sensitive.
This is my wife Edita.
I can't be something I'm not.
She lost money, family, friends.
Now present yourself using these sentences!
My name's not "ty"; it's Ricardo.
Where are we going to meet?
We need to consider all options.
I hope this will never happen again.
It's a great probability that the rain will fall tomorrow.
You're driving me crazy.
You don't need my permission.
I remember everything.
Do you think what she said was a lie?
Tom didn't do that.
She has a nice flower, but she doesn't produce fruit.
I'm touched.
Tom told me to knock on the door.
Tom's fired.
Do you plan to go to Tom's and Mary's wedding?
This candidate is much better than his precedent.
Don't call me while I'm in the office.
Who bought you this?
Thank you for loving me.
The doctor's questioning the patient.
Tom put his drinks down.
This is a clutch of justice.
I could lose my retirement.
She's a bad mood.
It doesn't matter where I am.
I always knew that.
Don't beat.
You've got very inflammatory eyes.
Every communication is a translation.
I'm trying to be careful.
I'm really happy about that.
I've never been to camping.
They believe in God.
When the cat's gone, the mice runs water.
Everyone's the boss in his own house.
Let's hope you're right.
We broke up at the corner.
Are you angry about that?
I baked my tongue.
You tried.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
When there's no news, that's good news.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Did that work out for me?
No one died.
Did you sleep?
I'm deaf and I'm not eating.
They've been sued hard in court.
My name is Sally.
I'm not practicing.
Is there a reason why you're keeping these old bottles?
We've been talking for a while.
Now I have to go.
Can I take your dictionary?
No one else was hurt.
We have to try.
That fabric isn't from India, is it?
Who are you?
I'll buy what I need tomorrow.
Maybe I'm an antisocial, but that doesn't mean I'm not talking to people.
I believe you're honest.
I didn't choose anything.
Don't yell at me.
They were talking ugly about the captain until he was gone.
Let's try something.
Are you in Paris?
Don't leave me alone.
Tom started learning French last year.
Tom was sitting on the bench all day writing cards.
I have two cats.
They don't need words.
Don't you eat anything?
It's abandoned.
Don't move!
I've already thought about it.
He always talks about the government with despise.
The money's talking.
Tom's new girlfriend is very young.
I don't understand that word.
I hope Tom will remember this.
Tom told me his father died.
We have to spend less!
Tom doesn't like cheese.
They already have one.
As long as a man lives, he hopes.
I parked twice.
What's his job?
Tom's selling cars.
I'm sick of your screaming.
I've never noticed that before.
Do you want to live in Mumbai?
Maria's a book mole.
Tom broke something again.
I'm too old for something like this.
Tell me where you live.
You have to teach me these days.
Yeah.
I love this store.
I'm just about to come looking for you.
He leads a burdenous life.
I'm not a rich man.
I really like your music.
I lost my mind stream.
That's what I'm used to.
Tom's got a real attitude.
The anatomic breast implants, however, can also lead to the deformation of breast forms if they rotate on the side.
Where did you find the keys?
I'm not going to tell anyone you did it.
She tried.
Tom was a little freaked out.
I saw the bus.
It's not a big deal.
Tom's smart enough to do something like that.
I've brought these reports to see them more closely.
I'm not as rich as we would like.
Can I kiss you?
Get on the ground.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.
Tom's still mad.
How can I know you're not going to report me after I help you?
Why are you still awake?
Please don't make me eat that.
I think your work is very good.
Tom helped Mary wear her coat.
Have fun while you can.
The Internet is not your personal army.
I could go with you.
Unfortunately, he has passed from the Almighty God to become a powerless, dirty, small and unsignificant man in the corner of the small province in the huge empire.
We should do better.

It's very old books.
I saw the snake.
It's useless.

Are you listening?
Am I in love?
Wait, wait, don't go yet.
Did you eat anything?
Give me another reason.
I'm proud of you.
He was born in a small town in Italy.
What did you two do?
Is this your first exam?
Life goes on!

I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
Okay, we agreed.
Let's not be emotional.
Tom is very patient.
Everything's changing.
Tom knows where the wind blows.

I did what I could for him.
How old is this book?
That's enough for today.
I'll just say, you're beautiful.
Are you allergic to some food?

This is my computer.

I'm sure I've seen that guy somewhere before.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
Where's the museum?
I'm buying a lot of things in that store.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
I almost forgot my passport.

I'll call her tonight.
The police asked the criminal to surrender his gun.
It's human to sin, to forgive is divine.
I've done all the tests.
It just took me a while.

Get out of the way.
It's his, isn't it?
Please be honest with me.
Tom knows it's hopeless.
You never get in time.
What's that?
A man snows, God determines.
Exactly when you did that?
Someone probably told her, but that wasn't me.

I have a book.
What do your kids usually breakfast?
Am I so different?
We had a terrible fight.
In this stage of world history, in America, there is no such thing as an independent print. You know that, and I know that. There is no one among you who dares to write his sincere opinion, and if you wrote it, you would already know that it will never appear in the press. I've received my regular salary to keep my honest opinion out of the news I'm working for. Many of you are also similarly paid for similar things, and any of you who would be so crazy to write what you honestly think, would find out outside, on the street, looking for some other jobs. That I'd let my right opinion appear only in one edition of the newspapers I work for, I'd get a fire from work in less than 24 hours....
And Tom is a seller.
I'm twice older than Tom.
That's exactly what I said that would happen.

Men have approximately seven or eight times more testosterone than women.

Don't argue with me!
It was a good hat.
Do you want tea or coffee?
He doesn't want to lose the whole week.
The door's stuck for something.

It's very important to rest well.
You disappointed me.
You shouldn't eat right before you go to bed.

I think I understand you.
Tom's personal assistant has a personal assistant.
It was sitting alone.
Who cares?
What a father, such a son.
We're talking about a wolf, but a wolf on the door.

I never borrow books or CDs to anyone.
That was kind of weird.
I don't have a lot of friends.
I need a drink.
My children rely on me.
I beg you to think about it again.
It can be treated.
We're here tonight for a good reason.
Don't screw up.
When they experienced the French revolution, citizens became free people, free tradition and church, praising freedom, equality and brotherhood.
I thought it wasn't appropriate.
Tom offered to help when it seemed that everything went completely wrong.
Tom left before I arrived.
It's not allowed to smoke here.
Translate or not is a moral choice of translators. Things sometimes sound better if they remain such as they are in the language in which they are created.
Look at what I grew up!
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
It's necessary.
What have you done now?
Excuses on errors.
I'm poor.
How long have you been living here?
Do you think the situation will improve?
Who doesn't risk, doesn't get it.
Don't look.
J. Kepler, astronomer and mathematician, was conducting research on planets and their movements.
That's enough for today.
That was very good.
I've never been to camping.
Bury Kalifa is the highest cloud in the world today.
I wasn't exactly ready.
It's very old books.
I could help.
Tom shouldn't eat if he doesn't want to.
It's a time competition.
Please go.
She was caught in the work.
I think I know a way to save for a while.
You told me you weren't here today.
That was unfair.
You don't know me.
It's a totally unique friendship that is deepening for many years.
Okay, I get it.
What are you looking for?
Are we all here?
Scientists believe that finding always comes like a thunder from the wind of the sky.
Oh, no!
It's not that easy.
Is that your new boyfriend?
The ship's screwed up.
I got a new bike for my birthday.
I said I'd be waiting for you.
I agreed to buy it.
Happy birthday!
It came from nowhere.
They know you.
Let's go one by one.
Don't yell.
The ship disappeared without a lead.
I got off the train.
They won.
It's precise.
I've never seen that before.
Did you enjoy watching the night game last night?
Their closestness was mysterious, given that they met only three days ago.
We only speak French at home.
I've done that before.
What year was your car made?
I was trying to be nice.
Don't sing.
It would be good if I dressed another layer.
What am I saying, brother?
The keys are in the code.
That's all we can do.
Are these new shoes?
What's the name?
Why don't you take your coat off?
Where the hell have you been before?
She was smiling.
You told me you weren't here today.
Tom's gone.
Tom just couldn't do that.
I thought you were married.
I'll go if you go.
Are you on Facebook?
All right, what about you?
Well, I have some news.
The chances were against me.
I want to be with her.
What I saw was embarrassing.
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this?
You tried.
Thank you for loving me.
I'm a big football fan.
We'll do what we always do.
You're making Tom nervous.
Knowing is nothing, imagination is all.
Keep working.
There's a lot of bad people in the world.
It all happened with lightning speed.
I thought you were happy here.
I'm natural.
I don't feel like dancing.
Don't forget to send this letter.
Nothing happens if he doesn't have a dream.
This book is not about linguistics.
I was trying to be nice.
I can't believe my eyes.
Are you a student?
It's her, isn't it?
I promise, I won't lie to you anymore.
The mini skirts are back in fashion.
Tell him I'm innocent.
Tom is very well imitating the way Mary speaks.
Can you solve this problem?
Can you go faster?
Some of my friends smoke.
You're my princess.
You'll miss everything.
Come on, sit down.
Tom's gonna wait.
Looks like Tom thinks so.
Don't let Tommy sleep.
Come down here.
This place is really beautiful.
Excuse me?
Everyone's changing.
Who's gonna be the first?
I'm a translator.
The church is just across the street.
Do you want more apple juice?
We can't lose hope.
Let's sit down.
My father always said that the heavens helped those who helped themselves.
Buy a liter of milk, and if they have eggs, buy twelve eggs.
Tom wants to know if you're planning to come to his party.
Did you see me dancing?
Why would Tom want that?
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
Be real!
Tom's very idiotic.
I'm hurt.
Keep digging.
I don't want any evil.
I was the only man in the tourist group, and the rest of them were the Arabs who lived in Istanbul.
Explore it.
It's our fault.
Tom's not the right person to work.
We need to get better.
They demanded an increase in the salary.
Let me see your prescription.
Tom approached to help.
Sometimes they squash between families spread through generations.
It's all wrong with him.
Tom thinks fast.
The comments must be about the subject.
Don't go away.
The programme sets the conditions for the development and implementation of projects.
We should go again.
Do you feel okay today?
We won.
Give me the spoon.
Can I find you on Face?
I was trying to be kind.
What was the name of the Boston hotel you were in last year?
I had lunch with her.
It would be confusing.
Tom introduced himself.
We're here.
That's their book.
Tom, we have a problem.
You can sit next to me.
It pulled the hand.
Tom was a great manager.
Everybody's screwing.
You just need to practice.
Have you ever slipped the cow?
There's a lot of orange fishermen on the river.
You just need to write a few sentences about what you did yesterday.
I couldn't sit in the train because there were so many people.
Can you please turn off the radio for me?
Some Mr. Itoh wants to see you.
Come again.
The girl has a white horse.
She's walking.
Why are you still awake?
Tom was a scout.
You'll be completely safe.
What are we doing with this mess?
You can lose today and win tomorrow.
Tom counted the piece.
I studied hard while I was at school.
I refused the Tom.
Should we tell someone?
After five hours on the hot sand, he saw something on the horizon that looked like a desert fatamorgan.
When are you coming to the station?
Are you honest?
We'll try in your way.
Snow falls.
Are you a maniac?
Gold is expensive than iron.
I'll be better now.
And that's it!
I've made an apple pie.
Are you a prisoner?
No one's watched.
If you have to be somewhere right now, it's definitely here!
Tom could lie.
Good luck.
I've never repented for that.
Tom was mad as a rice.
Tom could have a point.
Am I welcome here?
I don't know what Tom was thinking.
What did you both do?
Don't yell.
What a experience!
Tom's learning to program.
Are we done?
How much does that cost?
Tom's a little eccentric.
Tom's the best singer in my class.
Mary came back from the school in tears because her friends were kidding her.
I trusted you with my secret and you betrayed me.
I'm writing very fast.
We all did that.
Maybe you're wrong.
I'm sure you'll understand.
I have to pay the debt.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
His speech was, mildly said, a catastrophe.
I'm worried about you.
We need to save money to buy a new car.
What are you going to write in this letter?
Bad things will happen.
I thought you already took care of it.
What year is your car?
You have to believe it's possible that it's going to change.
She translated her sentence.
Did you ever ask Tom to use it?
This book is dry.
She came alone.
Do love, not war!
I could go there now.
Everyone was cheering.
Tom said you were cool.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'm glad you answered.
Drive carefully.
Let's see.
It's just a game.
Do you have a perfume?
He's not a scientist, but he's our friend.
Don't play a monkey!
Mary's a little attractive.
Makes such a grimas to wish you hit him.
Does Tom eat eggs?
Turn left.
Be careful.
Vienna is a beautiful city.
You understand me.
Tom wanted to know what we're doing.
Are you honest, Ken?
When the screaming doesn't help, shout louder!
I think you should talk to Tom about it.
Resting in peace!
Tom arrived in time despite the storm.
Something wasn't right.
Tom said I was unreasonable.
Tom wanted to take Mary's phone number, but she refused to give it to him.
I beach someone to do it instead of me.
You're still inexperienced.
We'll have a great time.
It's not bad.
He asked me to help him.
It's so hot here.
Have you completely recovered?
Dan learned the Slovenian languages of all Eastern Europe that he visited.
Tom was wearing black farmers and a white shirt.
The book cost five bucks.
The picture was beautiful, you should have seen it.
Is it so simple?
Tom's not like the other guys.
Her face was a bright red color of anger.
Listen to this.
Can you cook?
How much is that worth?
Tom is an American living in Paris.
I was lucky to survive the accident.
What the fuck did you say?
I'm just doing my duty.
No one I know is going there anymore because there's a big crowd.
I'm teaching Korean.
Good luck on the exam!
I'm losing.
I don't want to see him again.
I'm glad Tom left.
I'm buying a lot of things in that store.
Drive slowly.
Mary's Tom's sister's twin.
Tom must have had the key.
Time in Istanbul is very cold.
Why is that interesting?
I'm curious.
Are you involved in this?
I'm sure Tom didn't intend to hurt your feelings.
Life is beautiful.
You're the reason I came here for.
Tom probably hates me, too.
Tom spent the whole afternoon playing tennis.
You can sit with me.
Oh, gray cat, please don't pass it.
I'll be glad to come.
Just give me a chance.
Tom asked Mary some questions she couldn't answer.
I saw the cat.
What's your smile?
How many people were there?
They're all quiet.
Send me some sugar, please.
I'm stunned.
I want the sword!
It seems too good to be true.
Don't talk.
Excellent!
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom got into Harvard.
You're a good team.
Why do you think Tom would do this?
Tom's my roommate.
Tom had a little help.
Tom was more than ready.
I'm not thinking about that.
You're average students.
Tom's as old as Mary.
The lemon's oxygen.
Why don't you come over sometime?
We all did that.
I'm drinking milk.
What did you do now?
This is the bag I bought in Italy.
Answer me right now.
Why are you angry with me?
Don't forget we should do homework.
It would be nice to wait for me.
They were sitting in the circle.
I want to meet Tom.
We've arrived in time.
I'm sorry.
Norwegian prisons are the most luxurious in the world.
Maybe something's wrong with you.
It happened.
You need a hobby.
Keep working.
I'm horrible with the kids.
We need to get another bottle of wine.
Where did you find this knife?
The west came like a thunder from the wind of the sky.
Now I have to go.
On a separate page of paper, describe your friend: years, where she or he lives, his or her work, etc.
She's looking for a hotel.
Tom's playing with his son.
I'm twice older than Tom.

It was a little weird.
What does this word mean?
I'm bluffing.
How do you say "bye" in German?
Tom promises Scotts hills and valleys.

Tom asked Mary to tell him where she hid the diamonds.
Finally, we have all the names of the fields in Norwegian and that will be of great help to our users.
Tom's gonna talk.
I want to see you!
It's on your left.
Where's the bathroom?
Your test results are great.
That doesn't look like you.
I'll call her tonight.
This will make our job much easier.
We should be tolerant to everything and everyone, but not tolerance.
We'll win.
Tom interfered with people who had a very bad influence on him.
That's his car.
Where did I leave the keys?
I got 100 points on the mathematics test.
Am I in love?
How do you know so much?
I'm substitute.
It's your choice.

Maybe Tom will agree to do that.

It's not over until it's over.
It's a big day, son!
You underestimate me.
Tell me what you wrote.
Smile.
Keep an eye on him.
Be home by half seven.
That's not all we have.
I was kidding before.
Stay where you are, Tom.
I recommend that you visit the British War Museum in London.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
He got a cat's lucky colleague on his birthday.
I'm from Italy and I speak Italian.
I know everything.
Bring me some food.
Could you translate this for me?

That's a fake, isn't it?
Do you live in town?
Thank you!
I can't just give up.
We're going to church tonight.
He gave up.
Do you like it or not?
Life continues!
Tom claimed it was an accident.
Tom had his drinks and ordered another.
"Do you like costumes?" "I hate costumes!"
I liked that one.
It must be scary.
Men want to feel significant.
Is there any other hotels you can recommend?
Can we just start over?
Do you know what this sentence means?
Do you agree with that?
Looks like he lives in Britain.
But the-but is an example of the ideophon.
You're paying me well.
He's working in big city hospitals.
Come on!
I've read a lot of books.
Tom said okay.
I don't want to discuss this right now.

I'm giving up.
What's in your mind?
I gave them an anniversary present.

How much does this hat cost?
This isn't drinking water.
Tom showed me how to read.
Was I really so happy?
Is that what I'm talking about?
He has one son and two daughters.
It would be better if Tom didn't buy Mary's gun.
That's how I realized.
Tom wrote several hundred articles and several books.
Where's the museum?
Our teacher will return from abroad in August.
Come on.
Are you coming with us?
He ended up in jail.
What do you mean?
All right, what about you?
I'm in a hurry.
We sang as loud as we could.
Tom wrote Mary's phone number.
There's a good chance we're gonna win.
The meeting took an hour.
I guess you're hungry.
I can walk only about three miles.
You told me not to lie.
Don't sleep with the light.
Tom was a garbage.
Beer's good.
We ran him out of the country.
I totally disagree with that.
He's crazy like electricity.
Don't you ever do this again.
Tell Tom what Mary did.
Can I get your dictionary?
I'm naked.
All future meetings will be held in this room.

What about you?
Eat what you want.
He has a big family.
You look a little better today.
No problem!
Tom's at least honest.
We will live like kings.
I didn't write this.

I'd like to use this opportunity to thank you all for your trust.
What's your old car?
You're absolutely right.
I apologize to those among you who are eventually injured; that was not my intention.
I told you it was gonna work.
I'm tired.
Nothing can stop me.

Who knows what that was?
It's been a long time.
Tom seems a little gross.
I shot a bear.
I've been looking for you.
Tom's been severely beaten.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote myself.
You didn't commit a serious offence.
I don't like writing.
You're asking me questions that you already know the answers.
I didn't see anything.
We get a few men mad at Tom in the bar and Tom told them he wasn't afraid to face them.
This is the end of the world as we know.
Did Tom really want Mary to do that?
Tom has failed to provide any evidence that would support his statement.
I'm not so happy.
Anybody want a beer?
If something sounds too good to be true, it's probably true.
I'm not gonna say anything.
Goodbye!
You're good to everyone.
Come see me after work.
Where's the beach?
How do I call a cab?
Where are our rains?
Tom signed Mary as a mercenary waiting.
Open up.
Tom's very sophisticated.
The face is easy enough to float on the water.
When you start, you'll never stop.
That's really nice.
I can't either.
I was nine when I asked my mom if Grandpa Christmas really existed.
Do you like roller costers?
It'll be all right in the end, if it's not okay, then it's not the end.
I'm angry.
Follow him.
Move, people.
Are you sarcastic?
I'm really sorry, Tom.
Where did you find this knife?
Speak for yourself, Tom.
Some people, no matter what age they are, don't lose their beauty.
We shouldn't be laughing at others.
Tom went to the beach.
Have you completely recovered?
Smoking kills.
I'm proud of it.
Where did I put my keys?
There's an obvious difference between the good and the best.
I don't sing.
You're a very patient teacher.
The elephant has a long nose.
I asked the boss about the elevation.

It's possible in theory, but in practice it's very difficult.
Is that far from here?
I'm very happy about that.
Tom had no choice but to smile and tolerate.
The cigarettes cost two Marks.
I know I'm not perfect.
That's how it was supposed to be.
Tom was nervous about you.
What's wrong with you?
We haven't met yet.
I'm not old.
Can I take your dictionary?
Tom ate the whole box of chocolate himself.
Keep the repository.
Can we do this later?
I like studying foreign languages.
The truth must be said.
Wash yourself.
Do you like the costumes?
Didn't you do enough?
What do you know about me?
I think he's very smart with that.
We have two daughters and two sons.
Does that mean you love me?
This will never end.
We have a serious problem.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Explain it with simple words.
In our monogamous part of the world, marrying means half your rights and double your obligations.
Tom just drinks coffee without caffeine.
There's a cat in the kitchen.
Tom pulled the smoker out of the bottle.
We need to get another bottle of wine.
Now we need the truth.
Tom's been sleeping all the time.
I really like your music.
Let me sit down.
This is Kopakabana!
Language of Europe is a translation.
I'm learning a few languages.
The mayor personally delivered awards.
When you hurt others, you hurt yourself.
I'd do the same again without thinking.
You're dead.
You can't make us leave.
Tom said I could stay.
Who else uses this room?
You'll save time if you listen carefully to my instructions.
Do you have any idea of my life?
He's tired of reading.
Can we order now?
The code is Muriel.
We can't stop here.
Tom didn't think of trying to convince Mary to do it for a minute.
Don't argue with me.
Hey, give me a chance.
There is also an ethical question that has been asked about this.
It just happened again.
Everyone survived.
It's gonna happen bad things.
Some people were killed.
Who's that crazy guy?
Do you love your mother?
He's a complete monarch.
Who is this man?
I'm really proud of it.
This is my third marriage.
What did you do here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's a little worried.
He likes a mosquito make an asshole.
I totally disagree with that.
The boy's thin.
It's a routine thing.
He never overcome his son's death.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will anyone tell me what to do?
Tom's writing better than me.
I don't have anything on my hand today.
I'm responsible.
You're doing good.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom pressed the switch.
I need my children.
The teacher wrote something on the board, but I couldn't read because it was too small.
Of course, Tom's wrong.
I didn't wash my hair.
I can also close your eyes.
He has to buy his son a new bike.
My dear, don't be shy!
Are you afraid of death?
Are you hungry?
Tom's still frustrated.
If you try, you'll make it.
We have enough seats for everyone.
That was a fake alarm.
Tom's learning programming.
Everybody can get waxes.
Tom didn't let me answer Mary's question.
What did you say?
I don't know the answer.
Every time I find something I like, it's always too expensive.
It's a cat.
This advertisement is very insulting.
I want Tom to leave by noon.
Tom seemed amazed.
Tom wasn't very energy.
Nancy's afraid of dogs.
It won't help you if you're worried.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
Did you go to see Tom?
I've been looking for you.
Cat's not a man!
So this is how it ends?
What's this?
I'll go with the car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know what question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.
She's asleep like a baby.
I'm taking my day off.
Are you blaming me?
That's not what I like.
That broke the mood at the table yesterday.
Stay in the house.
I thought you were going to Boston bus.
Tom still has a little time.
Fuck you!
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
Just waste your time.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
How many pairs do you have?
I've never had trouble sleeping.
It's locked.
I'll figure something out.
A honest man can't do that.
Take care of yourself!
I won't try to predict the future.
What are you doing at this time?
I'm early.
