Republican Resistance Strategy to Reelection of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans have justified their policies by combating counterfaith in elections.
However, in Brennan, the latest myth is considered as a myth, claiming that the cases of fake elections in the United States were rare than the death of a lightning.
In addition, only 300 cases of electoral falsifications in the United States have been calculated by the Republicans for ten years.
One can be said with confidence that these new trends will have a negative impact on the phenomenon of voters.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the American States are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most Governments have adopted laws that complicate the registration or vote.
This phenomenon was a new phenomenon after the elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new places in 26 states.
As a result, only one year of 2011, 180 laws restricting the right to vote were adopted in 41 state.
The new election laws require the voter to provide an identity certificate with photography and proof of the existence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of preliminary vote, emptie the right to register the voter on the day of the announcement and take the right to vote from the citizens of judicials.
Before the elections of 2006, no American state had obliged the voters to provide the identity certificate with the photograph.
Indiana became the first state to introduce such a requirement.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the law adopted in the Indiana in 2008.
The Republican authorities have hurried to distribute this practice to other States.
During the last two years, they have initiated drafts that require the voters to provide the identity certificates with the photograph, in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens have no universal identity certificates such as the medical insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, 21 million who have reached the age needed, have no identity certificates with a photograph issued by the Government's body.
Furthermore, five million new voters have no such document in 2012.
The value of receiving the required identity certificate often exceeds $100.
New restrictions affect youth, minorities and low-income people disproportionately.
In fact, 25 per cent of the African Americans, 15 per cent of people who earn less than $35, 18 per cent of citizens aged 65 and 20 per cent of the voters from 18 to 29 years of age do not have the required identity certificate with the photograph.
But that's not all.
The voter students who are considered to vote for candidates from democrats are not allowed in several states to use the identity certificate with a photograph issued by their educational establishment.
The same States, however, allow the members of the fisheries and hunting clubs, which vote mainly for the Republicans, to vote in the certifications issued by these clubs.
Until 2004, no state had required evidence of the existence of American nationality for vote.
This requirement was introduced in Arizona for the first time.
Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws that require voters to prove that they are US citizens.
These measures are apparently aimed at limiting the vote of voters from Latin America.
Two thirds of Latin American voters are considered to vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, the Republican Legislatives initiated laws that celebrated the registration of voters on the day of the vote in eight states in 2011.
They also limited the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
This limitation did not go without the consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to bring about 10 million citizens into the lists.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have resulted in a decrease of 17 per cent of the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators adopted in five other states laws aimed at reducing the period of preliminary vote.
Thus, during the 2008 universal elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters voted prior to the Afro-American were Africans, although the latter were only 13 per cent of the total number of state voters.
The same was happening with Latin American educators.
In representing only 11 per cent of the voters, they were 24 per cent of the citizens who voted in advance.
Unlike whites, 76 per cent of the voters were only 46 per cent in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their actors are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws have been vetered by governors-democrats.
The action of the most unequal laws was suspended in the intervention of the United States Prosecutor General.
This has led to partially limiting the negative consequences.
For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted laws that require the identity certificate with the photograph.
Nevertheless, new rules that have entered into force will undoubtedly make it difficult to implement the elections of 2012.
The criticism of democrats condemns the predominance of the laws which have been adopted, seeing their obvious focus on the impact of the 2012 elections in key states.
The report of the Centre of Brennan of 2011 demonstrated that the States adopted these laws represented 171 of 270 votes necessary in the voter colleague to win presidential elections.
It is too early to claim that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
It is only one thing that these new provisions will have a negative impact on the phenomenon of the voters.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Preliminary iron cancer: Do you have a test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives mistaken results, false, and sometimes fake positive results that lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, and so unwanted to dispanse, have more to doubt.
Do you want to go through a test or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
Studies conducted in the United States have experienced numerous infections among research groups, so the data received are difficult to interpret and difficult to develop any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, revealed a variety of mortality among those who passed the warehouse and those who did not pass it.
This study also showed, after the 12-year-old observation, that the probability of metastasis by 30-40 per cent higher in those who have not been in bed.
So, I would recommend to take a test from 50 or at 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Afro-American men are also at risk.
The key moment is to take the right decision as soon as cancer is discovered.
Cancer can be both aggressive and violent.
The patient must clarify the risk of his cancer, offering possible options without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not constitute a risk for life in a long-term perspective, but by selecting, in these cases, for active observation of disease.
To date, many men who have cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive or threatened to live.
We will offer them active monitoring, and if the disease begins to progress, we will begin the treatment.
We are increasingly incorporating the criteria to decide who should or should not take the course of treatment.
So I'd recommend that you do the test anyway.
However, it is also important to consult your doctor in order to determine whether the test is necessary or not.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember created a tool to evaluate everything for and against the passage of the test on the PSA.
This document (without any time in English, it will be available) can be downloaded at http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening
Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle reception to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, healthy lifestyle remains a better way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is estimated that if all people were fed well and moved enough, 30 per cent of cancer cases could be prevented.
"If no one was smoking again, this figure would have increased to at least 50 per cent," said Andrew Bolier, the press secretary of the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cancer cases are inherited.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Association, smoking cancer remains priority, despite the reduction in the number of smokers.
Smoking is related to 85 per cent of the cancer of lungs.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous damage to human health.
"And today there are 1,5 million smokers in Quebec," said the press secretary Andre Bolier.
Congratulating fact: 10 years after smoking, the risk of dying from cancer decreases half.
Wes
According to CAR, excessive weight and fatty also contributed to disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, thick and direct wombs, nutrition, iron and wombs.
" Studies show that regular physical activity throughout life protects from cancer of thick womb," added the Association.
Food
The Association also recommends that the consumption of red meat be limited.
In too large quantities, it increases the risks of a fat cancer.
Furthermore, sausage products should be avoided.
Conservation of meat by pressing, drying or salt may lead to the education of canceroge substances.
"The latter can harm the cells of the body and lead to cancer development," explains the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the impact of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But at present, the results of these studies cannot be considered unanimous.
According to SCC, vitamin E studies have made contrary results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other resulted in the opposite.
There is also no full clarity in assessing the impact on the development of vitamin D cancer.
However, Mr. Bolio stressed that his concerns and family analyses were important to discuss with the doctor.
"Analysis does not lead to cancer."
Higgs Boson in Details
Last summer, the report that scientists may have been able to detect Higgs' boss, caused the real arrogance, and not without reason.
It is estimated that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the universe, not much.
Furthermore, this is the last part of which was foretold under the Standard Model - our best, or, in any case, "the least imperfect" description of the nature and behaviour of the matter, which has not been discovered in a experienced way before.
But physics are not sure that this is the Higgs boson.
We know, without doubt, that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it is a very similar to the Higgs Boson, foretold by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, the new data presented this week at a large physical convention in Kioto appears to be confirmed, although some data are not yet fully confident.
Let's imagine the same thing as the Higgs boson, since the chances of wrongness seem minimum, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, one law is absolutely inevitable, saying that two things cannot go to the same place at the same time.
There is no way around this rule, not even try too hard, otherwise hurt yourself.
However, although the physics of elementary particles is quite a strange world, it also appears that there is a law of the same nature: the principle of Pauli’s exemption that two particles cannot take the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantum" is "staty" in general, in some of their characteristics.
As a result, the physics divide particles into two categories.
In one angle, we find good citizens called farms who are reasonably subject to Pauli's principle.
Another is the bosons, the disgusting gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything, at least for this principle, which means that they can find themselves at the same time at the same time.
As states the site (in fact, completely unusual) Particle Adventure of the Berkley Laboratory, these bosons are divided, in turn, into two groups: the mezones that we are not talking about, and the "power particles" through which the basic forces of the nature are spreading and somehow the Higgs bosone.
These bosons should be emphasized, not all such exotic beings as you might think.
In fact, if you're able to read this chronicle, it's because of an incredibly banal boson: photon, or part of the light, which is the courier of the electric magnetic force.
In fact, when one particle with electric charges accelerates or modifies the direction, it violates the electrical magnetic field in this particular place, like a stone thrown into the pond.
From this "defeat" is the electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultrafiolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and, therefore, one of the "power transmissioners" bosons.
More stable fields
The same happens to Higgs' bosone, with only the difference that in order to make this bosone appear, it has to be violated by another field, the Higgs field.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable of the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to achieve very and very high energy, as if it was a freezing spray, whose surface could only smash a very large stone.
That is why a huge accelerator of particles, such as the one used in CERN, the Great Adron Collider, which is a diameter ring of 27 km! - to achieve such enormous energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful for the explanation of the relationship between the Higgs boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electrical magnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interaction, but others do not: a paper sheet, for example, will never be held on the fridge itself.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who interaction have mass, while others (such as the photon, by the way) do not have it.
So, what can "to bring" all these studies, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows the physicians to gain the difference between the results of observations and the MM forecasts.
Furthermore, some of them are eager to find such a distinction, so that the smallest inconvenience can open the door for “new physics” and shut some of the Model holes.
The latest, must be said, has still significant deficiencies without offering any explanation for gravity (oh!) or for a dark matter that forms about 80% of the universe (oh!).
But we haven't found these differences in the CER.
Effects
The benefit of these studies for the daily life of a medium-statist person would be to predict more difficult, but it would be a mistake to assume that it was not.
At the beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of laser research in Bell's labs could not even assume what revolution would cause their work.
They predicted their applications in science, but not more.
In fact, a dead physicist, Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell's Laboratorys, where laser was invented in 1960, who himself developed the first continuous laser (precedented) in 1962, said that the original laser was considered rather as a lab gadget.
Imagine...
Furthermore, the annex can be found for the tools accompanied by the study.
For example, the same William Boyle developed a small light sensor during his optical studies in 1969.
This sensor, although it wasn't its original purpose, now serves as a “eye” for all digital world cameras and deserves the Nobel Physics Prize in 2009.
This certainly doesn't mean that the work of the Great Adron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows what it can be.
Palliative aid is the best way to die...
The Commission has recently discussed a delicate issue of life for the decent death in Quebec.
The debate should soon be renewed, and the draft bill is prepared at the time.
Nevertheless, there is still much to do in this important area.
"Long" tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. Lived one more in his apartment in Monterrey.
The prostate cancer that destroyed him from inside gave him a delay for two years.
"I was given five years, I lived seven," he said, between life and death, laying in a bed in the shelter of the spalliative care of Victor Gadbus in Bela where he arrived before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't prepare for it," he says.
The illness does its work: an incredible weakness that does not allow to go to the bathroom alone and even to eat on its own.
By sitting at the table on the appetite meal, he surrenders and agrees to help him take food.
He awakes, even smiles, talks to strangers who work around him, brings him medicines, brings him to the bath.
Courage before usual death.
"My greatest desire to be healed from the diarrhoea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the personnel found a medicine from this disease.
"In our life, they teach us that a man should be pissed stand," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victora Gadbua's shelter.
Regression to the condition of the child is for some insufficient humiliation.
"Everything depends on the ability of man" to reconcile the decline," he said.
Because many of the people who are concerned with palayative care, important events also occur in the heart of the decline.
Patients who come to Victor Gadbua's palliative shelter are all diseased with cancer.
The prognosis give them a maximum of three months of their life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses does not provide any more assistance called “healthy”.
Ms. A., 89, is most afraid of dying in consciousness of breath.
But my illness made me know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in my life," she said before she was allowed to put a breathing mask.
She continues to wait in the coming days of the last visit of her son, who arrived from Italy.
Victor-Gadbua's shelter with a volunteer group provide body care and food assistance.
This is a palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, every 11,700 inhabitants have one place in the Paliative Assistance Institutions.
It's very little, given that sooner or later we're all gonna die.
This is where life continues in the best conditions possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the shelter.
Whatever is physical, emotional or mental comfort.
We will agree to the dying person to provide the brandy or the pepsi linings, as he asks.
The diabetes are no longer forced to control sugar levels.
And death is part of daily life.
We brought a beer to Mr. X last night, who died tonight.
His son drove this beer in his legs in the dead in the morning.
"We are helping our relatives as well as patients," Natalie Savar, the director for the care of the patients.
Victor Gadbua's shelter doesn't look like the previous day.
In addition to a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family at the courtyard on his toast pillows, a young man of 36 years dies tragically surrounded by his parents, his wife and two small children and tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months of three to five cocks, they are always busy with cancer patients up to 45 years," said Dr. Christian Martel.
53 per cent of the patients hosted at Victor Gadbua's shelter are arriving from home, and 47 per cent from the hospital.
Probability of access to palliative care
It is considered that 77 per cent of the Canadians simply have no access to palliative care, i.e. to care provided to facilitate the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or in the shelter.
And some institutions, such as Victor-Gadbua and the Society of Palliative Care in the Great Montreal House, are specialized for more or less exclusive care for cancer patients.
This is the great gap in Quebec's health system that causes many doctors to fear the adoption of a law legalizing eutanasy and suicide aid.
From October, the manifest signed by the lights in the field of fuel care, Dr. Balfur Mount and Dr. Bernar Ljapuant, and witnessing their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec’s health system is insufficient to ensure the right to palyative care of high quality before the transition to eutanasia is permitted.
She said recently - I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency office, in terrible pains, and no one took the necessary measures to facilitate them.
I'm afraid that patients want to die only because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists have tried to save patients by the last day, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Ellen Richard's hopes for survival were minimal when she stopped the exhausting chemotherapy.
When I informed my oncologist that I was quitting the treatment, she replied to me that she regretted that I was stopping the fight, she said.
She told me my days were counted!
All-powered care is not available
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the patients who are asking for death would thank the medical personnel for not fulfilling their request after the fuel team facilitates their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely strong in combating pain.
According to Elsa Monroe, the director for Palliative Care in the Society of the Great Montreal House, patients are unacceptable to abolition in 8 per cent.
At the very end of their life, doctors often run to a palliative sedation where the patient sleeps until he dies, or at times, or constantly.
We can't pretend that we don't know about these sufferings.
All more and more patients who are unable to relieve pain will be able to have access to inflammatory sedation.
The sick people who suffer from pain always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to get eutanasy," that means "I want it to make me feel better."
The creation of this report has become possible through a journalist grant from the Institute for Health Studies in Canada.
Huge scandals with real estate in Quebec
Persons responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, political parties as well as Italian mafia experts daily tell what they know about the enormous " system " , the opposing construction industry, public officials, politicians, trade union workers and mafiasis.
Industries, which cost very expensive to Quebec's taxpayers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"I wonder how this system is broken after all the funds were released, Jacques Ducheno, the deputy and the former chief of Montreal police. "
It was the result of the scandal in 2011 as a side result of the investigation of official crimes related to road-building contracts in Quebec, which the Prime Minister of the Times from Liberals, Jean Share, had agreed very unwantedly.
The Ducheno Report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
" Since the start of the 2010 investigation, he stressed, only one of the Ministry of Transport would retain billions of dollars in contracts," if some had abstained their instincts to share.
The Charbonno Commission has already placed two mayors, he adds, hoping that it will "open the schemes behind individuals".
Permanent Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Division for Combating Corruption, which included a large state of government audiences, investigators and analysts, was linked to the case in 2011.
In addition, Molot Special Officers who had forced Montreal's eastern cartel after 2009 to cease the value of contracts.
A series of searches have been made over the past weeks, and some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Rishar Marcott, were charged with fraud and corruption.
In turn, Jil Wyankur recently retired from Mayor Laval, the third largest city of the Quebec Province.
He was suspected of receiving bribes repeatedly when the public orders were placed.
Furthermore, the official accusation was filed to several engineers of the Montreal's communications and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Acurco and Lino Zambito.
The latter exploded this bomb by investigating the “system” of public contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3 per cent of the cost of contracts in Montreal, some intermediary related to the mafia, which, in turn, translated the money of Mayor Gerald Tramble, United Monreal.
In the 2000s, Zambito screwed money right and left, and he listed more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about EUR 68,000) to various provincial parties, mainly the Liberals that were then in power.
He also admitted that he was illegally gathering funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party, Natalie Normando.
Kanalizing contracts with excess of value
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked indefinitely.
Gil Surprenan, former civilian construction engineer, detailed the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction firms, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes by $766,000 in exchange for sewer contracts that he has excessed.
Other officers responsible for the construction of roads recognized that they received a foot, over 30 to 40 per cent through false supplements.
Then an organizer from the Mayor's party, Martan Dumon, accused Mr. Tramble of intentionally closing his eyes on the existence of a parallel budget filling parties with dirty money.
After these discoveries, Mr. Tramble resigned in early November, putting Montreal into a deep crisis.
Shantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal who had been alarmed.
The mayor of the Rivier de Preri district in the east of the island is opposed to the sale of a municipal station purchased for $5 million and re-selled for... 1.6 million builders in the range of the construction paper.
70 per cent of dirty money in pre-electoral campaigns
She said that in the investigation that would eventually be initiated, it would "shook the string to understand the functioning of the system of ants to stop the gangrene and identify the guilty."
This process is characterized as "sick but positive".
We are in the wound cleaning process, but Montreal will need its own investigative group and observer to avoid returning to suspicious practices.
How we're going home.
Regularly.
Jacques Ducheno observed that “the officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars”, but he was particularly concerned about the role of “electoral officials who knew about the scheme” but not participating in the machination.
Given that the share of dirty money in the financing of the electoral campaign in Quebec is 70 per cent, he jokes, "I was said that it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit to $100 donations to parties, but he said that this would not change the situation: " Until we are strictly limiting the election costs, there will be dirty money in politics."
It requires the full restructuring of the public contracts and the financing system of the parties: " We cannot fall down below; with the courage to realize things, we will be able to build a house on a stronger basis, with better control and legitimacy."
If this story also casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Ducheno calls on those who are daring to look into their own court ...
"PSG - not FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you've made an extraordinary scope in the PSJ.
How will you explain this growth?
This could be explained by individual consciousness, but perhaps by a new dimension of PSJ.
Great players arrived.
I grow around them every day.
Technical personnel also brought a lot.
These factors make me raise my game every day.
And during the game, it's easier.
The football's all happening very fast.
But I'm not upset.
From the beginning in the preliminary training centre at the NIF in Clerfonten and before I came to St. Etienne, I have always been moving forward.
So you're benefiting from the competition set by Carlo Anchlotti...
The completion of this summer is not new to play a very high level match.
They also know that every training is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me is eager to be at the level and to be at maximum level.
In addition, Carlo Anchlotti is supporting my position.
He's helped by substitutes like Claude McClelle, who played in the same position as I did.
Anchlotti's owner of the situation?
Of course.
Anchlotti respects all technical personnel.
Today, he has no equality in the First League, and he is part of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a lot of experience, and he won a lot of titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with big players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I left a whole series of injuries.
The confidence that he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSJ season?
In the First League, Leon took our leadership.
But we're still ready.
One of our main objectives is the League of Champions: we have qualified effectively in one eighth final.
What's the club's goal in this tournament?
We'll try to walk as far as we can.
From now on, everything can be.
We can say our word face-to-face with very good European teams.
We want to end up first in our group, before Porto, in order to be able to take a response match in one eighth final.
Could the CTB be a first-class European club in a short-term view?
He already has a budget for that...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and build positions on a long-term prospect.
It's not true today.
Financing has the means to make the project real.
To take the title in the First League, like last season, will it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we really want to get this championship title.
In the past season, we were close to it.
In May, there was a disappointment because we had everything to get to the finals first.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
Of course, 79 points suggest the name of the champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played a more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Although strong teams, such as Marcel, Leon and Bordo, have entered the struggle for title, I think we have powers to win.
Don't you think the media are expecting too much from the PSJ?
It's normal that we expect a lot, given how much we have invested and what players we have.
We're ready for this.
On the other hand, when we're home winning 4-0 against Tru and we're still finding something to criticize, of course, it's a little embarrassing.
We ask what people are expecting us first.
We'll never be able to win every weekend with a 4-0 account.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to introduce a game project.
The team is formed with time.
We have proved at the League of Championships that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who has not been able to go into one eighth final, although they also spent the huge money!
In view of the amounts incurred, we represented you at 15 points ahead by the winter break.
This would be a disregard to our opponents and the French champion.
Leon and Marcel, who were not high in the past season, were "awakened" by this new PSJ.
This shows how fascinating the First League.
I hope in May we can smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The PSJ seems to be fully dependent on golden Ibrahimovic's movements.
Well, what if they say there's some Golden Dependence.
This only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he has a lot of heads.
He came for this and proves he's the Star of the First League.
Wherever he played, he showed that he was a big player and a world-scale star.
We respect him as a man and a player in the group.
He also respects people who are surrounding him.
What he did is really exclusive.
This also stimulates others to improve their game.
Tjago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro-2012 with the collective France?
It's like a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from breaking a little game time.
I've seen a lot of things there, and I got out of there stronger.
Today I can play good electoral matches.
That's what I was hoping of since I was baptized with the Blue.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we have to act modelly.
What do you think of the first months of Dedie Desham in the head of the Blue?
They're effective for him.
He has good positions in the electoral group to the world champion.
He's a strict coach, he's close to the players and inspires winning.
What Lauren Blanne was.
But I don't want to compare.
Blan has achieved his goal and has qualified us in the Euro.
I hope Dedie Desham will bring the Blue to Brazil.
A good earned man (1-1) ripped 16 October in Spain is a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in himself.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, my career had no matches like that.
Pay and sell without banks - with Bitcoin
Completely contrary to the current money exchange based on central banks, numbered transactions between recipients with commission collections for their processing.
Furthermore, how often these technologies occur, the political vision is evident: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopols, leads to financial crisis.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (psevdonim), is also a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euro ...) and a protected BitTorrent exchange protocol, which allows the exchange of files between participants of one level.
About 200,000 operations have already been registered from 15,000 computers in the network.
Several thousand websites are taken by bitcoins for donations or as payments.
The Bitcoin course, reaching a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 months later before returning to approximately $10 today (teaches indicated at the Bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing special compared to the global exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency published in October was interested in the system.
It describes the bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "contesting with a dollar or euro" and "as normal currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currency, such as credits used for promotion in a video game that are earned in the game or which can be purchased (and sometimes exchanged).
The Facebook social network has also developed a similar system.
However, the exchange operations are always controlled and processed by any central body.
In Bitcoin, all networks are at the same time holders of the accounting book, the audiences, currency emitters, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually happens between two e-mail addresses, like an email.
Only for each new payment, the user can choose another address by providing anonymity in this way.
The collection of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically, using a double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the validity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the transaction are actually in a public account sent across the network.
The key phase is the registration of a new transaction in this book.
It takes the decision of the mathematical task sent to computers which, as a temporary central bank, receives the privilege to add this new line.
It's a phase of hashing the file, that is, converting a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers take a new transaction and add a number before they're hashing all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (with many zeroes at the beginning).
As soon as the number is found, other nodes are easily checked that it is correct.
Transaction is thus unrelatedly related to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, in order to deceive, the user would wish to pay twice the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network, while the other would remain unaffirmed because they had different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the task gets 50 bitcoys.
In order to avoid inflation, the prize is regularly shared by half, perhaps by the end of 2012.
The number of bitkoins in the treatment is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided to one hundred million, which leaves other reserves...
The complexity of the task is also increasing with the increase in the calculation power.
The network's life has already survived flying and falling.
The Bitcoin service sites were attacked, and the bitcoines were stolen from reserves.
"The defect used does not relate to the protocol itself," assures Pierre Nuaza, who recently launched the Paimium company with real money payments using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported the possibility of washing money through this anonymous service.
But cash is also insufficient.
Great players such as Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of such kind.
Others, such as WordPress's blog platform, are authorized.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Institute of Waitzman in Israel, recently analysed the accounting book and found that nearly 80 per cent of the Bitcoyans were not trafficked.
The giant sales were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who worked at Coinabul, who was converting bitcoyns into gold.
Pierre Nuaza, another author of this currency, strongly believes in the capacity of this technology as an operational network.
His system, Paytunia, is an equivalent to the credit card (in current money) or the non-contact payment through the mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, so it comes cheaper.
The owner better controls his personal data and can be anonymous in this way.
The system is simple for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It's only enough to inform the address that can be photographed and recognised by the phone, and Pierre Nuaz has made it clear, assuring that he has already thousands of users.
There is a common trend in the review of hierarchical systems for more horizontal.
"Before the Bitcoin approve, it will pass for a while, but 2013 may be a turning point," he foretold.
The ECB in its report suggests, by the way, to review the various risks considered to be excellent today in the event of success of the system.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capisa and Suribi).
NATO and Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
For the Afghan Army, it is time to reconsider its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future without relying on us.
We have suffered mostly from the Afghan villagers we considered terrorists.
And we are, with 88 soldiers killed, injured and hurt.
Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also frequently of settlers who reject the presence of a foreign army, as it was with the SSSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even to join them dżihadists, Pakistanians, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tadgers.
They are tolerated, sometimes helped by local rebels, but they will be gone as soon as the West becomes more delicate.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the Netherlands base, which I observed from the height of the hills planted by the mindale trees thanks to the French loans, was fine.
The convoys of trucks and armotechnics in accompanying helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, the Talibs will not be invaded against Cabul .
The circumstances have changed since their insufficient promotion from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Cabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the fight between different groups.
Taking them under control of the country was then viewed as a kind of release, a return to security.
Afghan women paid for the darkness of these settlers, in which Al-Qaida had overcome, but their situation has not improved in our day.
Former mojahedes, the Afghan Government and the current talibs are united in their desire to keep women under control.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war have returned to the authorities in 2001.
They became participants that enrolled government lands to sell them to repatriates returned from Iran and Pakistan, using the vast American subsequent contracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
People, as I heard in rural areas, want a government that would not be a thief.
Many young people want to leave when those who have been generous of America will leave: capitals are significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during the exile in Iran or Pakistan, and appreciated his advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is up to 25 years old; 5 million inhabitants are now in Kabul, one fifth of the general population.
State schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
The jobs of these young people must be provided that they will not want to return to the darkness of old parties or to corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed warriors, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish sauce operes that represent the modern world and look everywhere.
There's a army at the moment.
Will the authorities that command her be considered legitimate?
Old leaders of the anti-Soviet fight have already taken steps to restore provincial wives who would not be subject to the central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountain country, with strong local distinctions, should be decentralized to a certain extent, by the model of Western countries, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized State with a strong presidential authority, removing the post of the Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai did not want foreign control, especially before the elections for April 2014.
But his country, starting from the 1950s and even earlier, depends on foreign assistance.
Industries have not been placed on their feet, no tissue is functioning, no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to the private initiative.
In a country destroyed by the thirty years of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There were rumors that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealths.
It only strengthened the feeling that the Western countries were there only to take over them.
Without energy to reproduce iron rude or copper on the spot, without transportation to export them through the mountains, there are no useful diggings.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the landing of Media Mes Ainak, leaving international archaeologists (Finded by the World Bank) to dig up an enormous Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers of the province.
It is also necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depends largely on imports and exports, at the same excellent day, restore normal relations.
The conclusion of the French military units was completed on 20 November.
The new collaboration treaty provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: girls, boys, French university, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support of archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in the pursuit of “creaming hearts and minds” and the impossible task of helping with incoming operations, military and civilian activities at the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was accelerated in 2012, along with the small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public work and activities aimed at reconstruction of agriculture in the dozen mountain villages.
These works, with the intense attraction of local workforce, were able to sustain the rebellion: rhythm, wells, drinking water, forest recovery, fruit trees, soil protection and increased land area.
What will we keep in mind about ourselves spending two billion euros on military expenses?
A much smaller budget would contribute to improving the living conditions of the local population, very severe in these valleys, often at more than 2,000 metres above the sea level.
The Embassy received tens of written requests for small agricultural work from local communities in Capesa Province.
In order to get rid of the rebellions led by foreign groups, what farmers wished, as they told me, we need to give them a small non-military support that would be well-controlled and direct.
Hard families of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risky step by President Muhammad Mursey.
While Egypt was divided more than ever, on the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gave him extraordinary powers, he decided to play a wa-bank.
At the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutional Assembly would vote on the final text for the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of the State provided the Assembly with two additional months to complete the work.
Shortly for two years, Egypt has been based on the preliminary text which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contraventions.
This new initiative has only strengthened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President is stubborn in his " autocratic breed", continueing to "violate the word" and "persuade the right".
His followers are convinced that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum should be held for 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to refrain from intention to explain to Egyptians the text, the article after the article.
For the President, this is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while displeasure has been overcome throughout the country.
Muhammad Morsey seems convinced that the Egyptians would vote positively, as he said in an interview with the American Time week.
In addition, the ultimateum call for accelerate voting is to the Egyptian people: “If you vote for my text, or I retain extraordinary powers”, which is expected to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constitutional Assembly, mostly Islamist, voted yesterday.
Most Liberals have not responded to the challenge.
In mid November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked the door, feeling unable to make their views.
The representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 persons, reserve participants, were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
It is not surprising that in most cases the article was voted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, distracted the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day occurred around... the time for prayer, as some members of the Committee considered that the hours of the Charter Assembly were misconducted.
The text on which the vote had been voted yesterday consists of 234 articles.
The object of universal attention, article 2 has finally remained an identical article from the 1971 Constitution, which states that “the principles of the sharia are a fundamental source of law”.
The Salaphic parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, were hoping to replace the " principles " with the rules " , which would enable them to be more strictly applied.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a witness to their goodwill and respect for other participants of the Egyptian society.
"Licemeria," are the Liberals who only see it.
Because they believe that the islamation of the Constitution is going through other articles.
They indicate in particular article 220, which gives the university of Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular in checking the conformity of the laws of the Shariat.
According to the expert on Egypt, Sophie Pomeje, this is alarming, so that " people who have to make decisions are not chosen and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can observe the theocracy fertility."
Many liberals are also excited by the fact that the next university rector seems to be much less moderate than the present.
"There is no specific religious intervention at present.
With this constitution, we remain within civil law.
Most lawyers who worked on this text are not ultimate, but people with university education, some have been trained in the French system," reassured Alexis Bloe, who prepares dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognized that “the circuit of article 220 could be misunderstanding, since the terms used in it were borrowed from a religious lecture.
This is particularly relevant to "fix" [Islamic jurisprudence, - Prim order.]
And in the future, the question of how eligible civil judges are to make decisions."
In addition to its religious perspective, the text adopted yesterday was criticized, as it gave the President of the Republic a broad authority.
Muslim brothers argue that they have been significantly reduced compared to what they were in the old regime.
Another controversial moment: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the military wishes, the consideration of the defence budget will not be held in Parliament but in the National Defence Council.
It will also not be prohibited by a court against civilians in military courts, despite the requests of human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text they considered destructive for freedom.
Responsibility for godly defilement has been preserved and is now prohibited by an insult, which may have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of press.
Furthermore, none of the articles are talking about the protection of a woman, stressed Heba Moraeff, from Human Wright Watch.
According to her, the only positive moment is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
The word not appeared in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to speak on TV last night, the manifestations were planned today on the afternoon.
Participants of the head of the State will, in turn, leave on the streets on Saturday.
Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places in Israel, Poop Earth and seas from dissolus
The Promised Earth combines the greatness of Bible truths, the modern comfort and the originality of nature.
The AIF has identified five of the most important reasons to be visited in Israel.
Let us worship the holy places
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that all those who enter this “coupelle” are deprived of God's grace.
And Galilee is the place of the miracles of Jesus: the wedding of water into wine, the walks of water, the calming of the storm and the filling of networks.
That is where Jesus appeared before his disciples and after his resurrection.
But most of all the sanctuary in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here are passing the path of the sorrow or the Crossway of Jesus (in Latin Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretorium, where the court was, and on the streets of the Old City brings the temple of the Lord's grave to the mountain of Golgoffe to the place of Raspath, the Stone of the anointed and the place of Jesus' funeral.
This is the symbolic Christian Pope of the earth, symbolising the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of St. Cross in Jerusalem will be raised in a place where, according to the Christian legend, a tree rose, from which they made a cross for Jesus ’ singing.
In Jerusalem, the most holy place for the Jews, the Stan of Plac, remained from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different confession leave notes with wishes that are then fulfilled.
Execute vertical trip
The ruins of the fortress of Massad remained from a secret shelter from the enemies Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on rear rocks in the mountains at a height of 450 m above the ocean level.
And only those who are involved in the alpine can reach them.
The rest of them are delivered to this historic top of the canatic road.
In the north of the country, at the height of 1600-2040 m, there is a famous mountainshooter Hermon, with a huge inflammation of tourists during the winter months.
The bus shuttle is delivered to him from the bottom of the mountain.
The overall length of mining routes is 45 km.
According to ancient dedication, the mountain's top seemed to have been the pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
In this country, about 300 museums.
You don't go to everyone for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth visiting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near Knesset (Parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or scrolls of the Dead Sea found in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and antropological exponents.
The art Museum in Tel Aviv should also be attended.
His exhibition is widely represented by the impressionists and expressionists of Mona, Pissarro, Renoire, Sesanna, Sisley, Matiss, Modilliani, Shagala, Picasso.
Acco can be visited in the Museum of Al Basa, representing several old Turkish bath halls with visitors and banders of that time.
In Caesarium, it is worth entering the unique Museum of Ralley, where you can enjoy the sculptures of Dali and Roden.
There are no excursion guides and souvenir bars.
The entry is free and the donations are not categorically accepted.
The fifth -- the Holocaust Museum or the Jad-Yousch in Tel Aviv -- tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part - the child's memorial - was built in memory of 1,5 million destroyed in concentration camps and gas cells of children.
You get into it and you're in absolute darkness.
The stars are floating.
And the names of the children of Jews and the names of the lands in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Recovery
Three main Israeli court zones are located on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has pools, aquaparks, dolphins and oceanariums.
Interestingly, even in winter months, water temperature is not lower than 21 degrees of warmth, and air warms up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and the sea is bathing around a year.
By the way, this most unusual sea in the world is at the lowest point of the planet at 417 m below the ocean level.
Lasur water in it is a rassol, which is easy to keep on the flood, even unsure to swim.
The landscapes around are unbelievable.
They are coming here to go through the course of treatment with salt water - rape and target fibres, and to treat the health of dermatics, allergies, astmas, exams, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar diabetes to bring the nerves in order.
To touch the Secrets of Ancients
They are preserved by the ancient part of Tel Aviva, the city of Jaffo on the Mediterranean Sea.
It was a famous seaway that connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to the traits, Noah built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beauty of Andromeda, with which they lived long and happy life.
Tourists love to flourish the narrow laundry called Zodiak’s marks.
They say if you touch the walls in the street of your sign, Fortuna will be favorable.
In Jaffo, youths come from all Israel and even other countries at photosessions.
And in Caesaria, the city of King Herod, you can enroll in the Roman theatre, "to take" the fortress of the baptisms.
In the Roman period, Caesariah was the capital city of Judea and residentiality of Roman prosecutors, including Poncius Pilate.
The renovated theater is now used for the evening concerts and operacles.
Note Tourist
Going to Israel, don't worry about your imperfect English: about 30 per cent of the people in the country know Russian.
Money to travel is better not in euros, but in dollars that are easily exchanged for shekels (now $1.8 - 3.8 shekels).
The city transport is mainly buses, but there is a fast tramway in Jerusalem, and in Heife, the only line of the metro in the country consists of six stations and the connecting Lower City with the Top.
In fact, it's a subway funikuler.
The travel of all urban transport types is 6 shekels, for which you can drive with transplantation within 1,5 hours.
The Sabbath is marked in Israel on the Jewish tradition on Saturday.
From Friday night before sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport cease.
The work week starts on Sunday morning.
In many cafeteria, restaurants and hotels, it is only a cosser food that excludes pigs, sea products, fish without cheese and food with milk and meat.
It offers a large choice of beef and beef food, soup and desserts prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish paste humus, variety of sausages, balloons of a meal falalel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no walking dogs on the streets of Israel.
But a lot of fed cats that are very "happy on their own."
In the evening, even on the roofs of parked cars can be seen asleep.
The bullets love human places and don't give up the feasts.
The car rental, depending on the mark, will cost $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance is $15 a day.
And the bike is going to cost at 15 secs per day.
The museum tickets are in average 30 shekels.
Digital Language
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Most of all, US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine arrived in traveling and resting.
In the Promised Earth since January to October 2012, 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists were visited, 51 per cent more similar to 2010, until visa was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
Great and powerful will lead to Moscow: migrants dig money in language
As long as the deputies and human rights defenders argue that the law on binding testing has already been issued in the country, frauders traded with "lips" certificates
Every year 13 million gasterbaiters are arrived in Moscow, Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of it are Central Asia citizens: Uzbekistan, Tadjikistan, Turkmenia.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of families left in the family.
Since 1 December, the law entered into force that each labour migrants would be obliged to conduct an examination of Russian language.
For now, this rule only works for those who intend to work in the field of service, housing and communities, housing and diversity.
However, with time, - the FMS promises - tests will be binding for all arriving.
However, it will be necessary not only to give the language but also to the Russian history and the basis of legislation.
The knowledge of the language will have to be reaffirmed for both obtaining and for the extension of the permit to work.
The exemption only works for citizens of countries where Russian is a public language.
The law is not subject to the law and the people who have successfully obtained appraisals and education diplomas before the decline of the SSSR in 1991.
The benefit, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of examination items will work under the auspices of the Russian language Institute named Puskina, the University of People's Friendship, IGU, SBG and other Russian lips.
The migrants can be tested in all cities; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
The Initiative for the introduction of the test was supported by the State and the FMS.
But before the law entered into force, many times they had the opportunity to ask in the press: What does that give?
What will change the obligation to learn the language and to the Russians and to the arriving themselves?
First of all, the representatives of the Migration Service respond -- that will reduce the number of people suffering from “work slavery”.
Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of work migrants, explains the leader of the Russian FMS Mission in Tadjikistan Victor Sebelev.
Protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only a system of organized sets will allow 90 per cent to address the problems of foreign workers.
There are problems with migrants without profession, education, non-scientific languages.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev is confident that the future migrants are obliged to face unconscious people who would like to help him put a " path" into a horrible tight bark, where he and his dozens like that would be screwed for months without food and documents, incorporating 12-14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"Them is promised one thing in the family, and when they arrived, they are deceived, picked up passports, not paid for the promised salary," confirms the Chief Office of Work Migration of IPS Tadjikistan Tolib Sharipov.
Don't argue, messenger!
Nevertheless, many medium-Azian citizens in Russia are acknowledged that they do not only know the language of the country in which they strive, but are hard to write in their own.
Of course, it is not as much of their wine as the troubles: few Turkmen, Uzbeki, Tadjici can even afford a thorough primary education.
Because their families have nothing to feed their children, not mentioning them to wear good clothes, shoes and equipment for school.
As they grow up to adolescents, such boys are earmarked for earning at their first opportunity.
It's hard, if it's bad with the knowledge of the language, they will admit.
"You feel humiliated and invaluable."
True, the law on the language of human rights defenders marks one important moment.
The test will be conducted only for migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or follow-up.
In the meantime, most gasterbaiters continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or the Foreign Entrance Brightened."
Many arrived claim that getting official status in our country is not that easy.
The reason is in bureaucracy and the same linguistic difficulties.
Furthermore, legalization is worth money: from 12 to 16,000 rubles.
But the false registration can be done quickly and only in a thousand and a half.
Russian police officers know that we mainly have fake documents, we have no registration, from here and cases of expulsion.
"A hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," said the journalists of the Tadjikistan Citizen, Umed Huskadamov.
"Flip, don't push, buy a painting."
On the first day of entry into force of the language law, it was revealed that there were not only migrant registration documents.
Several "lip" certificates for language tests have already been excluded from FMS staff.
Fake papers are printed on a normal color printer.
Of course, they have reached the new owners with no relief: each migrants who so hoped to facilitate the challenge of testing had paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two times more expensive for official testing procedures: it will cost a work migrant in three thousand.
The main challenge for the next time is to protect the system from corruption so that the " steps" cannot be simply purchased, compared with the representatives of the authorities and human rights defenders.
While the authorities can promise the gasterbajters that have failed to perform the testing since the first time, the time for the study of the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian arrivals will be offered to work in areas without active communication with people.
IMD does not turn into an illegal arms market
Proportion of crimes with legal weapons
The IMD of Russia suggests that the law on civil weapons owners be reinforced.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: Push the wedding shots when there were no victims, and the fight established by the Moscow Lawyer, Dmitri Vinogradov, which resulted in the death of seven people.
The police are trying to ban their trauma in public places and to increase the age from which weapons licenses can be obtained from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Thinking Security Committee and the opposition of corruption of Irina Jarovaya and promised that amendments to the arms law would be made to the State in a short future.
Not everyone is pleased that the Russian authorities are trying to combat the problem by "closing the hacks".
The network has opened a letter, whose authors, representatives of various public smaller organizations, are required to refrain from " useless deficiencies".
The percentage of huligence with registered weapons is minimal, said the Russian Bi-Bi Criminal Lawyer Vasili Lesnikov.
According to IMD statistics, 142 firearm crimes registered in internal authorities have been committed during six months of 2012, while 1168 000 crimes have been recorded during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the proliferation of civil weapons legislation does not place a criminal to go to the black market.
Now, they say, any weapons in Moscow can be found at a low price.
Meanwhile, the IMD claims that they control the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The Black Market of Weapons is filled by several channels.
The main channels five, commented by the Colonel in retirement by Victor Baranac, who has been working for ten years in the Ministry of Education and Genstab structure.
Score of the site taking arms orders
The first is the army or military trail, that is the weapon stolen during the fighting activities in Kavkaza.
"The weapons were taken by Russian officers and the Cawcasans themselves," said Baranese.
The following type of black weapons is stolen by criminals from force structures.
The Baranac explains that police warehouses are also removed and stolen from law enforcement officers.
Illicit arrays are sold from military warehouses.
Many military warehouses have frequently experienced explosions.
"There are evidenced versions that part of the fires have been made specially to cover the lack," said the former military.
The Barans said that the manufacturers of weapons are bringing their leptue.
"Now there are private arms factories that do not endure competition in the international market and throw weapons from under the floor to the black market, including Moscow," said the expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
There are particularly many guns and machines from poor countries, such as Kirgisia.
"There is its production, sometimes crustaceous, and there was a mafia that organized the stream," explained the former military.
Where did the weapon come from?
The experts estimated the approximate share of each of the sources of illegal weapons supplies on the black market.
The report prepared in 2011 the Centre for Disaster Analysis and Public Management Projecting.
Specialists analysed the reporting of the IMD and Rosta, criminal literature and open data of the portals on arms theme.
The suppressing part of illegal weapons, according to researchers, comes from the army and force departments.
Half of all weapons in the black market were found there “on the guilt of officials whose work is related to weapons”, stated the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the weapons came from the places of armed conflict, 14 per cent of the abduction of weapons, 5 per cent in black archaeology.
A consultant of one of the arms shops, who asked not to call him a name, assures that weapons found by black shoppers have not been purchased for too long.
Most of all, as he says, the sellers go to a warehouse to the new party.
Through the flag, a man buys a unit, like a TT gun.
He's being released, transferred through the bench.
"He transports it to the city and sells 900 euros here for a piece of two shops," he said.
"Truth, the police are aware of all cases, therefore, periodically when the crime-recovering plan is ongoing, it is procurement of illegal weapons from traders," the consultant added.
"As in a luxury store."
Seller and buyer often find each other through friends.
I looked on the websites, in the blog until a companion responded, who suggested to come to the Beach platform, where a man will take me to the corner, where we're going to trade.
The price of the gun I've only learned there.
Military Observer Victor Baranese
To get a gun, I need a friend who has a way out, a consultant says.
There are market salesmen, but there is also a need to come from Ivan Ivanovic, who asked me to say that his daughter had a teeth fallen.
I'm even getting a couple of castets right now through a man who's sure.
He's giving them to me, too, because he knows I won't give it up.
The new ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Baranese tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing for the publication of this article.
The schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album with a photo where it was "everything."
"I felt like a luxury store," said the military.
The buyer, according to the Barans, does not offer a cat in the bag; everything can be tried.
I'm a potential client, not just buying, we're going with a seller to the forest, putting a target there.
"I'm given the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm convinced that weapons are good, we're starting to trade," the expert's procedure describes.
Couch store
Searchers on the Internet provide websites and groups in the Contact, where they offer to buy weapons for various purposes.
It does not require any documents and personal meetings.
"There's enough to have a certain amount of money," they say in the ad's hat on the website "Buy a wargun or a machine."
The users leave their applications and ask questions on it.
Are you going to sell to minors?

"Buy TT.Moscow" is a phrase of Fedorenks.

I have heard of these schemes: the website is usually registered outside the Russian laws.
People are taking orders.
The buyer is paying off through the bankomat.
"In response, they send a photograph and instruction where weapons are hidden," said the press Secretary of the Public Arms Rights " Dmitri Kislow.
Victor Baranac claims that if you leave a request on the site, you can stay without weapons and go to prison.

Macarov for $100
In buying illicit small arms, experts estimated that the amount of $100 to $900 could be attached.
According to Dmitri Kislova from the "Right to Weapons", Macarov's gun can be acquired for $100,300.
We'll have to wait a month and a half.

According to the official statistics of the agency, compared to January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia has decreased by 7 per cent and was 22.9 per cent, while the number of explosives and weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices had decreased by 7.8 per cent.
U.S. Fastfood and supermarket workers
Through the MacDonald Cartage, it goes to the fourth of all American teenagers.
The recent days in America have been a wave of protests against low wages in the universities of Walmart and popular fast food networks, such as MacDonalds, Bunger King, Tako Bell, Wendis and Kentucky Fried Chiken.
Until no one decides to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or it is judged to die in early stages.
Action supports trade unions and a number of left public organizations.
In addition to the improvement of the modest wages received by Walmart and rapid food workers, the aim of protesters is to establish trade union organizations.
Until this economy is nearly covered by the trade movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week, after Thanksgiving Day, on so-called Black Friday, when the selling orgy of cheap sales in America had been deployed by millions of residents and sometimes accompanied by shopping.
On this day, some Walmart Corporation employees, who are working 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and picketed with trade unions and left activists the corporation shops whose goods are based on people of modest and medium-sized supplies.
Walmart trades all in the world, from diapers, hunting guns and car batteries to dusts, eggs and milk.
Products in his shops are on average 8% to 27 per cent cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid Walmart employees renounce only their work.
The availability and accessibility of goods made Walmart one of the largest American corporations.
According to criticists, Walmart can afford to sell the goods of the sewage partly because it pays little to its employees.
The latter also complains of difficult labour conditions, such as the lack of carriers or manual scanners.
Participants in the Black Friday shares demanded a higher salary and settled that the value of the medical insurance provided by the corporate has risen from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
The typical Walmart employee, who gets $9.5 an hour, didn't make the expense by the pocket, they said.
Scientists from the University of California in Berkle prove that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12 an hour, it will cost $3.2 billion.
It's about 1.1 per cent more than she spends on salary now.
If Walmart totally transfers salaries to the buyers' shoulders, each visit will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, they'll spend some $12.39 more than now.
The Walmart participants have noted that the protests were only in nine states and did not harm corporations.
"Black Friday" continued in her shops from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight next day, and Walmart sold about 5000 goods per second.
In general, its kass machines produced nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The representative of Dan Fogelman stated in an interview with the Huffington Post ' s left jobs in general, " less than five" of Walmart staff, and that the protest was just a "new piar trick" that organized its trade union.
"Free Cassa!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their object was not the university of Walmart (they are not regretted in this progressive city, and that is why they are not yet), and the McDonalds and other cheap restaurants.
McDonalds says he's selling billions of bucks, and then he doesn't even give you hospitals and he doesn't pay you for a fair job!
Jumaine Williams, member of the New York Corps
At present, the minimum wages, according to federal and New York law, amount to $7.25 per hour.
The fast-food restaurants increase it with time, but less, and in the average, their serial workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one earns less than them in this expensive city.
How can you exist in New York for such money, I can't see it.
Once through McDonalds, almost a quarter of American teenagers who worked for them after school, living with their parents.
Many have seen the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I'm constantly interviewing McDonald's workers who complain that they should live on that salary and sometimes even feed the children on it.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal forum has a comment that the author notes that it is irresponsible to bring children, unless you know what you will feed them.
Participants in the protests that started on Thursday at MacDonalds on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cassiers and rapid food chefs start paying at least $15 per hour, which is more than doubled their current minimum earnings.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be established in the field of fast food.
The American Law prohibits the administration from preventing and punishing trade union activists by jurisdiction and dismissal.
On the other hand, the administration rarely facilitates their lives.
However, prompt food is also difficult for objective reasons to cover the trade union.
One of the main is the unusual status of staff.
Disagreeable
The noise protests took place on this day and on a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
In the middle of the day, a shareholder showed up at McDonald's meeting next to the Times Square, where several local Democrats politicians were presented, in particular a member of the Council of Jumaine Williams, who said, "McDonalds" said he was selling billions of receipts, and then he didn't even give you hospitals and does not pay you for a fair job."
The demonstrators also supported other visible New York democrats, such as the mayor of the city of Bill De Blacio, who stated that " we should join the support of fast-food workers in order to achieve fair salary and economic welfare that each New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described, this was the greatest share in the history of American rapid food.
But it was only a few hundred people, but not all of them were rapid companions in which tens of thousands were employed in New York.
Uncertainly, whether this spark flame of mass movement will be born.
"So long as the brain's deceiving is mean."
The theme of modern technology fans of supplemented reality has recently been accepted mainly through the prize of special points.
First in the summer of her annual conference, the active model showed Google, and then in November, it was known that the application for the corresponding patent was also made by Microsoft.
However, from the interactive 3D technology manager in the Cambridge Lab, Microsoft Sharam Izadi, it is important that the scientists of this company are a stage.
Their prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with naked hands, creating virtual open spaces.
Can you please tell us in general what your research team is doing?
- We're dealing with machines, but we're trying to move the borders of this interaction.
As long as humanity in the mass is stuck at the stage of work with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes their fingers.
We would like to look forward for 5 to 10 years and predict cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the gesture management.
- What else's waiting for us?
- Despite the fact that Kinect has passed the interaction at the physical level, much still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input has improved (the system receives more data) and the conclusion is not yet very much.
We are trying to change this, we work on real 3D reflection systems based on different technologies, including projectives.
We have to release the computer world into our, physically, to make it more obsessive.
However, it is necessary to identify not only the user but also the space around it.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all, fuck these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think of the voice management?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it overestimated?
- It is definitely not called a panace - a matter of privacy, because it is not always desirable to report about its actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in his own thread.
For example, we had a project in which we were thinking about gestures, but not the lumpy, but the extensive, short.
The gestures were not taken by a camera, but by a hand bracelet that fixed the movements of bones and muscles.
As long as it's big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the hand hours.
But at all, the future of a mixed management type, for example, a gesture+glass.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to hand over this gasoline bank?
You'll say and show it at the same time.
- I usually just say.
- Oh, it'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you're trying to make users adapt to what the car can or cannot at the moment?
- It's not necessary, but it's mutual completion.
I think we will have to work mostly on the development of new types of sensors, which will enable us to define human reactions more accurately.
These may, for example, be laser sensors, they give good depth resolution, which is very important.
- Speaking of your Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Is there a lack of permission, depth or something?
- In principle, the present generation is what can be distracted from in our three-dimensional recognition work.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 with 1000 x/s.
But it's not megapixels, it's like matrix and depth.
From the last point of view, all current technologies are not good for us -- this adds work to algorithm designers.
So you should not only remember the X and Y resolution, but also Z.
The speed is also very important, the number of staff per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 x/s are frankly low, especially for gestures.
Steven Betishes, from our Redmond Lab, has made a sensor for the controlled processing delay - from 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of humans and machines.
I would use the equivalent of such a device in my work, but not a touch that would make the staff more in a second.
- Don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared radiator, and the second is the receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is, in particular, the ordinary sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
The potentially larger number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or to make it worse by increasing the calculations required.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog of Kinect, play with the curve of the cameras and see how this would help to define the situation three-dimensionally.
- As I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented her glasses to the public.
Don't you think that, from the perspective of the daily use of the techniques supplemented with the reality of the score is one of the most perspective platforms?
Of course, all the time walking, holding the smartphone in the hands raised, not very comfortable, but this is what I think is the coolest option would be the "going" supplemented reality when on the basis of the cloud platform you could switch from the points to the smartphone, the projection screen and anywhere else.
The scores are a very personal device, in which their power (private things only you see), and the weakness - the supplemented reality on the basis of the points will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual gallographic objects in the air is not only accessible to Tony Stark from the Iron Man, but also to a simple mortal.
There is one problem that often indicates the criticism of the idea: there is no tactical response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the complemented reality is the seventh breakdown in the human and machine interaction.
I think the eighth could be an addiction of tactile feelings.
At the same time, one of the interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a kind of image floor.
She's got a lot of pressure records!
But there are technologies that are really aimed at bringing these "in the air" maps -- for example, the interference of several directional ultrasonic lights in a certain point where the finger is, gives a sense, but while it's very weak -- it's like you're screwed up on the pillows.
There are also bracelets on the wrist that affect nervous endings in the fingers, as well as the prospective direction.
- Did you try to deceive your brain?
To make him think he feels what he should feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried to do that yet.
There is another challenge to fight for a long time - how to force a person who is physically in a very limited area, to believe that he is going on open, practically infinite - we work on the concepts of runway tracks (not even in clubs) and giant platforms.
As long as the brain is deceived, work has been worked for many years.
This is what makes work on virtual reality so attractive to the researcher -- many things in a completely initial state.
The taste instead of the culture is Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the Petersburg Avangard project, dedicated to the towns ahead, in the avangarde of culture and art.
The top list has already been accompanied by the bright art scene of Petersburg, whose achievements are beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe through the universal Russian knowledge.
The new hero of Rosbalta is an epiphatic artist Kiril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyrille Miller, a boobed man who is dressed in all the red, who meets the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, the fashion party and the backfalls.
The pictures of Kiril Miller always gather the crowds of viewers wherever they are.
Cyrille Miller is one of the many Petersburg socio-philosophies, the creation of new mithologies.
Cyrille Miller is a bright man of the Petersburg Avangard at the end of the 1980s, the beginning of the 1990s.
Furthermore, he is a man of the city, his appearance on the streets, causing a smile from the towns who are in the mood.
Recently, he took the charm and became a Petersburg charmer, since he grew up to this complex role for all his godly existence, philosophy and images.
- Cyrille, why are you walking around the city in all red, not in yellow or bruise, for example?
- I chose red color as a modeler with a view and image.
In this world, red color is a compromise between artist, imagemaker and society.
Although everything in society that is almost gray is aggressive and abusive.
But my provocation is about to start talking.
The whole history of my provocational action is invitation to discussion.
- When did you realize you should be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the D.C. Nevski, where my work was exhibited.
I realized it was my way.
Then the wave of the old free informal artists passed, and the new, free, like me were unacceptable.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the postgassoning, which led to Pushkin 10, and there was no more wave.
He throws me to the theater, the clothes, the music, all the genres, except the word.
- And all of this has been united in your art clinic... - I was important to be in the center of Petersburg culture where all the best creative forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I took the territory in Pushkin 10, and there was a musical artist club, a goddamn club, a house of Petersburg Bohemy.
Many were born there, NOMs, Tequila jazz, remembering Schnoore brought with the Ucho Van Gogh project.
Schnoore and his friends sang light songs under the faner, they were in a embarrassing trick, among them the modern composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group played alive, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was leading many programmes to the Khale-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went away, and he received basic education and education from us.
The gallery "D 137", the Pigeon Club, are the noises from Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and our workers went forever.
I'm a hero of the last century when the culture meant something.
In 2000, the press survey was in, the prize was "The people of our city."
In the year's nomination, I was called, and my cultivation ended.
In the new times of old rules, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is a recognised manner.
- Many of my paintings are hits, and they have a clear expression of relevance and sharpness.
I'll have a software exhibition, the Russian Museum in clowns.
Clowns are an extraterrestrial category.
I used to be social, being like this is painful and horrible.
But in the clowns, the tragedy is being taken off.
I love grotesk, I have grotesk ideas.
For example, the saving of peace through the totalitary change in order.
Now they meet on the clothing, focusing on the external mechanics, not on the internal person.
Maybe you can't give him a hand and spit in the face.
And the deception will be removed by re-wearing.
And recently, we saw you as a city charmer.
Whom I don't like to be.
- Could commercial art be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art must be precise, tactical, sweet.
Cultural disintegration is ongoing.
In the past, people were struggling in the barn, the goddammed loved, the prostitutes, the other.
Now everyone's broken into microsociates, and it's hard for everyone to like now.
I'm not a $100 paper to like everyone.
Now you need to think who you're gonna like.
Now every cult hero has 100 fans.
- There's a few thousand on Stas Mikhail!
- It's broken, it's a sex-social sphere.
And on the cultural ground, 300 people will come and 10,000 won't come, and the result is less management, money, everything will go.
I have the fans, the main thing is not to be deceived, not to ruin the profits.
I wrote these pictures in my youth that one collector had them on the wall next to Falk and Larion's hanging.
I started with pictures that usually end.
They're frequently confused.
They say, spiritual culture, consumption culture.
There's no consumption culture, it's from another opera.
I'm a man of the culture of yesterday, grown up in the examples of artists living in poverty and dying in poverty, denied money for painting painting.
I'm for this kind of culture.
- Cyrille, what's wrong with Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: a cultural official.
But not every one of them can engage in culture.
With the right kings, the kings may not have very much understood in the culture, but they knew that the right experts had to be held.
There are good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in Petersburg who might be experts, but they are induced, because we need higher experts who will appreciate those experts correctly and give them the way.
It's a taste.
The same Earth, but they're different that they're honestly saying that not all modern arts we're taking, there are artists who need to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, much more in Moscow, there's soil.
And it's hard for art to grow on our stones.
We need cultural soil, and now we have more writers than readers, that's wrong.
In Europe, there are a lot of people who are curious. They go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of thin.
We need to do fashion art like it was in the beginning of the past century.
The project implemented on the funds of St. Petersburg
Born in Outer Space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with asteroid killer.
The spaceship carvans with landscapes are deployed to search for a spare planet.
In order to preserve humanity, is the main question of how to continue in the conditions of inadequateness or on the same reserve planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be conquered at least hypothetically.
"This is Venera and Mars," believes the Senior Scientific Officer of the State astronomical Institute called P.C. Sternberg (GAISH) Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions are more suitable for life on Mars, the surface of Venus is 500 degrees.
You can only live on a big height or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The approach to the reproduction in space began with flora.
A half-century ago, plant experiments have been conducted.
Four generations in the orbit of the mountain were not different from their earthly sorts.
Then, an orbit of insects, tiny fruit fly-drosophile.
In 1979, the eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops in the conditions of faintness.
We get a totally normal bird on the way out.
And then the problem begins.
"The problem that this bird must find resistance must stand on his feet and begin to move," explains the head of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) RAN Vladimir Sichev.
Without the resistance, the birds were screwing out of order.
And 10 hours later, the newborn had a complete atrophia of instincts.
The birds did not respond to the light and sound.
And there was a problem that in four days they were just dying.
"And twice we pushed the birds, then we refused, because it's impossible to work with them," said the experiment with birds in space, Vladimir Sichev.
With animals, the last time the biological "minicch" flyed to orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, experiments will continue.
However, only one-poxed persons will be on the Bion Satellite.
There was an experiment with rats that have already been sent to space with fruit.
In principle, there was nothing supernatural.
"It was just on the satellites, but it is a single experiment, and such research must be conducted," said Vladimir Sichev.
After the landing of the Space rats, the seeds appeared.
But the problem of reproduction is not yet available in space.
It's a difficult task.
Animals, losing, a habitat environment, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
A man, unlike beasts, may in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
No such experiments are conducted on ethical grounds.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereskov.
And the most precious thing humanity has is a female organism.
Our Tea's gone, and no one on Earth could say if it would be saved after the flight to space.
Can she have a child after this flight?
"No one answered this question," said the Veteran of the Space-Rockets Division Wachtang Vachnazee.
In June 1964, only a year after the flight to space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereskova had borne a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrew Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, a second cosmonautic woman, Sweetlana Savicka, who had two times attended orbits and even worked in open space, was born by a son.
However, the risk remains.
We don't have a lot of cosmonauts that have long flights, and a healthy generation grows.
"And if more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," the outcome of the aviation cosmonaut, the Hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia Valerius Poljakov.
Nevertheless, humanity needs to find some new paths in biotechnology, protection from radiation, artificial gravity.
The CPC hydrolaboratory is a mandatory phase of preparation for flight.
In this case, the cosmonauts are working in the open space in the conditions of zero swimming.
Water is imitating the wax.
If adult water is comfortable, but still a foreign environment, the breast-feeding children are natural.
Little hythiands as if they confirmed that life on the ground came out of the ocean.
There's a link between the baby's approximately nine months in the approximate fluid, and it's easier to get used to the water.
It is in principle logical, because since the day of birth, since the first bath, it is only two weeks.
"It's very little to forget something," said Marina Axenova, instructor for chest swimming.
In the word, if the child's weakness is more natural, it is necessary for a woman to gravity, the strength of gravity.
Very quickly, muscles of abdominal drilling, thaza, falling in the ability to push the fruit.
All right, let's put this down, based on the stimulators of family activity.
Of course, you can go to a special cell, she'll push it out.
"And what?", asks Valerius Polakov's non-sustainable questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling of earthly gravity, the organism will not form a skeleton and a muscle system.
The newborn in orbit cannot be dressed as an adult in a special training suit.
He's just going to be deprived of what he's going to need.
"And this experiment that we will go with you allowing the child to be born in a foreign environment will lead to bringing a disabled person to the Earth, completely disadvantaged," predicts the head of the IMBP Committee on Bioethics, RAN Igor Pestov.
As long as the birth of children in space is a theory issue.
However, later, this will be a reality when the landmen on their ships will go to a remote planet that will become a home for their offspring born in space.
Chief of the Chief Controls Management: The check of the Schwartz system failed by politicians.
In the procurement sector, Czech Republic has good control authorities and, despite the qualitative legislation, it stands in its application.
This statement was made by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Control and Revision Management, from an interview for the Currently.cz website.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, what I think we are missing," he commented on the current situation of Kal.
Such conclusions provide a joint inspection of the Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of the wrong practice, Peter's approach to the so-called Schwartz system was brought to Peter’s approach.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GDP (Gradian Democratic Party) would not disturb the entrepreneurs by verifications - is that prohibited or permitted?
"The law should be established in some way and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of institutions to be required to verify and pursue obligations," states Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and the German parties, which compared the public procurement legislation of both countries.
What was it specifically?
It means a parallel check we started, probably two years ago.
Easily speaking, the European legislation claims how public procurement should be made, national legislation and subsequently practice.
All information has been gathered and, even in an unfinished verification, there have been interesting differences -- easy to say, we may have a "correct and unchanged" legislation, but in practice, we decline Germany on certain parameters.
It is therefore necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you what it means to you?
This joint control can contribute to the efforts to stop the clarification of laws, reducing and improving restrictions, as this does not result in a positive outcome.
Economy means receiving the relevant item for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and perhaps criminal behavior.
But not the fact that we're going to do this, has reduced the limitation of orders.
The system may be filled with "papers" in such a way that those who want to find the layouts in the system will find them much easier than if the limitation had not been lowered.
You are talking about internal issues of practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an organization such as our ClA (Control Revision Management) or does this work otherwise?
With regard to institutions, there is also a colleague that works a little differently, but mostly both institutions function similarly.
Furthermore, the powers are similar to certain degrees, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and federal lands, their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public resources.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal accounting chambers.
What about local legislation, is there easier than we have?
In fact, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects, Germany could be taken as a sample, but it cannot be definitely said that it is best in everything.
Is that because they're better dealing with control?
Absolutely not, but again, I don't like these comparisons.
However, even sample countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any advantages from cooperating with our office, would they?
With regard to domestic legislation, how did the amendment to the Law on Public Procurement have been affected in some way?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it has not yet been shown in our control work.
Since we control the fact, some delay must be taken into account.
We only take this into account in the process of preparing future checks - we have started using our new tool "designing the risk of ineconomy" through which we have expelled nearly 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them, and there, of course, these changes will be manifested because the limitations are changed, the conditions of some types of tenders are changed and so on.
Do you think the approval of this law would be useful or additional bureaucracy?
I think that the law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that this will be confirmed.
The problem that may occur is that the rules will not be respected.
In the functioning of previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes - with the regional Council) that any non-compliance with the public procurement law means breach of budgetary discipline.
Is this the case worth reinforcing the law?
I don't think that way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal error that does not affect the solution.
Such a system will only create even more bureaucracy pressure.
So how do you get out of this situation?
Let's realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that GDP would not disturb entrepreneurs by checking the so-called Schwarz system.
Schwartz-system forbidden or permitted?
The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of bodies to be subject to verifying and pursuing obligations.
We can say, "We're changing this law and we're going to solve it," but we can't say we're gonna pretend that nothing's going on.
The Public Procurement Act contains strict rules as well as what should be formally implemented, and that is correct, and it will protect public procurement.
On the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best proposal is discvalified only because of formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, what I think we're missing.
Dear places are slippery, but mostly passed.
In some places, the roads are freezing and snowing.
Mostly, they are passed, but somewhere more carefully.
Carlovar Land
This morning, the road was passed, but somewhere frozen and snowy.
Temperature fell from five to ten degrees below zero, but it must be a little warm during the day.
The snowfall in the region stopped, only in the lowers is a small layer.
However, there is about 30 centimeters of snow on the red mountains.
From the information received from road workers, it was known that the places were lower visibility because of the fog.
The R6 rapid road and the first-class roads in the region are currently running without restrictions.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface can be found and slipped.
All roads relating to the second and third grade, including mountain routes, are also being passed.
However, some of their sites are still laying down the remains of the frozen snow and the places of the snow.
Especially careful to be on highways.
Pardubic and Royal End
The Czech road management and roadways on their websites on the Internet informs that some Eastern Czech roads are threatened by hololed, and the mountain roads and highways may be a elevated layer of snow.
District road workers warn drivers of hololeda, which may be particularly in the elevations of the Pardubian country.
The Hollow may be around Lanschrown, Orleans, Police, Swetawi or High-Mito, especially on the roads of the second and third grade.
Roads I/43 and I/34 located in Swithavi are processed by chemicals.
Especially, the snow lies on the roads of the Crocnoche and the Orlic Mountains.
The elevated snow layer is on highways in Richnow and Trutnow.
In the Eastern Czech Republic, there is a change in cloud without declines today.
Temperature usually varies between negative three to a degree of Celsia, light wind.
Plazin Country
The roads in the Plsen edge are being passed this morning, but the places need to be cautious and adapted to weather.
In the morning, the temperature goes from three to nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and the next cooling in some places may be slippery.
The drivers may face the fog, but the visibility will gradually improve.
Information was provided by regional road workers.
The D5 road is now almost unlimited, but the road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most of the first class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In southern Pluzny and Tahova, the frozen stations may be caught.
The roads of the second and third grade are wet, and there is also a warning on the possibility of accelerating sliders.
The drivers should be cautious, especially on few roads used in the area of Schumawa.
Olomouch edge
The drivers who are heading to the highests of the Olomouch country must today take into account the snow cough on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Red Gore seat and on the road towards the Videla Cruise.

In other areas, the road is usually without restrictions.
"The Shumper's excellences lay down the remains of snow.
The drivers directed to the side of Esenic should consider the existence of snow casualty in the Red Gore seat,” CAN reported today (Cheech News Agency) the road traffic management manager.
At night, their colleagues from Esenic went cleaning roads, and they assured them that the highways after the processing of chemicals remained naked and wet.
The roads in Olomouca are without restrictions, but the drivers in Sternberg must be careful at forest areas where wetness remains.
Libercase End
Today, road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are several difficult places left.
According to the police database, in addition to several places with hololed or falling snow, a mountain road has been closed from the Clinics area in the Usteck edge.
The temperature remains negative in the lowers, so the roads remain snow and ice. In the lowness, especially south-east of the Czech Central, on the contrary, there are no problems, the road is most dry.
The complications on roads are not yet reported.
Road workers report on the appearance of hololed in the area of damage.
According to the meteorologists, for his education at night, perfect conditions were created -- the whole day rained and the snow was snowing, the sky came clear and the frozen began at night.

Because of the branches of branches of branches that relate to the road, the road was forced to be closed in the Telnica in the Kninica.
Shimon Ornest: At the concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about less than a month after the end of the world?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we, people, are so easy to see.
Together with the Tap Tap, we are always joking about this and saying that we are the only group in the world that can gather sufficient positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you will give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you tell the readers more about this?
It is a national gathering event that we have planned for two years.
We have decided to use the marketing capacity that the Mayan calendar has, which was announced on 21 December at 11:10.
On the day before that, on 20 December at 9:00, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Island are simultaneously launched.
They will end roughly when the island of Kiribati is in the Pacific, the clock belt of which 12 hours before we have, the Mayan calendar will be completed.
Who has this idea come to mind?
At first, it was my idea, and we all came up with our artist Gonza Auguste.
In addition to the accumulation of sufficiently positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about how this world will be handed over to our children one day.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a unique collection of shoes, shoes, bags, and original keys against the end of the light. These things can be purchased on www.e-tap.cz and thus provide support for us.
The Tap Tap Group, together with other musicians, also fulfilled the hymne against the end of the light, called "The End of the Light is Cancelled".
Will the loving listeners of YouTube speak hymnes at these beneficial concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if it ends and the end of the world doesn't come.
It is conquered by all performers at all concerts at the same time.
The gymns will also sound directly in the Czech Television.
The words to this song were written and played the role of Jesus in the Tomas Hanak video, also involved Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We are also cooperating with other Czech cultural personnel because we have many charitable activities and concerts.
We are trying to actively connect them to these projects.
It turns out that many people like to work with us, and they are interested.
What's it going to make from the concert against the end of the light?
For the purchase of equipment for the STUDEO wireless educational centre, we have been working with the Tap Civil Association at the Yedlicka Institute for the sixth year.
The teachers regularly attend the Yedlicka Institute school students and conduct fun and interesting activities with them.
Students themselves have no means to go to the teachers, and we are thus trying to give them that opportunity.
In the future, a separate building to which we will move with this project will be a project of additional construction of the Yedlicki Institute.
A number of musical groups and executors will be presented at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to make a programme that would interest all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinese, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Irgi Suhi will be presented.
For all details, see www.kpx.cz.
Do you plan any such "great events" in the future?
In May, we will first speak at the Prague Spring Festival, and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
The next year, we would be happy to present in the Czech National House in New York, and I would like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
For abroad you have serious plans, you have already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with limited opportunities.
How do you deal with the road from the view of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it looks at first.
We have five participants on electrical wheels, their wheelchairs must travel in the luggage office, plus a large number of goods and tool boxes.
Nevertheless, the Czech CHSA and British Airways aircraft were always greatly prepared for us, and I was surprised how many times.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, it went without trouble.
You can compare different countries from the accessibility, public relations to persons with disabilities and so on.
What have you faced until now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we have, in Russia, we have witnessed that there is still a base level on the east.
In comparison with Prague in Moscow, there are very many barriers, and there is still a man's own movement in a electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
There are also such banal things that are not in progress as to withdraw the path of the disabilities in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are public organizations that have tried to draw attention to people's problems with limited opportunities.
What do we, on the contrary, need to pursue the front countries?
There are a lot of things that have been fulfilled far behind.
However, it is important to clarify that improvement and improvement are always dependent on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is normal that people with severe disability move themselves on the streets, go to the toilet, in the museum, anywhere...
It is not very common that many people with limited capacity are actively involved in the public life, and we are a little emerging them with The Tap Tap!
Respect for public or barrierity is one thing, but at the time we have known sportsmen, artists, actors, politics or lawyers, it will actually change.
As long as this is a single case, people with strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is now very popular, but we'll be back for two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I entered the Institute of Jedlička as a teacher, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician, including the saxon, I organized an interesting musical circle with my colleague.
Well, with time, as our leading Lady Angelovic says, this has come out of control.
The popularity has only arrived in recent years, or am I confusing something?
That is true, it helped us to join the famous singers and work actively on the propaganda of the group.
We have come to the conclusion that the work that no one can evaluate is as though there is none.
With the means of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did the Tap Tap goal stand for you so well?
From the beginning, I felt their potential in the ability to do something unusual.
The Shaw business is full of things like each other.
This is logical, all new things are taken with caution, and it lasts long.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who can see us, of course, is pity, it's natural...
But this regret is absolutely excessive, because people with limited opportunities are not any suffering and all the abandoned individuals we should regret.
They are people who can live full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities do something, it's not just for them but for the whole society.
Has the success of being a strict leader, as many of you consider?
If we want to do the work quality, we must be in many things compromise and maintain certain discipline.
But I think it's normal.
Some people come to us with romantic ideas and fly in clouds, and when they find out that twice a week they need to go to practices, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group who wants to work and reach something.
At present, the Tap Tap Group is composed of twenty people.
How many were in the beginning of 1998?
Only one Ladia Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come and leave, that's impossible to prevent.
For those who have desire and power of will, our doors are always open.
It will take place a day before the end of the world, on Thursday 20/12, 2012 at 21 p.m.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba stadium, in the Breno Fléda and Island Club, in Plynoam, with the participation of 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by the telemost at the time the Tap Tap song was performed "Abolished".
The project aims to gather funds of 25 million crowns for procurement of multi-functional non-barrier equipment for the STUDEO education centre at the Yedlicka Institute in Prague.
The ticket for the concert is 400 crowns, for children up to 12 years, free entry. The tickets can be purchased in advance in the Czechiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency of Poland, the twentieth member of the European Space Agency was adopted as the second country from the former Eastern Block (after Czech Republic, which became a full member of ECA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the ECA in 1994 and in the years following, actively participated in a number of projects of the Agency.
But the journey to the universe of Poland began much earlier.
Until World War II, Polish enthusiasts had taken flights to space, but this was not always aware of understanding.
I recall, for example, the A. Sternfeld lecture, which represented the idea in the Warsaw astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933 from its innovative work of " Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after a few years, Sterfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sterfeld won Robert Esno-Peltry and Andre Luis Hirsch for "Introduction in Space".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a major propaganda of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
The Haddomian became a world propaganda of cosmonautics, and its contribution was evaluated, including that one of the craters on the back of the moon was named in his honor.
In 1925, a railway vehicle has been built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author remained unknown as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear that a rocket should be used to drive or brake the carriage.
The information on this clothing is only known from the press of the age.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to think about missile arrows.
The study was carried out by the Arms Technology Section in cooperation with Professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Mokgicki.
The preserved material shows that studies have come to the stage of practical tests.
However, with the coming of the German forces of work, it was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of the photo-electronic executive missile proposed by the Rogozinian engineer was made, and the next year, the " Air Torpedo missile and the bomb air missile" of Leliva-Kivoblock.
Both projects were developed for military use of missile engines.
The Temporary Scientific and Scientific Committee (Scientific Temporary Committee), which coordinated all the work before the war of all the projects of military missile use.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its work, the work was completed because of the beginning of the war.
The next scientific work devoted to cosmonautics has appeared in the Polish press after the war, through the work of the Polish Astronautic Society (Poland Astronautic Society).
For the first time, the public is mentioned in the November 1954 magazine " Problems " in which four large astronautical articles are published.
In one of them, Professor M. Sabotovic suggested that society be organized as a cosmonautic.
The artificial satellite projects have already been being revolved, and it was clear that space research was a prospective industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish astronautical society (POA) has tried to enter the international astronautical Federation (based in 1951) and has already become its real member in the fall.
In the next year, the first President of POA, Kazimich Zarankevic (1902 - 1959), became Vice-Chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained at this post until his death, which came in 1959.
Since 1956, the POA has contributed significantly to the development of a very successful meteorological missile RM (Meteorological Raketa), which has become the first Polish research missile.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and the first launch was 10 October 1958.
The rocket, capable of overcoming the distance of 1800 m, was about 80 cm long and weight was less than 5 kg.
The improved version of RM-1A was then built, and in summer 1959, two-step RM-2 tests were carried out in the Bladow Desert.
The rocket was about 1.4 metres long, and its weight was approximately 11.5 pounds.
The next version of the missile was already able to work on this scientific work - the RM-34 missile could have exceeded 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
However, further development was suspended in 1962.
The first RM missiles were the Meteor-1 missile developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-step, its total length was 510 cm and the initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which were different from the size of the scientific equipment chamber.
The Meteor-1A missile had a range of 0.4 l, Meteor-1V - 0.34 l and Meteor-1C - 0.62l.
The maximum distance of all three types of flight was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute was developing a meteor-2 missile, and its first summer tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 missile with 380 kg start weight was able to deliver a useful load of 10 kg per height of about 60 km.
The versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were then built.
It is also important to mention the entry of Poland into COSPAR (Kosmic Research Committee) in 1960 and the establishment of a national committee of COSPAR two years later.
In addition, in the Intersmos programme, Poland participated in space studies on Soviet art satellites and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermashevski became the second interconsmonaut after Vladimir Remeka.
Abolition of the public work law is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the constitutional court discontinued the public work law.
The provision led to a vivid social debate.
It would certainly be interesting to look at this issue more widely.
The liberalized economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multitude, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are constantly conflicted with each other.
This relates to the principle of free trade and free, unlimited movement of private capital, along with unconstable financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the value of the workforce (in salary), the price tension is arising.
Under this concept, it should be understood when the manufacturer, through delivery of cheap goods, endeavours to stand in economic competition by “coupling” the value of a competitive to acquire a majority of the market and thus increase its own income.
As a mass, this means to most entrepreneurs either to transfer abroad production, or to cheap purchases, or disappearance. As a result, unemployment is increased in countries where the cost of working force is high compared to others.
Since the private capital does not bear any social responsibility, including the unemployment it has done, the inevitable costs of the State will grow on social needs.
In general, the situation strengthens the unwanted taxpayment of entrepreneurs and thus compensates the social economic and social damage that they have in pursuit of profits.
The situation is so well known that no specific statistics are required.
Incessant private capital methods create at the level of economies of individual States where Governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, Governments have given their own population to private capital, despite the social depreciation.
This reflects first in the changes of existing legislation.
It is aimed at economically forceing their people to obey the dictate of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This acts as a system of economic force in case of long unemployment, while at the same time serves as a tool to cut the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty increases, and the difference between poor and rich .
For several years, there has been public distribution of products to poor people who are unable to feed themselves with their own work.
The number of these people is approaching a million.
In the context of improving the competitiveness of the German economy, there are always cases when employees receive such a salary that the State must pay them to obtain a living minimum.
Such a scandal has become known to the public in the case of additional Bundestag workers.
The economic measures practically in all southern EU States are undoubtedly the same condition in which people under the pressure of catastrophic social status have either to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or to exist on poverty in the courtyards of society in hope that private investment capital will ever come to the country.
However, it is asked where it would come from?
If the capital comes from other EU countries, the poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still work for the European wages.
This concerns Latin America.
The Liberal Theory and Mass Information Media to Toughness argue that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own household, which leads to economic disaster.
The private capital insisted that the State should not interfere with the governing actions.
Further should the question of whether the private capital, which is now practically managed by politics and the same whole State, is not in its own selfish purposes?
The answer is yes.
The evidence is the existence of almost all-powered and everywhere lobbys in all States.
As a result, we have an irregular situation in corruption, mutual benefits, in legislation where almost everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In FRG, the situation is that government ministries, due to the lack of funds, are responsible for the development of draft laws to private legal companies that are closely linked to industry.
Subsequently, Bundestag adopted those draft laws.
The entire authority is not from the people, as the West Type Constitution says, but from financial and financial groups prefering their own interests.
Obviously, liberally-oriented democracy is now in a situation as described by the Appian in the " Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompei: " The government has been declined for a long time, and the departments are engaged in violence.
Contracts, illicit receipt of mercy through stones and swords.
The bribery and corruption have bloomed without any prohibition, and the people have gone to elections with the previously sold vote"... the regular people have never argued for the ruler's position, at the end of one eight months, the State remained unconsulted.... .. .. .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Like in ancient times, in modern society, the own unreasonable interests are prevailing without taking into account public interests.
Private capital is no longer intended for public purposes.
The current result is not different from the past: the improper decline of the elite without any effort to carry out reforms deeper.
Thus, the cause of fascist and communist regimes is to be searched for insightless liberalization of the 19 and 20th century economic systems.
The absence of these regimes and the existence of Liberal Democracy can be considered as a certain pause, after which the next tour is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite is completely ignoring the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social disasters that we have already seen, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The abolition of the public work law is not a solution or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition, both at the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of population.
This trend is thus a systematic trend.
The decision is the objectives of political and social reforms that will strengthen the State ' s integrity in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the governance of the State and weaken the monopoly position of private capital for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Laboratory of chaos.
"Nothing will come out of violence, and it can never come out." - Sting, the Singh, where the main verse of the Refreen are the words: "Don't forget how cruel we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, they wouldn't have been there," the dead Gutel Schnaper, the wife of Meer Amshell Rothschild.
The last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza sector, as always, has resulted in numerous responses.
Some speak for Israel, argumenting that he has the right to self-defense, while Palestinians act as terrorists, others support Palestinians, argumenting the racism of the Israeli State, the genocide committed over the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel assigns the role of a terrorist State.
I don't want to think about who in these periodically repeated waves of murders is a criminal, and who victims, eventually, today's nationals of Israel, including self-governmented territories, were born at the current political situation and were not witnessing the start of violence.
My goal is to invite the readers to look at the curtain, to see who has served the tension for 95 years (with the signing of the Balfur Declaration in November 1917) in the small part of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are supported by historical facts, some of them are based on my own understanding of who or any group of people are the main engine of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is the history of combating for power.
At every age, we can find the same Alexander of the Great or Napoleon.
It is not so clear that they have always taken their own steps, or behind their throne was someone who had directed their actions to the prior objectives.
It should be assumed that we live in a period where world wealth is concentrated in the hands of a number of persons and that this concentration of money and the emerging authority could not occur in the life of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families is one that could be viewed as the head of the spirit (I don't know if anyone is above them, but that is not excluded) - Rothshilds.
They don't say much about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) has already purchased in the 1990s to stop hearing about their name with criminal acts in the higher areas in which they were shadow, which always led to strengthening their powers, enrichment of wealth or at the same time and to the other.
They have large stocks of shares in almost all central banks of the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their shares, they are running or preparing a war (on the invasion of Afghanistan was only seven countries, after the invasion of Iraq was 5 countries, and only four, but at the same time, the Russian Government took the central bank of its country into its own hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of the Central Bank behind the Rothshild Bank of America, and he began to issue his own (conscious government) money and was killed in the theater in 1865.
John F. Kennedy began to issue his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (Federal Reserve System), killed in 1963, and the Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to judge the FED for the resolution of the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for the world's power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan of three world wars created by the large mason of the 33th level, Albert Pike.
The challenge of the first war was to destroy monarchical States in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Britain, and the third should lead to a reduction of the world population to approximately 0.5-1 billion people (i.e. the number of slaves would be sufficient to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they would not consume much resources), to establish a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be anything else than a prerequisite for such a project) and to finalize the absolute authority.
The Method, with which the wealthiest families are working in the head of Rothschilds, is a challenge of the crisis and the subsequent proposal for decisions (order ab chao - a order of chaos).
However, these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the FED foundation that had to prevent the repeat of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to untie the First World War by killing the Habsburgh successor of the Austrio-Wungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Royal Russia by starting a more visual revolution.
The first world war ends with a sudden, unfounded military and economically unfounded German capitulation (without the need for a war to destroy Royal Russia) and, as a result, the breakdown of the Central European Power, Austria and Hungary.
To facilitate the settlement of the Second World War, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposed large military reparations on Germany rather than a prerequisite for the radicalization of the meal mass, then only the Germans had to put in place a strong enough, blameful and simple solutions of the Leader, to further create a multinational Czech Slovakia with a strong German minority that had to play, and indeed played the function of the fifth column, with the lighting of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschilds had provoked the foundation of the Sionist movement, one branch of which was endeavoured to establish a Jewish State, desirable in the field of historical Judea and Jerusalem as its capital (return to Sion).
The above-mentioned declaration of Balfura created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of the Jews to Palestine, and the first conflicts with the local Arab population began.
Terrorism attacks took place on both sides.
The Second World War exploded, hard to evaluate whether Hitler had emerged from chains in which he was originally held by bankers, or all that he had done, was planned, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in concentration camps created prerequisites to recognize the Jewish State as a world community.
Israel was formally established in 1948 and, as Germany was provoked by military reparations for World War II, the State of Israel was declared to create the fire of the Third War.
If international bankers are able to untie it, the Jewish people, as in the second world war, will be victims of battle on the front line, now with Arabic or, easiestly, Muslims of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of disagreement and chaos not only inside the country but also at the international level (only a rapid division of people into the opponents and opponents of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israel conflict, where the injury causes an infinite chain of violence, if it begins with the greed of individuals and their desire to the world's power?
There is a need to distinguish Israeli ordinary people from their leaders, because, as we have, international bankers encourage people to vote in elections exclusively of their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is the typical example of the fashist, loyal international bankers by a politician who is doing everything to start war with Iran, which, through the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to grow into a world conflict and, taking into account Iran's control of the Armus River of 20 per cent of all world oil stocks (the corridor is only two miles width), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
What is the point now that David Rockefeller said in 1994, "All we need is a common crisis, and people will take a new world order."
The new world's order in their representation is the world of gods and slaves.
The world where the rest of the human population serves a bunch of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
The world where each born organism is implanted by a chip with which it becomes an entirely controlled creature.
"And it makes all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves have on the right hand or on the forehead of the cream, so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast, or by the number of his name, could not buy or sell.
This is wisdom: Anyone who has a mind can calculate the number of beasts.
For it corresponds to the name of man, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
"Argo Operation: When there's nowhere worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, the crowd of Islamist Democratic Students captured the US Embassy in Teheran and hosted 52 diplomats.
They were to be released in exchange for the dumped chess of Mohammed Reza Pechlevi, who fled after the revolution in the United States, which had been a protector of his regime for decades.
For the United States administration, the positive outcome of the situation was not expected -- it could not afford to throw the chess out of the ship, because it could have undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, was unable.
It was a hit on the prestige of the United States, which was later strengthened by a failure to release hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were ultimately released after 444 days, after negotiations in the intermediation of the Government of Algeria.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Antianic moods at home.
The defeat in Iran has significantly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter at the 1980 presidential elections of Ronald Reagan.
The film by an actor Ben Affleck, Operation Argo, describes one of the episodes of the history that brought America a small victory.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six workers were able to escape.
After complicated perceptions, they completed their way to the residential embassy of Canada.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, has been able to pick them out from Iran, with an extravagant covering legend that helped them depart from Canadian passports as members of a scope group searching for a scientific and fantastic episode.

In order for the legend to be reliable, the specialized magazines wrote about the film project, a press conference was organized, an invented production company had a real office.
Details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, a film based on Tony Mendez's memoaries.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political triller, so-called film-kinoopus, the history of the good point, the affairs - an example of a number of Ouchen friends films.
The film has constantly changed the mood -- on the one hand, the documented scenes from Teheran (the titters show signicles of historical images of events and how the same situations have been demonstrated in the film - no great differences).
On the other hand, the relieved Hollywood fragments crossed with irony and moderate overundering.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions -- men in suits discuss the situation at the tables of negotiations, on the stairs of institutions, on the phone...
Ben Affleck was greatly able to restart his career.
A funny actor became a respected director, and his game was no longer a ridiculous object.
"Argo" operation of its third full-sized film, after a dark detective, "Gay-bye, baby, bye" (2007) and Triller City (2010).
At the same time, this is the first film of Affleck, which is not filmed in the city of director Boston.
The sense of atmosphere, however, relates to the qualities that raised the earlier films of the director over the Hollywood Standard.
And Afflek shows it in Argo, where Teheran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film are going to be on the streets, when real events are reconstructed - the introductory scenes of the fall of the embassy are impressed by their clarity, which also transmits the emotions of confusion and unpredictableness that occur when history suddenly changes.
Similar effects Afflek and his colleagues are achieved in the fake headquarters on the Teheran market.
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the report did not imply a number of film-related scenes.
He has been working pretty successfully with this little one, and sometimes he thinks that it's not so elegant (the scene in which the phone call in America prevents the coming crisis at Teheran airport, and the race on the airline looks pretty elaborate).
The lack of “Argo” is the dissolution of the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman, in Hollywood colleagues, are really charming, but their characters would deserve greater space, and they are not the only ones in the movie.
Affleck's film lacks a little dramaticity, it's a film that can be viewed with moderate interest by evaluating the performance and retro-style that rebuilds the trilleries of the '70s.
But it's hard to find out.
However, this is enough to remind one, still in a famous sense of living history, as well as to the evidence of the overwhelming perception of all-powered and all-known specialities.
Rules of air balls, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey on the most absurd banking gatherings, now decided to announce a competition for “the most absurd order or a project from the EU workshop”.
"The last event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of major European companies," said the Law organizer of the questionnaire Patrick Nager.
Among the nomination of absurdities has already been the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rate of insurance contributions for men and women.
Women have still had the benefits of life insurance because they are objectively less risked for insurance companies.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU's workshop can be made by the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place until the end of February 2013," said Nager.
The dispute orders of the EU include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents into fuel, resulting in damage to nature, and the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury plants only because they contain relatively small numbers of dangerous substances, or the chicken cell directive, which has resulted from significant traveling eggs this year.
The criticism has also been prohibited from using the term “button oil” or an exemption from the sale of classic lamps.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimeters long.
The general European apparatus often decides under pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by a State or group of States (e.g., even under the threat of the vet, now faces the requirements of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are: for example, the highest quality bananas in the European Union had to reach a length of 14 cm and were not daring to demonstrate " anomalous curve".
However, the European Commission was justified that only harmonised existing different national rules that complicated trade.
The EU, despite the opposition of some States, mitigated the standards relating to fruit and vegetables, indicating that existing directives would lead to dissolving products.
The candidate for the survey may also be a last year's EU decision, according to which selling air balloons must be provided by warning that children under eight years can not be suppressed without an oversight of adults.
The EU addressed the American studies in accordance with which the airballs in the game are the potential cause of death of children by suspension.
Such limitation is now extended to children up to 14 years of age who are not allowed to go into shop dudes.
Funny ideas are born at home
It is also absurd enough to rule on European officials themselves: anyone who has any official position in the EU cannot, given the delicateness of the topic for Greece, use the name of Macedonia and should instead say "BURM" (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Banking Payment Portal.com, in collaboration with Liberal Economies "Principle of Non-Integration " (Laissez Faire), proposed a vote, except for several of the above-mentioned absurd rules, such as the EU Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Member State.
The EU has established the maximum amount of food reserves that may be in the Czech Republic for the day of its entry into the European Union.
Subsequently, Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the amounts of conserved mushrooms, which threatened her great fines.
The interrogators were also interested in paying to some countries for the lack of sea and the idea of granting subsidies for a statement of grants.
But these ideas came up in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We are in an inconvenient position because we have no sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation," said then the Minister of Agriculture, Yaroslav Palas, in autumn 2004.
As a argument, he indicated that there had been high grain yeasts in the country, and as a result of the so-called intervention procurement, the State had full stocks of stocks that had to be exported.
For the fact that Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission met the Czech Republic, organizing a tender for procurement of grains from countries that have no sea access.
Subsidies to obtain subsidies were invited to villages the Ministry of Regional Development, which was headed by Minister Paul Germany (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies had to go to a statement for grants from Brussels.
EU: Remarkable orders are exception
While the decisions in Member States are easily criticized, the efforts of the EU to regulate, as well as the more effective functioning and development of the European Union, many experts believe that it deserves a faster recognition.
The serious problem, according to experts, is the drawing of EU grants for projects that do not even mean anything in common with the deepening of European integration, however, which Member States have achieved in the discussion of the budget.
It calls on emotions among the Czechs and that, as in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic should fight in Brussels for the right to identify its traditional products, not always winning in this competition.
Although the Czech Republic, after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians, maintained the name “Olomouque turkeys”, however, the Tuzemic Rom, whose traditions in our country were rooted in the 19th century, our producers had to rename the Tuzemic.
Rom can be called only products from a berth distillate, not a sugar cereal.
In the official list of EU registered products, along with the world-known "feta" and "gorgondzole", the Marcipan from German Lubeck or the parmine branch, has already been found, for example, carlovar sugars, hillish and troshebonic rocks and lambs.
The EU's trade mark can also be proud of the pardubic pipes and rugs.
People want me to protect the Republic, but I'm a fan, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man get into his head to be president?
I'm not thinking about being a senator or president alone.
If it worked without trouble in our country, I wouldn't have been talking anywhere.
But I can't see how the country has been screwing up in the last 20 years, the thiefs are screwing up, the taxes and the pension age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to figure out how to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and I'm an independent non-party, I have no other opportunity to influence things but to qualify for a senator or president.
You got to the Senate, but soon you went to the presidential castle.
Do you not turn back to the people who chose you?
I kept saying that I would be involved in the fight for the presidential castle depending on the results of the elections in the Senate.
Later I stated that if I was elected as a senator, I'd vote for presidents.
My goal is not a position, the post is a tool that I can achieve my views.
Therefore, I need the greatest influence and the widest powers.
But the difficulty isn't just that we're like a nation in a bar or a television, but we're willing to melt anyone who's trying to change something.
This is added to the media that are blackening and confusing freedom of speech with freedom of lie.
For example, I was told that I was bribeing journalists or that I was the advisor of Irgi Paroubek.
Let's go to your views.
The fight for the presidential castle you have launched with those on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and reverse property declarations above twenty million.
In order to implement this, the law must be amended.
You don't have such powers as president, and only a whole senate can offer laws.
What do you want to do with this?
When I lobbed as a citizen to be a free entrepreneurship, it was successful.
The problem is politics -- when someone comes with a good proposal on the left or on the right, he is deliberately obstacling, which prevents citizens.
As an independent non-party person, I have a much greater capacity to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My privilege is that I can take what is best for our country without a party laying down, without reviewing the doctrine from each party, and apply it.
Do you think you're a man more about right or left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people are referring me to the left.
It doesn't matter to me at all -- a little left or a little right.
It's important for me to go forward.
It's not about someone's right, but someone to the left, I want to merge people together.
I will always support any good decision for the society whether it will be proposed by the CDM or the GDP, and I will also be against the bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're a populist.
But do you not prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have some perfect goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to do.
It can be called Populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already functioning in the world, or the visible experts are talking about it.
But without parliament's support, you will only have slozzangs.
And you won't last long with this in politics.
Or do you think that when you come out and talk to people, you can carry out criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another possibility.
Only to persuade politicians, journalists and the public and to try to lure them into our own way to achieve our own.
If I had been elected by the President, there would be no problem organizing a direct television transmission in which I would address the chairmans of parliamentary parties, calling upon the legislative and criminal responsibility for politicians, public officials, judges and prosecutors.
And in the case of refusal, they will have to report why they do not want to do so.
If there is a strong personality that sounds abuse, there will be pressure on the political scene.
Take the president's direct elections -- it was a public pressure.
I'm just saying I'm a lover, not a genius, not an intellectual.
I am trying to seek allies to resist my beliefs and views.
I'm only a politician, and for my programme, I'm going to try to get the support of the majority.
I'm trying to move on on my own; in case it doesn't work, I'll finish in six years and return to the private sector.
That sounds partly as if Okamura should save Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything alone, so I went through a number of famous people with a proposal to make a vote at the Senate.
I went to Radim Janchure, and he refused to make a lot of work.
I also supported at least the leading investigation of the journalist Jan Lorenz, who discovered fraud with light fuel products.
I made my candidacy because people are really unsatisfied, but now I feel at weight.
Sixty per cent of the people have not chosen elections, but most of those who have chosen the representatives of the execution.
We're only two independent in the Senate.
People chose the Senate so that changes will be tough.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my views, for example, for direct elections of mayors and governors.
You think about the foundation of your own party?
I haven't thought about this yet, because I don't have time to check the purity of the past of every potential party, and I don't have money for that.
There are no money for the presidential campaign, only twenty thousand crowns on my transparency account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, and what's your own business with that?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have an area in Prague worth approximately 25 million, a 10 million apartment, another apartment for 8 million, about 10 million art collection, Aston-Martin at 3.5 million, and the Superb Scotch for a million, and a few more million on the account.
By the way, Aston-Martin came to me because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who was on the car, was galanteous with women, and at the same time struggling against devil and lawlessness.
You're driving Aston-Martin, you own 60 million property and you don't have any money for a campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for a campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the pre-electoral campaign from my pocket.
The campaign costs will actually cover me with the senator's salary.
But I wouldn't live for that money, for example, I couldn't pay my son for an English school worth 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't have been talking anywhere.
So you're going to do business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd reduce this activity?
But it doesn't depend on the salary size.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activity.
For example, the director of the Tourism Agency will be my deputy.
People would like me to be a silver man to keep the Republic.
But I have to live for something too.
How much have you used to getting a month as an entrepreneur?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I get on.
And if I were to be president, I would have finished my business.
You'll find a full interview on Saturday's News.
The MVRDV architects prove that these adventures are not only in imagination, such as Speekhenis and its recently built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"This building seems fun to me, it looks futuristic, we finally have something interesting again," said Lisette Verheig, passing on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT expert in a large enterprise nearby, thinks, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself, why do we have another library today?
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
Now no one willingly goes to such old-fashioned librarys, right?
Speakenaisse, a small bedroom town under Rotterdam, belongs to an unusual record.
The population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
A few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and to build seven inventory bridges that were painted in euro banknotes, as a painted iron miniature.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the fathers of the city realized that they had the only way to overcome the statistics: to build a library here!
Vini Maas from the Rotterdam Architecture Bureau of MVRDV, the master of brave columns and the author of clever, sometimes even cynical buildings, took place with its ordinary insaneness and appeared at the 2003 competitive audience with five books under the mouse and smile on the face.
And while the jury's members looked awkwardly around and squeezed by their shoulders, the drunk Maas put a piramid on its original size and finished his speech in the protection of his project with the following words: "Reverends!"
Here's my offer, "The Book Mountain" in Speakenis, so-called Buchenberg!
In nine years, this mountain had increased at a value of 30 million euros.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes the underground garage, supermarket, mail and several residential homes and townhouses in a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Book Mountain was noted by the second prize of the Netherlands' Best Library of 2012.
The project is also participating in the 2012 National Dutch Contest on woods.
Thus, the unlike predestations that could have before offered nothing but a post-modernist pedestrian zone and an incredibly unbelievable council, the white fasces of which suggest the thought of the milk factory became richer to one modern architecture.
But the most important thing is that the first in the history of this city was the public building of cultural appointment.
Long Way to Book
The first impression: the book Eldorado is under the cheese collapse.
There is only one elevator in the center of the mountain massive, because the actual architecture and reading fans would prefer to study this area walking.
The light and light, light and easy-sighted premises of the burned tube and elegant street lamps have made a sense of public city area.
The city environment is perfectly restored.
The look is unwillingly looking for scams, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere -- books, books, books.
"The book boxes are usually standing along the fasads, and there is a large dark hall in the middle, usually uncomfortable and unlikely," says Vini Maas.
We set a classic space configuration from each other to the head and pulled out a zone for reading from inside.
The internal area of the book mountain has been used skillfully: offices, libraries, chess clubs, environmental centres and technical facilities are located in the centre.
The black book sheets that serve the walls, parapets, and stairs, are particularly happy.
Their species, texture and smell are unusual.
Even experiencing architects and construction engineers are losing their guess of the unknown material.
"We have endeavoured to work with secondary materials," explains Jop Trauborst, a project manager representing the Spakenis community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once at one agricultural company in Frisland, we met the appropriate side product of agriculture.
For many years, heat and fields in the Netherlands have been used as an artificial fiber thickness.
It's cheap and saves time.
The thin textil serves one or two seasons, and then it can be thrown out.
For the library, this is the first time in such volumes, a thickness of four centimeters was cut in the panel.
Under the heat and pressure, the so-called landbowplastic (KLP) is converted into a dark, one-born, solid material, a little like a new car and a little crossing.
The top is 105 degrees.
The one who can reach the road of nearly 500 meters will be rewarded in a literary cafeteria not only by a fantastic view of the city but also by the Dutch croquets and wood ficus in the garlic.
They take care of the atmosphere, and primarily about the right wetness of air on the literary mountain.
Expenditure for a New soul
"It is hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is a model project in the context of the environment," said Trouborst.
The heat and cooling of the earth are used.
Although the Book Mountain is under a glass bulb, even in clear days the sun comes inside for a little while.
The wide farms of a sticked wood, located perpendicularly glass fasade, give shadows and take on most sunlights.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is fully provided by automatic rolling curtains.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above, has already visited a new library.
Lizette Verheig was here too.
As well as a teacher of the traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogard, who called Buchenberg "the soul of Speakenis, which was long missing."
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each person received an invitation to offer one book from his own congregation.
These books had to take empty places on the shelves yet not fully compiled library - at that point there were 70,000 books.
It worked.
The poles are upstairs.
"There is nothing worse than a half-left library," said architect Vinny Maas.
"I think that because of our invitation, each inhabitant is now in some ways connected to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it serves only for decoration.
Thus, the MVRDV has been able to solve the royal task that is called the creation of identity in the professional jargone.
Spekenisse wrote his literary story.
And let them be very young and unscientific.
It's only the starting point to build an identity.
Sabo: “Germans must play a more important role”
Germany abstained from the voting of Palestine's recognition.
According to Stephen Sabo, a United States-European link expert, in doing so, Berlin balances the narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinian request for the status of observer to the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from voting.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelites in Gaza.
Now Germany needs to be careful about its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it also does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, not too critical to Israel.
During the rebellion in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote of the prohibited flight zone.
This proposal was made by NATO.
Is Germany difficult to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The point is, it is in the process of transforming its external policy, namely, from the policies that, as the United States said, have been managed to its own German foreign policy.
Furthermore, the situation is complicated with the lack of a harmonised policy.
Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just getting their role, but they're on their way to "more normal" foreign policy.
External policy that France or Great Britain conducts.
What does "normal" mean in the German perspective?
It is willing to take a position in its national interests, regardless of the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policies, such as exports and links to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are significantly different from the interests of other major States, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, in particular in the States of the Persian Gulf.
It therefore needs to be careful to avoid insulting the public and elite in Arab countries.
Anyway, it plays its role.
But I wouldn't give it too much importance, it's not a totally unilateral connection.
However, this plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Did Germany harm its relations with the United States by refraining from making important decisions, such as the voting on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States, the understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don't think it was as dramatic as in the Libyan matter.
Germany may even get some respect in this way.
Because this signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that it should be considered with its interests.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the contrary, the United States had clearly spoken for veto.
Is there a difference between the United States and many European States?
Such differences have always existed because of US domestic policy.
I believe that the Obama Government is deeply understanding the European position.
But, of course, as regards the local political situation, the Government cannot take this position openly.
I believe that substantial differences in opinions are not as significant as they always appear.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all admired by Netanjahu's policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU with the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be a little easier if there was a single, uncontrollable European policy, but now it would not be.
Therefore, they cannot speak within a broader approach and are forced to act instead, based only on their own vision of the situation.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think in the future, Germany will take a leading role in developing a common European position.
It is clear that it is difficult for Germany, at least because of the relationship with Israel.
This theme was always pushing.
But I think the Germans are clear that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany considers itself as an important international player, would it really take the lead?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany has not yet been used to this, she is still uncomfortable, and for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis -- every time Germany takes an important role, various anti-Germany feelings are shown.
The Germans are not just dealing with it.
In fact, this is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this regard, Germany is much more difficult than the United States.
It should take into account the various neighbours and opinions, which is not easy.
Thus, the U.S. influence in European policy is constantly weakening, but at this point the EU does not fill this vacuum, and who remains?
The Germans just have to play a more important role.
Even if you don’t like it, it is unpleasant or intensifying your displeasure — such a life!

Protection of goods in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani, a worldly known trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is Armani Polo?
It is an entirely officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with companies whose names it is created.
Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original names have filed a complaint.
But then it is not clear whether they will be able to stand up for their rights.
"The foreigners are increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," said Thomas Patloch, a lawyer of Taylor Wessing, specializing in violations of trade marks in the Far East.
It appears on my desk every week on a new case of this kind.
The imitators are sufficient to add only a few letters to obtain the right to register their trade marks.
So Gucci comes from Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada-Kny, you can register Prada-Kny.
The German enterprises, such as Puma's producer, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a folder with records of the office of registration of goods in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered a trade mark of Zegna DF Puma, a artificial name that also used the name of the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
The fact that the Chinese are the champions of the world's copying and violating intellectual property rights is known.
In large cities, there are multi-level universities that sell almost exclusively fakes.
However, Patloch's cases are not such, but he, on his trustees, opposes that Chinese enterprises are fully officially receiving from the office of registration of goods, the right to use a name that is already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it Ban Minpai, the passenger mark.
This word is associated with the ban daquun.
That's what they call women hunting rich men.
Chinese authorities do not accept guilt
"It hurts business, it must be combat," said Patloch.
"The trade mark is washed, the unique situation is lost, the image is very suffering."
The financial losses and process costs in the affected sector are calculated by millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to CLSA market research, China, sales of 15 billion euros a year, is the third largest and rapidly growing market in luxury items.
However, removing suspicious records in the trade mark registry is hard, and it is expensive.
The process may last up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Patloch describes cases in which the court rejected the lawsuits, since after a long time the contested term became “reality of the market”.
If the claimant is unfortunate, he will even have to pay the plagiator because he damaged his trade mark in China, said Patloch.
Sometimes there's a law of jungle.
There are also famous cases on graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a judicial dispute with the manufacturer of construction cars, Sany, a company that acquired the Putzmeister concrete company shortly before.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use a symbol similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo company of Geely originally used a blue-white logo that was like BMW; the process was successful, and Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of fashion products Lacoste lost in China by imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, with a famous crocodile looked on the other hand.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The CTMO registration records in Beijing confirmed that in 2010 the lack of staff and equipment there were difficulties.
But last year, "return from an emergency in the work process to normal."
Thus, the number of unemployed objections decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81.500 claims are still waiting for production in the office.
It's worth fighting it.
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million trade marks claims received in CTO, almost a third of the 2010.
This record and means that China has led a list of new registrations throughout the world ten times in order, reports the agency.
The same applies to the total number of real trade marks, only 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion of juana collections were paid.
If it is simplified, this means that each registration is meant to average 1280 juanas or 160 euros.
It is worth a much more opposition, as indicated in the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the concern has been fighting the Chinese plagiator.
The Germans have achieved that their illicit production of fake car details has been eliminated.
However, the imitator has established Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trade mark.
This was its own leak, since the names in Germany were not protected, said Hannah Ventzler, chairman of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in München.
And the CTMO registration office rejected the München claim.
True, in both of the following instances, Freudenberg has won, but the opposite party continues to fight yet.
We need to be careful
The matter is now being considered in the Supreme Court.
Ventzler hopes to bring the case to a good completion and praises the professionalism of courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and takes us a lot of time, money and nerve."
The company's archive had to examine even the acts of a century ago to bring evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg ultimately offered the opposite party " a large six-digit amount in euro" for the settlement.
"There's clear how expensive this is for us," said Ventzler.
The Dangers of the Dale East threaten to turn even to Europe.
It is if imitators register unprotected trade marks there.
Thus, a Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and skin products.
The Concern has long ceased production in these areas, but, despite this, it has been able to prevent registration.
"We need to be careful," said Ventzler.
Both him and Patloch's lawyer recommend that German enterprises be very careful with China.
Not enough to rely on international provisions on the protection of goods, rather, foreigners should “all that is worth protecting, registering in China”, said Ventzler.
Otherwise, this could cost a lot more than a registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trademark drama, the opposite party will have to pay the licence collections for its own name, explains Ventzler.
Otherwise, we'll get out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: Press, Sing, Help
In Heidenberg, the Imbongi Choir is a rehearsal of AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
A history of relations that exceeded more than 8733 kilometers.
At first, cowboy boots, basketball cruises, ladies boats and male puppies pick a tact on the parket floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Only after that, the voices of singers are slowly growing -- alta, bass, tenor, and soprano -- they are coming, charming and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old director, almost jumps out of his mother's shoes when he leads them with flexible and clear gestures.
Monday night, in the musical hall of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi Choir is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty participants from 23 to 69, from a human genetic expert to a palace.
"Om'Obani" is an easy thing, every voice of people has its own text, and in a completely foreign language: Zulus, in which 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesoto, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland speak.
Help for self-help
According to Unaids, United Nations programmes to combat AIDS, there are some 34 million HIV-infected in the world.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, there is 245,000 orphans of AIDS.
More than 40 per cent of the HIV population are positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitžana, the association of Voices for Africa found heads in Germany.
70 of them attends a school preparing for further training.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take the lead.
It guarantees the child's money for school, school shape and daily hot lunch in Gogo Centre.
Imbongs in Zulus means a storyteller or a praiser.
They don't say a run on a bantu in this room, but they can sing.
Almost ten years, the choir is studying songs in this foreign soft language and sometimes even brings them back to the first place where they appeared: south of Africa.
Because at the distance of 8733 miles of summer from Heidalberg, northwest of the Swaziland, there is a village of Esithjani, which depends on the votes of the German people.
Forty per cent infected
There are about 2,000 people, some still in simple clay and slam chambers, many children.
More than 300 of them have lost parents who died from the HIV virus.
The miniature in Esithena reflects the disease of all Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF data.
The extreme body circumcision of men that have proved to reduce half the risk of infection is almost not accepted among the population.
More than 40 per cent of the Swaziland population have an immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth tenth is not rare.
The Horus opened this village on a joint trip to Africa in spring 2005, but before the Imbogny participants saw a number of children on the streets lacking not only parental care, but just the food, clothing, education.
Without school education, a man in a poor country has no chance.
At first, it was a private obligation for individual participants to send the child to school for a few euros a year and to give him the opportunity to get hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir established the merger "Voices for Africa", which has since been almost professionally concerned about AIDS orphans in Esithena.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial IPP includes siphilis, chlamidiosis and tripper (gonorium).
The common virus PPPs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
The skull pedicules and frequency refers to the parasite PPP.
What are the main insane groups?
Siphilis and gonorrhea are mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Institute of Robert Koha is based on the fact that at least four of the five cases of siphilis registered in Germany have been transmitted as a result of sexual contacts between men.
Heterosexual adults often encountered sexually transmitted diseases include chlamidial infections, trichomonyasis, candidosis (gmouth), gonorea and human papyloma virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of the new HIV infections are affected by this group.
Clamidia infections are often more common among youths than among other population groups.
According to European, three quarters of all infections are affected by young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
We also have a human papilloma virus among youths.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are required to be registered.
Siphilis disease, according to the Institute of Robert Koch, has doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been reduced since 2007.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
It's about one tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate veneric disease?
Infectious diseases may result in genital phenomenons, urinary complaints, exclusion, pain at the bottom of the stomach, as well as bubbles or clothing.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain undetected.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms are capable of reducing the risk of infection, but do not provide 100 per cent protection.
In fact, partially sexually transmitted diseases can also be distributed by contact infection and in close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular surveys, especially in the frequent change of sexual partners.
In early diagnosis, the majority of the PPPs can be treated and avoided remote consequences.
The headship, donations, and not the latest privileges for people all over Germany, are allowed to gather.
"We have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjan," said Annette Lennartz, chairman of the United Nations.
In the village itself, money from Germany is ordered by Codva Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also cares for orphanages to be well built, such as one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as they call Zulu's old women, is the backup of the village.
Some of them accepted up to 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads and provided for children in the shape every day to be presented at a time.
Those who do not have a family are entering a shelter to Hanisil, a single woman who receives the wages from the merger, as well as two cookings that prepare for more than 200 hungry children every day.
Furthermore, the merger “Voices for Africa” organized a scholarship, built two chickens, and together with the American Health Organization of the PSI organized analyses on HIV for many villages.
It is hard to imagine, but the disease that is so obvious throughout the country prefers deep silence.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolute taboo," said Annette Lennartz, "because it's related to sexuality."
It is quite unusual for the country in which the king has 14 wives officially.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King of Mswat III, is known for his love for expenses.
Polygamia instead of democracy.
In particular, it is also guilty of such an authorized State ' s lifestyle that the HIV virus has spread so quickly in the past years.
But it also lies on wandering workers who carry the virus across the country.
The free condoms are literally on each corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh."
In order to support a cultural exchange, Ibmogni travels every two or three years south of Africa and sings songs full of sadness, combat spirit, confidence and black self-conscious, which many in the southern edge of the black continent have known since the apartheid.
The bus full of white singing songs in black language is not only a good mood and joy, but even had tears in the eyes of severe borderers.
The journey is always accompanied by Esithen, where singers visit subheading children.
Although a small village can hardly be found on the map, it is known more than in the Eculven Valley.
"Go to Esithen, there's a light," people here say.
And after a 8733-kilometer trip back to Heilberg, when the singers go back to the rehearsal hall in Bergheimer Street, you can see that the light is also burning here.
Messenger: NASA opens ice in Mercury
The Messenger Zond found evidence that there's ice on the Mercury planet.
The ice shelter may have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The U.S.A. Space Department has demonstrated the existence of ice on the Mercury planet.
Although it is closer to the sun, there is also a frozen water, as shown in three studies published in the Science Special Journal on Thursday.
The Messenger Zond found evidence that the ice was covered in the shadows of the region.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, perhaps even up to 20 meters.
Assuming, the water is happening with comets or perhaps asteroids facing Mercury.
No one links the ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific leader of the sonda Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury may reach 426 degrees of Celsia.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other construction elements of life have gotten to other places of the Solar System.
For the inhabitants of the Earth, the zonda, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix, are exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small windows into infinite daily.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from Max Plank Institute.
Eight planets of our Solar System, as well as the Cerera collar planet.
Like Pluton, who turns around the Sun for Neptune, Cerera, on the new definition of the International astronomical Union since 2006, is not "paid".
This fragment of the infrared telescope "Spitzer" represents a "family portrait" of unbroken generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue points, the harder to identify in the star circle the pink-born stars.
This area of star education, the scientists, unromanticly call it W5 - opened telescope "Spitzer" in Cassiopea's constellation, at the distance of 6500 light years.
This transfusioned fever of the dying star photographed NASA Spitzer telescope.
The doughnut ring consists of the material that the star threw out during the dying process.
The giant fog of Trifid, removed by 5400 light years from Earth, produce new stars from gas and dust.
NASA telescope Spitzer made this picture of the galaxy birth hall.
The star bunch of Pleida, also called "Seven sisters", can be seen at night with an unarmed eye.
Of course, the color telescope is better.
As the red eye blinks the observer the Flash Flash on this infrared picture.
It is located at the distance of 700 light years in the constellation of the Waterstar.
The earthly continent's corridor brought the nickname North America.
The combination of a normal and infrared photo provides an explicit flower transmission.
This new star in all the beauty could be photographed only with infrared telescope sensors.
Saturn and his rings: how they came up is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
This may be the part of the Saturn moon, which disappeared inherently 4,5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and most clear photos of the Habble telescope: Watergate
Depending on the flower, the pictures of spiral galaxies are transformed into present artwork.
The photo published by the Southern Observatory shows the trifid fog of the Arrow's constellation for thousands of light years.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three, three-second), since the dark dust lines divide into three parts the heart of the star collar.
In the star of the Snake, astronomers photographed a space collapse champion: 400 million light years from the Earth of two merging galaxies are encountered and inevitablely encountered.
The star's birth of the Habble telescope took off in the M83 spiral galaxy.
One who does not like technical reductions may call it Southern Trustee.
The photo of the space telescope Habble shows the fragment of Iris mist in the conservation of Cephea.
The tumor that is removed from 1400 light years consists of particles of dust, which are 10 to 100 times smaller than the normal domestic dust.
This picture was made of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a black hole ring removed by 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 photographed the NASA space telescope Habble.
The large spiral galaxy, the scientists call UGC 1810.
This star fog is the brightest group of new stars in our Milk Way.
The star collar constantly creates new stars.
This star cloud, connected with the Fog of Roset, also constantly creates new stars, at the distance of 5000 light years from Earth.
There is no dust in this bright galaxy with a small black hole, but gas.
Researchers suggest that it occurred shortly before the Great Explosion, when the universe was mainly a hydrogen.
Our Views to the Universe: Important Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgay, even before Galileo Galileo came to watch stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become more and their views of space are increasingly available.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Observatory of Palmar in San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S., the large binocular telescope is installed.
It allows two mirrors to look into space, each diameter 8.4 metres.
"Gran Telescopio Canarias" has a giant internal device - a diameter of one only mirror is 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Greater South African Telescope in South Africa is segmented to reduce prices.
However, it reaches about 11 meters in the diameter.
Insufficient constructive performance: the telescope is strictly attached under the vertical angle, which restricts its movement.
The Hobby-Aberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its speciality: high lighting ability.
It reaches -- despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - parameters of the largest world telescopes.
With radio telescope in Aresibo, Puerto Rico, researchers listen to alien signals in space.
Radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Participating in the External Insight Search project (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing its calculation power.
The Observatory of the European astronomical Service (ESO) in Chilean Andes.
It's a "Very large telescope" -- a totally matching its name.
His four mirrors allow lighting in the visual pipe even the average infrared spectrum.
The Chile Observatory of the ESO also plans to install a European " Very large telescope " .
Its main mirror should be divided to a total of 42 meters and will be composed of nearly 1000 mirrors.
However, photographs should be expected not before 2018.
By 2007, both Cook telescopes in the Hawaii volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the biggest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
The Kea telescopes are composed of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which is also looking into the sky with the subar and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope, with a mirror of 30 meters, must appear on Mauna Kea.
They can love the illustration here.
However, the most important types of space are placed by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, he has drawn pictures of remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the Space Telescope Kepler has been looking for planets outside the Solar System, especially those in which life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1235 candidates were discovered from the beginning of the mission.
The photograph has been sealed by the recent preparations of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The space telescope of James Webb (JWST) will be sent to space not earlier than 2018 on the Arian 5 missile.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is that it must be in the light of the first stars and galaxies to look for the Great Explosion.
Scientists assume that there is ice on the south of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data on this, since the Messenger is turning closer to the northern field of the planet.
Radars for decades indicated that there was ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the 2004 Messenger sonda, the first that turns around Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink oil every day and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many inhabitants reach Biblely respectful age.
There's even a long-term museum here.
The finding of the findings in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many inhabitants reach Biblely respectful age.
There's even a long-term museum here.
The finding of the findings in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
The journey through the Taleland Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
The microautobus screams through the whispering road along the growing thick forests of the hills, storms of rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everyone around is so green and bright that you can think you're in Schwartzwald.
But this is the southest edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few miles away.
This is where tallies live -- one of the peoples of Caucasus, who are not aware of, except what they are speaking well in farsi and Azerbaijan and are different by the long-term.
The final item is Leric.
The small town is scattered by a too heavy architecture of Soviet times, which does not harmonize with the painted mountain landscape at all.
Tourists from Europe are barely arriving here, the road from the Azerbaijan capital of Baku is too tired.
It takes eight hours to reach 323 miles, since the road has only one trail.
The legendary wealth that the country owes the Caspian sea oil here, to the province until it has arrived.
However, Pilate Fatulaev (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Leric.
"In May, Baku was celebrated by a song of Eurovision -- and next year we will have a festival of older people in the world," said Fatulajeva.
She is the director of the long-term museum, probably the only one in the world.
This documentation documented about eight dozen talls of these places over 100 years. Fatulajeva indicates a black and white photograph.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old here.
When he was 136 years old, he was born with another child
However, the museum’s controversial star is Shirali Muslumov, who is probably 168 years old.
The birth certificates, however, are not.
And given that the older person, whose age was confirmed by the documents, 122 years were fulfilled, Muslum's age seemed extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," explained Fatulajeva.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at 136 years old, he seemed to have a daughter.
Did the Muslums' chaban add a few dozen years to his age?
Because even Rembrandt Shaltz, a researcher of age from the Institute of Max Plank in Rostok, heard about long residents in Central Asia.
"Amazingly many people of the old age can also be met in some areas of China, Japan, or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," said Shaltz, "in Sardinia, there are also extremely many very old people."
However, because of the lack of documents, scientific reaffirmation of age was not possible because there were no civil status registries.
Each day a glass of warm oil
Nevertheless, there is a fact that people in the area of Leric often reach the Bible’s age.
Now there are 20 people older than 100 years.
Why are there so many people in the south?
The Azerbaijan executive, Farid Mugimsade, explains this with special genes of tall.
The Director of Fatulajev Museum, on the contrary, believes that it's a matter of food.
Tallies love meat, bread and most of the milk products, many drink on a glass of warm oil every day, but it is unlikely that high calorie diet can be healthy from a dietological perspective.
In Changemania, a small village near the city of Leric, lives Rubab Mirzoeva.
At 97 years, she is relatively young for these widths.
Mirzaeva, who claims that she has 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, typical for the whole Caucasian region.
She's sitting on the floor with a bowl of oil without tired riding there and there.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of the sons and daughters of Mirzaeve, who have already had their grandchildren.
Two babies will also be jumping around.
In the kitchen the guests are cooking the tea in typical slippery glasses of armuda.
Mirzae has perfectly equal and strong white teeth, hiding long dark-Rye hairs that her son opens with pride to us.
I've always had my hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
"And I never used the shampoone," said Mirzaeva.
Monthly retirement is sufficient for life
She's always eating only what grew up in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, weeds.
I've never been buying food in the shop for my whole life.
Then she tells me about her husband who served in the army.
It was most difficult after World War II.
But it's been better when Geidar Aliev's "loved father" ripped up.
The propaganda does not sound often in the speech of an old woman.
However, the cult created around the nation's father who ruled as a dictator in Azerbaijan is almost no borders.
He was in power until 2003, and then his son Ilham took the brass of the government.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijan old people.
230 monates (e.g. the same amount of euro) Mirzaeva receives a pension per month, for local conditions, the amount for which you can live well.
And perhaps a long-term son of Mirzae's right too: "Olders in our culture have deep respect."
They live in a large family, loved, surrounded by care and happy.
No reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human right" is not in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The competitive demonstration in Cairo demonstrates that the country is deeply dispersed.
The future constitution based on the shariate has encountered a rageous resistance.
The Egyptian President did not seem to be a paphos.
We have to create a transition.
"And his success is on my responsibility to the people and to God," he said in public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but primarily to Christian kopts, liberals, educated Muslims and non - religious Egyptians.
Because they are all still unreliable in a disturbed opposition.
Fear of a religious State in Nile on the mercy of the mighty Brothers Muslim.
Mohammed Mursey, almost by apologizing, said that he had temporarily cut off the competence of the constitutional court and extended his competence to "to save the revolution".
However, that a 61-year-old engineer, a doctor of the Southern California University, really wants to save the world and Egyptians.
Will the judicial authorities be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles have been carried out in a 15-hour night jump with obstacles to the Islamic Constitutional Assembly of 100 participants, which partially causes fear.
As in the previous constitutions, the draft states that the proceedings are based on the "Principles of Islamic Law".
But what does "principles" mean?
It was and remained a matter of interpretation, and it could be feared that Islamists would use a strict formulation and a legal lift for a more strict interpretation of the sharia.
At least one new article suggests that, in all cases relating to the sharia, the Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic Institute of the country, which has a great authority in all the Sunnith Islam, should be drawn to the Council.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy is supervising the law, that de facto would result in the restriction of the judiciary.
In the constitution draft, many things are subject to interpretation
Another problem is that civilians should remain accused of the military court.
Those courts during the period of Mubaraka served to suppress opponents.
After the dictator was defeated in military prison, up to 11,000 civilians.
As stated in the project, the State should protect the " true substance of the Egyptian family " and " support its morals and values " .
This is legally so unreasonable that public institutions can even control the contents of the movies and literature by means of this article.
This means nothing but censorship.
In fact, no article sets a straight equality of men and women.
However, another prohibits insulting and wronging the prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It is also suspicious for the wording that is prohibited by “offense”.
Will there be enough cartoons for the president or jokes about justice?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in this project, which Murcey proposed for signature and which he said, " Very soon" would be submitted to the Egyptians on the referendum.
"The revolution has come back."
A opposition against Islamic superiority has been formed for several weeks.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual single night Friday night on the Tahrir Square in Cairo and swore to destroy this document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took third place at presidential elections.
The Nobel Prize of Peace and the former leader of the International Atomic Energy Department, Mohammed El-Baradea, stated that the constitution was placed on the waste of history.
Through the Short News Service, he accused Mursay's commitment to lead the "patch against democracy".
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and take it away," said oppositionist Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not been revenged," the Egyptian media of the opposition policy of Haled Ali quoted.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would make it incorrect.
"Coran - our Constitution"
The well-organized Brothers Muslimans, in turn, called for a opposite demonstration, but, from precaution, not on the Tahrire Square, but after a mass prayer in the other Neal coast in front of the Cairo University.
It took part in a large number of women under the covers and the salaphites who cried: "The people require the application of the law of God."
They demanded Murcy, "Clean the country!" and assured, "The Quran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area in which everything began has provoked the state of practically civil war.
Murcy's followers obviously didn't want to take this risk.
The Muslim brothers stated that both the opponents and the constitutional constitutional representatives were expressed loudly and clearly.
Now it is time for the people to decide from the electoral urna in which direction the country should go.
Most of the Islamist project, this is considered a decisive case.
"Human rights" is not mentioned once"
Hafiz Abu Saed in anger from this forced constitutional process, which, in fact, had to last before February with all public forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (ECPR) protected the “Brats Muslimman” when they sat in prison or were in court in Mubarak.
Not because he divided their perspective, but because human rights are unknown to him.
That's why he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
Now the words "man rights" are never met in a new constitution, he regrets in the conversation with "Welt am Sontag".
The increase in Mursay's influence on all three branches of authority in the State disappoints a lawyer.
These measures are obvious impacts on the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil state, the President de facto cancelled it," Sayed regretted.
Because without civil society organizations, democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels that he was abandoned, even the international community, who looked at the ideological struggle in Nile with the mix of curiosity and tension.
That could be the payoff.
The demonstrator on the Tahrir Square warns: "You create a monster you can't control."
Norwegian rakfisk: the worst smelling fish in the world?
The 5 million Norway population has one of the highest living levels not only in Europe but also in the world.
Perhaps the secret of the country's success has something to do with local addiction to an extremely cruel fisheries dishes?
Take some of the oversighted pieces of cheese.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweat sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You'll have the scent of a rafico, one of the most famous Norwegian delicates.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours away from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but in the air there's an unexpected scent.
Rakfisk is a foil, salt-solied and water-floating up to a year, depending on what kind of dust should be achieved.
As summers are cold and cold, the Norwegian crowds are gathering for a festival in Fagerness, which is dedicated to it, let's say that it's an exciting meal.
"It is eating raw and peeing with a rough aquavite, local dark vodka," explains Howard Halvarsen, local fireman in the profession and the racfish general compatibility, who runs the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat a little fish and spit it with a lot of alcoholic.
"Someone prefers aquavite than a rafish," said Howard.
This drink is capable of breaking the smell.
I'll try a couple of pieces.
If you can get a piece under your nose, it's not so bad — it's little different from the drought you've been driving with you in the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product of totally different times, poverty times, when, before the refrigerators appeared, fish was wiped in hermetically closed bowls with salt water.
Then, in a deep winter, when the fish was well and properly polluted, it was extracted, and was used in food by suffocating alcoholic perception.
The fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate primarily in the United States.
The population is now rapidly growing -- more than 13 per cent of immigrants that are drawn up by jobs, high wages and the developed social security system.
Sweden’s residents (the old competitor and not so long and much more resilient neighbour) have come to work here.
Rakfisk is considered as an important symbol, unchanging, although a few of the horrible elements of the past Norway.
It's one of the most expensive local foods.
On the other hand, it's all expensive -- a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds of sterlings ($14).
Norway rarely appears in world news, and most people of the country seem to have this.
People are still unwanted to mention the name of Anders Bravic, racist and the extremist of the right push, who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without prejudice to his name, the terrorist calls "the case of 22 July".
Norwegians are very difficult to believe that in their peaceful country one of their fellow believers has been able to do such acts and murders.
Based on the current welfare of Norway, growth (from the early 1970s) is one of the largest oil sectors in the world.
"And oil is not the only reason why we are prosperous," says Anna, our waiter, who delivers candidates with a survived cancer, a woman with long light hair and amazingly blue eyes, acquisition of Nordic Welfare.
We are a people, as you call it, reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks greatly English.
We don't like to show, we're not bragging.
Norway has very carefully treated its oil, most of the revenues of the oil industry are invested in a special fund established for the benefit of future generations.
In the years preceding the global financial crisis, when everyone was scattered with the money they had not had, Norway was carefully counting all costs.
"As long as you can ride on the skies in winter and walk in summer, that's enough for happiness," said Anna.
"And there's a cancer," she adds with a careless laughter.
I'm standing in the snow in a row for some food, I'm done with the rafish.
There's a hamburger with fate meat -- it's definitely an exotic, delicious juice meat.
But tonight we're waiting for more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel, there is a special dinner dedicated to the rafisque, during which the visitors vote to determine the best or perhaps the most smellful fish.
There is a direct television showing the leading in a candy coat surrounded with cancer tapes.
It's like a song competition "European".
"So, Thor-Yergen, what is your best fish in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our assessment."
Everyone laughs and applauses.
Someone's falling off the chair, perhaps over the aquavit.
Or maybe just breathing from the smell of this fish.
The President of Mexico, Enrique Penya Neto, is in the face of a difficult start of his career.
While the newly elected President of Mexico Enrique Penya Neto is preparing to become a position, the correspondent of BBC Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he had to face and the mixed expectations of his country.
The road movement in Mexico is now in a particularly pathetic state.
The city was loaded by transport and at the best time, and several key roadways to the capital had been placed on the road since Monday.
However, it was done not to allow people to come to work from suburbs, but to prevent protesters from reaching the parliamentary building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Penya Neto, will put on the presidential bonds and take the ruling of the country.
It is a challenge to him.
Mexico has achieved good economic indicators in the administration of Felipe Calderon, who is now composed of its powers, but the country has ruined the drugs war, which has already taken about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My Government claims to the people of Mexico that they are willing to fight violence," said Mr. Penya Neito earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barak Obama, in the ovalary office of the White House.
I will offer a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
The political career of Mr. Penya Neito was developed as the Governor of his native state of Mexico before such statements.
His family, in a huge and wide state, around the capital of the country, had divided the views of the new leader.
Rect linear person
In the idilical city of Valje de Bravo, for example, it is mentioned warmly.
The inhabitants deserve to renew tourism, the development of the sphere and the establishment of infrastructure.
One of the new roads built by Mr. Penya Neeto, which are different from the roads with boilers and james that were previously in this place.
Tables with his name hang on the modern sports center building and on an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We link him to real and serious changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Ernandez, congressman of the State headed by Penya Neto of the institutional revolutionary party (PRI).
We look forward to the current and decisive changes that our country so much needs, especially in the field of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous residence, the Party of the PRI was exhausted in 2000 by Visente Fox.
Congressman Olvera acknowledged that after his 12-year absence in the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, the Party has given great hopes on Enrique Penya Neto.
Furthermore, he opposes the opposition to the new president ' s accusations of non-containability.
He is very straightened and very loyal to his vision of the future country.
It is an excellent public actor, and, firstly, a person who can listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different idea of the former governor.
The Nesaualcoitl Municipality, also known as Sudad Nes, is the most remarkable contrast with the powerful streets of Valje de Bravo.
Hidden under the highway estacades, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico itself.
The municipalities also have a severe nature of this megapolis.
Earlier this year, military forces have been attracted to reconciliate drug trafficking gangs in these areas, and violence against women is particularly acute.
There were only a few dozen dead women discovered in the wilderness near the extensive debrief in the past two years.
More than a thousand women have been killed in Mexico during the governance of Mr. Penya Neito -- that is significantly greater than that in the sadly celebrated city of Sudad-Huares, whose name has become indigenous when it comes to killing innocent women.
According to the opponents of Mr. Penya Neito, he was in a better way to say that he had not been able to deal with the problem of the murder of women during his position in the Governor's position.
In the worst case, his administration was accused of the full ignorance of the problem.
A resident of a concrete house similar to most houses in this area, Irinea Buendia barely holds her tears, showing me pictures of her dead daughter, Mariana Moon.
Mariana had committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her companion killed her.
"When I got to her house, it seemed like her body was washed before that," recalls Ms. Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body was already rounded.
Mariana’s mother tells this story, and her daughter's portrait looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the scaffold, which is just one word: justice.
That is what they said that the family had been rejected.
"State officials treated me as an old speaker, dissatisfied with a peacekeeper.
They want people to accept everything they say and keep silent.
But this is wrong, so it can't, especially when there are so many violations and misunderstandings around it," she said.
Wearing the presidential bond on Saturday, President Penya Neito will take with it a difficult responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have affected violence crimes, and the new president promised to make the problem priority during its rule.
"I hope that he will be exactly the same President as the Governor," said Olvera, congressman from Valie de Bravo of the Pri Party.
However, this is the most fearful of the victims' families in Sudad Ness.
Bradley Manning has not complained of bad treatment, he claims a charge.
Prosecutors are trying to dismiss Bradley Manning's statements of bad detention conditions.
During the hearing, Manning was paid attention to the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence requires the closure of the case on the ground that the conditions of the Manning prison were cruel.
The U.S. Army has been accused of kidnapping thousands of secret documents.
On Friday, the accusation tried to prove that soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the largest escape of secret materials in the U.S. history, did not use many possibilities to file a complaint of bad treatment, which he said he had to transfer when he was in military prison.
During the interrogation at the Fort Mide trial, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Fein stated that the records of weekly visits by Manning's representatives of the prison administration for nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints on bad treatment.
The cross-examination in the review of the application for the protection of the Manning case on the basis of that the conditions of his imprisonment were cruel and in itself were sufficient punishment, was carried out the next day after Manning stated that he was detained, he intended to commit suicide.
Military Intelligence Analysis Specialist, arrested in June 2010, is accused of kidnapping a number of thousands of secret documents during Iraq ' s service.
These materials were subsequently published on the WikiLeaks website.
The WikiLeaks resource did not confirm that the source of information was Manning.
During the hearing on Friday, Prosecutor Fane, along with Manning, reviewed the reports that were filled with after the visits of Manning by the representatives of the administration during his stay in Quantico prison, where he was under the strict detention regime since July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Prosecutor Fane asked about the reports on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he appreciated the view of the prison administration as " excellent" and the general terms of conclusions as "very professionally organized".
The reviewed reports did not contain complaints of bad treatment, despite the fact that Manning was directly asked about the conditions of its content, Féin said.
Manning replied that he expressed his oral concern with these problems and that his representatives of the administration had discussed these problems with him and claimed that they would deal with them but did not fix it in writing.
"They have recorded "There are no problems" (after the discussion of my complaints), but that does not mean that I have not raised this subject in a conversation," said Manning.
The Military Judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained of his misconduct in January 2011 during the meeting of the commission that considered the suicidal intentions he expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting, he wanted to be able to remove the regime of “trauma warning” and to mitigate the conditions of imprisonment.
Military leaders explained that a limited detention regime -- below than a surveillance regime -- was introduced to protect the prisoner and to protect others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I'm fine to cancel the trauma prevention regime... to improve my life level, from my perspective," explained Manning.
On Thursday, Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held nearly two months before he was transferred to prison on the maritime base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that his thoughts of suicide appeared in Kuwait and that he once lost consciousness because of a strong heat.
He explained that it's psychologically very difficult when you're not told how your participation is decided and what happens in the outside world.
"My world came to the Camp Arafjan base, to the sizes of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I'd die in this cell."
When he was in Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell at least 21 hours and often even more than 23 hours a day in full loneliness.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only mattress, blanket, blankets, several clothing objects and glasses.
He said he was trying to move, because sleeping or even lying in the day was banned by rules.
According to Manning, during his sleeping, he was constantly beaten by the light that came out of the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned into bed at night, he said he was awakened and forced to turn to his back.
Manning's lawyer officially objected to the unlawful treatment of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to military prison in Fort Levenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement that he made during his statement on Thursday, that, after he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners at the morning check.
Manning stated that he had no possibility to cover his blanket during the check.
In response to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said that he understood the order of the guard that he should drop the blanket that he could cover, but admit that no one directly ordered him to leave it.
On Thursday, Manning stated that he was forced to sleep naked at night because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not at risk for himself.
Manning said that he told the officer that he could use a tire of cowards or a scum to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his underwear, the squirrels and the glasses were taken out of the cell.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would, at least, take into account what he had to experience during his imprisonment, and would significantly reduce the sentence if Manning was recognized by a war court who had to begin its consideration at the beginning of the next year.
The defence stated that it planned to invite Manning to acknowledge less serious crimes and other accusations to be condemned as excessive.
The hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the accusation party is expected to insist that the conditions of detention were justified.
Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the content of the arrested with the maximum strict regime.
Among the accusations made to Manning are the help of the opponent, illegal assistance to the internet, the transfer of information relating to national defence, and the abduction of public property or documents.
If it is convicted by all the acts of prosecution, it may be threatened by life.
My national self-determination crisis is the story of the American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the absence of the possibility to realize themselves.
The Mexicans are inclined to blame those who left because they remind the people of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that the Mexicans of American origin are breaking between two cultures.
During the recent trip to Mexico, I walked through the hallway for arriving, approached border control zone and stopped in place.
The signs indicated two rows: one for Mexicanos (Mexican), the second for Extranjeros (foreigns).
I was standing in front of them for a few seconds without knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I was called Mexican all my life.
It's just a parole name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends from New York consider themselves Italians.
Later, I stopped on the complicated construction of the American of Mexican origin.
But here I was in Mexico.
There was no need for conditional names or complex designs in my grandfather's family.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is more poor than the tongue holders, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport, and I became a turn for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico Enrique Penya Neto visited the White House and met President Obama.
The agenda had been used for the meetings of the Presidents of those countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Penya Neito was willing to talk about the rising of the Mexican economy, which, with the same success, the Mexican people would now be able to stay in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wished to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and to establish a North American Trade Block like the European Union.
Furthermore, President Penya Neito promised to continue a war against drug carriers in Mexico, but no specific proposals had been made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a severe and executive issue of old insult.
Most Americans have never thought that in 1848 the United States had invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half their territory.
But Mexicans have been thinking for centuries, not for minutes, and see the reminders of those events in all.
It is therefore worth only a US State deputy to speak to Mexico's criticism, the press and the mexican elite of the sovereignty of the neighbours.
And the descendants of Montesum are fulfilled by the military.
Mexico's relationship with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin in the United States is the most complex.
Do you want to talk about insults?
That's enough.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people who find opportunities for themselves in this country, and those for whom there is no possibility.
In L.A., Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Anthonyo, so many people of Mexican origin only for one reason: at some point of their family history, any father or grandfather had no opportunity to realize themselves in Mexico and had to go north.
Most of all, Mexicans of a certain type -- misty, low-educated, poor farming families.
We are their descendants, and we remember it.
They see this differently in Mexico.
Today, our life is a dream of Americans, we have been studying in good schools, and we have a good job, but we don't forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and uncertain, but we know what country to consider.
United States of America.
We also know that most of the representatives of the Mexican elite and the governing class do not love us.
We answer them the same.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating damages, and they refer to us as men of the second sort, as the nonreal Mexicans.
We're not speaking well enough in Spanish, and our relationship with Mexico is not strong enough.
Our own existence is due to failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn't be behind the silk curtain right now by finding a life in the United States, but by losing spiritual relations.
My wife was born in Guadalahar and moved legally to the United States as a child, and this reminds me of the fact that there are some trends between the Mexicans and the Americans of Mexican origin -- the Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly, and the Americans of Mexican origin are insulting.
She is a US civilian and believes that she belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my famous Americans in Mexico do not feel belonging to any of them.
We're listening to the Mexican group of Los Tigres del Norte, but we love Bruce Springstein.
You get the best of two worlds, you lose roots inevitablely.
We're Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States we are called Mexicans.
Now, as I learned during my journey, as if our relationship was not enough confused, some of the Mexican leaders and intelligence representatives want to restore their relationship with the diaspora.
They want the Americans of Mexican origin to work as Ambassadors of Mexico and represent its interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends about how beautiful this country is and how good it is to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen communications with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
It's not gonna work.
Too many insults in the past.
In view of the breakdown between rich and poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us don't think that this country is so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but you can handle it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If a number of Mexicans still can't forgive the United States of America as they did with Mexico a century ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican origin were still offended for how recently in Mexico treated their relatives.
Yeah.
I guess we've had more common than I thought.
Old Fights in the New Middle East
The ceasefire Agreement between Israel and Hamas grouping could be a crude foundation for further peace
Is long-term peace possible between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another circle of bloodshed suggests that such hopes are harmful.
Sounds as common, meaningless disputes about who started first; many buildings are converted into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were composed of civilians and six Israelis; for the first time during the conflicts released from the Gaza Strip, missiles fell in the area of the capital of Israel Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the unlikely involvement of Israel and Palestinians in their eternal conflict, changes have come to the Middle East.
This could be different, but the “Arab Spring” events circled in a rebel storm of rebellious realities, and the Palestinians with the Israelites were unable to stay away from the wind shook of the region.
Their fight may result in even more bloodshed than before.
However, there are reasons for hope for the exit of this deadly asshole.
War without winners
At first, the situation does not give causes for optimism.
Even if the cessation of the fire, the agreement signed on 21 November, will be fulfilled, the struggle that occurred this week only strengthened the positions of forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamic Movement of Hamas, who came to the authorities in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will claim that they had forced Israel to retire despite their losses.
Despite the destruction of some group leaders and 1.7 million inhabitants were locked in one of the most dense and troubled corners of our planet, Israel was unable to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank of Jordan, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by Fatch's more moderate movement.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders can find that time is working for them.
As the influence of Islamic movements in the Arab world has increased, Hamas has new influenced and rich friends.
The reborn regional leader of Turkey, who was once the closest ally of Israel among the Muslim countries, spoke with the support of Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamicly developing States of the Persian Gulf.
Hamas, succeeding actors, declared the establishment of an Islamist half-month around Israel from Lebanon in the north, in which the armed group of Hezbolle, to Syria, where the increasingly illustrated rebels have been disposed of the authority of Bashar Assad, and further to Jordan, where the king's authorities are threatening Hamas' allies.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region has occurred in the southern borders of Israel, in the most dental and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the influence of the movement of the Brothers Muslims has been strengthened.
Hosni Mubarak, who was ruled by Egypt for 30 years and was discarded in 2011, was a world dictator who had no particular attention to Hamas' support.
Muslim brothers, on the contrary, are an organization much like Hamas, and their leaders are more inclined to populism.
In the future diplomatic arrangements, Hamas could become a significant player whose voice will not be able to drown even Israel and America.
At the same time, Israel's opposite conclusions will come to the opposite line.
In a military sense, Hamas was slaughtered.
The Israeli Iron Couple anti-racket system has justified the costs of its creation and has successfully destroyed many of the Hamas missile launched.
Israeli citizens can sleep calmly, at least for a while.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to their standing position; many European countries have also charged guilt for the beginning of the last round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is Israel's economic prosperity, especially with the Government of Binjamin Netanjahu, which has significantly ignored the peace process.
Despite the death of approximately 30 Israeli missiles launched from the Gaza Strip since 2004, Israel has been able to minimize the problem of death terrorists, partly through a wall that enters the West Bank of Jordan, a significant part of the unrecognised Palestinian State, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illicitity of such acts in the light of international legislation.
The position of Prime Minister Netanayahu, whose Lecud Party, in preparation for the elections scheduled on 22 January, was combined with even more aggressively designed conservators under the leadership of Avigdor Liberman.
What is the point of creating Palestinians and giving them their own State?
If all the powers in the West Bank are given to them, will they not start launching rockets from there to Israel, as their companions in the Gaza Strip?
Better keep them behind the wall and strictly suppress any attempts to raise their heads.
Possibly the "speak" lines will win; however, their calculations can be dismissed in Arab spring.
While Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries have not the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defence part of Israel's budget is more than all its Arab neighbours, collected together.
The settlement of war with the regional supernational is unlikely to help the Governments of Arab countries strengthen their own economy.
The pragmatism of the President of Egypt, Murcy, who worked together with Barack Obama on the ceasefire, was a good sign and could mark the beginning of changes.
Israel should, at least, take into account the long-term consequences of its policies.
As a result of democratic change in Arab countries, the deprivation of the Palestinians of the right to self-determination is a bomb of slow action that will explode early or later in the occupied Israeli territories, like the bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repressions already undermine the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic aspect of the growth of the Arab population is only aggravating these problems.
For bloodshed operations carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement, the increasing dissatisfaction of the international community has to be paid.
Both sides need external impulse
It remains the only solution to which healthy representatives from both sides call on, as well as the majority of the rest of the world, and our newspapers: the education of two States and the Israeli derogation of territories in exchange for security.
Hope remains not too impressive in a short-term perspective, the hope that the ceasefire will allow other countries to influence the sides of the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, who has long time to decide to cover arms to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar have more than ever been able to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and joint use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the movements of Hamas and Fatch.
This would do more to create a Palestinian State than the forthcoming UN vote, which could result in the recognition of the virtual state of Palestine.
The President of Obama should also play its role in placing Israel on the table of negotiations.
During his first time, he has never introduced his own peaceful settlement plan.
Once he returned to the White House, he continued to demonstrate the unwillingness to address the problem.
It's a catastrophic position.
The United States is vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the law on a single packaging for cigarettes entered into force.
The warnings of smoking and images affected by parts of the body are contrastful to the poor green boxes that are equal to all the marks of cigarettes.
The first Australian law on a uniform packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products entered into force in the world’s practice, replaceing logotypes and coloring of different marks with the same olive-fish box with scary paintings affected by parts of the body and pictures of children whose health was blown by smoking their parents.
In addition to various paintings and labels that warn the damage to smoking, the only difference between packages incorporated in binding order with this Saturday is the names of the marks that are printed by the same small font.
This is the most rigorous conditions in the world to make packaging of tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia stated that the aim of this measure was to keep youths from smoking deprived of this bad fashion habit.
Based on this decision, studies showed that people who did not start smoking up to 26 years were never smoking in 99 of 100 cases.
"It is obvious that even in the youngest ages, children understand the sense that tobacco companies are trying to bring through packaging," explains the Minister for Health, Tanya Plibersek, indicating research that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with children with the idea of princess.
Australia is one of the least smoker countries in the world, so these changes will not affect the profits of transnational corporations, but the possibility of taking such measures is already considered by other countries.
The representatives of the tobacco industry have strongly opposed the adoption of the law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market with cheap and accessible cigarettes.
"This law will lead to serious consequences that are excellent from those who have been contemplated by its initiators," said Scott McIntaire, representative of the British American Tobacco company in Australia.
Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will provide much more such goods for sale in Australia's streets.
For someone, on the contrary, new laws contribute to business growth.
Sandra Ha, from a small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that the demand for portsages and silicon footlers hiding unpleasant paintings on the pack, has rapidly grown (practically from zero) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco were trying to appeal to this law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already implemented a number of six thousand items to the company and expects a new party.
It's a good business for us.
The potential disturbance for the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population to which these measures are addressed.
Following the adoption of a number of laws in Australia that have made illegal television advertising cigarettes and support for sports activities, as well as prohibiting sellers to issue cigarettes in the visible place, the tobacco advertisement has moved to the Internet.
The Government of Australia has prohibited local companies and websites to place advertising on the Internet, but it cannot limit foreign sites.
"If you trade in tobacco products and you have only this small lasey, the idea of promoting your goods on the Internet will seem very attractive to you," explains Becky Freeman, studying public health at Sydney University.
Freemen notes the increase in the number of reviews on trade marks written by a person of allegedly ordinary users in social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is, is this really the case of a soldier who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he has not regretted his strength and time and made a video, or is it the advertising company behind it?
The Australian British American Tobacco office claims that the industry is now more busy adapting to new rules than advertising.
The representatives of the tobacco industry have even taken measures, such as the sponsoring of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic, to dispute new rules: these States have claimed in the framework of the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade was unfairly restricted, despite the lack of trade between all these countries and Australia.
WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tany Plibersek, the Government discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first mandatory placement of photographs to warn the damage to smoking.
This rule is now adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of accelerating laws is addressed in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are not demonstratively subject to innovation.
These pictures don't bother me.
I just don't mind.
"You just grab a cigarette and hide a package in your pocket," explains Victor El Hayg, buying cigarettes with a photo of a mouth-based tumor.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me leave is my little daughter.
James Yu, head of the tobacco store King of the Pack in the centre of Sydney, claims that the same pack has complicated the task of laying down stock items
"I had an hour to unload the new party before, and now four hours," he complained.
"The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, and we would say what to do, all right, it's over, closing the store," he said, throwing his hands up.
Missing electronic networks and constant connections in the world is not so bad.
On this Thanksgiving Day, I had to spend five hours at the airport, because our plane had mechanical disorders and was replaced by another plane we were waiting for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of boring.
I won't cheat on you.
The afternoon at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and there will be no great help from books, magazines, iPhone, nor even shops of non-profit trade.
However, in recent times, more scientists and child development experts have been exposed to boredom.
They say that in certain situations, we and our children do not miss so badly.
This forces the brain to distract interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in the modern world, we are all constantly in front of a screen, the boring advantages are passing past us.
Maybe we need to try to get bored?
Yeah.
Not at the same time.
We'll get back to that.
I used to think, like many, that it was a boring invention of recent times when people had more free time.
This is not true, said Peter Tui, a professor of the Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University of Calgary, author of the book “Adorable History of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.”
"In fact, boring can praise a very ancient history," he said.
The walls in Pompeas have been found in Latin signs of boredom dated by the first century.
It remains open about how we understand the boringness.
The problem is, according to John D. Istud, the Adjunct Professor of the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boring was often changing.
After studying research on this subject and asking the task force of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boring is when people want but cannot do what would bring them satisfaction.
The difference between boringness and apathy, he says, is that a missed man does not do anything he wants to do.
There's nothing to do with apathy.
The main thing in the experiencing boredom, he said, is "a disturbance of attention and the connected deterioration of the mood and the feeling that the time is slow."
By the description of boredom, it may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible relationship between these situations, the nauseous people see the causes of problems in the world and the circumstances, and those who suffer from depression see problems.
Sometimes it feels like we're bored when we're really hard to concentrate on something.
In its study “Unemployed Mind: Determination of boredom from the attention”, published in the September magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues refer to the previous experiment whose participants listened to the record of the voice reader.
Some participants also heard noises of the television program included in the neighbouring room, others heard the same sounds in low volume, so they could hardly be settled, and the third group listened only to a voice record without a foreign sound track.
Those participants who heard low-level television noted that they were bored, often others, were hard to concentrate, but they didn't know the reasons for this and assign it to boring.
When we are trying to focus on the difficult or interesting challenge, disturbing the attention may be boring, says Mark J. Fenske, the adjunct professor of neurology at the University of Gwelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "e.g., looking into the flow of products on the conveyer in search of a marriage that distracts music can help to avoid boring."
It is considered, it continues that when people start to go down on a chair or draw drawing cartoons on a list of papers, they do it from boring, but now we know that these actions are actually helping not to relax physically.
"The study showed that children who are not prohibited from rising and rotating are better learning and remembering more information than children who are required to sit calmly," said Professor Fenske.
At some point, we all are bored to see a uninterested film when the flight is delayed (as in my case).
However, different people show a variety of boring tendencies.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special " scal of boringness" to measure such individual characteristics.
In order to evaluate this scale, questions and allegations are used, for example, "Mnoge of what I have to do, uniformly and monotoneously" or "I am too interested, so I don't have enough time for anything."
With these questionnaires, researchers have identified that boys are failing more girls,” said Stephen Vodanovic, professor of psychology at the University of Western Florida, especially with various external irritators.
However, adolescents generally often miss.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of personal and public development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he was contacting with a pager nearly 400 teenagers and their parents 7 to 8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32 per cent of adolescents said they were bored at school and during their homework, and 23 per cent said they were bored outside the school.
Only 3% of their parents noted that they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no information about the kind of boring data that would be like this, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “in adolescent ages, ” mostly because children and adolescents are not allowed to decide fully what to do.
Let's go back to my original question: is it boring?
Sometimes it does not, because, in extreme manifestations, it can push people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risk gambling or abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have been wondering about the relationship between boring and creative, says Professor Vodanovic, who devoted the study of this problem for over two decades.
"So our brain tells us that we should do something else; that is boring," says Gary Marcus, a psychologist at the New York University.
However, this brain does not always know what to do.
If you're bored and you're sending this energy to a guitar game or culinary experience, you'll make yourself better.
But if you start watching the TV, you'll only be better for a while, and it'll pass soon.
Therefore, if your child is missing and you give him an iPad, he will no longer miss, but he will not learn to fight boring himself or any other way to manage his time and employment," says Professor Fenske.
"And such self-regulation skills are active in various situations," he said.
Your child learns not only to do something alone, but also to learn self-control at all.
I don't think it's a boring thing.
However, it's not worth considering it bad.
We should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous stream of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees with that.
"We see this so that we need to get more bored, while boring is a very unpleasant, inconvenient desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are trying to get away from constant concerns and just relax.
"In today's world, we are used to constantly excessively stimulating the feelings," he says, "and when silence comes, we lose and we don't know what to do."
Unfortunately, the new marijuana legalization law in Colorado
Anthony Orosko, a nineteen-year-old football team player and a public college student in the south-east state of Colorado, accused of committing a criminal offence that will soon be completely legal in the entire state: the storage of a small marijuana and pipe in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosco said that he was with his friends in Lamar in September and drove in a premium car near the border with Kansas, when the police were stopped.
After the police discovered in the car of marihuana, Mr. Orosco came to the court's jurisdiction for drug storage and possession of drug-use devices, minor offences, for which each penalty is deemed to be $100 and appointed the date of the judicial meeting.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of uncertainty, which has been on several weeks since the state of Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana in small amounts for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of tiny judicial cases depends not on the law as far as it is considered.
Prosecutions for small offences related to marijuana are already taken in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, which took a similar measure.
The police stations have already ceased to charge people aged 21 years and older than holding small doses, which will be considered legitimate as soon as the law enters into force in a few weeks.
However, in more conservative districts, Colorado, prosecutors decided to consider existing marijuana cases and continue to be responsible for preserving the drug.
At the same time, in some towns from Denver’s suburbs to the mountains of the West, they vote to avoid the appearance of new marijuana markets licensed by the state.
"It's all developing so rapidly that I don't even know what to wait for next," said Daniel J. Outs, head of the police in Aurora, eastern Denver.
The representatives of the controlling authorities in the State of Washington also freak out their heads.
They have to establish rules for the determination of the order of licensing, processing, dissemination and sale of marijuana, and all of this must be done until 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, is in advance of most other states in addressing marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado, a more organized market, so they will serve a good example," explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Producing Management Board and the acquisition of alcohol products in Washington.
But now no one can do more, admits Mr. Smith than to make any suggestions and hope that it will work.
"We don't have a real precedent to be guided," he said.
The draft law of the State of Washington, called I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will put the state in uncertainty for a year when the State License System is not yet available and the right to marijuana is already legal.
However, there are also difficult technical aspects that need to be resolved during this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state's order of “adequate access” to the licensed marijuana with a ban on its trade at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and gardens.
"It will be particularly difficult to lay down licensed marijuana trade enterprises in cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the recently established Research Group "Center of Marijuana Legalization".
On 21 November, the Chief of the Outs police of Aurora sent a report to his e-mail officers that the prosecutor would no longer attract those aged 21 to the responsibility for the possession of a small number of marihuana, and that the police would stop identifying people in the data violations " starting from now."
The Chief of the Police Outs reported that the police would monitor compliance in the city with the rules governing the activities of persons growing marijuana for medical purposes and pursue illegal drug dealers and distributors.
The Prosecutor of the Wald District in the north of Colorado, Ken Buck, has a more strict approach to this issue.
Following the bill on the draft law, he stated that the prosecutor would continue to be responsible for the possession of marijuana, primarily in order to encourage the users to take the course of treatment.
At this point, 119 persons have been accused of storing two or less uncies of marijuana, although many of them are accused of other violations.
"The duty of our institution to pursue the actions that are considered criminal when committed," said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The response was unequivocable even in areas such as the Mesa rural district, where voters rejected the proposal for marijuana legalization.
The Grand Jankshn Police, the largest city in the district, no longer is responsible for having a small number of drugs.
The District Prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to withdraw charges on open cases related to marijuana storage.
"I believe that to ensure compliance with the law until it change is our direct obligation," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the inhabitants of the state of Colorado, who participated in the voting, supported this decision, the inclusion of marijuana for entertainment in the public and legal system would not be easy.
The contrary to the residential response in various places of the state has naked the indifferentity of the relations of local authorities to the State experiment with marijuana.
"The district prosecutors have a cultural barrier in this matter," explains Sean Macalister, a Denver lawyer who represents the interests of the convicted marijuana, and the local representative of the National Marijuan Reforming Organization.
"They have been persecuting people for this so long that they can't really accept that this is no longer a crime," he said.
Colorado and Washington are the first states in which marihuanas are similar to alcohol are meant to be an experimental field in the scale of the country to verify the idea of drug legalization itself.
Legalization parties and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but they are also awaiting the instructions from the federal authorities that continue to consider sales and growing marijuana as federal crimes.
Participants of marijuana legalization hope that the Office of Justice will withdraw in this regard.
Despite a wide range of the arrests of traders and patients using marijuana on medical testimony, the federal Government has mostly made good to trade marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
The Narcotics Office would hardly break into houses to confiscate a small package of marijuana, but they would hardly close their eyes to the state-regulated recreation marijuana shops, which were authorized under the new law, considers Kevin A. Sabet, former drug adviser in Obama's administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the action of federal authorities.
Before the presidential elections, some local administrations approved the moratorium to open new marijuana sales shops that could not be opened before a year later.
Last week, Montrose, the city in the western state, issued a six-month ban on marijuana trade, which would appear to be approved next week.
"We do not want to be in such a position that we will issue a license to someone, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There remains a lot of unsolved issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I was survived from Oxford for being a conservator.
The prosecution of university students for their views has not started today.
As far as I remember myself, I always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in Oxford and described it as a best educational establishment in the world, a modern similar symposium that sets up two foundations of civilization -- freedom of mind and tolerance.
However, two weeks later, I gathered baggages and left in the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand and cry.
Friends were distracted.
The Evening Standard stated that I quit college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Written by A. Normann Wilson was joking I was leaving because I had to drink from screwed glasses.
It wasn't really so funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, she ran away because I was systematically poisoned and frightened.
Not because of my very unusual name or that I was studying in private school.
I was posed only for one reason, and in this celebrated enlightenment, it seemed to be a real barbarism and blind fanism: my father, now the dead Woodroe Wyatt, was a famous advisor Margaret Tatcher, and I was the conservator.
You're gonna ask why to mention it now?
According to the latest data, the new generation of students, who follow the right center views, is subjected to the same trawl.
This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred to conservator students in Oxford is so strong that last week, the group of such students required the same protection of their rights as the one given to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatories from the College College College Corpus Cristia in Cambridge stated that they were "very actively isolated, attacked and forced to feel unwanted" because of their political views.
They want to introduce an additional representative in the Committee on Equal Rights to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only aggravated by a recent BBC 2 documentary film on politics in the student ' The Miracles Page: Young, Smart and Right ' , in which the conservators were presented by excentrics and non-nazis.
The film showed Joe Cook, former President of the Oxford University Conservatory Association, who drives Rolls Royce, wears a silver suit and a silver coat.
In other universities, conservatory students complain that they make 'cossels releases for higher education fees'.
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of the Conservative Association of Nottingham University, in an interview with one of the Sunday newspaper, said that “the university environment is increasingly crossing the left-hand views.
People who don't even know us think of us in advance as impulsive and undeniable children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21-year-old student of the University of History of Corpus Christ, who has been requested to strengthen protection, calls this atmosphere “neutical”, and Stephanie Cheryl, 19, a new president of the University of Conservators of Oxford, said that the attitude of members of the Student Club to the right-centrist views was significantly deteriorated.
"It is a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply for the normal life of the club," she said.
The first few weeks in Oxford, I wasn't just a minority, I was alone.
I entered there in September 1986, a robbery and a shy eighteen - year - old girl.
Oxford was a hatred to a conservative party.
A year before that, the university had deprived its former student Margaret Tatcher from the reduction of budgetary appropriations for higher education.
In such a atmosphere, it would be awkward for even the stalists.
In the first days of the first week, when students met each other and the teachers, I first felt what was ahead of me.
I didn't know that teachers were not only looking through their fingers at the conservator students, but also gladly participated in it.
Political issues -- the strike of miners, privatization and disagreement of the Government to apply sanctions against the Government of Apartheid to South Africa -- have been invaded through the wooden walls of the audiences.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text in the eighteenth century to English, and I wasn't ready for what followed.
"Ms. Wyatt," said the teacher, now the dead Harry Pete, - please transmit the first paragraph."
The text was hard for me, and I stopped.
Harry Pete was a very greedy man with a face like a cake.
"The Tatcherists don't basically learn French or they just lack brains?" he asked.
Other students have screwed up.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take several French lessons at free time if you are not very busy turning into society," said Pitt.
I went back to my room totally unhappy.
That night at college, I was sitting alone at lunch, and then someone swallowed me in my shoulder.
It was James, a second class student from the English University, who was represented as a member of the University Conservator Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
- Unfortunately, the case is:
Everyone suspected of conservators will be messed with.
It's hard for me, and in your case, they know your father's close to Margaret Tatcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most conservators are pretending to be laborists."
Later, in the local pub, I was cowardly trying to hypocrite.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Tatcher says.
Speed didn't work.
The first student of the University of Philosophy, Policy and Economy, who was studying in Ethan, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're infected."
Other students took up his words.
I was ruined, dirty.
"How are the conservators having sex?" One of them asked.
- They're hitting each other, aren't they?"
I felt like I must have felt homosexual before the revocation of criminal prosecution in the 1960s.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet with one-minded people only under the shelter of the night?
Will I be forced to be a layborist and to hide my true beliefs?
For me three years, it seemed like hell full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who did not hide its conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only because he belonged to the conservators but also because he was Tatcher's foreign policy advisor and one of its spictors.
He almost didn't show up at college.
He despised him for the province, tinyness and commitment to the Marxist Determinist view of history.
In 1997, he adopted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not gonna be happy here," he told me.
I began to travel to Oxford from a home of parents in London, trying to find asylum among my relatives and uncontrolled capital friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his training in the forty years, there were any political views.
"But this is the best university in the world," he said sadly.
- They're not capable of that, but not in the city of drowning spills...
Even my communist friends always acted perfectly."
His moisture eyes were wet.
"Don't make any rush decisions.
I'm sure it's just jokes.
You'll break my heart if you leave the university."
I was exhausted by constant journeys to London, and my emotional protection was weak.
My friend, as well as the conservator, did not endure pressure and refused his beliefs.
The next week during the workshop, when the next teacher of history seriously called me "the enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
In the hearts of shame, I confessed that my parents washed my brains, and I called them "old fools".
The rest was short.
The last iron in the roof of my career in Oxford was judged to slap my father.
At that time, he wrote on two columns every week for publications belonging to Rupert Murdock.
My door was locked.
I didn't go out, and five minutes later my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I gathered a suitcase and sat on the first train to London.
I haven't come back.
You can call me a pussy and a pussy.
But at the age of eighteen, no one should be subject to such anger and intimidation in the school.
More sadly, it was Oxford, who not only released fourteen Prime Ministers of Tory but also hides to this day behind the undeserved reputation of the university in which equality and freedom of mind are appreciated.
"Valentino prefers the elegance of glory"
The exhibition of Valentino: Sewing Master, which opened this week in London, ABC interviews with Nati Abaskal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica and other famous Italian designer clients
Somerset House, the former resident of the Queen of England, Elizabeth I, the only place in the British capital to take the exhibition of Valentino Garawani.
Designer recognized this during the opening of Valentino: sewing master, a triumphable retrospective exhibition, which combines more than 130 high-fashion dresses created by its home for the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the history, the only character of which is "Il siñor" Garawani, but it could not be written without his estate clients.
Valentino always felt charmed by a rare and remote world to know.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, there are many personal letters and photos for the signature of the most important aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga-Han to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Shantale, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from a modest porter from the city of Voger in northern Italy to the international elite.
Being in love with the royal court is nothing wrong with it.
"They at least don't hang out their cigarettes on your brilliant carpet, as some of the beautiful pop music stars do," says Barones Fiona Tissen-Bornemica.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an unlikely master and accepts guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all liked to come in his shake in Gstaade," explains the former wife of Hainey Tissen, a close friend of the forgotten beauty like Marella Annelli or Eugenea Niarhos.
Valentino always preferred the elegance of glory.
And despite that, he is a star.
Valeria Maz, representing Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Maz remembers a charisma modeler.
Once we went to dinner to his house, it was after showing mods in the Spanish square in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, younger.
Valentino's style appeared in everything -- in every detail of his apartment, in her clothes, in food, in music.
"Each of the Valentino guests felt important and loved," he recalls the top model, which started with the modeler in 1995 during the High Fashion Week in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his escorts are real art works," she ends.
Relative parade
Garawani's life is a history of obsessions, it's love with full mutuality.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries was converted into a glamorous division of sixty meters long, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes a place of models and should defilize on the floor, the "visioners" from the grids that swim from Valentino, such as the dress Jacqueline Kennedy chosen for her wedding with Aristotel Onassass, the suit used by Monica Whitti in "Nights" or the coat of the hair and skin belonging to the empire of Fara Dibe.
In this model, names such as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Taxis, Matte-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Gabsburg are shiny.
Nati Abascal and modeler, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "forget impossible."
I remember him very well.
These were pants, shirts, jackets and winter collections, 1971-1972.
"This was the gift he made to me," said Nattie Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him for his femaleness, for his great love for women, because he stresses our beauty," added the former Duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors that he uses: they have a lot of light and they're coming to his face.
The proportion is perfect.
The Princess and the Mode Legislaire of Patricia della Jowampaola d'Arenberg can also not forget the first time she was dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have age and reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
The hour finally came at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to put it on for a holiday in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a suit of scratches, a "corsage" in a storage and a cut without a bracelet.
"It was a dream that became phenomenon," said the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is overtime," explains the Italian aristocrat, which lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her holiday dress from a modeler with "maximum care... because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a combination of memories that accompany him."
"The King of Mode"
The great final of the exhibition in Somerset House, the wedding dress of Marie Shantal Miller for her wedding with Pauls from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as called the shake modeler) to make this shelter of elephant bone colour with an incrustation of bird, twelve different types of circles and a sliff at four and a half metres.
According to a journalist, Susie Manquez, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress is the weight of high fashion at the end of the 20th century, the "return of clients from the highest light".
The "life style" of the elite has been argued for many years, now Valentino itself is its best representative.
The Cavaller of the Great Cross (the sign of the highest rank in Italy), the Labour Cavaller, the Commander of the Order of Arts and Words rewarded by the Order of the Honorable Legion, Garawani gathered as many honors as any of his client's spouses.
"My attention was always attracted to his delicateness, his calmness, his precise and perfect appearance," he recalls, "Arenberg.
Last time I saw him a month ago at the feast dinner at the Orse Museum.
He was sitting at the table with Count Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was untouched, time doesn't exist for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: Miners from Kawah-Ijena
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk life and health by dragging 70 pounds of cheese to the top of the volcano on solid stone tracks
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them, Anto Vijaya, one of 400 miners who earn the life of the serum in the Cawah Ijean volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where the silk gas rising from the depths of the Earth is stopped with air contact.
The abundant pieces of cheese, the total weight of which can reach 70 pounds, put them in two bamb trash, drops the basket on his shoulders and brings them up the broken rocky road.
Until the volcano height of 2,386 metres, only 250 metres, the exhausted trucks are required for more than 40 minutes to raise a turtle step, hard to keep the balance and carefully pinch the road to avoid falling down and falling off the breach.
They know that one incorrect step could cost them life, as it happened to a French tourist who crashed from Kawah-Ijan's rocks a few years ago.
Cavah-Igen shatterers earning 5 euro cents for each pound of cheese
Turning up, they put their way between tourists who photograph them, as if they were monkeys from the circus, and they were tired of carrying heavy baskets, moving three miles to the weights that the mining company had located a little higher, at a height of 1,850 meters.
It is a PT Candi Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has been exploiting this volcano since 1960 and, rather not to say, its employees paying 662 Indian rupies (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of serum.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to oil productions, since this mineral is widespread in daily life and is used to produce spices, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to white sugar.
"Because the standard is 70 pounds, we earn about 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each walk," Anto explains to us, which usually performs three daily interferences.
He spends three hours on each of them and eventually feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seemed to be a miser for such unhuman efforts, it was more than three things that he would earn in the field.
"The salary to miners is very high at local rates where the coffee is paid 15,000 rupies (1.2 euros) per day and the medium-month earning is equal to two million rupees (167 euros) " , explains the truck used to be a stoneman in the Bali Tourist Island.
His salary was 75,000 rupees (EUR 6,2 per day) and the station was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banjuvangi, a town near the volcano, for a severe reason that in Indonesia was the same destructive as the cheese: "I married a girl with Bali, where only hindus, and brought her to Java to accept Islam."
Anto's got astma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and he's got eyes off because of toxic gases.
At his 27 years, Anto had spent three years risking himself in Kawah Ijan, whose cheese had already started to go to it despite the existence of masks and special scores.
He's got astma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing constantly, and he's got eyes off because of the toxic gases that he's gaining the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for his dream.
"I will work for another two years because I want to open or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than an acceptable English.
This pleasant and smart young man, punished by life, could be a tourist leader, a waiter or a portier in the hotel, but instead, he does the mule work.
For the dirty wooden cabin with other carriers, it stands every day at 2:00 a.m. because the cheese continues to flow at night when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the dark.
Throwing the challenge to the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, lighting his way with a small lamp connected to his helmet, which he bought for his own money.
Approximately 400 cartridges of gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite high profits, the mining company did not mechanism the gaining of cheese for cost savings and does not provide equipment to the hosts working on their own and with such deprivations.
In fact, they don't even receive parts of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of a photo-shot collection, which, along with the incoming ticket for 15,000 rupies (1.2 euros), the guardians of this warrant take from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its men.
"It's a work for the livestock, not for humans," said Badrusin, a 42-year-old rooted carrier, who spent three decades in Kawah-Ijan since he left college.
He is able to raise up to 110 pounds, and he assures that he will endure the work as much as he can, because he needs the money for the education of his three children aged 18 to 10 years.
I'm not retiring, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the cheese burns his throat and burns his eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in the dense smoke columns, they are so exhaustive that no one complains of their severe diseases... more seriously than their usual breath problems, artross, knees, and wounds on the shoulders that have been deformed under the difficulty of the basket.
By balancing the basket on the back, Unanik can now only raise 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
He and his companions each day carry 15 tonnes of vulcan cheese, which are transported to the storage in Tamansari, over 18 miles [18 km] from the narrow trail.
"I'm not retiring, I'm not going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," said Unanik, opening his mouth wide, which lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, older, 30 years old, he also works as a cheese carrier.
The time is passing, but poverty always generates one of the most difficult work in the world: what human mules of Kawah-Ijan are doing.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singapurs accuse career, stress and housing prices and education for the absence of children.
"Singapur population needs to grow."
I'm a patriot's husband, you're my patriot wife, we'll do our civil duty and create a life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertisement of the membrane but, despite this -- or perhaps -- this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
These phrase are part of the rap, which uses local sayings like "Let's put a bao (bull) in the baker" to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency, which made this video, BBH, hopes that they will be able to draw attention to this issue in entertaining form.
His creative director Douglas Hamilton said he wanted to use the power of music so that people could fulfil their "national debt".
This thing is only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world in reproducing ourselves, so we felt that this is the subject that we should touch.
We knew that the Government was trying to do a lot of things, for example, to launch ghosts with feromons or organize quick-counting parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can to solve this problem, namely, to create a rap?
1.2 Childs
Whoever does not take it so easily, it is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year for policy to encourage citizens to be born more children.
The State Package for Marriage Pairs and Parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends pregnancy and birth leaves and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in South-Eastern Asia, also known as conservatives of its leadership and its strict public control.
The level of birth in Singapore, according to its national population office, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
Last time it was below 2 -- which was known as a percentage of replacement -- in 1976.
So why don't Singapore have more children?
Tan Vej Min, Director of the Political Division for Marriage Pairs and Familys of the National Population Office, said that the reason for "developed education" and "the broader gamma of career opportunities".
"It enabled people to have a wider gamma of options in terms of life objectives and priorities other than the wedding and the establishment of a family," she explained.
These changes in social norms contribute to the rise in the number of barriers and to the postponement of marriages and birth of children, resulting in reduced birth rates in Singapore.
In the meantime, immigration policy, which aims at a rapid increase in immigration for the resistance of population reductions, causes disturbance among the local population.
There are web sites in Singapore where there is barely hidden xenophobia for many new immigrants, especially Chinese who are criticised for low-level salary and unwanted integration.
The growth of immigration is also considered one of the reasons why the last year Ruling Singapur Party has received the worst result in elections since independence.
Following elections, there was an attempt to solve the problem, using quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While fertility declines the economic growth of the nation, tax income, medical costs and immigration policy, the Singapore example also begins to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government has made efforts not to build so little housing.
This, for example, began to affect the real estate sector.
City Development Guide has transiently controlled the number of small apartments known as “shoe boxes” that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments are very well sold on the area of 46 square meters.
Nevertheless, there is a view that they can contribute to a negligible lifestyle and deprive the stimulation of builders who want to build a large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, director of the EL Developers, said that their shoe boxes are sold much faster than spatial copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are redempted for several days, even weeks, faster than apartments of larger size.
As a result, our cash income is increasing.
Nevertheless, he recognizes that new standards give more clear orientations for the constructors that had previously been posted if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too tense
Singapore is a public city.
Although these new rules may be a step towards increasing national birthability, after talking to Singapore workers in the financial quarter of the centre, they seem to have no special effect.
"People are very tense, housing is expensive, as well as education, and that is why many people postpone it," said the young manager.
Others can have children.
"But it is important for me to have my own money and time," said another young man for 20 years.
Men and women mention their career, stress and housing prices and education as reasons that prevent them from bringing children.
So, whatever the Government has tried to incite its citizens to birth children, in regard to the childbirth, the last word remains behind Singapore.
Personal offline - personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the Dictionary of the Kingdom Academy of Spanish, it is the property of a private or “private sphere of life that is entitled to protect from any intervention”.
What is personal for a minor under 16 years?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and in social networks?
Does he understand the dangers that he is subjected to on the Internet when discussing situations that he would probably not share outside the Internet?
elPeriodico interviewed five people from ten to 15 years of age, frequent network users.
In four cases, they associated the term "me" in personal plane, and "password and user name" when they applied it to social networks.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't have loaded into post," says the 10-year-old Horhe when he was trying to explain the importance of personal on Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"It's very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he said.
In the FB, I load beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
I also have fun with my friends.
"I wouldn't share a photograph that wasn't mine or someone who acts stupid," he said.
The boy realizes that it is bad to publish inappropriate photos of naked people, crimes or to write insultable or angry comments.
Jorge assures that he knows 35 friends he's got in the FBI and nine of his Twitter folks.
Most of them are relatives.
My mother knows she has a password for one of the accounts.
I made Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just loading them," he added.
"Social networks are entertainment, I can talk to remote relatives or to my friends quickly," he said.
Without thinking, he answers that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't count with someone who recommended it to a stranger.
The 14-year-old José case is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and at last admits that he doesn't know 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something common, music, for example," he said.
The boy said that no one had been inclined to trust him or asked him for his home address or phone number.
"If I'm pressed or demanded, I'll just remove them from my account," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask after reading the Twitter recommendations.
The boy is not a stranger to experience what is known as cybermobing today.
One of my friends was blackmailed in the social network.
He was threatened and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assured.
The victim, according to José, did not delete the accounting record.
"Only included confidentiality."
Then it explains the sequence of steps to set up the account in a safe way.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would have loaded photographs of familiars in uncomfortable or confusive situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if I don't like a man or if I want to.
"Although I know it's cybermobing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marélos Porras, a teacher of English and educational and educational expert, believes that the purpose of informing children and adolescents is to be aware that the objective of social networks.
"The Internet has appeared as a tool for searching for information, but the rules of the game have changed with the appearance of these sites," she noted.
Porras pointed out that academic Mark Prenski, a teacher of education from the Yale University and a writer of the Digital Aboriginals and immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginals are those, children and youths who were born in the age of technology.
"We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning," she says.
It explains that this theme is complicated, "because we ask them to have a certain criteria of what can or cannot be distributed, published or spoken, when maturity is not sufficient for it."
"As well to be electoral, while the most important thing is to be popular for them, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she added.
The expert said that the most effective way to show the confidentiality of children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think about.
"To tell them not to do this, it is useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you like to have published a picture of you like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know that others are publishing about you?
When you sign photos from the party, do you ask for permission from other people to mark them?
And another thing, do everyone need to know what you're doing at any time?
Another point is to let them realize that they should act online as they do offline.
Rules of the same.
"Out the Internet, the person acts with respect, responsibility and other principles, as well must be in social networks," she said.
Carefulness
Estuardo Guardia, a university teacher, primary education professor and education advisor, explains the need for family heads to read social network policies well.
Under each paragraph, they have good reasons for talking to children about the prerequisites for opening the account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to spread or publish," he said.
According to Guardia, the key question is to remind children of the lesson: "Don't talk to strangers."
The Summit of UNASUR ended without the announcement of the Lime Declaration
VI the Presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the announcement of the Lime Declaration, announced earlier and theoretically signed by the family of binding participants.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI regular meeting of Heads of State and Governments of UNASUR, but the sources from the Office and the Administration of the President indicated on the main page that it would be transferred after closing, but then confirmed that at a certain point it would be published on the website of the Peruan Government.
On the text questions, they indicated that the content was presented by President Peru, Oliant Umala, during brief press statements.
The access of journalists to the Summit information was always limited.
It was only translated, in the press hall, a video of the presidential Assembly without a sound message with a "closed meeting, a sound prohibited".
A few information circulated among reporters was transmitted by the press secretaries of some Governments of UNASUR attending the meeting, but not peruanian.
The only document distributed during the day was a list of participating presidents, which caused the displeasure of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media that requested more information.
The Administration of President Peru subsequently sent an electronic message of the media with the " final declaration" of the summit, but it is the statement of Umala, not the official document concluded by the summit.
Last October, the Summit of South American and Arab countries (ASPA) adopted III and, despite the urgency of the press, the so-called Lim Declaration, which was previously declared, was also not distributed in the past October.
On the official ASPA website, it is possible to verify that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruan authorities have made sure that the transfer systems for all journalists are provided, but have limited the receipt of information.
The summit was also concluded by the joint decision of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court, which addressed the territorial dispute between the two countries.
Presidents of Peru, Oliant Umala and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, gathered at the regional meeting and ratified that they would comply with the International Court's decision, which begins on Monday in Hague to hear the statements of both parties, in the context of the accusation that Lima filed against Santiago.
"We will respect and implement a decision that will clarify the differences that we present to this international court," said Umala, next to our Chilean colleague.
" Chile was, was, and would be a country respecting international law, the peaceful resolution of disagreements, covenants and international tribunals," Piñera added, and welcomed Umalu's hands on the flags of these two countries.
The confirmation of both Presidents of their submission to the International Court was immediately after Colombia protested the Bogotic Covenant this week, which recognized the subjection to the verdicts of this international court after the decision on marine borders from Nicaragua, which it felt wrong.
The summit took place in the absence of Brazilian Presidents, Dillma Rusef; Venezuela, Ugo Chaves; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christine Kirschner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011 after the impeachment of his former President Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
The President, Oliant Umala, was responsible for the opening of the discussions in the morning and for the closure of the summit, a little later afternoon after the Lima Time.
The Chief of the State read the outcome document in which he stated that 16 agreements were adopted and approved action on 31 project among South American countries, a sum of $17 billion expected investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries will take " important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for which we extend the residential agreements".
He reported that action was being taken to improve “cooperation against civil insufficientness and against organized transnational crime, action to increase the availability of drugs, low internet access in all corners of South America and to take into account the common and effective risks of natural disasters”.
Since Europe is in the crisis, “economic unity (Latin America) should not have a triumphing basis, but should serve to expand our production framework and foresee a better future for our cities”, Umala added.
"We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 sign projects that will improve the link of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border zones... uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes," the Peruanian President said in the read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were pertaining to Peru, and limited to the cross-axis in its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two were aimed at a major connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The outcome document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its re-accession to the Union of South American nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of welfare and peace, to be united and to have a good relationship between the neighbours, was another topic emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before attending a regional meeting, which hopes to meet his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortegoy, on Saturday in Mexico, to negotiate in a respective form of sea dispute as a result of the verdict of the international court contested by Godoth.
"Sleazy tomorrow (Saturday), I may meet President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
"We shall review all these ways, not mutually exclusive, including the Nicaragua Covenant will require discussions with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Orteg, I hope I can tell him that we can deal with this most possible civilized and respectful way," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they have the presence of the new President of this country, Enrique Penya Neito.
Also, in the framework of the bloc defence summit, the branch ministers met preliminaryly to endorse the Action Plan for 2013, which aims at strengthening dialogue and unity on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the last part of the countries was suspended.
Peru has temporary presidency in the regional block.
"South America should learn from Europe on national integration: Rafael Correa
President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, reaffirmed today that the establishment of common nationality is a goal in which South America, in that case, should, yes, learn from Europe.
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the South American Union (UNASUR), held in Lima, stated to the public television of Peru that the Europeans “beat each other during the Second World War” and in other conflicts,“as now they are practically one country”.
He protected, in this context, the establishment of a South American Citizenship, which the UNASUR countries endorse.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country must be achieved, as it is already happening to the members of the Andean community, but there are still reactive sectors that want to return us back to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President also demonstrated itself as a party to the resuming of the Organization of American States (OAG) in order to reduce the influence of the English Saxon States and to take into account those who signed the Covenant of San José on Human Rights.
Those who read the lectures never take any obligations, and we, South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
"It is unexplained that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is in Washington and is financed by the United States," he stated, indicating the political asylum provided by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assanjo.
Correa assured him that he did not regret that decision, because he did not give up his principles with it, but respected his "deep values of democracy and human rights".
He added that in his time, “there were certain suspicions that the Assange would be extradicated into the third country and would not comply with the process”.
He also criticised the Swedish justice for arriving in its territory for the questioning of the alleged sexual crime, while “only the Swedish legislation considers it possible to be implemented through a video conference that could be made from the Embassy of Ecuador in London”.
Correa reaffirmed the risk of the deterioration of the physical and mental health of Assange.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived in our embassy, but the Ambassador told me he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuador head of the State.
What is really is the danger of the deterioration of his physical and mental health because of detention in a small space without the possibility of exercise in the air.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum issue provided by Assanju since June in the Ecuador Embassy in London by providing a guarantee of immunity that would allow him to go to Ecuador is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities and stressed that negotiations in London were to address the issue of WikiLeaks ' detention.
We do not negotiate human rights; we do not use this word in this case but have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities, because Assanja's lawyer, Balthasar Garson, has led a number of processes in various European institutions," he said.
And he expressed the opinion that "if Britain will provide a guarantee of immunity tomorrow, it will end."
And if Sweden, as greatly allows her legislation and as she has already done in other cases, will interrogate Mr. Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London or question him on Skype tomorrow, the problem will be exhausted.
Correa used himself to be a defender of the freedom of print and emphasized that he did not tolerate “the mediation, injustice and lies that distort freedom of expression”.
"The main enemies of freedom of printing are not corrupt politicians, but bad journalists supporting profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, he remained satisfied that neither of these journalists, " neither bankers nor burjuaz-hegemon countries dominate in Ecuador," and added that by re-elected, "to deepen the revolution for the continuation of development in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to preserve the paraguay veto in UNASUR before the next elections, argumenting that the organization " must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support the maske of legality" because "this actually destroyed the legitimacy of paraguay democracy".
The Ecuador President also considered his colleague colleague, Juan Manuel Santos, " fully justified" wish to negotiate with Nicaragua on marine borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which was found to benefit the Nicaraguan Sea Sovereignty.
This decision is currently incompliant.
This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by wishing to go together.
We have to process them together to overcome them and move forward.
He also expressed the hope of a good completion of the marine boundaries, which leads to the same court of Peru and Chile, and said that " it was right for Latin America to address international instances if the two countries had to decide, whatever difficult it was".
As a candidate for the forthcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, he indicated that he considered this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it was rather difficult."
Correa assured that if he loses elections in February 2013, he will leave public life.
In my personal way, I have never been interested in power, but in unfair situations such as Ecuador, the socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political authority.
"My political movement felt that I had guaranteed this possibly victory, so it must be recognized," he said.
In the event of victory, this would be my last time in the presidential position, and then we leave the public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
"This is a decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned the new course of treatment of Venezuela, President Ugo Chaves, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicholas Maduro, who told me he was going to the treatment that was already planned, routinely, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean the health of President Chaves," he explained.
The head of the Ecuador State participated today in Lima in the Summit of Heads of State and Governments of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
Fatality from AIDS today is the result of later diagnosis
Fabricio was 21 when he was announced that his AIDS analysis was positive.
"I'm like a deaf," he recalls the hard one, despite the whole doctor's tact, a moment.
The young man hid it from his family.
When he decided to deal with the disease himself, he wanted to know more about it, and his efforts were justified, he already noted his 43th birthday.
Fabricio is one of the " older" patients of the HIV hospital Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he was in 1994, overcome many obstacles.
He has been diagnosed with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, and in the early 1990s, it would be difficult to believe that there were too few treatment options, too little knowledge of the disease, too highly affected the illness.
So even the director of the Mexican Institute for Social Protection didn't want to say goodbye to him because he had a cut.
In other words, at the time to have AIDS was a sentence.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and to do it without a worse quality of life.
Nevertheless, without aware of their disease, many people still come when the virus has already damaged, "exhausted" their immune system, and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after AIDS appeared in the world, at least after the first statements, “the greatest achievement for the present time is that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG head of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, reiterating that this information was confirmed in April this year in prestigious scientific publication.
Infectionist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists found that AIDS was not a conviction, but the duration and quality of life depend on the extent of the immune system affected by patients at the start of diagnostic, with the best expected life in those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years, when 500 CD4.
Easierly, the above means that one who gets a HIV-positive diagnosis at 25 years of age, according to these terms, " by maintaining control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years," he explained.
To evaluate this progress, it should be recalled that the length of the lives of Mexicans today is 76 years old.
Although the mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS decreased from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), also that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since AIDS appearance.
Only in Kalisco, 255 people died in 2011 and have already been registered 187 deaths to my year; however, it is claimed that there has been widespread access to antiretroviral medicinal products since 2005.
- Why are there still air results?
Personally, I don't think it's the problem with access to treatment.
That's how I imagine, that's how things are in our hospital.
At least the last 12 years we haven't had a lack of medicine, the problem is that patients are coming very late because they don't know about their infected condition, i.e. at late stages of disease.
He stated: “The nine of the ten patients are coming when they have any opportunistic infection; what should be done to make more influence on the common mortality, so that the diagnostic is to be performed at a early stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide tests to be found massally, for all people who will ask for it.”
In their suggestion, experts and officials of the State Council on AIDS prevention in Khalisco (COESIDA), as well as individuals such as Fabricio, who have requested to verify the private lab, only motivated by his friend and despite his youth age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered by the sarkoma Caposha, a cancer tumour, which is one of the widespread complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything.
"If I die anyway, I'd better bump three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, exercise, take medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he had suffered cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of work, I travel, I have a active sexual life, but with both responsibility, I take care of myself and other people," said Fabricio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to raise his statement to those who now, in the context of the World Day of Combating AIDS, experience fear.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know whether they are HIV-positive as soon as possible, and if they have diagnosis, let them know that they can live as any other person, being responsible.
This report summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in this 2012.
Condoms on tape
The great disadvantage between health programmes and a simple citizen, believes Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalahara, who has dealt with HIV-related problem.
And the biggest is prevention.
In the areas of the task, "the condoms have actually increased, once given us one or two, now we have a hundred packages, and this is very good, but it turns out that there are those who have no access to the condom," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why do you?" It is a popular question, with acquisition and conviction, by social workers, school consultants, pharmacists and health workers who do not want to hear adolescents, assured a propaganda.
I suggest to change this ineffective distribution; so that condoms are not only behind the trailers and that hundreds of them are in machines in public toilets in places often visited by young people.
This is not a promotion of divorce.
This is not about paying for beer and motel, the Governor Emilio Gonzales replied when he was asked whether condoms could be distributed in his leadership.
"It is not sexuality; it is best to make condoms available for those who have already practiced sexual activity," he noted.
Key data in Khalisco
13.435 summary cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV) have been registered.
The State is fourth in the national rating on new and summary cases of AIDS and 13th on HIV.
92 per cent of the infections are gender path, 6 per cent through blood and 2 perinal path.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, since there are 4 to 5 people who do not know that.
Given the ratification of the United States Appeal Court of Appeal, a decision that discontinues the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group by competitive production in Mexico, the scenario sets a annual precedent for any national branch company in the neighbouring country with a problem with payment capabilities.
The procedures for supporting the survival of companies permitted by Mexican law seem not to be valid in the country of belts and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In a practical field, the approval of the decision made on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale in the court of bankruptcy of the northern district of Texas, leaves the Mexican firms unprotected against the possibility of arresting their property on the other hand of Rio Grande.
The decision, however, opens the door to the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to address the United States Supreme Court, proving three disagreements.
As an entry, while the judge notes that the creditors should be regulated by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Appeal Court of the Fifth County in New Orleans said that the main proceedings relate to the competitive production considered in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies annulment of international judicial cooperation in cases of non-payable capacity of enterprises of a transnational profile.
In fact, for this purpose, the UN Model Law on the Singlement of International Trade Law was established as an arbitration of the American Institute of Law.
Secondly, the verdict states that without inter-company votes recognized in the critical mass of competitive debt production that had been in front of the mother's company of the Vitro branch would not have been achieved a majority necessary to endorse restructuring.
Nevertheless, this opportunity is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time the scheme was adopted.
There are a half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts guaranteed the Federal Institute of Competition.
It is also true that, by reading the votes of the branches, Vitro creditors who fought it in the United States courts, namely, the funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not reach the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
The Court of Appeal declines these data.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of the difficult situation that had been faced since 2008, which was affected by a serious economic crisis that had struck the United States.
Until now, the Gonzales family firm will file a complaint to the Court of Appeal, so that the vote will reach its captivity, i.e. five judges, due to only three votes.
In the event of failure, a certification request will require a review of the process by the Supreme Court, in this case of the United States Supreme Court.
The most of the fact that the court rejected the document sent by the Government of Mexico as a amicus curiae ("second of the court"), which described the Vitro process under the Competitive Production Act, indicating that it is free from compliance with the agreements signed by the two countries to link it to article 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country was subject to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, i.e. to the rules established for inter-State non-payment cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Two-board carambols: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
General balance
In view of the postponed complaints on the table by the mexican de Aviation unions against the former owner of the company, Haston Ascarrag Andrade, who was accused of fraud, has already discovered a bottle throat by the Professional Union of aircraft pilots.
The instance headed by Carlos Dias Chaves Morino has just submitted a criminal requirement against the National Commission on Banks and Price Papers accused of impeding justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority systematically refused to provide reports to the Public Prosecutor General concerning the operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from the F/589 Bank of IXE 198 million peso on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be aimed at buying shares by the Professional Hotel Management Company.
As you know, Ascarrah Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas Hotel Network.
They're surrounded by Dragon Mart
On the weekends of the forum at the Caribbean University, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of the general civil society approved the establishment of a broad front to resist the opening of Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about the giant sales and dissemination centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean countries of the isolated country, with a housing zone close to 150 companies.
Rather, Canacintra has been able to combine the governors of the south-eastern zone to oppose monumental forces that compared with the land part of the protected territories and pose serious threats against the industry.
ACTA Death
The Government dismissed the senate requirement to explain under which conditions and circumstances Ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed the Trade Contraptory Agreement known as an ACTA abbreviation, according to the Mexican Institute for Industrial Property, this case has already been archived.
As you know, the action has been carried out, despite the disqualification of the Senate itself of the possibility of viewing it as a violating freedom of expression in social networks.
Homex in a long-term perspective
With a view to extinguishing long-term debts without affecting short-term housing building, Homex places market certifications for 500 million peso.
The release is the first of the four identical, with the proposal for a percentage payment every 28 days.
Competitiveness appears in light
The NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, the information technology leaders, the competitive trade-name consortium has just emerged, and its objective will be the market of software classers in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed 1.5 billion dollars.
Hector Hetin Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
A busy basketball traveller Hector Hetin Reyes has been associated with this sport for over 60 years, and it has led the whole world to go around.
Not a lot of people in Puerto Rico have stored as many basketball stories as Hector Hetin Reyes.
And before the brain bleeding attached him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was sunk into sport for over 60 years, as a small-category player, the High Basketball League, the authorized and the head of BSN with the Cowboys of Bayamon and the President of the Federation of Basketball.
"I have played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time as when I was President of the BSN, the Director-General of the National Team and the Federation Chairman in the 1990s," Reyes recalls during his visit to Primera Hora home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate by making that assertion.
The walls of his home, almost all the photographs and memories gathered for his long way, testify.
Bayamon in the heart
With the greatest emotions, he preserved those who remembered his way through Cowboys, starting from mid-50s as a player until 1982, when 15 years of his statement was carried out as a agent or a contract agent.
"It were my best years I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy champions since 1967 as an agent, with an agent or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five champions from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said good-bye to one in 1981, a year debute to Jerome Minsey in BSN.
Since then, it has continued to be the leadership of Cuko Ortis, who was a great administrator,” said Reyes.
I remember that Jean Bartov, who was headed here and was at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, said to me, "I have a very strong player for you, up to 6'7."
"Would you?"
And it was the beginning of Minsey, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended a sniper of Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsey brought Bayamon's championship, Gauss would have helped win one more.
I enjoyed the Championship of Cowboys with Gauss, but I was on a distance, because by 1988 I was already a head of the Federation.
By then, I preferd to enjoy his achievements and achievements in the National Assembly.
I remember the first time we won in the United States during the Olympic qualification Tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then the World Championship of 1990, where we received the fourth seat, had to be bronze if not the Canadian judge who had forced us to overcome the final game, said Reyes.
The 1990 World Championship team is the best assembly you've ever seen?
It is among the best, as is the one that won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was that the Pan-American games in Cuba in 1991 when we won gold and broke the U.S. Collections, which was quite like the one that won our bronze at the world's championship.
In that team, not only again, Minsi, Gausso, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopes and Piculina (Orthisa), but also young (Havier) Colon and James Carter, the brothers of Leon (France and Edgar) and Mario 'Kychote' Morales, who was unable to participate in 90 because of the knee trauma.
The team, which may not have been the best in personality, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic qualification Tournament in Neuken, Argentina.
With role players such as Canito Neévesa, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hurruitner, in exchange for those who were temporarily removed from the Pan-American Champion of Mar Del Plata, we won gold against all projections.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt, it was Piculin Ortis.
His indicators in international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level as Piculin did.
And it's not taking into account his career in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Portorican leader?
It's a very complicated question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melandes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From young people, I like Leo Arylla's work.
What do you think is your main achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most famous era of the national collection between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s, BSN had been up to 17 teams in the season.
What do you have to do?
There were things I wanted to realize, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, let the boys from Ponce play only in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoff.
Now the guys travel and play too much, and that's too much.
At least I see the fruits of binding certification and course for managers, officers and judges.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing now?
I'm listening mostly to music, watching musical videos of my age on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren, and I rarely go to basketball matches.
And, of course, I enjoy my wife's society, Isabel, who was always with me.
Actor Larry Hagman died.
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Wurth, Texas, became worldly known as John Ross Yuing, more known as J.R., in the Dallas TV, in which he had a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role of the Jay Ar Juing oil predator in Dallas television became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died on Friday night because of the complications caused by cancer, according to the statement of the family provided to the Associated Press company Warner Bros., the Dallas production studio.
"Larry returned to his favorite city, Dallas, playing a marking role that he liked most," his family said.
Larry’s family and his closest friends were at the Dallas shop on Thanksgiving Day.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and Sikvela, was next to Hagman when he died in Dallas' hospital, said her representative Jeffrey Lane.
He was joyful for all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, loving and talented, and I'll miss him very much.
"He was the original personality and lived a full life," Grey confirmed in the statement.
Hegman had diagnosed liver cirroz in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was found in the liver, and he passed the transplantation.
Long before Dallas, Hagman acquired acquaintance on television through the role of a good type in the light comedy of I Dream of Jeannie, translated by NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is changing when he meets the attractive girl Barbara Iden, and he starts living with her under the same roof.
He was also the primary character of two comedies that rarely appeared in the eter, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the movies included roles adopted by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it's his artistic interpretation of a remarkably disgusting J.R. led Hagman to the top of glory.
The CBS dramatic series on the Juing clan and other characters in its surroundings were broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot J.R.?", designed to create a noise around the episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character was almost killed, produced international discussions and millions of dollars risked in the booking offices.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the series at that time.
When an episode was answered since November 1980, the average of 41 million televisioners watched it and turned Dallas into a second review of the entertainment programme in history, after the MASH final in 1983, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R., Christine, who shot him.
J.R. interrupted her and then threatened her to accuse her of prostitution if she did not get out of town, but also others had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played Juing as an insecure corruption with a harismic smile: an unfair entrepreneur and a wrong husband who wanted his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Grey), to be treated.
"I know what must be on the grave plates J.R." Hegman said in 1988.
It must be said, "There is an honest citizen of J.R. Euing."
It's the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, also the hero of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as "the huge one and outside of the screen."
It is unforgettable and unreplaceable for millions of worshipers all over the world, and in the hearts of each of us who have been happy to know and love him.
The ten episodes of the new Dallas issue were shown a few months ago with great success on TNT channel.
The five episodes of the second season have already been recorded and the sixth was in production, reported the channel.
Warner or TNT have not made statements about what happens to the series after Hagman's exit.
Fort-Wuerth, Texas, was the son of the actress and singing Mary Martin, who was shining in classic works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she was born in 1931 during her marriage to a lawyer, Ben Hagman.
He tried to be happy at the theater scenes of New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the WC of England from 1952 to 1956.
When he was there, he met a young Swedish artist May Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the city of Malibu in California, where many famous people live.
In 2001 he called his memoaries "Hello Darlin": Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I have not included anything that would be able to hurt anyone or affect them in any way," he said, Prensa Asociada at the time.
After the transplantation of liver, he began promoting organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients experienced fear.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet them when they go to operations, and then," he pointed out in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like "Do not be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a little while, but you'll be okay."
He also acted actively against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
It begins to study the end of the light.
Each week students are studying apocalyptic phenomenons such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester, when the professor of religion, Stuart Sharme, decided to read the course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an unreasonable bait: the end of the " long opposite" of the May calendar, on 21 December, for which many people caught as evidence of the end of the world.
But Charme had no idea what he was expected in the next few months: a catastrophic hurricane of Sandy, a financial crisis, which some call “long armageddon” and a growing conflict, where Israel would be involved, the place where Christian theoretics at the end of time believed that the apocalypse would begin.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," said Sharmé to the University of Rutgers Camden (New Jersey).
If we analyze what is happening in the world now, as if we had only 30 days, it was a really good time.
And remember that it's bad for those who have apocalyptic image of thought.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the end of the world in this semester, theoretically the last in history.
In Temple University, Professor Barry Waker reads the course "The media, culture and the end of the world".
Each week students are studying apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas are spreading with time," he said, and the way the hypothetical scenarios suggesting certain human actions.
For example, if the nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, war can be ruined.
This month, students analysed films on the apocalyptic topics and studied how they relate to examples of real life.
"I tried to tell the students that it may be likely and impossible," said Waker.
At the main campus of the Pennsylvania University, professor of Latin America's history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amar Solari, adjunct professor of history of art and antropology, were united to read the course called the end of the world.
"We do not add '2012' to always have the opportunity to read the course again, in case the end of the world doesn't come," said Restal.
Despite the " inadequate destruction", students should learn, prepare projects and surrender the outcome tests.
In the Penn State, the final examination will be taken into the canon of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students other choices than to work " until the same night the end of the world," Restal said.
The courses were quite popular.
"The towns have ended in two hours," said Restall on its course for students with a high average ball, on which 35 students were registered.
We received e-mail messages weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked if there were rooms.
Students in turn assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old student of the Division and Socialology of Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers Camden.
And the apocalyptic image of thought, worldly or religious, is only a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Vexa, a 25-year-old student of the Psychology and Sister's case, said that he was watching all the apocalyptic movies.
"I have never heard of the course that would teach it," he noted.
I like it.
But none of the students questioned -- no longer speaking of the professor -- said he believed in the date of the end of the light on 21 December.
"Our first project affected the prophecy of May, and somehow we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, 21-year-old student of the last course at the Temple University of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; this is just a key moment in the calendar, said Restal.
But he noted that there was an apocalyptic concern in the Western culture, which was a number of centuries where people responded to changes around themselves, foretold the end of the world.
The Internet has raised more speculation.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, professor of the University of La Sal, who taught courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question whether he knows about a course on the end of the world there.
"The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world," he wrote, indicating that the above instance was ordered.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restal noted that for a long time, many days of the last court were spoken, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "the people will immediately begin to think of the next date" or to philosophy that 21 December was the beginning of the seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers are not sure about this date.
Some said they were going to go to the end of the world's party.
"Maybe I'll call one of my friends to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old colleague student.
