Black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair the railway network, many begin to see solutions in a small black box that easily enters your car's device.
The devices that follow every mile that the engineer will leave and transmit this information to the authorities are the core of the controversial efforts to Washington and the State Planning Authority to renew the aged system of financing of US main roads.
Usually, the failing design of roads suddenly boosted the intense debate and the formation of various communities.
Libertarians met with ecological groups and lobbed to make the government use of these small boxes that would record the miles and perhaps where you are going – and then the information would be used to build a tax dimension.
The tea party is frightened.
The American Union for Civil Freedoms is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of problems with the protection of privacy.
And while Congress can't agree whether to continue, some States are not waiting for anything.
They find out how they can move to the system in which the driver pays a mile of the road that he drives.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have a GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real need for our nation.
"It is not a matter of time when we can choose much," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive Director of the State Administration Association in Southern California, who plans to start tracking miles from each Californian motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology serves to do so.
The fact is that the Road Principal Fund financed from taxes that the Americans are paying at the pump stations is on the bottom.
The Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
The cars drive a lot more kilometers to one gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Because of the current high price of gasoline, politicians do not want to raise tax even for one cent.
"The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at Minnesota University.
His state recently set the tracking device up to 500 cars to test this payment system for a mile.
"It appears from a long-term perspective as the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user fee according to the number of miles.
It is not surprising that this idea is liked by urban liberals, because taxes can be used to change driver behaviour patterns, which, for example, can help reduce transport trails and gas generation.
California designers are looking at this system in planning strategies to fulfil the objectives set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But the Republican Bill Shuster (Pennsylvania), the Chairman of the Transport Committee, said that it was also seen as the most functional long-term alternative.
The representatives of the free market from the Reason Foundation organisation are also inclined to think that drivers will pay for miles.
"It is not a tax that disappears in the black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice-president for the Reason organization strategy.
People pay for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former American Transport Ministers who encouraged Congress to pay a mile in 2011.
The US Senate approved a pilot project last year for 90 million USD, which would include about 10,000 cars.
However, the leadership of the Representation Chamber rejected the proposal and made so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing the population, whose daily life often means to injure many miles away from the city.
However, several countries and cities are moving forward to their own hands.
The worst is Oregon, who included 5,000 drivers in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon start paying taxes to the state, instead of gasoline tax.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is just looking into the project.
Illinois is trying to do this at a limited extent in cars.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state ministries of transport, along with coastal countries in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change.
This concept, however, is not only a stop.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers were recently equipped with equipment, drivers were concerned that the government was able to monitor every movement.
"The concerns concerning the type of Big Brother and similar matters were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who runs the strategy and operation in the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't what people wanted.
As the test project continued, the American Union of Civil Freedoms in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to transform these devices into a full-value tracking device.”
It is not necessary to build an enormous heavy technological infrastructure that is inevitably expanded on the records of everyday exits and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada belongs to several countries who are trying to find available technology that would enable the State to monitor how many miles the cars will reach, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be more calm.
Hunt led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (real distant distance).
This company was originally not involved in the government's aid in taxing drivers.
She wanted to cross the emerging market with legal responsibility insurance where the drivers would pay on the basis of how much they would drive.
But this device that is testing attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and only provide limited amounts of information that are regularly recorded by modem.
"People will be more willing to do this if you do not follow their speed and position," says Ryan Morrison, executive director True Mileage.
In some of these pilot programs, there have been a number of major mistakes.
They're much cheaper and less intimate ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose a GPS or no GPS device.
Or they must not take any equipment and instead decide to pay the standard fee based on the average number of miles covered by all citizens of the State.
In other places, they hope that the cautious public will join this concept, if the device is capable of more, not less.
In New York, transport officials are trying to develop tax equipment that would be equipped to allow additional fees to be paid at parking hours in order to provide insurance according to miles and to collect data on the speed of other drivers, so motorists can avoid transport seats.
“Motorists will be willing to participate in this for the value of the benefits offered to them”, states the city project document.
However, some transport designers would like to know whether all the discussions on a mile paying is not just an enormous issue.
The Officers of the Metropolitan Transport Committee in the area of the Gulf of San Francisco say that the Congress could easily resolve the problem with the bankruptted Road Relief Fund by increasing gasoline tax.
Single or annual tax could be placed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not need much fuel, so they will pay the fair share.
"There is no need for radical operations when it is enough to take aspirin richly," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee for Legislative and Public Affairs.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a lot of other things.
For the CHSSD, the Saturday is negotiating.
Social democracy is being drooled, people and grandmothers talk and are planning a joint procedure.
If social democrats argue in a few weeks, they will sit at the work table with perfectly played partners who will put on the table a complete list of requirements, including ministerial posts.
The CHSSD ambassadors will then either swallow acid coalition grapes, or a kick-up for the swimming minority government.
Godslav Sabotka, after four days of his sympathy, first hit him.
Yesterday he was unable to control the political grease and primarily force the liars to resign.
Only he is yet confirmed by the negotiator, the other members of the team will be allowed until after the key session of the Central Executive Committee (EVV).
I apologize to the members of the graemy, and now even to the citizens.
There's no lie, in personal life or in the public.
"It was a mistake," said Michal Haszek, after the most rapid leadership of the social democracy.
He added that the first vice-president's post was not lying.
"I will communicate my decisions on November 10th," said Haszek.
Similarly, the Vice-President of ČSSD Zdenek Škromach and the head of the messenger club Jeronim Tajc spoke.
But he warned that he was elected two days ago.
The two ambassadors then declared that they would do everything to make the 50th Club of ČSSD sound in one voice.
He put the crown on Michal Haszek with a statement: "I'm a member of the ČSSD 15 years, I've always been loyal to her mark and respected the decisions of the party authorities."
It's another lie in direct transmission.
Or did he forget that August's RevV was 57 percent of the party's candidate for the Prime Minister, when calling on Saturday's resignation and dismissal from the negotiating team?
The Chief of ČSSD, however, has made a powerful army of enemies next Sunday by calling the OBV.
His opponents have ten days to flood e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media with a dream of various talks and fams, eventually reminding the real mistakes of Saturday's political career.
It will be very much to be washed with dirty laundry, the signs of dark alliance between the carbon Zedeń Bakala and the Sabbot Wing will appear.
A friendly relationship will be discussed by Godslava Sobotka and an influential attorney Radko Decent.
The disputes are exploding in the south-moral or sealandic organisation of the ČSSD.
The words of the island Primator and the Sobotk Alliance Peter Kainar are: "Chart 77 I signed so that the land should not be ruled by idiots."
If the UVV had met this weekend, the liar would probably be forced to give ritual sacrifices to their functions.
Traitors will squeeze their head with ashes and stay.
And the current winning chief of ČSSD then ends with the nickname Bogslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor about problems with OH in Socha: Communication with Russians is difficult
The corners of his mouth mark a smile, and then he just breathe deeply, "It's difficult."
Cooperation with the Olympics Olympiade Organization team in Sochi 2014 is a little more complicated by Martin Doctor.
What was on the last Olympics, we can forget.
"Nothing does not work the same," said the Czech chief of the Olympic Mission.
What's going on in particular?
A lot of things work slower, not exactly.
It's so confusing.
In terms of factures are relatively fast, not so much in terms of supply of information on essential matters.
For example, we've been working for three months to add us how the villages are officially marked, so that we can do a number of things according to this.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating this thing.
They still communicate in a number of things.
Is the Olympic village already delivered?
But it's no more catastrophic.
We were walking through empty rooms a month ago.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does that mean, they're empty?
Do you need the floors ready?
Just a basic concrete, so that was the condition a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even though there's a danger that on January 26th as the front, he'll still feel the stick.
And if they don't go, what's going to happen?
President Putin would think he'd force the army there?
That's exactly what it's gonna happen.
Just so that it wasn't that the Olympic village = the sunny village.
Rather, they are threatened that they will not reach a road adjustment, but do not make details.
Maybe they'll have ways in such a state that we're gonna have to take with us lenses from London games.
But I believe they're gonna put it somehow in a bunch.
How many Czech sportsmen could go to Sochi?
Now it's about 78, even if according to the nomination criteria, the number is changing.
Maybe the crocodiles are going to the trinity they've left.
There's no one to doubt about Martina Sablikova, but otherwise it's in development.
You're still waiting for a trip to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should fly there until January 26th.
As the houses are going to look in the Olympic village, we know.
We even measured some things by the meter by ourselves so that we could not believe only the drawings.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transportation.
And what does the chief of the mission do 100 days before the Olympic games?
I am preparing for an annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I am making a regular agenda in terms of communication with the organizational committee in Soca.
Putin promised an ecological olympiade, the plan is taking his giant secret puzzles.
The winter sports fans have already cut a meter to the start of the Olympic games in Sochi, others look at their preparations with increasing fears.
The Russian Olympiada starts in February, because it deals with another scandal.
The Russians are probably unable to fulfil the promise that preparations and the games will not at least interfere with nature in the Krasnodar district at the end of Kavkaz, where thousands of sports and tens of thousands of visitors will be headed in four months.
Otherwise, after the Vancouver Olympiade, the Russian latch was built very high, the Canadian games entered the history of the Olympiade as the most important to the environment.
However, it seems that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putin to organize games with "non waste" seemed to be taken for a long time ago.
Reporters of the AP Agency last week discovered a huge set of construction materials in the village of Achstir near Sochi.
So the shop full of construction materials, tyres, canysters and isolation pens found already in August, an ecologist, which they immediately announced.
The Russian authorities have disappeared.
Just for a moment.
Last week, a view of the three football games was given to the reporters.
Not the only one in the area of such places, the British newspaper The Times described.
There are Russian railways, state monopoly, which builds an approximately sixty-milemeter road between the airport in Sochi and the sports resort.
The subject, which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles, led one of the close Putin co-workers Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the railways defended the establishment of a subcontractor.
Local inhabitants are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achsther around all three months, the trucks full of waste material ride day and night.
According to experts, the waste is threatening to contaminate the local river Mimta, other streams, and finally the Black Sea.
"The water from here contaminates sociean water sources for the next ten to fifteen years," the British newspaper Vladimir Kimajev said from the EWNC ecological non-profit organisation.
The illegal stocks are not the only problem of the Russian organizational committee and the government.
The most expensive olympiade in history, the opposition is one big tunnel.
For comparison: games in Sochi will cost $51 billion, while the summer Olympiade in Beijing 2008 went up to 43 billion.
Last year, the games in London cost only 19 billion and the mentioned vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corrupt scandals, project delays and concerns if there is enough snow, there have also been reports that human rights do not comply with human rights when working on sports and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers put his mouth on the protest that he didn't get paid for two months.
Many are also afraid of the way Russian organizers conform to a new law that prohibits promotion of homosexuality during the games.
Some visitors are about to support Russian gay on the Olympiade.
A young couple grew up to live with parents, a new house offers privacy to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates has received as an assignment to propose a house on a parcel, which is located on the corner of two streets, and the land itself is considered somewhere.
The requirement continued that two generations would live in the house, which would want to live together, but each should have its own clear separate space.
A younger couple needed a little office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a mildly considerable land.
Therefore, the architects decided to place each house in one of the floors of the house.
"We respected family bonds, history and memories associated with the place."
"Thre different functions of the house are connected through an outer object, so they all realize the presence of others, but they have their privacy," explain designers.
The parent's home is at the level of garden with an old pine, which is important to family traditions and memories.
Single parts of the house are easily recognised from outside, because they differ from different final fissage adjustments.
While the main segment of the building is of concrete, whose surface was formed by panels from the boards, the part where the office is rejected is white and the remaining elements remained in a clean concrete execution without any other adjustments.
Many of the walls of the house are completely jammed, which makes the house's interior very connected with the outsider.
The home of parents, a more accurate kitchen, dining room, and living room, is surrounding a small garden with a tree that is of great importance for the family.
The interior connection with the exterior underscores the side wall that begins in the garden and continues to the living room.
A kitchen space in a young couple's house.
A young couple enters the house by the main entrance to the hall, and then goes down the stairs into his space.
The stairs are the main dominant interior of the house.
Their structure allows them to fall through a lot of natural light.
That's why the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and imprint something unique to him.
The home of the young couple is treated as one open space with a kitchen part, a dining room and a living room together.
It's divided from the terrace only by glass walls with scrolling doors.

The office itself in the highest floor is linked to a clean combination of white and black color.

Protect the academic freedoms, it's true for Zeman and OSS.
I have repeatedly called for open letters of students, teachers and high schools in several regions to protect academic freedoms from the election campaign held by President Miloš Zeman in schools.
I've met with a larger or smaller success.
Rector of the University of Masarik in Brno, who refused the presentation of the Prime President of the SPOZ - Zemanovci during the pre-election period, has even received an invitation to celebrate the Czech Republic's state holiday.
Here is a list of school representatives who have no longer been brave and visited Miloše Zeman: High Technical Learning in Brno, Gymnazium Gladnov in Ostrava, High Business School in Ostrava, Trade Academy in Colin, University of J.E. Purkina in Oste over Labe.
We are now meeting in Pardubica with the continuation of promoting politics in high schools.
Newly elected messenger for ODS, Dean of the Faculty of Electronics and Information of the University of Pardubica, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic function and it also seems normal to him.
Mr. Professor, it's really not the same as if you stayed in the office of the mayor of a small town.
Do you want to join the Cheytmans of the CHSSD who concomitantly have the function of the messenger and heitman and as they degrade both challenges?
You tell people that they can handle both these difficult functions on the left back.
I know, we have an example of Michael Hashk, who can handle even dozens of functions at once.
But it's probably not exactly an example of a person you should follow.
We will also find a opposite and positive example of the MUDR. Stephanka, who prefers to leave the post of the Messenger so that it can be fully devoted to the leadership of the city of Pardubica.
But the main reason why I recommend to leave the Dean's function is that you will violate the apoliticity of the Academic Land of the University of Pardubica.
The management of the pardubical ODS see your current action on both posts as a benefit for the university.
But your schools will be able to help you without staying a Dean.
I think the same opinion I have with the rector Miroslav Ludwig will have your students.
So consider your retreat and keep your face.
Otherwise, you may have the voters to count on you in the next elections.
And that doesn't have a long time.
In Kunovica, the bowl of zelt, the chemicals don't add to it
More than a thousand tonnes of oxygen soil they want to make in the next months in Slovakia Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé Food Group.
The season started here in October, and it's going to take about six months.
He's been making a healthy taste here since 1925 in a traditional way, so screwing directly in big dances.
In modern industrial times, it's about rarity.
Our employees find a poo for a shift of almost a dozen-meter route.
Each of the ten tanks includes 15 to 30 tonnes of grain, the filling of one takes three shifts," said Slovak Fruta Fruta David Kladroba racing director.
The heads of grains are driven to the company area directly from their fields farmers mainly from Ostrisk and Brzeclavska.
Fruth's employees then clean up the vegetable, remove the squirrels and throw them into the circle.
From there, the already cut grain falls into pools with a six - meth depth, in which they work tiredly dressed with white clothing and sticks.
That's how they're exhausting the undesirable air.
The last scratched layer of grain covers the sail and burdens with water.
"Then the green circuit rays six to eight weeks for spontaneous milk quash without any supplementation of quasifications," stressed Director Cladroba.
The natural process corresponds to production in domestic conditions, individual layers of workers spill salt and kmin.
The fertilizer travels to the line.
It is packed in sweet acid powder in bags or glasses and is subjected to sterilation.
Hamé is primarily supplied with oxygen soil to the territorial and Slovenian market.
It is also registered in some other countries, such as Great Britain, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to cooperate with Germany in connection with monitoring by the United States
Edward Snowden, an American reporter, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to submit evidence to the German Parliament unless the US National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander were able to provide answers to the questions of his activities.
German Ambassador Hans-Christian Sträbelle met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and acted with him about the possibility of witnessing in Germany.
The letter from Mr. Snowden, who was transmitted to the media on Friday in Berlin, states: “Although the result of my efforts was proofly positive, my government continues to be opposed as a fugitive and attempts to criminalize political manifestations by heavy complaints that do not provide a place for defence.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said that he believes that the support of the international community could persuade the government of the United States to withdraw the charges of criminal offences against him.
The charges raised by the Ministry of Justice of the United States include spying and stealing State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, said to Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to allow this.”
The tension between the United States and Germany began to rise when the NSA claimed to listen to Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of the parliamentary parliamentary panel who is supervising the reporting, said that if there was any opportunity to interrogate Mr. Snowden as a witness "without prejudice to the danger and that the relations with the United States would be completely destroyed", it should be done.
Mr. Sträbele, a Parliamentary Ambassador on the German side of the Greens, published a photo with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter contribution.
On their way to Russia, two German journalists accompanied him.
Mr. Sträbelle said that, according to the former NSA contract lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he once left.
If Mr. Snowden witnessed in Germany, he would need to be assured that there will be “safe”, said the parliamentary member.
Mr. Snowden, in his letter, said that he faced a harsh and persevering campaign associated with persecution that forced him to leave his home.
He said, however, that the response of the world to his “act of political expression ” gave him courage.
Citizens throughout and high officials, including those in the United States, have assessed the disclosure of an unreasonable system of monitoring of public service everywhere.
The letter includes the offer to cooperate with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved".
Killing us is sorry, but we're innocent.
Nuon Chea was number two in the Hyerarchy of Red Khmers and Khieu Samphan is the former head of the state.
In the Governments of Red Khmer, which was based on the mixture of maoism and nationalism in 1975 and 1979, life was lost because of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and execution of more than three million Cambodians, thus at least a quarter of that population.
This chief of dishonorably famous prison S-21 has granted the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia for life in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are charges of genocide and crimes against humanity including torture, slavery and murders.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by belief that they acted in the best interest of the nation and had no idea what the real scope of killing is.
"It's easy to say that I had to know everything, understand everything and then to hit and fix the situation," said Khieu Samphan in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea said that he never ordered Red Khmers to treat people wrong or kill them to deny food or genocide.
But he confessed "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to apologize sincerely to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
Fifteen-fifteen-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost 11 relatives in the Red Khmer regime, AFP said that the apology of Nuon Chea could not be accepted."
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be released."
"She doesn't care about the other," she said.
"If he didn't give orders, his subjects would not kill," she added, "the leaders of the Red Khmer are " worse than the monster."
The "foreign minister" of the regime of the Red Khmers Ieng Sary, who died this year in March, should also be held before the court.
His wife Ieng Thirith, the Minister of Social Affairs, in September 2012, the court found an unsustainable process for demention.
The leader of the Red Khmer Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is about to repay manual bags
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to 100 USD for saving the ship's manual bag.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee up to 100 USD for the hand bag and 2 USD for coffee or soda, although in their notification on Wednesday, they said that passengers would be able to keep the whole pancake.
The new manual bag fee relates to the bags in the upper storage space, so the small bags under the seat will continue free.
Frontier says that it will charge 25 USD if the fee is paid in advance, and 100 USD if passengers will wait until the gate is arrived.
The speaker of Frontier Kate O'Malley stated that a hundred-dollar fee would encourage travellers to take care of their payments forward.
"We don't want to choose this fee," she said.
The airlines began to repay the first and second baggages in 2008.
The passengers tried to avoid these fees and stopped in the manual bags hidden in the storage space as they could, so there was often no place in this area.
Payments are one of the ways to learn travelers to take less things on board.
O'Malley said that the sense of this new fee really isn't getting more money.
The point is that the most loyal customers of Frontier have made it clear that finding a place in the upper storage space is increasingly difficult.
The travellers who buy tickets on the company's website will not pay.
This means that one passenger at the front of the Frontier gate can bring a bag for which nothing will pay, while the other passenger in the front pays 100 USD for the same bag.
O'Malley said that the web sites and removal procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers learn about the fee before their arrival to the gate.
The new fee of Frontier for the manual bag will not be valid before the summer, but the date has not yet been fixed.
The travellers often complain for baggage fees and other charges, but air companies love them.
He claims that the manipulation of the bag is worth money, and the passengers who demand this service should pay for it.
Many people in Wall Street consider another baggage fee as a sign that air companies are trying to choose enough money to cover air traffic costs after years of loss.
But most of them did not reach the charges for the manual baggage.
The company Spirit Airlines first paid the manual bags three years ago and another low-investment company Allegiant Air followed her example later.
The only company that also has such fees is Hungarian Wizz Air, says the air transport advisor Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional fees.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that the company Spirit's manual baggage fee would bring 50 million USD annually.
Sorensen, former head of Midwest Airlines, flyed with Spirit recently and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers met with an unusual fee from Spirit for the manual bag.
"It was the most flexible thing I've ever seen in my aviation career," he said.
I was expecting to see a teeth scratch at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the approach went in a moment."
Frontier will also apply fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice according to the Spirit model.
Frontier stated that passengers who receive lemonade or juice can keep the whole coffin and coffee will be freely supplemented.
The water will continue to be used free.
In 2008, the US Airways tried to introduce fees for drinks, but after the complaints of the passengers from that seven months later, and no other significant airlines did not imitate it.
The last move of Frontier to repay the manual bag, unless passengers buy a flight directly from this airline, is its last attempt to direct customers directly to their website.
Aviation companies pay online travelers such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 USD for each supplied ticket.
This led all airlines to lead passengers to shopping directly from them, instead of to do it through internet travel agencies.
However, the company Frontier went to this area as far as possible.
In September, she began to give customers who bought through the Internet travel agency only half a mile within the loyalty programme.
In Wednesday, she cut the reward for a flying mile of 25 percent miles from the road.
So the way with Frontier is 1,000 miles from the Internet travel agency means a remuneration of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seats in advance only if they buy directly through Frontier's website.
Frontier's company has a faithful customer base in Denver's hometown, but its business is starting to compromise and waste money.
According to the financial results listed in the Wednesday company partner, markets decreased by 9 per cent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter.
The company of the Republic is trying to solve Frontier's financial problems by selling this airline.
For the fall of NSA websites, it does not blame hackers, but "internal error"
The Secret National Security Agency said last Friday that its websites fell for a few hours last week because of an internal error, not because of the hacker attack, as some claimed on the Internet.
“The NSA.gov pages were not available this evening for a few hours because of the internal error that occurred during regular updates," the spy agency said in an e-mail declaration.
The problem will be removed during tonight.
The claim that the accident was caused by the DDOS attack (distributed refusal of services) is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server sighters observed that NSA websites did not work at least six hours, and some users are still unavailable.
Early speaker of the NSA station ABC News reported that the internal sensitive networks of agencies were not “in any event” threatened.
The speaker said no undercover information was threatened.
At least one group of hacker activists on the Internet claimed that they were responsible for the deletion of the NSA sites through the DDOS attack.
The DDOS attacks are designed to flood target websites with information until the servers are loaded and the site falls.
This cyber tactics is relatively simple and the sense of attacks is not to enter the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA supersecret agency, which once received a nickname No such a agency, has become after the frontroom of foreign and domestic monitoring programmes in the centre of public attention and the target of the biting criticism of the total deviation of the NSA secret files from the agency and their betrayment by the former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the Agency has initiated previous speculation that today's accident was the result of a targeted cyber surgery.
Bombardier's profit has fallen as a result of the decline of supplies and orders
The Canadian manufacturer of aircraft and trains Bombardier announced on Thursday a fifteen per cent decrease in the net profit resulting from a smaller number of orders and supplies of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the train unit.
The Bombardier has also not published any air test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor has it offered current information in respect of whether this aircraft will hold an ambitious plan to start a commercial operation since the next September.
After the starting test flight about a month and a half of the plane flyed only three times and the question was whether the test phase was doing well.
The results did not fulfil the estimates and the stocks in the Toronto bureau fell by 8 percent.
The State Bank analyst Cameron Doerxen reduced on Thursday the rating of the highest profits to the “industration of the sector” with the expectation that the bureau will experience limited growth during the next quarter or two.
"While the smaller aircraft deliveries were expected mostly, the profit rates in the transport area have significantly disappointed us," said Doerxen in the client's report.
With how the test program will continue, we believe that Bombardier will receive new orders of CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders will be notified in the coming months, we assume that market scopes will grow towards this programme.
The Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft are invading into the lower market area which now dominate Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was discovered in March and after a few months delayed in September the first year.
However, the number of compulsory orders of CSeries reaches the slight 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight to verify the claims of the company concerning low consumption and savings on the costs of this transport plane.
Currently, it is total of 403 orders and obligations from 15 customers and operators.
The Executive Director, Pierre Beaudoin, expected that when the first plane is put into commercial use, the Bombardier will reach its target of 300 commitments.
The leaders also assured the analysts and media on Thursday that the programme is going according to the plan.
“The test plane has not remained on the ground longer than it was expected”, he said in the conference call of Beaudoin and noted that the tests on the ground and the software updates were planned during the aircraft's post.
Every producer plans them differently.
We decided to graduate the first flight and then focus on updates, and we did.
This will happen during the entire flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five testing planes should fly in the coming weeks and the other shortly afterwards.
However, the analysts are skeptical that the first customer could start running the CSeries plane 12 months after his first flight.
The Bombardier claims that it has evaluated its plan of putting the aircraft into operation and will provide updated information in the next months.
"This slow flight test rate -- although it is in line with the internal plan of Bombardier – will likely strengthen our opinion that the introduction will be moved to the first quarter of 2015," Doerxen said.
From 172 million USD, or 9 cents per share in the previous year, the net profit of Bombardier was lost at 147 million USD, or 8 cents per share at the end of 30 September.
The adjusted contributions to one share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The turnover marginally dropped from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to the IBES system, Thomson Reuters analysts expected 10 cents per share and turn 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft producer indicated that, compared to 57 aircraft a year earlier, only 45 aircraft were added to the aircraft during that quarter.
Clean orders fell from 83 planes to 26.
Incomplete contracts in the air division were made up to 30 September 32.9 billion, which does not change to 31 December.
"The results in aircraft were in line with our views, but the low receipt of orders and the overall market status disappointed us," said Beaudoin.
The profits in the air industry decreased by 13 per cent to 2 billion USD.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said that the profits in this division increased almost by 11 per cent to 2.1 billion USD.
Incomplete contracts in the transport were 32.6 billion by 30 September, which was compared to the marginal growth of 31 December.
The profit rate in the transport division has been affected by several major contracts.
The leaders indicated that new views will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's actions, which also announced the arrival of Google Patrick Pichette's financial director, decreased during the trade on Thursday afternoon by 8.5 per cent per value of 4.83 USD.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest producer of commercial aircraft and the closest competitor of the Bombardier, announced a ten-percent loss in the quarterly profit.
A lawyer depending on cocaine who warned the mafian from police investigation is in jail.
Basharat Ditta (42) was to communicate information to the King of the Underworld Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was afraid his drug addiction would show.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years of prison.
A squirrel defender who informed a drug mafian about a large police investigation because he was afraid that his drug addiction would turn out was convicted to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) had been suspected of the use of cocaine to Neil Scarbrough's underworld to provide sensitive information on his drug-rich investigation activities.
The lawyer whose name was "Bash" (parts) and who was celebrated criminals as the best legal representative, was arrested at his home in 2011 after the Scarborough police tracking.
Policemen saw Sarborough (32), leaving him in a lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, who was just for dinner with his colleagues from the Legal Society, three bags of cocaine.
Based on the tests in which cocaine traces were found in his hair, on his wallet and its credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular user of class A drugs.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he was trying to get injurious information about arresting two men for Scarborough and his companion.
At that time, all four suspects were monitored in a large investigation of heroin trade and cocaine in the areas of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After the police detained heroin and cocaine at approximately 1,5 million GBP, along with 200 000 GBP in cash, there were 32 others in prison.
Ditta (42) provided information to criminals because of the fear of his dependence on cocaine.
Today, Ditta, who worked with the Forbes Solicitors with the Blackburn residence, experienced a shameful moment before the Liverpool coronary Court, when he was found guilty in two cases of defending justice.
During his earlier hearing, he confessed to hold cocaine.
At the Scarborough police investigation, the lawyer's decline was found that he was in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two suspect detectives tracked, recorded his arrival to Ditt's house, and saw him put the drugs on the cleanness of 60 percent under the lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Then he was Scarborough with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium at Ewood Park, in a regular telephone interview.
The lawyer came home where he found drugs, and there was nine interviews between both people.
In the court, the drug tracks of class A were found in its hair, the wallet and its credit cards and that Ditta was a “regular user” of cocaine.
Ditta was arrested later, but he denyed the use of cocaine, and said that he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and argumented that their conversation was in “confidential communication”.
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to get some credit cards out of it, but they were all detained and taken his hair samples.
At the police interrogation he said he was running his office on both his home addresses and at the workplace, and that his clients visited him at home for work.
However, the court heard that after the key arrests, he contacted significant players in the drug supply chain, some of whom before represented to tell them what the detectives know about them.
Attorney Anne Whyte said: “Who else knows that he must not violate the law than a legal representative in the criminal area. ”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of his position of a legal representative and of getting in too close contact with a specific client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his interviews were certainly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it's gone far beyond the border of the common relationship a client's lawyer.
The police investigation dreamed as much as he could to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't bring his profession a good reputation, but he disrespected her.
He was too close to some of his clients, especially with Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be distorted.
Ditta rejected the offence and said: “If I was a corrupt lawyer that I am not, and I would like to give the information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not expect 15 hours, but I would do it immediately. ”
However, after hearing, the police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta himself became a criminal from a legal representative in the criminal area when he began to gain drugs from organized criminals. ”
His dependency on cocaine made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the purposes of the leading representatives of organised crime groups, which gave him a task to collect valuable information on the police investigation.
Legal representatives must stick to the highest principles of integrity and have public confidence and the feeling that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind his profession.
The unit for serious and organised crimes in Lancashire led against Mr. Ditt's investigation, on the basis of which he was also convicted in three cases of holding cocaine and now for defence of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bring a criminal to court.
This case should serve for all criminals as a warning that no one is out of the reach of the law's hand.
We'll find you and build you in front of our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years of prison after he was declared guilty of combining in order to deliver heroin, cocaine and ropes.
Another 35 people involved in trade have been detained to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his Ditta website, he arranged an online interview on himself, in which he said that his dreamed work would be legal to represent clients from the block of death in America, as a guest for dinner would wish Mohammed Ali, and as a motivation for work, he stated inequality.
He was negotiating government with Klaus and Spidla.
Now the people of John Casal have sent them against Babish.
People have received 14 Members in elections, that is only a third of the number of social democrats or representatives of ANO.
But, at least, they enter into government negotiations with one advantage.
In the team that has already started to qualify for possible coalitions, Jan Casal has a man who floated the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006 as a human being.
Social democrats and Andrej Babish don't have such a matador on their side.
Probably this will remind the first negotiation in 1992, when the ODS was also a whole new party.
"The experiences were minimal at that time," Casal estimates how this year's interviews will be developed.
The Kenyan press is disturbed by a controversial law on the media
"It's a terrible report and it's a place to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply disturbing the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," said the newspaper considering the law's proposal as an anti-constitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Director-General of Capital Group, which belongs to CapitalFM, one of the most respective independent radio stations and the reporting websites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be enshrined because it is a prolonged hand of the government" and that the restrictions on the content and advertising will damage Kenya's position in the world's economy.
"I hope the President will hear us, and we will ask him to reject this law proposal and return it to the messengers," he said.
According to the Day of Star, the proposal of the law is actually transmitted to the government "complete control of the media" and the Standard newspaper states that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "was injured hard," and criticised the law's proposal as "strict".
The approval of the draft law comes in the middle of a number of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the Islamic Shooter attack in the Westgate Shopping Centre.
The wrath of the offices the Kenya media turned to herself when she sent a security camera on which the soldiers were allegedly robbed by a luxury trade at the scene.
The police director responded so that he made two journalists and the manager of the media to interrogate, but the call was later withdrawn after the press pressure.
According to a new law proposal, media companies may be punished by up to 20 million Kenyan shilinks and individual journalists to one million, with the risk of “cleaning out of the list” or may be denied by the official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the property of the perpetrators unless the penalty is paid.
According to Daily Nation, “one penalty is enough to eliminate the majority of radio stations. ”
It is also stated that these measures may have a liquidation effect on what the Kenyan “live blogosphere” is called.
Politicians know that if the media shuts up, they can do what they want.
"You never know what can happen," wrote journalist Nation Mutuma Mathiu and described the Kenyan media as a key source of the system of mutual control and exports in public life.
"When we leave it in politics, they will bring the country to bankrupt and throw us back to hunting and collecting," he wrote.
The lawmakers in Kenya were the target of public critics in the past.
In May, they voted for the cancellation of the crushs ordered by the national remuneration agency and for the renewal of their fat salaries of about 532,000 non-employed shilinks per month, which is so settled to the highest in the world.
It's got to be argued, young Czechs know.
Most of them don't even know what interests
Still more Czechs give money aside.
However, they do not reach championships in the region.
Most of the money are stored on the side by the Examiners who slow the average of 181 euros monthly.
Something more than the Czechs are slow in Slovakia.
This comes from an exploration of the Erste Savings Barometr Group in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also turned out that the mood of scholars is improved and two thirds of the questioned are planning to pay more money.
While the Czech Republic is approximately in the middle of the stakeholders, in Romania and Serbia, the people of disrupting products are still very few.
For example, almost every other Serb is going to be slow at home under a pillow.
In the country this year, the number of those who have a monthly increase of higher amounts has increased.
Last month, a thousand to 2,5,000 crowns of 26 percent of respondents were put to the various kinds of dispute, which is five percent more this year.
The average monthly item in the inter-year comparison but slightly dropped to 2078 crowns.
The biggest hit among the products is the pension insurance.
This prefers 54 per cent of the Czech Republic, while three years ago it was the most favorite way to assess savings only for 36 per cent of people.
On the contrary, the interest in investment funds has also been significantly declined in the familiarity of construction arrangements, compared to the last year.
You've only been using 16 percent of the respondents, while it was almost a quarter of people last year.
The study also showed that, although people consider it important to disturb, most of them do not know what profits they make in individual products.
In particular, young people under 30 years do not know how their money is paid.
On the contrary, the best awareness of the profitability of their saved money has the oldest group asked, 73 percent of people over 50 years of age know that.
In the international comparison of the Erste Czech group, the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 per cent of people.
They follow Slovaci and Experienced with 12 per cent distance.
UN celebrates new objectives of fighting poverty
The United Nations begins to work without delay on a new file of goals which will replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), which have been introduced 12 years ago to address the world's poverty.
Before the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which started at Rio de Janeiro over the night, the Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDG, which expired in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of a document that will be approved by the world leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, during the summit.
The UN Secretary-General Mr Ki-mun overnight at the summit said that now is time to “close over national interests”.
"I am pleased that the Member States agreed to launch and take over the process to introduce the general objectives of sustainable development – SDG," he said.
SDG will build progress achieved under the Millennium Development Goals and will be part of the 2015 development programme.
I will make all my efforts to fill the mandate given to me by the Member States and implement our vision on the objectives of sustainable development that are putting on the success of the MDG.
The concerns about the safety of Mosambik are increasing due to the conflict of strong personalities
Under the Statue of Samara Machela, the Mosambian President of the founder, thousands of people gathered in Maputo in order to provoke peaceful passwords for rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, the Executive Director of the Investment Society.
For fear of the future of her country, she exchanged business clothing for a shirt decorated by "We demand security" in portuguese and joined the crowd on the Square of Independence in the capital on Thursday.
After two weeks, the conflicts between government forces and the Renamo party were reported almost daily, one of the worst fights from the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once familiarly known as the rebel movement, originally supported by the White Government in Rhodesia and then by the government of the apartheid in South Africa, within the efforts to destabilise the independent government of this country.
After the peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
The analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that the country will reappeare an open conflict, but recent events have scattered foreign investors and local investors.
A rapidly growing economy is at stake because the discovery of large coastal reserves of oil and carbon beds in the northwest can be brought by companies, such as Brazilian Rio Tinto and Vale, Italian Eni and American Anadarko, an investment worth more than 50 billion dollars.
The Ruling Party of Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo are blaming each other for an emerging tension.
The Renamo Party claims that the government has caused the last conflict by launching an attack on their members in Sofala Province, the traditional garden of the Party Renamo.
The violent attack of former rebels subsequently exploded when government forces attacked the Renamo party and tried to kill Afons Dhlakam, the leader of the group, said for the Financial Times speaker Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The government accuses Renamo's conflicts because they said they attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to mitigate his concerns about the instability.
Mr. Guebuza for the French press office of AFP on Wednesday said that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as a “husband, ” who wanted to use“ anything that remained from his power to try to prove that he could order his own decisions to the government. ”
Like Frelimo, and Renamo claims they want to avoid war.
However, the concerns increased when the words of Mr. Mazanga were quoted that the Renamo party departed from the 1992 peace agreement.
The FT list said that he meant that the Party of Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations but with seriousness," Mr. Mazanga said.
The previous interviews between these parties have made little to mitigate tensions between these parties, sighed in a number of fights this year.
It's a scarvato between two large personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), a teacher at the Open University and a expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to make the necessary resignations.
The Renamo Party, which was trying to change the elections, has already expressed that she would bought the community's elections planned for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for the next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of strength as an effort to collaborate movement to obtain advantages and financial expulsions from the government.
The electoral share of the Renamo party has been reduced since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was based on the former member of the Renamo, is expected to improve its position in elections.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza, which ends the second functioning period next year, wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
"He doesn't want a democratic system of more parties, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to release the presidential office," Mazanga said.
It is irrelevant what the Renamo Party has, but he has performed disturbing terrorist attacks on police stations and on vehicles on the key road between north and south.
Most of the fights occurred in the Sofala Province, which is a few hundred miles away from Maputo, but where the city of Beira, the ports that rely on the mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, on their exports of carbons.
In June, Rio stopped using the railway for about a week when the Renamo party threatened to attack this line.
Mr. Mazanga didn't want to express himself to the question whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted “to warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique was not good, ” said Mazanga.
Instability has increased frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many are also concerned about corruption, slow development rates and recent swimming of kidnapping.
"The people think that the responsibility for the future of the country is exclusively the government and the president and that he should be the one who finds solutions to problems," he says.
Demonstrant Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
"No one cares about either Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, want free access to roads," he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for a way of life, ” says the author.
The accounts of Thor can show that “the grave power cannot be equal to smart faintness, ” while artush legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large part of myths would “be too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene”, said Crossley-Holand, who is committed to carefully choosing works for the appropriate age.
"I think it's great that myths and human creation are already part of education," he said.
I've been on this plan for 20 years.
He added that “openly teaching ” authors and teachers are at the league stories with the“ threshold ” message for children as “exclusive. ”
Crossley-Holland, who translated from English epos Beowulf and also writes Norwegian myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Bookers, says: "You can have good intentions, but you will do better if you keep them for yourself."
Probably the greatest difference between the adult author who writes for adults and an adult author who writes for children is a sense of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or end with happiness, but there must be a natural sense for good and evil.
And it must be underconscious; revealed through a story, not openly defined.
It's the truth that it's better to show than describe.
The Brněn Starhouse will take visitors to the universe in a new Digitary
At first, it's obvious that the big planetary hall has changed in the last six months.
There is a new scene here, visitors can fall into new comfortable seats and over their heads arrives a projection area of a diameter of 17 meters in the shape of the dome from the US Spitz company.
In the middle of the hall, his most important part, the new projector from Japan.
In order to make the image perfect, there are other smaller projectors in the hall.
Another important part of the whole device is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"It's about twenty-one computers that generate a picture," said director of the Brinean starcase Jiri Dušek.
The computer will ensure that the image of several projectors is not covered, but made an impression.
"The computer vicoon is thirty-to-four times higher than the classic personal computers," the Technology from the star store Tomasz Gladnik said.
Digitarium can exclude extremely realistic and plastic model of night sky, human body or the bottom of the ocean.
The divacians are in the middle of the universe or the brain of a man.
Other similar devices are closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The star manager plans to show the purchased series and its own creation in the hall.
There are two series on the program since Saturday.
The first name is Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People will learn about the training of cosmonauts, fly into the universe, turn on the center of the world, and then on the perspective examples they will see the difficult conditions of astronauts faced in space.
The second show is for children and has the name The Magic Mountain - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of the cliff, whose pestro-colored inhabitants lived peaceful life until the explosion of a nearby soup.
The whole digitarium cost about 50 million crowns paid mostly by the Ministry of Education.
Minor amounts also contributed to the city Brno and the starhouse from its budget.
The project area cost ten million crowns, projector of twelve millions.
"The rest has swallowed audiovisual technique and computers," explained Dušek.
The digital installation followed the reconstruction of the entire building that the star store passed two years ago.
According to Director Duška, 25 to 30,000 visitors could have come by the end of the year.
We studied 11,000 INZERATES!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis took over 11,000 announcements offering workplace, of which 4300 were published in daily press and 6800 advertising (62%) online.
Thus, the Internet becomes the most important media for publicizing job offers.
In 2005, when the research was first carried out, it was 26 per cent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010), it was at approximately 60 per cent.
The performance indications of working opportunities are significantly reflecting the current situation on the labour market according to analysis.
An example can be a simple comparison of the number of public announcements during the economic prosperity period and during the economic crisis.
For example, nearly 25,900 announcements were published in the same period in 2007, which was less than half in 2012.
The offer of job positions on the Internet is aimed at a more qualified group of professions.
On the contrary, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider spectrum of professions including those workshops, the author of the analysis of Paulina Happy.
The rate of representation of selected professional groups is different in both media.
On the Internet, the front places of advertising searching for managers and managers, business representatives, programmers and financial experts have been taken.
The position of programmers or managers of small enterprises was only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, but large representation belongs in particular to service and work.
Of course, the most frequent requirements that employers express by means of an advertising offer include education.
The knowledge of foreign languages, in particular English, was included in the following areas that were monitored.
In the daily press, the request for knowledge of foreign language was stated in three per cent of the advertising, on the Internet in 37 per cent.
Only two per cent of the employer's advertisements demanded active knowledge of two foreign languages.
The claims for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 per cent of the advertisements (in daily printing 11 per cent, online in 57 per cent).
Practice in the field was required in 54 percent of the advertising.
Practice requirements are linked to qualified professions.
In particular, it is the leading production and other managers.
In the workshops, it is particularly related to mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and food manufacturers or electrical device repairers, complemented by the author of the study of Jiří Tillner.
The employees shall also in the middle of their advertisements specify the requirements for the qualities and skills of any applicants.
As the most frequently required skills, in the first place, communication skills have been shown for a long time.
In addition, employers require flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, individuality, responsibility, organizational capacities and reliability.
Ben Greenman: The tenth anniversary of the New York festival of comedy: New Yorker
It could be claimed that New York is a place where the solo comic show was born in America: nearly a hundred years ago, a variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as Chairman of the theatre at the Broadway Palace, began to tell the people with jokes in the interview method.
Fay's innovation has expanded over the years, most newly through the New York festival of comedy.
The festival founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Institute of Solid Comedy Carolines, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – together with more than sixty shows in small clubs and big theaters.
"The majority of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful to the extent that they were too large to play in the club," said Hirsch.
We have created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the show of Wandy Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes" (Stand Up for Heroes), the annual musical comedial beneficial show in Madison Square Garden, where other people will appear Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
As this festival expanded, the world of comedy has spread.
Several comics attended this year's festival came from non-tradicial channels such as show in smaller radio and television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll screwed up with his sitcom (sweet pixant "League" on fantastic-football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedial show at the Comedy Central Station.
Jenny Slate was a member of the program “Saturday night live” and “Parks and recreation”, but mostly celebrated with a rapid series of videos “Marcel the shell with shoes on” (Musle Marcel in shoes).
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comicles with clearly recognised voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, racial, racially focused on W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest Festivals will be the interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a solo comic, but he became a successful television and movie director, as well as an informal comic historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he held a TV show called “Sit down comedy with David Steinberg”.
The meeting takes place in the Town Hall in the center of Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedial DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he's walking a street between two buildings, and he says, "Oh, man, if I lose all the money, I might live here."
Oil price was further declined by 96 dollars for a barrel
The price of oil continued to decline on Friday, as the high supply concerns exported the report that showed the strengthening of the Chinese industry's energy hunger sector.
The American oil indicator for December supplies during the late morning dropped in the European electronic trade in the New York Trade Bureau by 14 cents per $96.24 per barrel.
On Thursday, the decline of 39 cents and the October remained by 5.8 per cent.
The wealthy stocks of oil in the past few weeks have burdened the price.
The Ministry of Energy in Wednesday declared that US stocks have increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, the supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday, two Chinese production reports showed a greater demand for growth in the activity.
This suggests that the economic recovery of China after the growth, which after the past two weak decades risen to 7.8 per cent in the third quarter, could continue to increase.
Ropa Brent, indicator for international oil used by American raphineries, fell on the International Trade Bureau in London by 26 cents per $108.58 per barrel.
Not that, Mr. Hask.
We have a unique opportunity to tell the politicians that it's not like this.
It is necessary to develop such pressure that Martin Haszek will be rid of all political functions and leave the messenger's mandate.
Any other solutions will reduce the level of political culture that is already so miserable.
Martin Haszek is protected by the promise that he has made, but everyone and the politicians must especially be aware of the consequences of that promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that the politician has (Mr. Babish has also the material, but it is a question of whether it is politics).
The better program by the liar is unreliable.
In politics, he's not excused, he's departing in politics.
Mr. Hask, if you mean that well with this country (and your frequent statements fortify me in this, so if you weren't lying - here you see how complex it is to lie), you will leave politics alone, as a man.
Then people will accept your apology as an expression of a man who has made a mistake and bears responsibility for her.
Otherwise, you will be viewed as weak, whose words or acts cannot be trusted.
Either you want to be proud, being a missing man, or a lifelong sketch.
Perhaps it seems unfair to you only, but you are the leader and they are just the wrong sheep.
And you're the leader and you've always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to close your ears for a while, overcome your powers, get out of this shame, and then attack again, but that's how participants are acting.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes, an alpha male, so behave.
Take responsibility and leave politics.
The Court has blocked regulations concerning the stop and search of persons by the police department in NY
The Federal Court of Appeal blocked on Thursday the judicial Regulation requesting changes in the stop and search of persons in the police department in New York and the judge cancelled the case.
The other US Federal Court of Appeal said that the decision of Judge Shiry Scheindlin would be postponed until the appeal decision the city filed.
The Judge decided in August that the city broke the Constitution by carrying out its stop and questioning program.
The city of its conclusion and its correction of the Regulation considered, including the decision to provide supervision that would help the police department to change its procedures and its educational programme associated with them.
The Court of Appeal heard in Tuesday arguments for the requested delay.
The Court of Appeal said that the judge must be revoked from the case because she had encountered a conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, by not acting in accordance with the requirement of the judge, partly because of the series of interviews with the media and the public statement, which she openly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge decided that the police officers violated the civil rights of thousands of people when they wrongly focused on black people and Spanish within their stop and search programme.
She established an independent supervision to monitor major changes, including reforms in procedures, training and supervision, and ordered the launch of the pilot programme to test the body cameras in certain areas where the most common stops occur.
In August, the city of New York agreed to terminate the method of storage of names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after the police search.
The oral reason for the revocation of the city is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
Tactics for the stop and search of persons criticised a number of protectors of civil rights.
In a certain form there is a stop and search for persons for about a few decades, but the recorded examinations under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg dramatically increased to the record number of 684 330 in 2011, most cases were black and Spanish.
In 2004, four men who belonged to the minority, the complaint that became a case of a group of lawsuits.
The applicants of the change in the stop and search of persons carried out by the police department in the NY argue that changes will cease unfair practices, increase confidence and efficiency of the police community and may affect the way these procedures apply to other police departments.
The opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morals, but not crime, and that the money is screwed out, but it will not solve a wider problem when the police congregation is under pressure after its numbers have been reduced by thousands of people over the last decade.
The judge noted that she had not completed the practice of stoping and searching persons that are constitutional but reformed the way the police department conducted in the NY.
Five Shopping Centers deal with low visits
This is based on the data of Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In Prague Boginic, the public opens the Krakov Trade Centre, will be the 19th Prague Shopping Center.
There are now 90 large business centres in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance approximately 20 percent of the medium and large centres.
The main problems are inadequately large centres against locality and bad layouts, that is too much of the floors or complicated and inconvenient passage arrangements, if possible, dead places of the centre," said Michal Sotak from Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about five business centres are facing low visits.
Among the main reasons include the mixed traffic availability, low income category of local inhabitants or the oversaturation of the market in the given place.
Some projects opened almost fully, but their results were primarily unsatisfactory at first.
Today, customers are quite conservative and do not like to change their shopping customs.
The new business centre must more strive to "take" its customers into new marketmarks, entertainment, services and marketing activities," Samadi added.
Shopping centres are generally stable, even in some centres, because the rentals were willing to relieve from the rental and rent some units in the crisis.
"But it is true that some projects, which are not fully busy and the average employment, have recently been opened (e.g. Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Shantawka in Olomouca)," Sotak added.
Trade centres opened in the past two years are promoting very slowly on the market according to Sylvia Samadi.
But there is a place on the market for new projects.
The number of seats suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague, we see a place to build a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly a place on the market to build smaller local projects called 'convinience centres' focused on shopping and services of daily needs for the population living in the immediate environment," Samadi said.
According to Sotak, there is also a place for other shopping centres on the country market.
And it's both for small 'servicing' centres, for big projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or enlargement in regional cities.
"The places such as Kladno, Czech Budjejovice, Brno or Plazin have space for further growth," Sotak added.
In Prague, there is a place for the prepared business center in the Victory Square, and he believes they have a clear potential of the street on the Prikop and the Václava Square.
"Intensively the expansion of retail parks that allow traders to cover and expanse to smaller cities for favourable rental and operational costs, the space is also in some locations for smaller local or sitting shopping centres, respect for their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of Prior business houses that come from a good location," Dita Cubanková added from DTZ.
In Czech Republic, 90 modern shopping centres are currently located with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of rough rental areas.
A quarter of all these shopping centres are located in Prague.
Between 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of renters, nine of them are in Prague, are based on Incoma GfK data.
In the number of shopping parks, the CHP is under the EU average, compared to the values of Britain and France, the Czech Republic remains about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson broke into the phone to check the tip.
The former editor of News of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson reportedly used the methods “invading into the phone, watching and confrontation” to confirm a fake tip on the love relationship involved by the Minister of the Interior, Charles Clarke.
State representative Andrew Edis at the Old Bailey Court said that the News of the World caught false news in May 2005 that Clarke was seen with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The papers authorized a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, to break into Pawlby's voicebox and invade in her private, but it sounded like Coulson called her and left her voice messages.
"The state representative suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a man standing in front of the house and hopes that he will catch people outside, but a man who loves to survey stories to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He said the NotW newspaper used three ways of studying stories: breaking into the phone, watching and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Apparently he knows about the other one, watching, he needs to know about her.
What about the first one?
Does he know about breaking into the phone?
He says no, we say, "But sure he knows."
The romantic relationship between Clarke was first caught by the New York News Division, when the source of sexual interest to Mrs. Paulby was said: “You're only wasting time, it's with Charles.”
The record with voice messages taken from her phone at at least three occasions was obtained in Mulcair's house in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on the computer of a private investigator, where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projects".
During the investigation of Mrs. Pawlby, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls in which Paulby was asked for information, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief rapporteur Neville Thurlbeck and former rapporteur James Weatherup monitored the monitoring of Mrs. Pawlby movement.
Coulson left her a voice report on June 18, 2005, in which he told her: “I got a story that we are about to give tomorrow, and I would like to talk about with Charles. ”
Mr. Edis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was according to the same model as other important personalities, including former Minister of Interior, David Blunkett.
The court said on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett because of the lovely relationship with a married woman, while he himself was seeing a co-affictioned Rebecca Brooks, who was married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks denied association with other persons in order to break into phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to break into the phone.
The NSA disclosure increases the social paranoia of monitoring by the State
One peaceful day at the end of August, the German police helicopter struck over the US Consular Office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
In the direction of the Social Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German Home Reporting Agency, the mission aimed at acquiring photos of the roof of the US pre-filled guard, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
The German media claims that the BfV Authority was hoping to identify the presence of interrogative antennas, and this action launched an exchange of views between the US and the German Foreign Minister in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Rapporteur, again in September insisted that the United States did not use their foreign rapporteur's options, “to steal trade secrets from foreign companies in favour of American companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, who became a co-worker, began to reveal his valuable collection of secret observations to the United States, the European Government and the front businesses, they don't know if they should trust the words of the director.
Following the reports that the US National Security Agency has been spying in the Brazilian oil company and has obtained access to data available by American cloud suppliers, including Google and Yahoo, has reached a general paranoia on national monitoring of new dimensions.
The last drop came with the discovery that Angela Merkel's phone may have been listening for ten years.
If the target can be the most powerful person in Europe, they are certainly the potential targets and the front businessmen.
Snowden has reviewed intense cooperation between US rapporteurs and companies.
I would say it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefits.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, representing small and medium IT companies in Germany.
According to the study issued in July by the EY Advisory Service, the German companies are convinced that in the case of industrial spying and stealing data, the USA is now the same risk as China.
However, there is no evidence in the entire documentation revealed by Mr Snowden that the United States has transmitted trade secrets to foreign companies to their own companies.
Politicians expressed concerns that the EU lacks certain skills in the field of IT and the Internet, and said that it should try to limit its dependence on the United States:
The front businessmen are skeptical about this.
The German Parliament calls on the votes that we should make a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again...
This is not a way, says Hasso Plattner, President of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he shouldn't have died 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is intacted, from car to car and farmer.
Everything except the IT industry.
The scope and technical development of American spy agents discovered by Snowden is for some companies who have already felt that the largest danger of monitoring is China, however shocking.
There is a big turn in cloud calculation technology, where European representatives in a wider range have realized that the data stored in the United States fall under the jurisdiction, which is why they are potentially attacked.
According to an examination carried out by the trade community, Cloud security alliance approximately 10 per cent of non-American members after the United States Prism disclosure of the data transfer programme has cancelled the plans for the use of a cloud supplier with the US settlement.
Jim Snabe, one of the Director-General of SAP, says: “We have a new question for customers who hadn't been here a year ago - where my data were stored and you can guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German high factors argue that the latest reports are just confirming what they already knew: that the powerful States want to dissect their most valuable secrets and that data must be protected at any price.
That economic spying is not a surprise.
It's always happened.
"It's a major theme for years and it has not been significantly changed even during the current debate," said Kurt Bock, Director-General of the Agrochemic company BASF.
The Americans are being spying on us at business and industrial levels, as we are doing a spying on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
The supervisors generally don't want to praise with anti-arrangements that they made to avoid the attacker's advantage, if possible.
In the case of large companies, it has long been reminded that free-free USB disk or leave the unsafe laptop in the hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the car office Audi, says that for many years it is common practice to collect prior to the meeting of the mobile phones so that they can not be used as a hearing device.
The German Office of BfV advises managers to consider whether to use simplely pre-paid mobile phones on foreign roads because of the risk that smart phones can be failed.
Pre-paid mobile phones will be dropped.
However, there is concern that small and medium enterprises will continue to be hacking and monitoring vulnerable.
In Germany, many of these companies in their specific areas are the leaders of the global market.
“The small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experiences, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against the unauthorized approach," he warns in his BfV report.
The United States warns its own company from economic spying from other countries.
According to Washington Post, the National Intelligence Estimate papers stated France in February next to Russia and Israel in the second series of perpetrators who are involved in the hacker activities for economic rapporteurs, right behind China.
The German Non-risk company member concluded that economic spying “they are the worst of the French”.
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French Internal Rapporteur Agency of DCRI, said this month in one of the interviews: “Service knows quite well that all countries, even though they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies. ”
The parents of a minor boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe that he was murdered.
The parents of a teenager boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside the rival spirit in his high school, believes that their son was murdered, the family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdo, Georgia, on January 11th, was found desperate in a balanced spirit behind tribunes in a gym school, where he was going.
Sheriff's detectives from the Lowndes County have concluded that Johnson died unfortunately, but the family of the 17-year-old young man refuses.
"They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered," said for FoxNews.com lawyer Benjamin Crump, representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson.
They never believed he died as sheriff said.
"They are convinced that it resists logic, physical laws and healthy reason," Crump said.
They believe that it is to screw up what really happened to protect a person responsible for their son’s death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school, and he returned to their dead bag," he said.
State representative Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting a regular investigation of Johnson’s death, and noted that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a result of a crime?
he announced Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll watch the facts, no matter where they're going to take me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for common investigation," he said.
Moore informed the journalists that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson died as a result of “local suspension. ”
But the second autopsy according to Moore indicated another cause of death.
"There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if in the case of Johnson's death, there is enough evidence for a warrant to investigate the crime or violations of civil rights, the FBI will request and its implementation.
The Deputy Sheriff's Office of the Lowndes district was not available for any comment on Thursday.
Judge from South Georgia, in the middle of the office, ordered all the videos from the cameras that the investigators examined.
Youth parents hope that video records will contain a lead to discovering how their son died.
CDC Centre issued directives for schools on allergy in children
In the middle of the Centre for Prevention and Control of Diseases (CDC) issued a set of directives to assist in children's food allergies in school.
This is the first set of directives that the US government has issued because the number of children of school age suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One of 20 children in the United States is allergic to food.
The CDC Centre found that food allergy increased between 1997 and 2007 by 18 per cent.
The directive contains information for schools about how the teachers and staff to inform children's food allergies and how to respond to allergic reactions if it occurs.
It also recommends that schools have adrenaline – most often used an automatic injector of EpiPen – be able to respond to potentially dangerous sensitivity.
National legislative authorities have recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline easier.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms appearing in conversations with children with allergic reactions.
The child may say, “It's like someone fucking my tongue, ”“ I feel like I have hair in my tongue ” or “I have a tongue. ”
Parents of intersexual children can choose "indetermined sex"
Germany has become the first European nation who recognizes the third sex in children born with unclassified sexual structures.
The newborn children will no longer be classified to either male or female sex.
The new law does not require any gender for such children, and allows them to mention sex as “indetermined ” or“ unspecified. ”
The aim of the law is to stop pushing parents to quickly decide for their child’s operations in order to designate sex, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersexual.
A intersexual person according to BBC after many years said: “I am neither man nor woman. ”
I'm going to stay a salad created by a doctor, crushed and blurred.
It is estimated that 2,000 children are born every year, which is not either a boy or a girl.
They are intersexual, part of a group of approximately 60 facts that fall within the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, which cover the term for those who have atypical chromosoms, sexual irons (eggles or warlates) or unusually developed genitalities.
Intersexual could have been Wallis Simpson.
Self-determination is not fully understood yet, but most experts in the United States say that if the gender cannot be defined, it is better to use the best available information and to determine them, instead of waiting and monitoring the psychological and physical development of the child until the operation is carried out, if any.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-determination problems, said that the new German law “seems like a good thing. ”
Intersexual children represent ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in life a threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children do not," he said.
Self-determination can be performed without an operation and then can wait for the identity to be developed.
Knowledge of how sexuality develops in the child is not too accurate.
No one can answer the question why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are homosexuals.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not related to sex, but to their biological building, which is not exclusively either male or female, but typically composed of both and cannot be clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics may be displayed in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair rise, pearls and characteristics, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and sexual structures, or in the structure of chromosoms and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of discrimination experienced by intersexual and transsexual people in the field of work, as well as levels of burden, violence and prejudice.
Guys who don't match any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowed to mark adults in official documents of male, female or “third sex”.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian woman, became the first worldly recognized “without sex” in June when she won a court appeal so that she could keep the status of “indeterminable” sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of Interior, German passports will have other than M (Man) and F (Women) and third mark, X, for intersexual persons.
In neighbouring France, the report on France 24 gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from this strongly Catholic country signed the petition for the elimination of “theories of sex from school books”.
The American Catholic websites online also defined the German law and wrote: “When the world is attracted to a new state, when sex is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not, we turn two more civilization pillars into a bunch.”
A newborn mother from Maryland also told the Baby Zone that she would prefer to see her children assign sex at birth.
“Parentalship itself is stressful even without other restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child”, she said for the web sites relating to parental care.
Children need stability and security.
Historicly, children with male and female gender were called hermafrodites, according to a beautiful Greek, who had a double sex.
And about ten years back, the medical community thought that sex was something like a table that could be deleted and drawn again.
But now many doubt the ethical basis of the operation with the fact that sexual privilege is a complex matter and sometimes doctors can decide wrong, because they don't know how children will feel when they grow up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, but a surgeon.
The persistent theory about how to deal with children with an inexplicit sex was presented by Dr. John Money at the University of Johns Hopkins, who believed that sex was subject.
He created a new term of “sexuality” and argumented that social causes and influences of the environment — as parents raised their child — affected children’s genes and hormones and created a child, regardless of whether it was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case of 1966, known as John/Joan, his theory became a dispute.
To the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged because of the wrong circumcision, he recommended that their child be completely castred, removed his warlates and raised him as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful conversion case, but the fact was different," Drescher said.
When he was 15 years old, he let him reoperate on a boy and marry a woman.
But when he was 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some physicians use "tento model" to date.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these surgeries have arrived “in dissatisfaction with the result. ”
It was also a case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes, but inexplicit sexual structure.
The physicians were not sure if he had a big clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man he could never live “the satisfactory life. ”
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed from outside authorities and warlates and raised as a girl.
When he was 12 years old, he got female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," ABCNews.com said.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At 18, he was sent to a whiskey plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was scary.
After I was born, I was sterilized and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with gender development disorders (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone so that its sexual structure could be developed properly.
After he learned the truth, he turned back into a man, took the doses of testosterone, and had to remove his pearls,
Operations caused his inferiority.
Today he represents other in the organization called Interface Project and seeks to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the Advocate Advocate Advocates for informed choice (advocates of informed elections) with the headquarters in California, is afraid that the German law is “urged for ceking and stigmats”.
“Mnogy activists are afraid that the German law will encourage parents to make quick decisions and choose “indeterminable” for the child,” she said.
We're afraid that it encourages intervention.
We think it's better to allocate male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law eventually sounds, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because "he allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex".
"The adults should be able to make their own decision on legally valid sex," she said.
The German law is about to allocate it at birth.
That's a battle that a little child should not be invoked at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a chest layer from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with sexual development disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law would "fail" both to parents and children.
The daughter of Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but DSD is called an unsensitive syndrome for androgens.
Because her androgenic receptors are defective, Katie's women's characteristics have developed.
He's got a vagina, but he doesn't have carpets and eggs.
Now, 29-year-old Katie is married, and in the context of the University of Pennsylvania, she works as a child psychiatric intern.
Although she is inferior, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or replacement motherhood.
"The law will give parents a place to avoid rushing their decision," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do some tests and think about it and gives them time before they write “husband ” or“ woman. ”
In this regard, everything is fine — you raise your child and love him.
You have a wonderful child and you're happy about it.
You don't have to rush with an operation that's unbackly.
"It brings an opportunity to involve both the child in decision-making and takes away the anxiety that parents bond because they are uncertain that they are doing the right thing," she said.
Finally, the child decides what sex he is more identical — and that is a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drunk poured the whole house with gasoline: He threatened to burn it with his own family!
The tension grew up, the fear grew up.
The man started threatening the whole house to burn.
Instead, all available police patrols in the area, as well as a firefighter unit from young Boleslava and a voluntary firefighter.
The police negotiator also arrived, trying to talk his irrational behaviour to the man.
The man kept threatening the house to burn.
So the invasion unit had to come into the house, which distorted and bound a man.
The aggressor then ended up in a study in the youth of Slavic hospital from where he was transferred to an anti-alcohol station.
Eventually, the firefighter's petroleum house was sucked with a sorbent that they later cleaned up.
In addition, all domestic animals were saved from the house.
The man didn't give the police negotiator, so he got his command.
Report: Obama's campaign considered to exchange Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisor of President Barack Obama, according to the New York Times, was secretly considering to replace the candidate of 2012 Vice President Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton.
This discovery is the most important sensation of the unhealthy expected books on the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times has obtained a copy of the arrival book and announced on Thursday night that the president's top colleagues organized intense group meetings and research to assess whether relief from Biden would help to restore Obama's bleeding hope for re-election.
According to a national-politic writer for the magazine Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of the leaders within the campaign and in the White House, namely the former Chief of the White House of Bill Daley, to measure the effect on elections of the former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Clinton to the post of the Vice-President.
The potential change was a strictly preserved secret within the Chicago's campaign infrastructure and within the Oval Workshop.
Only a few President's closest advisers -- including Daley, former head of Obama's campaign Jim Messina and former major advisers in the White House of David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew that this change was considered.
The Double Down book states that Daley was a representative of the effort to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to take this move, when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would "Obama's chances would significantly increase".
In his interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration really considered the replacement of Biden Clinton.
"I was intensely exploring a number of things, and this was one of them," Daley said.
Don't forget that the president had horrible expectations at that time, so we said, "Christepan, what should we do?"
While Daley characterized research as “suitable care”, Martin told Anderson Cooper from CNN that the re-elected campaign had made a lot of investments to determine whether this move would be worth the elections.
"The campaigns do not make such money for elections and quality research if something is seriously not considered," said Martin to AC360.
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told the CNN that Daley asked if his boss knew about this potential card mix.
While Daley said that he didn't think that the president had a potential change “conscious”, the former head of the office confessed that it was“ possibly ” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double Down" definitely does not answer the question whether the political sonda reached Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the research on Biden's exclusion from the candidate.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British entrepreneur made the first ice cream that shines in the dark - using meduza.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of this seafish animal and developed a lightweight pample.
He came to the idea when he read a professional medusion debate, and convinced the scientist in China to chemically produce protein that causes lighting.
This ice cream reacts with consumer language – increases pH levels in protein and then causes its radiation.
Chris says that ice cream lights when heats your mouth, so the more you lie, the clearer the shines.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious" (lick me, I taste great), says: "It's an amazing substance, but as far as it comes to production, we're at the beginning, so in 200 GBP you'll get about 2 g of this substance."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your language in neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms the protein, pH levels are rising, and ice cream starts to shine.
We've tested it over the past few months and it seems to be a great idea for Halloween celebrating, because it causes this fantastic bright effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because the lighting of the medus is four times more expensive than the gold.
So I'm worth about 140 GBP.
But it tastes great.
Charlie's experimental company with a seat in Bristol is known for its untraditional taste of beer, cheese, beef and gold tickets.
His next product should be even more ambitious.
He says: "I would really like to make an invisible ice cream."
In fact, it's impossible because of the light caused by ice crystal that makes ice, but I'm counting on some way to do it, we'll find it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of the meduse artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat sweets, stay awake long and show with our neighbors in a dress.
I feel like I've become a guardian today.
Two years later, the sugar showed up in my apartment, and it probably won't be different this year.
However, the statistics show that I am black sheep, as to Halloween.
According to the National Poland Federation (NRF) this year, Halloween will celebrate most Americans – in fact 158 million of them – and will spend a total of $6,9 billion for sweets, costumes and decorations.
But every time I look forward to Halloween, there are trends.
According to NRF, $6.9 billion is expected to be 1.2 billion per costumes.
This year, they're the last shot of fashion sexy inlive objects.
Sexy must not be only women anymore; sexy can also be like pizza, hamburger and corn.
As for men, I'm expecting that through the passage of the dead we'll see a lot of zombies, and I bet spacemen from Daft Punk will get it into our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most searched zombie costumes, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes, and we were not the only ones to my surprise.
In fact, the Americans according to the NRF will spend this year 330 million dollars on costumes for animals' loves.
So he'll see a lot of funny dogs.
As for sweets, we're not wasting time.
According to Nelsen, the Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
It's approximately 300 million kg of Hershey tables, lizards, sweets Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark Tits.
This is an amazing report for 41 million Christmases who, according to the U.S. Trade Department, are about to rape our quarter.
In fact, we'll buy during Halloween, and believe me, and we're consuming, 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Association of Sugars around Halloween, almost 16,000 tons will be sold.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candy.
That's the secret I've never solved.
Nothing is more typical for Halloween than scary houses.
They have the best names, such as "The Terror behind the walls" (Hroza behind walls, which is, by the way, real prison) "Howl-O-Scream" (eco, rice) and "The house of shock" (Home of Shock).
In fact, there are officially dedicated 1200 scary homes in the United States, which, according to the American Scary Houses, have a profit of $500 million, including those amazing photos on which you are freaking fears and your friend will give them to Facebook, and you can't remove them, and the person you like, will take a look at the photo and write a comment like "fitting face."
And eventually, there's little more about bowls.
Since we were little, Charlie Brown presented us a big pumpkin (Great Pumpkin) and the cutting of the soda lamp is something like a decoration of the Christmas tree – we're doing it since we were little.
Fortunately, for us, the trend of "baby in the pump" started with the Pinterest application only last year, so most of us grew up on the cutting of the tickle instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the United States People Counting Office, the Americans will spend approximately 106 million dollars for the poultry.
Ding lamp with a flamming flame on your front veranda probably comes from Illinois, where this year has grown 245 thousand tonnes of oven.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Matisdon from Napa City in California and try to cut their soap weighting almost one tonne.
Notified series of race land Rovers
The interior has race seats and six-point security belts and intercommunications devices.
The selection is improved brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and storage of the vehicle between individual races.
Drew Bowler, technical director Bowler Motorsport, said: “The races participants who come to Bowler have changed. ”
Not all are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure, and also the achievement of the world class races.
We are glad to offer them this trip in collaboration with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience various race disciplines in Britain and invasion, and that it will prepare a competitor for the hardship and reality of races of Rally Raid.
Defender Challenge's car development we really enjoyed – it will be a really exciting competition.
In February, Defender Challenge will offer a school and testing day, as well as a chance to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: In two years we have early elections here
The President of TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg expects further early elections to be nearby.
A week after the last interview for Current.cz said that another exit was not and every government came out of the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible blind.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg with the time of life starting the election period estimates within two years.
With the objection that the voters are barely different, they do not agree, "I think it will be a little more balanced decision."
At the same time, the President of TOP 09 does not accept that his party could still lose voters in other elections as this year (for 2010 it lost about 300 000 votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it was clear in two months that the preliminary elections would be, it would strengthen the movement of ANO 2011 Andrea Babiša.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babish will lose.
The turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where the President of Godslav Sobotka, after the secret last meeting, part of the leadership of the party, declared that he, or Michal Haszek, will remain in the leadership of social democracy, commented on Schwarzenberg after his:
"The leaders of the Democratic Party as little boys go to the head of the state to allow them to turn into a country."
"I thought Mr. Haszek was more intelligent and more intelligent."
"Because I have not seen something so unexpectedly badly done in my life," President TOP 09 added.
And in the direction of President Zeman (with which he encountered in the fight against the presidential function) he crushed: "The role of the head of the state is clear: He wants to make it possible."
The first laws have already been submitted by TOP 09.
What was the greatest surprise of the elections for you personally?
ToP 09 has already submitted its first proposals for laws in the Charter, including the Faroe Register of Contracts, which had been discussed before the elections by the Chambers, but with the early elections he fell under the table.
The President of TOP 09 in an interview for Currently.cz claims that such speed is given by "this laws are needed".
At the same time, TOP 09 obviously wants to prevent similar attempts from other sides.
For example, the electoral leader of the movement ANO Martin Komarek accused TOP 09 in the pre-electoral struggle for the idea of introducing a registry of contracts "clears" the ANO movement program.
TOP 09 has now been using an accelerator -- just made a proposal that has been made up before the second parliamentary reading.
The fire units have arrived to save the lost puppies that stuck 15 meters above the country on a dangerous shell in the stonebreak.
The cocrosspanel Ruby fled after a little car accident.
Three days later, the man who was trapped in stone was seen by the man who took the dog out.
The firefighters were sneaking around the rock wall to save the dog from a certain death.
The puppy was released by fire units who came to release him after he was in some way captured on a dangerous shell in a stonebreak of 15 meters above the earth.
The nine-month cocrosspanel Ruby fled after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and he survived three days himself until he was released from the stonebreak in Wednesday.
His owners Scott Alderson (25) and their girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were in a stone of Flappit in Denholm, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he fled when he got into a small accident, heavily after his lost dog they searched and placed challenges on social networks.
On Wednesday, about 14,15, a bright dog caught by Ruby on a stonebreak of 15 meters above the earth.
The technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station rushed down to release Ruby, using a carriage bag for animals to pick up the rock.
The expert chief of Andy Clayton's technical rescue team said, "The dog was in a dangerous situation.
He was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and below.
He didn't move his eyebrow at the rescue – he was totally frozen.
But now it's okay.
Then he got cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
The fact that someone saw the dog is incredible.
The excipient chief of the Technical Rescue Technical Team Peter Lau said: “Rubs had great happiness during his escape. ”
There was a possibility that he would be very seriously wounded or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a search, and except for exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “In view of the rescue action, I was afraid. ”
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to keep him in his arms again.
The veterinarian said that if he was too exhausted and collapsed, he would probably fall.
The firemen did a great job.
What they did was very courageous.
We're very grateful to them, they were just awesome.
Mr. Alderson from Keighley added: “We feared that he could fall, but stayed there. ”
The firemen were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger claims that after that 18-year-old Katy Perry definitely didn't leave.
During an interview for the Australian radio show, this pop star said this week that for Jagger's song “Old habits die hard” in 2004 sang accompanied vocales.
Perry said when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went after her.
And she added: “It was a long time ago, and now he is very kind to me. ”
In a statement from Thursday (70) of Jagger's representative said that he categorically refused to make Katy Perry proposals.
He said, "It may be the one who is confusing him with someone else."
Perry was one of the hosting singers (singers) who showed up on the Rolling Stones concert this year.
Her new album "Prism" debuted this week first.
George Kerevan: Division Europe gives Scotts to choose
Next day, another scary story of independence.
This time, a warning is shown that the condition for membership of independent Scotland in the EU would be its entry into Schengen.
This led to stories about passport checks in Berwick and the wire along the Hadrian valley.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper has mentioned possible economic advantages of free movement with the rest of Europe, but, as it was expected, it has not been produced in the titles of the newspaper.
No one also mentioned that the EU Member States spend the amount of time adapting their official laws, if it suits them.
Since Scotland is not in Schengen now, the offer of continuing disagreement would be a cheap decline for Brussels for anything they really want from the Scotts.
So it's a pretty weak story.
Furthermore, so old that he became a digging, a newly reported duck that “independence means passport control”, I heard at least 40 years ago.
Nevertheless, one interesting idea is hidden in this brassy story.
Why should it be expected that independent Scotland will listen to Europe?
Why exchange the London chomout for the Brussels, especially now?
This is a real European story: a great war plan to unit Europe finally lost.
The euro crisis influences the so-called Europe Project officially dead.
Through Europe the impact of the dedicated resistance to the EU or the cancellation of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the European Sceptical Party for Germany, which was founded in this year, came from nowhere and already took advantage of nearly five million votes in the light of the federal elections, which is essentially "free Democrats" from Bundestag (equivalent of British Liberal Democrats).
At home, there was always resistance to the plan to create federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a crucial moment.
The savings dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank together with the collaboration of the national economies, through irrigation to the common currency, have led many people to think that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis only has little to do with the fact that national governments have a high budget deficit -- that was true only in Greece.
It is a system of euro that blocks its members on exchange rates of advantage for German exporters – and German politicians want to keep it.
Without the possibility of devaluation of domestic currency, Southern Europe in the field of domestic production, compared to Germany, has a disadvantage.
The only help is to scratch revenues and public expenses — which Germany encourages.
The current budget and currency problems are a deeper cause of European small performance.
As a result of the “green” energy policy supported by Brussels, the French and German consumer costs code is doubled in the European industry for electricity and four times more gasoline than it is in the United States.
This is a paralyzing disadvantage in the area of costs, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Even all the frozening of salaries in the world would not reverse the drowning of the European petrochemical industry with cheap oil from the United States.
The result is the rebellious rebellion, especially in France, once excited EU advocacy.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that Germany will hold on the knot and allow Paris to stand in the world at Washington level.
Berlin, however, does not need Paris as a evidence of political legitimacy and has put on its own economic policy in Europe and has left the French economy needed.
Result: The right wing of Marine Le Pena, the anti-European National Front, has just won essential additional elections and has moved ruling socialists to the third place.
The Fronta is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – a timely warning for British labourists that they cannot assume that the right sticking is automatically positive on the left.
How does Le Penn be charged with its new acquired popularity among the white working class?
The European elections in the next year would like to take advantage of creating an anti-European block against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a block can dominate the first time in the history of the European Parliament.
I think that the increasing anti-European feeling and position against the common currency will be connected, and the euro will be lost.
The EU will not disappear, but rather turn into something more free in the sense of “Europe (suvereign) nations”, has already preferred General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may have kept the euro, but France and Southern Europe will renew their own currencies.
I expect Great Britain to be distant from this project and join the United States.
However, the increased interest in Washington in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be a region (in principle) Small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – it is also possible to announce Berlin and Brussels when we are to be left.
I assume that Scotland would have done well in the relaxed arrangement of Europe, provided that it would preserve its own currency.
Cooperation with other so-called countries would be easier in the non-federal Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and keep our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – a miracle – the most successful political movement that does not make savings in Europe, which won a large majority in 2011 due to the opposition position against the scratches he planned (a implemented) labourist Chancellor Alistair Darling and the next coalition of conservatives and liberal democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now elected independence only in order to adopt savings directed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early teenager: Adults Early
The research showed that African Americans and Spanish are reaching adolescents before their white classroom.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching
It is not demonstrated that there are hormones or other chemicals behind it
Experts argue that one of the previous teenagers can be an epidemic of obsession.
The trend of previous teenagers is not that obvious in boys.
Former rapporteur CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family problems.
Should the mother be scared when her daughter grows tits and shames at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Children's Medicines this week in Orlanda, Florida, a pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplowitz explained that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I spent a lot of time as I assured my parents that this is usually not a sign of rapid development towards a full puberty," said Caplowitz
The visible signs of development, such as breast growth, shamefulness and body smell, appear earlier in girls.
In the last 40 years, however, there was only a small movement in the age of the first menstruation.
In the United States, he is now the average age of 12.5 years from the age of 12.75 in 1970.
"When the breasts begin to develop, at least two to three years before the first menstruation," said Caplowitz, who is also the author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem" (The Frequent puberty in the girls: Unnecessary manual to deal with this common problem)
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
It is discussed what activates the real start of puberty, but if the breast growing is accompanied by a growing spurt before 8 years of age, the girl is considered “precedented”.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop — which children can carefully monitor.
Faster growth may be the reason for endocrinologist to perform tests to exclude serious problems such as tumour or cysta.
There are treatment procedures that delay the early menstruation and prevent the following consequences: the early ageing of bones that may eventually lead to the stop of growth and adulthood.
Recommendations on medicinal products and hormonal treatment are dependent on the age of the child, the speed of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
The psychosociological aspects are also important.
As regards medicinal products, Caplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that “a puberty can mitigate the girl’s behaviour and her feelings that they are different from her classmates. ”
Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They are concerned that he can become pregnant or how he will handle hygiene," Caplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter began to have a menstruation when she was 10 years old.
Although there were signs and menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school frightened and angry that she was first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of early teenage puberty.
However, there is still no related file of evidence that there are hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual message in the media.
Boys – like girls – reach adolescents earlier.
Caplowitz assumes that the most important reason is the epidemic of obsession.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study in girls aged from 6 to 9 years, connecting body fat with teenager time.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contribution factors.
In this country, African and Spanish women are inclined to reach adolescents before their white pupils.
Explanations are different.
Globally, the models of the early puberty appear to be affected by all possible economic conditions through climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys in a low age appear to be familiar in their face and in a shame, the trend towards the full flower of early puberty is not as clear as it is in girls.
Other doctors attending the Conference of the American Association of Children’s Medicines (AAP) added further complexities to this subject.
Even in babies and patches is common.
"We must be careful about how we identify a real puberty occurrence," Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist from the Goryeb child hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get their child’s doctor’s instructions to talk to their child.
"It may mean a need to talk to the child before you assume," Caplowitz advised.
If you remain calm, your child will probably react well.
Girls that develop earlier need to be assured that even though this happens early, this process is a common part of life.
Nada Convalink's as a housekeeper.
Does she have a new job?
The actress Nadia Konvalink (62) appeared behind the exhaustion of the household, and it was very good for her.
That the favorite Czech actress would plan a change in the profession and go to business in the cabin?
Nada Convalink appeared in James Joyce Irish pub and turned a beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I did it right now.
Even the boss offered me to hire me, and I could feed my beer.
But I refused, I'd rather stay with what I'm doing today, in acting," she said with the smile of Convalink, who was a guest on the twentieth anniversary of the Irish house.
"I like Irish beer and I'm gonna get Irish whiskey in there," she gave her tastes to the actress.
A long - year - old friend and colleague Paul New showed up for action.
I'm dead and I can't drink in the present new life.
I have one beer or one drink a day, and that's what I'm trying to do," the actor added.
The aircraft producers wish for the width of seats, there are large orders in the bet.
A dispute about the width of seats in the second grade at a long distance between the aircraft's managers, which led to a bitter exchange of views on the air show in Dubai this month.
The object of the dispute is the width of seats provided in remote flights for the economic class – not exactly the one that air companies would normally precede, but whose destination space is the key to the efficiency of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
This week, Airbus called for industrial standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economic class, but the main American rival Boeing says that air companies should decide.
The dispute arrived at the time when the manufacturers of aircraft were selling the largest version of their two-way remote aircraft with the potential recorded number of orders expected during the operation from 17 to 21 November.
The way the rear part of the plane is displaced, especially if there are 9 or 10 seats, is the basis of economic efficiency rights on the proposals of new aircraft ‘mini-jumbo’.
The Boeing company says that the improved model "777X" transports 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm distributed by 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competitive version of its A350 model will transport 350 people in 46 cm of wide economic seats distributed after 9.
The giant aircraft often attack each other in technical matters through advertising in professional media.
Airbus is now in front of the air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to get over 100 orders, he appeals directly to the public.
Recently, he showed what could be the start of a new advertising war when the financialers showed a picture of three people stuck in a restaurant with a title: Would you like it?
"Boeing promotes remote flights in seats more than they are in regional turbovertural aircraft," Airbus John Leahy said.
As food additives change, people are bigger, but the seats in the planes have not radically changed.
Since the early 70 ’ s, when Boeing 747 Jumbo defined modern remote air traffic, the average American average of 40 to 49 years has increased by 10 percent to the age of the United States Ministry of Health.
According to American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a 100 cm passport.
The Airbus claims that his rival holds the concept of seats from the 50s, where the average width of the seats of the newly baptized plane was lower.
The Airbus claims that it has carried out a research that suggests that the extension of the seat by 2,5 cm will improve the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing's size of airbus seats refuses and says it is not in the power of aircraft producers to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that experience in the cabin depends on more issues than just the width of the seat.
“It's true to provide air companies with flexibility and to allow them to do things that they are convinced that they must make them succeed," Kent Craver said the expert on the cabin space.
They don't want us to dictate their profits.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, there is a major larger space for elbows, but for the suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect profits.
Under this dispute, a race in aircraft orders with estimated trade in the next decades worth at least $700 billion in catalog prices is sufficient to avoid an American and European export language.
As the Reuters said in July, seat-deployment is exactly what triggers the battle between the last planes.
Boeing, both Airbus and Boeing, claims that they have 20% better efficiency than the market representative in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER model with 365 seats.
The performance rights of Boeing depend parts on comparison of model design 777X with 10 seats in order and concept of 777 with 9 seats in order.
The profits in units are weakened against the 10-sedadle concept.
"The reason Boeing does this is to embark more seats and make his planes more competitive against our products," said Kevin Keniston, head of the comfort of passengers in Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, the analysts say that the cabins with 10 seats in order for existing models 777 are in line with that many passengers are for a densier distribution that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
"Forty-five centimeters a wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that the project is motivated by the threat of model 777," said Mary Kirby, the founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network portal.
Airbus and Boeing don't add seats, but they offer the airline directory of suppliers so they can choose.
Aircraft sellers are even carrying a measuring zone with them to check the competitive arrangements.
While comfortable, all producers also offer aircraft with high dense arrangements for low-commerce companies and regional passengers.
Airbus offers model A350 with 10 seats in order, but he says he hasn't sold it yet.
Recently, Airbus emphasized the need for greater adjustment of the cabin by offering a wider seat in the streets for some of his planes.
Experts say that without the support of one more producer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industrial standards will remain unacceptable, but can be discontinued from the selling wave of 777X.
The number of HIV infected exceeded in Prague thousands
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected people grows annually.
For example, in 2002 the tests confirmed the infection of 50 people, about five years later 121 were already 121 and in 2010 there was 180.
Last year, 212 were infected and it was a record number.
"The total number of newly diagnosticated cases this year exceeds 200, I believe it is no doubt," said the expert on AIDS Miroslav Headaty, who has been leading the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
According to it, 165 patients with HIV arrived in the country from January to September last year, 176.
Since the beginning of the monitoring until the end of September, the tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, most infected in Prague.
Their number reached 1005.
In the Mediterranean region, 206 infected places were infected.
The diagnosis has also been heard by 156 people from the South Sealand, 130 from Moravsley, or 116 of the Ustecki.
At least the infected came from Height, 19.
A total of 88 percent of patients have been infected in sex.
14 people in the past have been infected with blood transfusion.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of the testing, which is more than a quarter of the century.
With the HIV virus, six children were also born, transferred to them from his mother.
The nonsense in the Gravitation film is, but the view is beautiful, claimed experts
The fantastic film from the universe of Gravitation was producing a movie in Czech Republic for a while after the premiere.
In October, it was seen by the Union’s film distributors nearly 150,000 viewers and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews evaluate the picture positively.
Others, however, find some disagreements in it.
The Lidovski server.cz asked experts from a series of astronomers and astrophysics about how they liked the film and whether they noticed some nonsense that appeared in the movie.
Jiri Dušek (Rider of Star and Plantaria Brno): I like scientific-fantastic films that I think are modern, dreamy tales.
The gravitation film doesn't take out, even if it faces like "physically real" show.
It's not, but it doesn't mean he'd be bad.
I enjoyed it too much.
You can notice, for example, the hair of Sandra Bullock, which is somehow uncomfortable.
Hubb's space vision and the International Space Station are moving after a significantly different circuit roads, so they can't be seen in one video.
Some film viewers evaluate the unreally active effect and the whole flame behaviour in the state of graveness.
They don't think the scramblers would either hold such wounds.
The heroes in the Gravitation film often collaborate with various objects and suits without bigger troubles will endure everything.
Criticism wasn't saved even a history confusion.
Such a large tragedy on the Earth's orbit is unreal.
Furthermore, she wonders why the doctor was sent to the universe to repair the technique.
People at the forums are arguing about the "real" behaviour of lan.
They said it's like it's designed for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Riterator of Star and Planetarium, see Pragues): I have seen him only on a wide plate yet, but clearly I can say, I was charmed.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary movie, it was science-fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost obliged) not to stick to the reality consistently.
"More than your mentioned incomparability touched me with how a space station has been shown three times with a degrading level of technique (the last Chinese)."
"China's gonna look better in the end of the decade, and I guess it'll look better than it's in the movie."
Vladimir Karas (Astronomic Institute of Sciences): In computerly generated scenes, authors are very successfully trying to not violate physical laws, so naturally oriented a watchman appreciates that at various cosmic collisions and collaborations the moment of movement, as said by the physics dictionary, also the view of the Earth from the universe is very realistic, including the thin columns of the atmosphere and the polar light coming in polar areas.
Incomparability will certainly be found in more detailed examinations.
For example, when I read comments, I found that the preferred direction of the circulation of various space trash on the circuit road appears to be turned in some scenes than it should actually be (from the west to the east).
Jiri Štepan (Astronomic Institute of Sciences): Some things the creators adapted to their needs, but no creative and heavenly calling for a sin against logic or natural laws I have not recorded in the film and in comparison with other films of similar focus is that the creators have been concerned about the credibility of these events.
From the moments that don't make sense, it's worth appointing the fact that Hubbl's space remote vision is circulated by a different slope of orbit than ISS.
The result is a significant difference in mutual speed and the rescue operation could not actually take place as it was shown in the film.
Then at the moment of Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock) I didn't notice that the whole ISS would rotate, so there is no clear origin of the power that acts on Kowalski, which forces both actors to release themselves when they are no longer moving towards themselves.
A new vaccine against Nikotine can take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists developed a vaccine against nikotine that can take away the pleasure of smoking cigarette.
The only dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mouse for life from the dependence on nikotine.
Before human tests, it is necessary to perform further tests that will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from the Weill Cornell Medical Faculty in New York says the first signs are good.
"We hope that this type of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who tried to stop and exhausted all the methods available today on the market, but they found that their dependence on Nikotine is so strong to overcome all current approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was composed to carry genetic information for the creation of anti-Nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which will then start to create a fuel stream of these antibodies.
The antibodies persecute all the nicotine molecules in the blood speaker and neutralize them before they get into the brain, thus preventing the smoke from getting a nikotine inflammation.
During the vaccinated mouse tests, which were further supplied by nikotine, they continued their common activities.
But the mice that were not vaccinated “relaxed, ” the researchers said, which is a sign that Nikotin got into their brains.
Experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine magazine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be administered so often to maintain sufficient antibodies, so they showed themselves expensive and unpractical.
The costs of new vaccines should be much lower because they turn liver cells into plants to the production of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines for humans are completely safe, they could be given to children before they have a taste of cigarette, and that would prevent the dependence on nikotine.
But much more likely the smokers would use it to stop.
"They will know that when they start smoking again, they will not benefit from the Nikotin vaccine, and that will help them to get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but they noted that they needed further research.
Tripodi denies that it would be affected by Obeid
Former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Committee for Monitoring Corruption.
Former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, denied that he would change coastal rent policy at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three propertys in the government controlled property.
On Friday, the independent Committee against Corruption (ICAC) extended its search for whether Mr. Obeid was lobbying in several state ministers to rent him at Circular Quay, where Obeid had owned two restaurants and café, renewed without having to attend the election procedure after his expiry in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr. Tripodi knew about the secret interests of Mr Obeid on these propertys, based on the evidence submitted on the former representative of Mr. Tripodi's office, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of interviews launched in 2005, the government pushed the rentals to public competitions.
The rentals were against it, and they also wanted more long-term contract conditions.
In 2009, rentals in Circular Quay, which brought Obeid 2,5 million dollars a year, were renewed without the need to participate in the public competition.
Mr Tripodi, who was the Minister of the Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a favourite of public competition.
But he denied that the changes were made on the request of Mr. Obeid, which, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, insisted on a movement in the government's rental policy.
The receipt of the calls submitted in the ICAC showed the calls from August to September 2007 between Mrs Obeid and Tripodim and Steve Dunn, the chief official who came to the port resort after he worked under Mr. Obeid at the fishing department.
"Was the theme of the interviews during these telephone calls the development of commercial rent policy?" the assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy Mr Tripodi asked.
"No," Mr Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but definitely not about this.
Absolutely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military aircraft attacked the target in Syria, said the responsible factor
The Israeli military aircraft hit the target in the Syrian port Lazikija on Thursday night, confirmed the responsible factor of the Fox News station.
This responsible factor did not concrete what the goal was, but said he was at least one.
The press agency Associated Press states that the target was SA-125 Russian production.
At least two times earlier this year, Israel launched an air attack on rocket shipments in Syria.
Many things have moved, and it's different.
Perhaps the commentator of Pecinka spoke so that it could be agreed, where the President Stéch was screaming the dispute.
Haytman Chovanec was suspected as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and he confirmed it.
The President of Saturday was always, and is the symbol of the poor of the CHSSD.
The other gentlemen showed their weaknesses mainly.
Senator Dienstbier is a principled and readable and unused, Vice-President Zaoralek disappointed himself most in television.
Based on this, I do not see a better option than if the CHSD proposed a Prime Minister of the Vice-President of the Gaydeski Senate, the only one would not have the starting handicap, and I think it would take a standard performance.
That's such a good solution that he's barely supported by someone in his leadership.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done, and to continue without breaking the party.
Alana Gaydeško could, without concern, build a minor government with only blessings from the President of Babiša and without humans, but with the Human Health Minister Talk, who is actually a believer of the social democrat.
This minimum government would have a great stability, as it would promote a proper referendum law, and it would also be obliged to support the President of the Dawn of Okamura.
The President Babish would eventually reconcile with tax progress, for he is smart and will see that it can't work without it.
People wouldn't bring any trouble because the Call is the bearer of the best they have, and otherwise they wouldn't be in the government.
The same applies to the ANO, even here would be a valuable minister, but if they reasonably do not want to enter risking government participation, but provide support, too, well.
Let's give our courage to Allen Gaydesh!
Foreign workers with visa permission may be subject to the ‘authorisation’ test
With the way the government intends to extend police proceedings, it considers the "authorities" test for foreign workers with visa authorisation 457.
The test, if accepted, will be applied by the criteria in order to prevent programme 457 from being used to fill in unqualified labour positions or as a back door for family and friends to Australia.
When the government's discussion article was issued today, the former labourist Member Maxine McKew condemned the government rhetoric on foreign workers with the words that it could offend the Australian neighbours.
“Notified declarations “for foreigners at the end of the front” and “work first for Australians” are a very uncomfortable remnant of the time the unions demanded the protected labour market”, said today for the Australian-Indy Institute.
It historically meant that white workforce was to be protected -- and I wouldn't be wondering if anyone in this region had recorded this historical artefact.
The discussion article discusses 12 measures considered earlier by former Minister of Immigration, Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration, Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lance yesterday, where he deals with officials for trafficking in people, implemented five of the recommended changes and others remain to consider.
If the criteria ‘relevant’ are accepted, the applicants of visa can be detailedly examined whether ‘a nomination is authorised for the situation where the candidate is in relation to the owner or the relevant person of the sponsors’.
After previous experiences with businesses that were planning to sponsor a small number of workers, but then hundreds of them were employed, the number of visa holders could also be required from businesses to reason the number of visa holders of 457.
Meanwhile, a 35 - year - old man from Sri Lanka, who was trying to asylum, died with suspicion of a heart attack after he arrived on a asylum ship on Christmas islands this week.
The nine - year - old frightened son traveled with him to Australia and, after his father died in the middle, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the ship.
Australian authorities and a man hurried to a hospital on Christmas islands where he died.
The British government announced a study which aims to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
The HS2 work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will begin as soon as the first stage starts in 2026.
The Ministry of Transport, Baron Kramer, said that the project would "merge the Great Britain together".
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was co-operating with the British government on this plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and West Midlands.
After the end of the Phase two will lead a line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government reevaluated the estimated costs of building a high speed line between London and Northern England from 32.7 billion GBP to 42.6 billion GBP.
The British government, which conducted interviews with the National Transport Scotland Transport Office, authorised HS2 to identify further railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London for three and less hours.
Baronka Kramer said: “Our purpose for HS2 is a really national network that better links the Great Britain and its cities.”
We gave SH2 green because the benefit that it brings is huge.
Without this, we face a crisis in our rail network's capacity.
However, this is also about the connection – across Britain, through HS2, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s notification is a good news for Scotland. ”
For the Scotland Government, Keith Brown Mr Carmichael called on to support the "speakly" Scottish integration in the HS2.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed route has the potential to bring Scotland incredible economic advantages, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland in a general case the high-speed railway across Britain.”
We are therefore excited to cooperate with the British government to explore the possibility of bringing high-speed railways to Scotland and thus bring everyone benefits and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish government plans as well.
I look forward to reviewing this study with British ministers during the next year and the joint decision on other steps.
Together with Barta, an inspection and an analyst of anticorruption police has been arrested.
Information about arresting Vita Barta began to spread on Thursday night when the server brought the report to the First Report.cz.
The MF DNES discovered that the case was taken over by the General Inspection of Security Assemblys (GIBS), its people were to arrest Barta in the centre of Prague.
It happened in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection deals with cases where there are cases between accused police officers, but its competence also applies to civilians.
According to MF DNES, among the arrested and one of the officers of the anti-corruption police - the leader of analysts and information Jan Petrjilek.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
The speaker's anti-corruption police Jaroslav Ibehei refused to comment with the age that the media must be turned to the GIBS.
Even her speaker's inspection, Radka Sandor, but she didn't want to say anything to the case, refers to the City State Representativeship in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question in view of the protection of secret facts," said the speaker of the representative of Stefan Zenklová.
Also, this unconcrete reaction can lead to the fact that the event has occurred, but it is in a secret regime that does not allow speakers to say anything specific.
In a similar situation, Bart's lawyer is Oldrich Poor.
The media said that Bart was representing "in this matter," but since it was a secret information, Bart's arrest can't be confirmed or undoubted.
Some media first speculated that Bart's arrest could be linked to the former police president Peter Lessy.
It was promoted to the function of Barta, along with the former VV President Radk John, who was headed by the Ministry of Interior.
The dispute, which had been furious between Peter Neweather and VV, even had to deal with the President Vaclav Klaus at the time.
I don't know where this connection came from to my person.
No one contacted me, I wasn't interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about the thing," said iDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became the police chief.
Even though Radek John was officially a party chief, he was a Barta at that time.
Barta was now running for the elections for the motion of the Dawn, the messenger fled only closely - about 175 votes.
The Leader of the Dawn, Tomio Okamura, declared that he had no idea what it was about.
"Vit Barta was one of the many candidates of many parties at our candidate and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy Tomia Okamura," he was distant from Barta Okamura, who said before the elections that Bart had given the space to run for the Dawn, because he helped him solve the issue of executives.
Vietnam Barta came to court in 2012 with his former co-party from VV Jaroslav Skarka.
The rules on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft will remain in Australia for now in force
The travellers of Australian airlines will still have to turn off their tablets and smart phones during launching and landing, regardless of the changes in the USA to mitigate the regulations on these devices.
The US Federal Air Management (FAA) has given US companies a space to change their procedures, so passengers will be able to read electronic books on their devices, watch videos or play games during critical fly phases if the device remains in the "air" regime.
Travelers can do this already during a major part of the flight, but many people are bothering to have access to their electronic books during starting and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a large portion of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but indicated that they have not planned to change their procedures in a short time.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that this notification was examined, but emphasized that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases are still in force in Australia.
‘CASA does not currently have any specific rules governing the use of electronic devices in the aircraft’, he stated.
This question is covered by provisions that require the aircraft operators to ensure that the safety will be maintained throughout the period of time and that passengers shall act in accordance with the safety instructions acquired from the members of the crew.
Virgin, who has already spoken with CASA to extend the use of its wi-fi discharge system, has changed, but noted that the decision of the regulatory authority will be subjected.
"We would welcome that if the CASA authorities conducted an analysis of the permission to use electronic devices, because we really think that this would improve the experience of customers now when we have (free-board fun)," the speaker said.
The company Qantas announced that the current rules will be followed for now.
"Our current policy is that the electronic device cannot be used during the flight and landing, and we do not intend to change it in a short time," he said.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
But we are constantly interested in the development in a regulatory area that can be useful for our travellers, and we are surely exploring the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
In the case of air carriers from the United States, the impact of the legislation will differ from the company and will depend on the age of their air park.
Transporters will have to testify that their aircraft can tolerate radio interruptions of mobile phones, as well as to revise the manuals, training materials, manual baggage programs and information for passengers.
“As soon as the air company confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use transmitted and easy electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smart phones, in any supersea height," the FAA said.
In rare cases, low visibility, the crew shall order travellers to shut down during the landing of the device.
The group also recommended that the harder equipment be safely stored under seats or in the storage space above the head during the flight and departure.
With the growing poor high-class, the sinks in Singapore have a flower
In the shopping room in Bendemeer in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stops the golden bracelet, ring and earrings so that she can pay her daughter school.
"We just bought the house with our husband and I gave all my money to it," Mrs. Amirthalinga says.
Although every month as the administrator receives $2400 (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, the family monthly income is insufficient, he says.
The demand across the regions of South-Eastern Asia – where the household debt is increased – is indeed that the ValueMax company, where a woman performs its transaction this week, took place on a third stake on the ladder in Singapore.
The stop of jewelry is not only a fast way to loan cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga – but is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In Singapore, the stakeholders normally apply the annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just over 15.4 per cent rate offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, the stockholders have the advantage that they do not require verifications of a person (payment history) or a receipt document and may provide a loan faster than the banks.
Therefore, with how families feel pressures due to increased life costs and growing debt of households and consumer debt, millions of people around the region turn to be founders.
After five years of strong growth from the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by the free monetary policy in advanced economies, families with low and medium-sized income are turning to the flags to address the worsening financial situation.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's quoted the increased use of household loan mainly due to increased rents as a risk factor for the creditability of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia.
Malaysia is headed by a ladder with a relative of 80 per cent of GDP, which is an increase compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economies also feared the high level of consumption debt in Thailand, which just came from the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed the continuing weak export and the deterioration of consumer demand.
"It is important that with increased costs, people from high to low [primary scale] will try to complete their income wherever they can," Song Seng Wun, an econome in the Malaysia CIMB bank, said.
Historicly high gold prices in the past two years have contributed to the embarrassment of their personal property and the opportunity to exchange for the cash of their family jewelry.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 cities form gold.
People say, the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month.
The largest storage operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, recorded the recent months to 20 per cent increase in the number of customers using its flagship.
The growth in the stakeholder sector is so large that ValueMax, branch operator in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where he has four branches – but even outside Asia, says Executive Director ValueMax Yes Lee Ching.
The company will finance this by using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD, which she received on the Singapore Bureau this week.
While some discount creditors have experienced criticism under fire because of high interests, Mrs. Yes says that the flag offers not only lower rates than the other creditors, but also directly does not increase debt.
“The customers stop the subjects already owned, and the cashing of personal property does not increase the household debt," he says.
In the company, the property flag is increasingly accepted as a means to ensure short-term, secure funding.
In addition, not just people in financial distress are among those who use the flags.
Rich people from Singapore also use ValueMax branches when they stop gold rods or watch Rolex, and they can reach up to 60 percent of cash purchase prices.
Our customers are of all possible circumstances.
“It belongs to rich individuals who need to borrow shortly for their courageous trades or investments or small enterprises that need help to solve problems in their cash flows," Mrs. Daova said.
Sometimes they just need money as fast as they can.
Saved package of $325 million for Tasman health
The Federal Government insists that a rescue package of $325 million for commercial health in Tasmania contains hard conditions to ensure that the government does not lose the financial resources.
The Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Australian Union is making “accelerated measures” to disturb the crisis caused by the ageing population of the island, a higher number of chronic diseases and system disorders.
The funding for four years was decided after government consultations with an independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilk.
"The government has come with an emergency rescue package, which we believe will solve specific problems that the State faces," Mrs Plibersek said today.
The package of $325 million contains $31 million for surgery on the request of a patient.
Other 2600 operations including ortopedic operations and gray tiles will help to remove debt.
Money is also available on free clinics in Hobart and Launcestone, better pooperation care, training of health professionals, mental health services and personal electronic health records systems in local hospitals.
"This investment responds to the thoughts that the front clinical doctors told me that they would best help the Tasman health system," Mrs Plibersek said.
The Ministry stressed that the Tasman government must require a strict reporting and recording regime.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive the money of the Australian Union and to inform monthly where additional funds have been equipped.
A three-party committee will be established to ensure that the State delivers services as effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would not be helpful, "will real reform be followed in order to establish a more sustainable basis for the Tasman public health system".
Nevertheless, he praised the government for the response to his request for accelerate aid, which he first introduced in negotiations with the President of the Government at the beginning of May.
"I believe that a federal aid package can eradicate public health from critical state," Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the government, these additional selected procedures will significantly reverse the recent shortcomings.
The federal opposition speaker in the field of health, Peter Dutton, believes that today's statement is just a “plast. ”
"The reason why I'm here is that the labour government has excluded 430 million dollars from our health system," ABC TV said.
You can't have a government that takes nearly half a billion dollars, and the Australian union, which is devoted to $300 million, and seem to be a good news.
Mr. Dutton invited Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee that no dollar from the rescue package will be issued to a higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux adapted the novel Denise Diderota, which brings exceptional film explosion and time creation, but is also more boring than it should be.
In the 1960 ’ s, in France, they share a dark story about Suzanne, a young noble one who is sent to the monastery.
When he rebels, he experiences extremely cruel treatment of criminally disgusted mothers presented and becomes an object of sexual passion for another.
The film never slides to the kindness or sensitivity, and that's his problem.
The ceremony of this story leads to that the viewers will experience torture like wearing a yellow shirt.

Syria destroyed its resources for the production of chemical weapons, says the supervisory authority
Syria destroyed the essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poisonous gas, said on Thursday the Committee for the Global Oversight of Chemical Weapons, while rapid conflicts in the northern country, not far from one of the places where the poisonous substances are allegedly stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian activeist group also declared that more than 120 000 people were killed since the start of civil war almost three years ago.
Notification of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons arrived a day before 1 November,
the term established by this organisation with the Hague seat of Damascus to destroy or disable all the chemical weapons and machinery equipment for the mixing of chemical substances in order to create poisonous gas and ammunition.
Completion of this in principle the initial phase of destruction is an important million in the ambitious timetable, which puts its aim to destroy all Damascus chemical weapons by half of 2014.
Destruction of equipment means Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must still begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
This country is expected to have about 1,000 tonnes of chemical substances and weapons, including yperite and nervous sarine gas.
The announcement came at the time when the fight was raged in Safira on Thursday, which the experts speak as a headquarters of the chemical weapons and storage factory, stated the Syrian observer for human rights with the headquarters in Britain.
The group of activists, who monitored the total number of victims through the network in Syria, announced on Thursday that 120 296 people died.
It should be 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 members of the armed forces of Basar Asada, 18,678 ruling warriors and 187 armed men from Libanon Hizballah.
Among the dead should also be 2,202 government perpetrators and approximately 5,375 opposition warriors, many of whom are aliens.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million inhabitants to leave the country.
Assad's units fought in Safira against rebels, many of whom are associated with Al-Kaida, for weeks.
The observer said on Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but she had no specific numbers.
The struggles undermine the danger of inspectors for chemical weapons, who, at their mission, when in the middle of the Civil War of Syria, have to eliminate the chemical arsenal, must deal with close terms.
The statement from the OPCW, which is closely cooperating with the United Nations, stated that its team is now “happy to verify – and watch the destruction – the Syrian declared essential equipment for production and mixing/completion”.
He added that “no other control activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors said that they completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of 23 places declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit two places because of security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that these two places were “released and... the elements of the chemical weapons programme that it contained were transferred to two other declared places that have been verified”.
It was not immediately clear whether the device in Safir was one of the places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria agreed to the plan of total destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPCW next month.
"I beg the courage and courage you have shown in the fulfillment of this most difficult mission that this organization has ever had," said the Director of Observers Ahmet Uzumcu in his comment issued by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, it stands against itself in the civil war, especially the sunny muslim rebels and the Government of Assad with its security forces filled with members of the Alawit Sect, with the shaith Islam.
With regard to further development, Chief Observer Rami Abdul Rahman said that there was a strong explosion inside the air defense device in the Syrian coastal province Lazikia.
He said the cause of the explosion was not known.
Anger of the judgment of the founder of the bomb attack on Bali
The survivors and relatives of 202 killed in a bomb attack on Bali in 2002 responded angryly to the judgment of the last founders who were built before justice and said that Umar Patek was to be executed.
The duck, who spent almost 10 years running as one of the most searched persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years of prison yesterday for composing the explosive device used in the bomb attack.
In 15 years, he could be released conditionally.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of a massive murder in attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which 202 people remained dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty in several other points of charges related to terrorism, including a series of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas night 2000.
The prosecution demanded for life, although it could insist that a man with the name “Demolition man” (whisperer) had been sentenced to death by his reputation of an expert on the production of explosives.
This decision renewed the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39 - year - old twins, Jane and Jenny, nearly ten years ago, during the destructive attack of Patek and other founders.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek was to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should go in the tracks of the others.
For AAP, Mrs. Corteen said: “It should be built before the executioner's office.”
I have to live every day with not seeing other grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari club was compared to the country when a strong loader was launched shortly after 23 hours outside parked truck.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds before the suicide assassinator fired a bag filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell in a moon, while he was kept alive, three times “death. ”
Mr. Hughes said that Pateka should meet the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jama Islamia responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlase and Imama Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get a death punishment like no one.
Keep him alive... there's no reason to keep him alive, it's just not.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and hundreds of other people injured, it's not that much.
Patek was standing in court as the last of the Bali assassinates.
The arrest was avoided for nearly ten years, but eventually in January 2011 he was caught in the Pakistan city Abbottabad, where less than four months later the American forces killed the former leader of Al-Kaida Osama bin Ladina.
During the trial, the FBI agent stated in his testimony that the reports of the rapporteurs revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Ladine in trying to reconnect the terrorist groups from south-eastern Asia and Al-Kaida.
"He didn't give up voluntarily," said Mrs. Corteen.
Until today, he had no regret for how much grief he caused others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and which will be part of the ceremony at Bali and Australia.
"We will see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
The patch can still be revoked against the judgment.
FAA: Travelers in air transport can now use technological equipment in aircraft (but they cannot call from their mobile phones)
The passengers of airlines will be able to use their electronic devices “from gates to gate” – except calls from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watching movies and listening to music on the basis of unhealthily expected new rules issued by the Federal Air Management (FAA on Thursday).
But the travellers do not expect changes to happen immediately.
As soon as the change will be introduced, according to individual airlines, the FAA manager Michael Huerta said to the press conference.
Airlines will have to report the FAA management as long as their aircraft meet the new rules and update the training guides for the shipping crew and the repository directive in order to comply with the new rules.
The FAA has stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of transmitted electronic devices in aircraft.
Among the companies that have already passed the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the condition of this plan, we can improve the extensive use of electronic devices very quickly," the FAA said in its statement.
The travellers are currently required to turn off their smart phones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches the height of 3 miles and the captain doesn't give a permit.
The passengers are expected to turn their devices off again when the plane falls down to land, and they will not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
According to new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic disturbance may allow their passengers to use their facilities during the flight, landing and ride, the FAAs.
Since the majority of new aircraft and other aircraft, which have been adjusted so that passengers can use Wifi at a higher altitude, the criteria are expected to be fulfilled.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
"As soon as new rules are safely introduced -- and we will work closely with transport companies – it will be success," Glading said in her statement.
Honestly, we are tired of looking like “the guards. ”
However, surfing on the Internet, sending e-mails and texts or downloading data will continue to be prohibited under 3 miles of altitude, said the agency.
The travellers will be notified to switch their smart phones, tablets and other equipment into the airline.
So there are still no Words with friends, the online game of scrabble, played by an actress Alec Baldwin on his smart phone in 2011, when he was, as well known, thrown out of the American Airlines plane, because he refused to shut down his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And the harder devices like the laptops will have to continue to be stored for fears that they could hurt someone if they flyed by the cabin.
Mobile phone calls will still be banned on board.
The rules for mobile phones are not fixed by FAA but by the US Federal Telecommunications Committee.
FAA may cancel the prohibition in certain electronic devices during the flight and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Transport Safety Committee, a national security expert at CBS News, said that mobile phones are still considered risky.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create disruptions with navigation devices, but from the FCC data we also know that air can cause disruptions of the radio towers," Rosenker said.
The Bureau Advisory Committee established by the FAA management in order to examine the problem, proposed last month that the Government would allow broader use of electronic devices.
The FAA has been pressured in recent years to reduce the limitations to their use.
Critics, such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a democrat from Missouri, claim that there is no legal security reason for this ban.
Constraints are also increasingly difficult, because use of such devices is everywhere available.
Some studies suggest that a third of the passengers are forgetting or ignoring the obligation to shut down their devices.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices traveling in 1966 in response to the breakdown of navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, the technical equity of that time.
New airlines are much more linked to electrical systems than previous generations, but are also designed and approved by the FAA management to resist the electronic disruption.
In several years, airlines have offered travelling Wi-Fi in travel excess.
Plans adjusted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disruption.
The large majority of airlines should be adapted in the framework of new rules to greater use of electronic devices, said Huert.
The current electronic devices generally shine much less intensive radio transmissions than it was in previous generations.
For example, electronic readers issue only a minimal broadcast when turning the page.
But the broadcast is stronger when the device downloads or sends the data.
Among those who push to release restrictions for use of these passenger devices is Amazon.com.
In 2011, the representatives of this company charged the transport plane with their electronic readers of Kindle and carried out test flights, but no problem has occurred.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as regards whether these devices constitute any risk.
Douglas Kidd, from the National Association of Air Travelers, said he is convinced that disruption from these facilities is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee have declared that there are only broken reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause disruption of air systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow the pilots to turn off the equipment during the flight according to low-visible devices.
The travel industry group welcomed these changes and according to it it is a reasonable procedure for the traveling public that technology is exploiting in extensive extent.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognized the pleasant travel experience is not in contrast with security," said Roger Dow, Executive Director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was transported aircraft from a flood platform in the North Sea and released back to nature
The bird was transported to the coast after he was found exhausted on the oil plate in the Black Sea, and released back to the free nature.
One helicopter was transferred to Aberdeen last month after he was treated by the Scotland SPCA in the rescue center before he was healed.
Colin Seddon, operating center, said: “He probably migrated from northern Europe when a strong wind caught him over the North Sea. ”
He allegedly lost his strength, and he found a shelter on the oil platform.
Mr. Seddon added: “He was not able to fly again, so they contacted us with the request for help. ”
When he was released, he was in good condition and health.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain Campaign was launched in April with a pledge to connect businesses and to define what changes in the EU want British businesses and companies creating jobs to see.
To this end, we have given the biggest and most complex research in which we have asked the front entrepreneurs about their views about Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov questioned 1,000 businesses representing British enterprises of different sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the research will be for many surprises.
We have discovered that a cruel majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries that modernize and grow while the EU States are downloading.
They want to see how the government prefers new trade bonds with countries such as China, India and Brazil than to enter into a long and hard process of reforming mysterious European institutions.
When we asked about their views on specific political areas — from monopoly regulations to products laws — the majority of entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
General dissatisfaction with the single market, and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulations now overlook the benefits of being part of the European business area – the consent expressed even 40 per cent of large enterprises, which is traditionally the most pro-European society.
And eventually, our examination of leading enterprises revealed the most explanatory knowledge, and although the clear majority wants Britain to seek to change the treaty and relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not policy.
The findings identified by different dimensions and the main business group show that the business sector is pushing on a “consumptional change” that will bring the impact back to Britain.
There is a lot in bet – achieving a change in the contract and a better agreement for Britain can be a profit of up to 16% in the vote in the EU's referendum.
The President of the government should not hesitate: this research shows that the British trade supports its plan for the novelization of the conditions of the British membership in the EU.
This also shows that the business sector expects that this novelisation will mean a significant move from the current export of forces back to Britain.
The better agreement for Britain is possible and, given how the euro area is travelled for a higher economic and fiscal union, it is still more necessary.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, and as the results of our research show, this means re-concentrating on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels's regulatory approach.
John Kerry admitted, spying went too far!
The United States have been spying at times "too far," the head of the American diplomacy John Kerry, according to the agency AFP, accepted during a video conference between Washington and London.
But a collection of information, according to the minister, served to distract terrorist attacks.
"The first confession from Washington" according to the AFP was in the middle of a strong dispute on both shores of Atlantic, due to a scandal discovery of a bunch of data monitoring by the American National Security Agency (NSA), which was targeted by American allies.
"In some cases, I admit, as did President (Barack Obama), some of these actions have gone too far and we assure that this will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he was primarily defending the practices of experience.
The collection of information is considered necessary to combat terrorism and prevent assaults such as attacks from 11 September 2001 in the USA, assassinations in Madrid in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We prevented aircraft from falling, buildings exploded and people were murdered because we were able to be informed on time," Kerry emphasized.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases went unproperly far."
The American intelligence Afera, which reportedly watched hundreds of millions of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.

Alexei Miller from Gazprom says the tube in Bulgaria starts a new gas era
Starting the construction of South Stream gas in Bulgaria means launching one of the largest European energy projects, said Gazprom Director.
"We are witnesses of the Messier today: The construction in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gasway, the largest and most important project in Europe," said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is the key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream tube should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazpro and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risks of conventional routes, the officials say.
Miller says that direct links to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks related to transit countries are "ever" removed.
As soon as the entire project begins its operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will get gas from South Stream gas for cheap price.
The Gazprom company says that the construction is going to start in other countries in the end of this year.
The gas pipeline is designed for the annual capacity of 2.2 billion cubic gas footsteps.
Hizballah sent thousands of warriors to Syria.
There's a decisive battle waiting for them.
The Lebanese Movement of Hizballah placed 15,000 of its warriors north of Damascus in preparation for a decision-making battle on the mountain area of Kalamún.
According to Israel’s continuing detailing reports at the middle attacks at two places in Western Syria, he destroyed the missiles designed just Hizballah.
This Libanon Shiit organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army.
Her program is also a fight against Israel, which is not involved in the Syrian conflict, but clearly said that he would prevent the movement of arms to Hizballah's hands to Libanon.
Reports of central Israeli attacks on weapons storages in Western Syria are just affirmed.
Israel did not comment, but the American sources confirmed it.
According to the Syrian Dampress.com website, rockets fired from the Mediterranean sea to the Syrian Snubar Jabla base south of Latakia.
The rapporteur's station of Al-Arabia claims that two warehouses were hit in which the missiles were ready to transport to Libanon.
According to its sources, it was Russian production rockets SA-8.
Israel refused to comment, but the military analyst Ron ben Jišaj said that Syria is continuously trying to supplies Hizballah with missiles and Syrian aircraft teaching members of the armed section Hizballah to treat missiles.
SA-8 are an aged rockets that the Syrian army has since the 80s.
They're placed on a moving trailer.
Although they are relatively primitive, thanks to mobility and small dimensions, they can easily hide.
They're equipped with a radar that turns off after the shooting, so it's hard to focus.
Latakia is located in Western Syria, in the area of ruling alavita.
It's a well-secured area and Hizballah was participating in battles in Western Syria in the past.
He claims to help protect the Syrian Shiit community that belongs to.
Now allegedly 15,000 of his warriors are ready to help win the army back Kalamun.
With Hizballah there, the Syrian army also strengthens its units.
Kalamún lies between Damascus and the third largest city of Homs.
The battle should be answered by the source of al-Arabia for the recent attack of the opposition to the Syrian Shiitian Brigade of Abu Fadla Abbas in the Shiit part of Damascus.
Hizballah helped the Syrian army to fight back the town of Kusajr at the Libanon border this year.
Many rebels from Kusairo just went to Calamún.
Recently, most citizens in the Czech Republic seemed to wish for early elections.
As reasons, corruption, disbursement of money for predominant purchases and public procurement, tax increases and, in the latest, government scandals.
According to the results of the elections, most of the citizens had the condition.
That they did not really mind, and with the state that was here, they were actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I can't explain that 3 413 497 voters did not reach the elections, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters, therefore, totally 4 394 028 have actually supported the original government coalition, representing 52.16% of all lawful voters.
Which is a super-half majority.
When I attach 1 016 829 voters to the above, then with an old order (because all those parties participated in the "crabbling" and debting of this State), 64.23% of the lawful voters actually agreed with this condition.
In fact, most voters have demonstrated that they are not stealing and renewing for the punishment of the guilty.
Or do you think the members of the CHSD who participated in this are laying down appropriate laws?
Does it even help us?

The Royal Commission learned that two Christian young men (YMCA) were accused before complaints against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission for the Sexual Exploitation of Children learned that before the charges against the child's instructor Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Association of Youth Men (YMCA) in New South Wales were charged with sexual abuse of children.
But before the committee, in its initial statement for the Commission, the association stated that they had never solved the case of sexual abuse of a child in their organization.
The Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked for a case when one of the employees of the YMCA Association was accused of the offences relating to child pornography, and on another time when a body trainer in Caringbah from the YMCA association was convicted in 1991 for the sexual disturbance of children who were in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, advisor of the Commission that he knew about the first case, but not about the second.
He admitted that the initial declaration of the YMCA association was also unprecise when it stated that an external audit was carried out in the YMCA organisation which evaluated this organization as the frontist of the rights of children.
The evidence submitted by the Commission indicates that the YMCA was notified that the second of the four lowest estimates had been received in the audit of the Ministry of Education and Company from August this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working with the YMCA association when he was 21, admitted that the leadership from him itself down failed when Mr. Lord accepted without being certain whether the staff is aware of the obligation to notify violations of the rules of the safety of children.
Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted for sexual harassment of 12 boys who had been committed during two years when he worked in the YMCA association.
He was trapped for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, refused to claim that the YMCA association had a cultural problem that prevented the staff from reporting the security of children by Mr. Lord.
The staff members provided evidence that they were witnesses of such violations, including that Lord was with children alone, in particular watching them, letting them sit on his knees, telling them he loved them, and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's superior and asked for training for the safety of children because she was concerned about his behavior, confirmed that Jacqui Barnat, who was head of the services of children in the YMCA Association in Caringbah, who was Lord's supervisor, was “very intimidating and often hard to talk to him. ”
The Director-General said that he did not accept the evidence of staff that they were not aware if they were to contact their superiors and to announce their actions.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord had eclipsed their judgment, so they did not report the problem.
Mr. Hare said that the YMCA council in New South Wales told his opinion that the lesson from “the case of Jonathan Lord” for the organization was that the staff “no message” had been given, and the Council agreed with it.
Mr. Hare said that the decision of the staff to sign agreements on silence shortly after the accusation appeared, made a general manager for children's services in the YMCA Liam Whitley organization.
He said that the goal was to avoid disturbance of evidence, but it was “excessively zealous ” and misconducted.
The professional for sexual abuse of children, Professor Stephen Smallbone from Griffit's University, told the Commission that YMCA in New South Wales, in 2009 to 2011, was not a organisation that would be safe for children.
He said there had been serious problems in the recruitment, verification, employment, training and staff management.
The hearing was delayed on 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would use the chance to return to the ministerial post, but he confessed that return was unlikely.
The 59-year-old politicians expressed their views on various areas of domestic policy in the night's fiveth anniversary.
Since June 2007, after ten years in the leading position, Mr. Blair avoided mostly interviews on British politics and limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Ambassador of the Middle East Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of the Minister, his answer to the London Evening Standard said: "Yes, of course, but it may not be possible, so..."
While the teams of experts in Cardiff gathered to show horses to fight the price of the Horse of the year, it was clear that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kircland.
Although they're not going to school, and just a few months ago he made the first steps, this boy and his animal pet, the Shetland Pony Toffee, slightly scratched three wheels to eventually get the main price and left 30 grown rivals behind.
These unresolved couples – with the same height – were commended for the appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition operated by the Sunnybank River Centre in Rudry's village near Cardiff.
He stood against the gentlemen and the ladies in elegant hats, put his barrel in a joyful corner and let his two-year-old Toffee mention around the circle.
Fenton was commended to the jury for its natural ability to control the horses that far exceed his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks of view and personality.
Fenton Toffee got his third birthday in March and since then he's been practicing with this Shetland pony daily.
His mother Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee are doing great work. ”
They did not make great hopes, but eventually they left with a golden cup and a flower.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffe, and when he won, we were excited.
Everybody thought he was a phenomenon and a totally stranger wanted to take a picture with him.
A guy from the village of Nantiglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales is following his aunt Sharon Howells, who presents horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says: “There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone was encouraging and pleasing. ”
He ran through the sand all the length of the arena, and even though he did so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has taken over two chickens.
Given how he started, he'll be again soon at the Horse of the year, and I'm sure he'll do well.
The speaker of the annual contest of the horses showing said: “Fentons are only three, but they already know how to control the pony. ”
They're making a great team together.
The jury picked Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and the way they showed themselves in the competitive circle.
They always watch how good team work is between the pony and who leads him – and Fenton and Toffe were the best on the tube.
I'm sure Fenton's clothing really helped him.
Too curious newspapers are to be examined
The Chinese newspapers, which asked on the title page to release a reporter accused of the conspiracy, will be examined thoroughly, said the press manager.
New Express and Guangzhou were made a rare public request for release of Chen Yongzhoua.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he was taking bribes to invent the story of the company partially owned by the state.
The manager said that the New Express newspaper will now carry out the "full repair".
The Regulation came from the State Office for Printing and Publishing, Volume, Film and TV in Kuang-Tung Province.
The preliminary investigation showed that in the period from September 2012 to August 2013 the New Express newspaper of the Yangcheng Group of Evening News issued several false reports on that company Zoomlion.
"The direct management of New Express newspaper was unresolved," said the manager in his statement.
He said he had to decide to “invest Chen Yongzhou's administrative penalty in the form of annulment of the press license”.
Furthermore, he “recommended the Yangcheng Group of Evening News to make a total repair of New Express, and recommended that the responsible persons in New Express investigate and immediately change the leadership of New Express. ”
Mr. Chen wrote for New Express several articles relating to financial disagreements in the company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper issued on the title page two requests for his release and claimed he was worth his journal work.
But then Mr. Chen showed up on public television and confessed that he issued false stories for the payment.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and to the whole media industry and its ability to gain confidence to the public," CCTV state reporting station said.
I did it mostly because I was looking for money and glory.
I realize I did wrong.
After excusing Mr. Chena, he issued a list of New Express on the title page of an apology in which he stated that he failed when he did not perform sufficient control of his reports.
Recently, several closely monitored suspects were confessed on TV.
The experts say that confession is still regularly forced, regardless of the change of the law of this year, which prohibits the authorities to force anyone to blame himself.
There was a tunnel for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most intelligent drug traffic tunnels between the USA and Mexico has been found, supplemented with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical railway.
The U.S. authorities described a tunnel about the size of approximately one meter as one of the most suitable secret hallways they have ever discovered.
The tunnel that clicks to the length of nearly six football fields connects the warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the United States.
This area is full of indefinite warehouses, where it can easily hide cars before they are charged with drugs.
The authorities stated that the tunnel was closed before drugs could have been uncertainly transported.
In addition to the discovery of the tunnel, the authorities also detained eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine according to the court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers, were accused of holding marijuana and cocaine to distribute them.
In the case of condemnation, he faces the penalty of deprivation from 10 years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, the smugglers invade into large waterway channels.
The tunnel is the eightth largest hall in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico, which builds a problem before drug cartels as soon as possible to get their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a hall at about 650 metres long, equipped with railways that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.

CME targets TV business.
They'll release almost a quarter of people.
The CME media group will be released.
By the end of the year, he wants to lose a thousand people.
He's going to cut all side activities and just want to focus on his main business, television broadcast.
The group, which owns TV Nova in Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of 4,500 people.
Almost a quarter of people will be lost to work.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is part of CET 21, which holds licences for television stations Nova, Nova Cinema, New Sport, Fanda, Smilesov, Telka and Czech version of the MTV music station.
How much savings will affect Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the local TV TV TV News, is not yet clear.
"It's too early and we can't really comment on it," said New Josef Kokoliček, director of communication.
According to MF DNES, the significant release of Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but it should have the greatest impact on the personal state of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both new heads of New Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who came after the long-year director Adrian Sarbu, during the medium conference call with analysts, talked about trying to limit all activities that did not directly relate to TV business.
It is therefore quite likely that the cost of production of own series, film and production is significantly limited.
In the industrial area, the CHKD in Prague burned a cooling tower at night
In the industrial area, the CHKD in Prague burned a large-coupling tank, according to the firefighters, apparently a cooling tower.
"To the fire, firefighters were riding on Thursday before 11 p.m., this morning the fire was still inhabited," said Paulin Adamc, speaker of the Prague Firemen.
The number of damages in the air in the area according to measurement did not exceed the allowed limits.
The highest damage and causes of fire are not yet known.
In the Colben Street, about five dozens of firefighters arrived gradually.
"One of the fires of the large-capped tank, probably the cooling tower," Adams said.
"The area does not find a functional hydrant network, so we extinguish through the transport guide from tanks," she supplemented.
According to the server tn.cz, the shutdown of the badly functioning hydrant network has been complicated, so the firefighters had to deliver the water from the other hand.
The chief of the firefighter has announced the second degree of fire alarm.
They're totally four, the fourth is declared in the most important situations.
The chemicals also went to the place to verify the level of dangerous substances that could get into the air at the fire.
"But they did not target the amount of damage in the air that would exceed the hygienical standards," said the firemen speaker.
The British police delivered Assange's release notice
Today, the British police issued a notification to the founder WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who found a refuge in the Ecuador Embassy in London, where he asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard declared that he delivered “the notice of publication to 40 years to Australia, ” asking him to get him to the police station and that if he does not, he may be arrested.
Assange, under the British Law, exhausted his options when the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal against issue this month, and faced the issue to Sweden for the accusations of sexual crimes.
Because he feared that Stockholm would send him to the United States, he searched for a refuge on June 19th at the Ecuador Embassy in London, where he asked for asylum in the South Americas.
Scotland Yard “familiarly informed a 40-year-old man to be asked to be delivered to the police station at the day and hour that he had been assigned to him,” said the speaker.
Assange continues to violate the conditions of bail.
The Ambassador refused to make comments.
Assange fears that it will be issued from Sweden to the United States where he can face the prosecution of spying because he published 250,000 American diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The driver got a penalty of 1,000 pounds for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his feet
The engineer got a penalty of 1,000 pounds for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his feet.
Andrew Howie (35) from the city of Tiptree in Essex was seen in his Mercedes Benz on the road A120 in Braintree on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, she found out that he had a glass of drinks between his belts.
At the police court in Colchester Howie, he confessed to accuse him of driving inadequately and discreetly.
Seven points arrived on his account, resulting from a six-month ban on the management.
Howie was also ordered to pay for the costs of 90 pounds and a surveillance for the accused 100 pounds.
As a result of the tax on foreign real estate owners, the bress london bubble
The Ministry of Finance has previously calculated the tax from the contribution of the financial property, but awaits the final decision of Mr Osborn, which in the 2012 budget represented a 7 % fee for transfer of property for buildings at a price of over 2 million pounds and annual fees for buyers owning property within the company, not as individuals.
The profit from the transfer fee in the apartment fund in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which reached 708 million pounds in 2012/13, already exceeds the total sum for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northwest, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr. Cook said: “In view of an increase in real estate transfer in high-value homes and the presentation of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that property of high-value is not taxable, regardless of the effect of the aged tax system.”
He added that “this step could cause some foreign investors to avoid buying real estate in London, whereby existing owners are not selling”.
Prior property – upper 5 % to 10% of the housing market according to price – in a rich belt that reaches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has been recorded by 11,8 % in the last year.
The prices in the middle of London continue to show a steady growth of 5,6 % per year, but they were shaded by a growing “home market”, which, according to the research of the Savils reality office, experienced southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) increase.
Scientists lighter how tail movements are related to the mood of the dog
Earlier studies showed that joyful dogs have tailed more right (of the dog’s view), while nervous dogs have their tails mostly on their left.
But now scientists say that the other dogs can record and react these gentle differences in their tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, neurobiologist at Trent University, said: “For people, it is well known that the left and right side of the brain have a variety of incentives that cause positive or negative emotions. ”
We tried to observe the same in other species.
He added that, as in humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for the left movements and the opposite, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to get more information about how dogs react to an improper tail of other dogs, researchers monitored animals watching movies about other dogs.
They measured the pulmonary frequency of these animals and analysed their behaviour.
Apparently, it won't take long until we understand why their tails sometimes go on one side, and another to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We made dogs movies about dogs – whether in natural version or in the form of sillueta – to get rid of any madness incentives, and we also managed to adjust the tail movement and illustrate more right or left."
When the animals saw a different unexplicable dog moving the tail to the right (of the look of the dog swing the tail), she remained absolutely calm.
But when she recorded the tail tails mostly left (new from the sight of the dog swimming with the tail), their pulmonary frequency increased, and the animals were uncertain.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think the dogs would communicate consciously through these movements.
Rather, she believes that dogs learned from experience what movements they have to and whom they must not be careful.
He said: “If you meet dogs several times and move their tails in one direction is repeatedly connected with friendly behaviour and traffic produces less friendly behaviour, you will react on the basis of this experience. ”
Researchers say that findings can help the owners of dogs, veterinarians and trainers better understand the emotions of their animals.
A dog-behaving expert John Bradshaw, a high-school medicine teacher at Bristol University, said that it was not the first study that investigated whether the left and right side of the dogs was important.
Last year, the Lincoln University team found out that dogs were turning their heads to the left when they watched aggressive dog, and on the right when they were looking at a jolly dog.
And in another expertial negotiation from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “The dog robots with dogs were more likely to be listed when he was screwing his tail left than the right, when they were rather uncertain — exactly the opposite of the Italian study. ”
The difference can be given by the dogs in these different studies of animals in movies or dog robots not fully interpreted as dogs.
He explained that it could help studying how dogs react to real dogs.
“Although there are valid evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be explained – and dogs are not exceptional," he stated.
But since it's easy to record their behavior, it's probably not going to take long until we understand why their tails sometimes go to one side and another.

Pope František appoints the first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francisek, February 22, first named new cardinals of the Catholic Church.
The cardinals have the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church right after the pope and are those who choose the pope, so Francis will set up their first group of men who will finally help to choose his successor.
Now there are 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal is 80 years old, the choices of the pope cannot be made anymore – the group is reduced to 120 voluntary cardinals.
In a statement announced by the floor Federico Lombardi, speaker of Vatican, said that before the celebrating of the new cardinals, there will be a meeting of current cardinals known as a consitorium.
"Papa František decided to communicate his decision to appoint a February consitorium in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero from Catholic Voices said that the number of voluntary cardinals will probably fall down by February.
He said that the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it takes to increase the number of voters to 120 again, and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wants.
The Consitorium next year will be important, because it will be the first time after Francesch was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At this point, a certain orientation on Europe and in particular Italy is shown.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of the Roman Catholics are in South America, but they only have a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since Francesec established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, which has given the task of finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope decided everything for himself.
"Now Francisek has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that “it is quite possible, ” that these cardinals of the pope would ask for advice.
But we weren't in this situation before – it's a complete news.
Valero said that the popes traditionally elevated the position of the bishop's cardinals from large places, but Francesec is "full of a surprise - so we don't know who he names."
The GM company downloads some new easy trucks in the USA for repair of seats
According to the Friday notification from the U.S. Car Security Authority, General Motors downloads almost 19,000 of its new (2014) light cars Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra to fix the disturbance with manual loading of the branch.
In some of these vehicles, the mechanism of loading the front seats may have a disturbance.
As a result, the seats are not in line with the federal standards of autosafety for the heads.
The notification on the websites of the National Transport Safety Authority on the road (NHTSA) states that “when the vehicle from behind gets a hit, the head resistance must not protect the passengers correctly, which increases the risk of injury”.
The downloaded models were made between August 1 and 10 September.
The GM marketed the supplies in June, and for this front American car, it is the most important placement of the vehicle on the market from restructuring to bankrupt in 2009.
The company GM informed the owners of the van on the disturbance in the first half of October.
The NHTSA could not review the notifications of the owners because of the 16-day government infusion that weakened the sales of cars in October.
The sales of the supplies of Silverado and Sierra, which were processed for 2014 models, increased during the first 10 months of this year to approximately 20 per cent, said GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 models of Silverado and 16,503 Sierra models from its supplies.
The New York Bureau has increased on Friday afternoon by 1.4 per cent to 37.47 USD.
A desperate scream of Obam's voter
I voted both twice – I shared the hope of possible change
He says that Obama's sincere efforts have understood the obstructions of the Republican Party
Obstructive policy cannot excuse the passions of Obama's websites of healthcare or attacks of droneless aircraft
Obama's memoaries of 2008's 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying medicine in Harvard in the next year.
In these days I read a very sad book.
I thought about this book that during the cloud days of my second year, I was encouraged at the Medical Faculty and rebuilt hope in me.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and it is the memories of the presidential campaign Barackka Obama in 2008.
When I finish the patients' judgments tonight and I go to bed, the book returns me to the time politics inspired millions of people and your speeches took your breath.
The elections ended with a violent advantage, and the TV reporting forced us to think about the historic value of this moment.
My schoolmates cried with joy, and my parents hid the newspapers they got.
The young team of visioners headed to the White House, and the nation was ready to change.
During the 2008 entry into the Office, Obama had the support of 82 per cent.
And here I'm closing the book.
Going to the present is a rough awakening, like waking up from sleep.
It's difficult to remind these optimistic days – they seem to be remote memories, a sad reminder of lost opportunities.
In years after I put my first election ticket, there really have been changes.
It was definitely nothing I imagined.
I acknowledge that Obama has achieved a variety of great and variety of successes – from the law on accessible care through the movement of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy “not to ask, not to say anything” after the death of Usamama bin Ladina.
Furthermore, I am convinced that the parties' obstructions have reversed so many efforts to move our nation forward: it is an immigration reform, an option for the public to choose health care and close the base in Guantanam.
But after many situations, when I defended Obama's administration from my colleagues and friends, I was at an absolute limit in terms of the explanation that they could provide.
I've come to a place of political hopelessness.
The obstructions of the Republicans cannot explain the consent of listening to foreign leaders or the invasion of droneless aircraft that kill innocent children in abroad.
It cannot be explained to them that the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of the Americans, nor the persecution of those who will disclose the wrong acts of the government.
They cannot be responsible for the execution of Anvar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a proper court or for restricting public contributions and expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
They cannot be justified by finding a report that says that the efforts of the White House to silence the media are "neaggressive... than Nixon's administration".
And they can't apologize for the incapability of creating more than 3 years after signing the law on the simplicity of the site.
I don't know if this could be expected.
Was I supposed to think when I was 18 years old that the government's power could be in contrast with the political campaigns that preceded it?
The selected function apparently has no predictable progress and our public interviews will form an opposition political party and random events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples that I have indicated above are largely appeared to be the result of the own decision of the administration.
And that's what I'm most troubled.
I voted both again in 2012, but not because I was excited of his candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented a confused and unbreaked alternative, and it seemed to be unable to reinforce his policy or position.
I felt that the second functioning period for Obama, free from the pressure of the next elections, would fill the hopes we've heard.
However, the return to 2008 – with how Obama's support has fallen below 45% this week – through this book is increasingly difficult.
They make me remember the series of promises that have been lost.
This week, I read the chapter in the book about Obama suffering a cruel defeat with Clinton.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to the pace and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that the President of the Government of Tony Abbott is in conflict with interests due to the parental vacation programme
Miliarder and Ambassador Clive Palmer said that the President of the Government of Tony Abbott is in conflict with interests due to the parental vacation programme, because his daughters can be pregnant and raised from it.
The Banja's Magnat, which leads a dispute due to the remuneration of the carbon tax dimension of $6 million, made this claim when he tried to remove from the table the question of whether it was in conflict with interests.
The United Party of Palmer can control up to four votes in the Senate that play a key role in deciding whether taxes from carbon and quantities are to be collected.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could be in conflict of interest, and added that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could have personal benefit from this policy.
"He has encountered a great conflict of interest in paying parental vacation, because if any of his daughters were pregnant, he would have direct interest in whether she would receive a parental vacation," Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the elections of the electoral committee after the number of votes, Mr Palmer officially declared Mr. Palmer as a winner in the fighting chair for the Fairfax district in Sunshine Coast by gaining 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for an examination of the election results to accelerate the process.
daughters of Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after closing the election rooms?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come, get details on the computer, vote immediately and get results at half seven nights?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark voting tickets.
The point is that the results can be shummed if someone doesn't like it?
In these days and at this time, use of pencils seems unbelievable.
The Electoral Commission studied electronic vote options and recently issued a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political programme also refers to the Sunshine Coast airport and that he would take his new job “very seriously”.
The public office is public service.
"We do not strive for any reward except that we can serve society at this critical time," he said.
Are you washing your hands?
Scientists figured they washed your hand by changing and nalad.
The experiment attended 98 persons divided into three groups.
The first two were to solve the insolvency role.
Of course, both failed.
But a group who failed to wash his hands had a much more optimistic impression than the one where its participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the group with washed hands did better in the next test than the other one.
Still, those who washed their hands in other tests have made worse results than those who had not washed them.
The results of the "laundered" were at the level of the third group whose participants did not notice any previous failure.
The results of the test show psychologists that physical pureness really removes negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, motivations are declined, tests must be focused much more in other tests.
If we transferred the results of research to the Czech Republic, we'd probably be the most optimistic when we returned from the toilet.
After the use of the WC, it is not only one percent of the Czech and Czech, but it's a fifth road.
On hygiene, 85 percent of people are also used after working in the garden or in the workshop.
Smoothing a pet motivates 78.7% of people to wash their hands.
The recent research revealed that there is a difference in the perception of the Czech and the Slovak, as far as it is necessary to wash your hands after handing a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of the Czech Republic and 40.3 per cent of the Slovakians are washing their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"If it was in place, I'm afraid the reality is different and people are trying to make themselves a little better," commented the results of a skin doctor Claudia Komark.
RBS suspends two foreign currency traders
According to two persons familiar with the situation, the Scotland Royal Bank (RBS) has suspended two traders in his foreign currency division, which is another indication that the global investigation by the control authorities relating to suspicious monetary machinations is increasingly frequent.
Some of the biggest world banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with the competent authorities on the world's largest financial market investigations, where they change owners 5.3 billion USD every day.
The mention of two traders would be the first RBS employees suspended within an expansive investigation that will respond to the LIBOR's scandal with the manipulation rate (London's inter-bank interest rate).
The Bank refused to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that this month it received a request for information from the authorities.
"Our inconvenient search in this matter continues, and we fully cooperate with the FCA and our other authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, those who are close to this event indicated that RBS had transmitted the British Financial Behaviour to the British Authority e-mail records and rapid news sent from the accounts and to the accounts of the former trader.
This businessman, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is expected to be released from his current position by the European President of the trade with foreign currency in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European President of Fine Money Trade in Citi, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former leader for trade in currencies in Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any offence.
Mr. Usher's team for sending rapid news belonged to bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, said people dedicated to this event.
The UBS Bank expressed this week that after the Swiss Finma Control Authority announced that he was investigating suspicious machinery on the foreign currency market in several Swiss banks, she has taken steps against some of its employees.
Worldwide at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antimonopoly Office of Veko, FCA, the Ministry of Justice in the United States and the Monetary Authority in Hong Kong – are examining the claim that these bankers have connected to the monetary market.
The publics of the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched an internal investigation or have received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks are searching for years of old rapid news and e-mails to find cases of offences.
The investigation reports alarmed traders in the area which was one of the biggest engines for the production of profits in the conclusions of the investment banks in the past years, but which was disturbed by reducing the speculation opportunities for speculants.
Some bankers tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation when they claimed that, with a large and highly liquid market with foreign currency, it is essentially impossible to manipulate, but highly positions traders say that this must not be true.
The highly built trader said that despite a significant volume of daily trade with foreign currency of liquidity between different commercial platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms, "you can start having an impact on the market at relatively low prices."
The report arrived the same day when the Credit Suisse announced that this week she released the trade department of a trader, which at the end of last year caused the loss of nearly 6 million USD.
The Bank immediately notified the competent authorities and cooperates with their control authorities.
"We are convinced that this trader acted on his own and that this problem was solved," the credit Suiss said.
The number of HIV infected in Prague exceeded a thousand dollars
The doctors in Prague have recorded more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of the surveillance in 1986 to the end of this third quarter, the tests confirmed the disease in total of 1005 people from the metropole.
This comes from the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to it, 2 063 people have been infected throughout the CIS so far.
The 396 immunity failure has already broken.
198 people died.
The number of infected in Czech Republic has grown annually in the past decade.
In 2002, the tests confirmed the infection of 50 people, and 121 were five years later.
In 2009 the investigation revealed 156 new diseases and then 180 in 2010.
The prelone number dropped to 153, last year, but it was recorded.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"The total number of newly diagnosticated cases this year exceeds 200, I believe it is no doubt," the expert on AIDS problem Miroslav Headaty, who has been leading the Prague House of Light for patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, the tests revealed the disease in 39 people and last year in 47, the Headaty said.
In September, the doctors recorded 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the tracking to the end of September, HIV tests confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS has broken up in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected was in Prague.
Whoever really wants to know a city, should go to the cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk of a starting center with memories, churches and galleries, more than a bedecre.
Many people read from the graves.
The graveyards slowly stretch and gain intimate view of local reality.
They find out what people live here, what nationality are, how great and coherent families belong to, what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were for them.
In what way they express their social positions as they taste.
And from the state of the graves, the way they look after their dead.
The Supreme Court has supported Obama's Healthcare Act
The Supreme Court in the United States decided that the healthcare law signed by Barack Obama is in accordance with the Constitution, which is a victory for Obama's administration.
With respect to the vote 5:4, the Court decided that the individual Regulation of the Patient Protection and Available Care Act – which orders citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, otherwise threatens them to pay the penalty – does not resist the constitution on the basis of government tax authority.
The Chairman of Judge John Roberts stood on the side of four liberalised members of the court, while judges of Skalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The Court also supported the remaining parts of the law on 2700 pages and further decided that the legal requirement for health care, which orders States to expand the possibility of obtaining hospital insurance, is threatened to eliminate all the financing of the hospital insurance from federal resources, is not compulsory and in contrast with the Constitution.
The complaint was filed by 26 States and the National Federation of independent enterprises in order to block this law.
During the primaries in 2012, the law emphasized each of the main Republican candidates, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
For the words "Mugabe is a cold asshole" no longer intimidated prison, the court has cancelled the law
Until now, Zimbabwani had to take good care of the public talking about the ninety - nine - year - old Mugabe, who rules the country since the early 1980s, then stands in her head since the end of 1987.
According to paragraph 33 of the Criminal Law, the penalty of $100 to one year of deprivation of the presidential office was threatened.
"State representatives should not be zealously accused of people who comment on the president in houses or in other public places," the representatives of the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
The government is likely to renounce the decision of the court, the British BBC informed.
A number of damaged Zimbabwans, including Tendai Danga, whom the police arrested two years ago for the alleged insult of the president in the bar.
In May, an opposite activist who ended up in jail in Mugabe's public with a "cleaned asshole".
In August then, the prosecutor accused a sixteen - year - old man for his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as a toilet paper.
The Court also declared the constitutional law restricting freedom of the media.
"The State cannot punish people whose statements later appear to be false," the Deputy Minister of Justice, Luke Malal, said.
Until now, the Zimbabwe Law has allowed the person who publishs false information to be sentenced to 20 years of prisoner.
"The existence of a law allowing to criminalize someone for false declaration has a freely freely freely affected the right to express itself," Malala added.
Nevertheless, Mugabe has ruled the country with hard hands for over 33 years, it has adopted a new institute with wider civil freedoms in March Zimbabwe on the basis of the referendum.
A small step from a man's dictatorship came in 2009, when the agreement between Mugabe and the opposition brought to the premier chair of Morgan Tsvangira.
However, the economic crisis continues to suffer from the world's highest inflation until 2008, which has exceeded 100,000 per cent.
Therefore, in 2009 the government totally canceled the national currency.
Today, in Zimbabwe only the currencies of other countries are paid.
The contributed economy goes to Mugabe's verb of unreasonable agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redeployed the land of white farmers between his favourites and war veterans.
But most of them had no experience with farming.
Central banks maintain swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent tool to allow banks to access global currencies whenever they need.
The banks stated this in their joint declaration.
"It is a very reasonable step," commented Julian Callow, the main international economy of the London Bank Barclays.
"Meanwhile, all the transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is not, in my opinion, any surprises," added the Benda Wartoch, the main BH Securities economy.
The central bankers reinforce the bonds that began to occur in 2007 when the international credit market first struck.
The central bank agreements allowed access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needs them.
The decision of central bankers comes when the US Fed is preparing to terminate its programme of support for the US economy, which could expel the price of money on the global market even higher.
The Swap contract is standardly used to overcome the lack of liquidity of one currency at the current excess of the liquidity of the second currency.
It can be considered as an entry of one currency and the loan of the second currency.
The ECB launches a third attempt to restore confidence in the European banks.
The EU agreed on bank supervision, the ECB will supervise 150 banks.
How Tipsport (no) discards personal data.
More than a year ago, I made a registration on the Tipsport.cz page.
But I didn't finish this afterwards, because someone who couldn't finish the registration on the Internet was sitting on the branch.
And since I didn't want to ride to another branch, the registration failed, then I moved, and I changed my address and the civil license number.
When I wanted to finish my registration later, I was told that I couldn't do it because I had another OP number, an address, and that I just couldn't finish it and that I should ask for a clearing of the data and make a new registration.
I did so, and 24.10.2013 I wrote on technical support that I am requesting to delete all my personal data from the database according to the valid personal data protection law.
That's a funny day that technical support wrote to me that I have a registration to finish in the branch office.
This started an e-mail marathon for technical support, where after the 4th U.S. 25.10. they wrote that personal data were deleted on my request.
So a man would think that he could perform that new registration and this has started problems again, first, it wrote to me that my user name has already been embedded (the understanding was not deleted - it's not about personal data, but they finally excluded this).
So I used a different user name and it jumped to me that my personal data have already been stored to complete the registration on the branch (how may they have stored something that claims they were deleted?), and I contacted again technical support.
On my question, how is it possible they wrote to me that they really deleted 25.10 and that I would send an email with the error.
I did that ( yesterday around 15 hours) and I was told today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 a.m. and that that is why it is not possible, because I used the same name and date of birth.
What about the fact that I've been in contact with technical support for a week and I'm dealing with them that it's not still possible.
And what about the fact that if the truth (if it is not) could be registered by no one with a matching name or the same birth date if this is already registered.
By the way, in those 13.22, I really registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used a thoughtful e-mail and phone number, and the world wondered, the site appeared to me that they sent me an email link to completion of the registration.
But how is this possible if you cannot register the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport owes the registration to an e-mail and phone number and doesn't just delete the data as it claims.
So I reiterated this with technical support that they just lie (be deliberately or not know what they write) because what they write is not true.
I've reported a few screens that the registration problem has been before 31.10, so "fake" registration doesn't have an impact on this.
Tipsport wrote to me a strict sentence - I'm sorry, but by being registered again, we can't check your claims.
And he terminated the communication.
The respect reiterates the same sentence that the registration applies to the name and date of birth.
They can't even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the e-mail, and so it didn't actually run.
So if I summarize it, the Tipsport is not only that it has not deleted the data as it claims, but still lies when it claims the opposite.
The worse thing is, it's easy to prove how they're lying and trying to make it look like the mistake is on the customer's side.
By the way, after the introduction of this matter on my personal blog, things have made a little move and from the Technical Support e-mail came that the issue is transmitted to verification and I will be informed (after the week of an urgent and arguing and awareness of the same error).
Music plays in the meter on the Bridge
The Transport Company, p. m. (DPP) Prague, launched the project Music in the metro.
The first newsbull, where the meter is continuously played by reproduced instrumental music, is the Bridge of Line A at the output to the Václava Square.
Test operation takes six months.
Michal Horacek presented his new double, band and three singers
The textary Michal Horacek brought not only his entirely new twoCD Czech calendar, but especially in the series among us the singers Lenka Nova, Františka Segrada and Ondra Rumla, accompanied by the excellent Matheja Bank Orchestra.
After the introduction of the input and the actress on the late musician, he gradually invited Michal Horacek to the stage all three singers, himself came with a candle in his hand and reminded the story about the last time they played in the Kolin and the theater and all over the city, the electric current came out.
"In other ways, two types of cards were made in the Colin," he recalled.
He also reminded the cousin of President Zeman.
"Maybe we could make a tour after the Zakolans or the Dubravca at Bratislava," he joked about the families of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horacek, who did not leave the scene and if he hadn’t spoken, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical rest.
The calendar also made Joseph Manes, who gave it on the eagle, about the ice hockey, but then he didn't know anything about meeting us on those squares and scanding who did not jump there is no Czech.
That's the name of one song from the Czech calendar, but we won't play here today," he laughed.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang for him a lot of suitable sleep in the day, singing at night and accompanied her on a guitar.
Otherwise, if he wasn't singing, he played a peanut, and all three singers then accompanied a band in the key, violoncello, guitar and contrabas.
All three vocalists sing a little singing together to the side of the heart sits, which immediately broke out the view.
"I'm glad that the song took you, which didn't surprise me in Kmoch's city," then Michal Horacek responded.
After the memory of Peter Hapku, I recognised in the application of Francesco Segrad, originally rewarded by Richard Müller by a huge applause, Hannah Heger recalled the music of Dad and Lyda Baar with the Horatic Explanation on the Communist Prohibition and the replacement of Baar's American actress Mae West.
The composer of Michael Kocaba again reminded the Sebastian song, Segrado then sang a beautiful song of Prague, decorated by Jard Freedom, a sad family and the former Kolinjak.
But that was already the conclusion, the applause in standing and the additive in the form of the optimistic song We live in a wonderful time.
The playlist was ready for another supplement, but the fans didn't applaud.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole four seated behind the table to sign not only the Czech calendar but also the older CD, Michal Horacek's books, and even the packaging of legendary LP, and with any interesters even photographed.
Berdich with the Stephanka will complement Rosol and Hayek
At the Final of Davis' cup against Serbia, the non-playing captain of Czech tennis Jaroslav returned to the square Tomasz Berdich, Radek Štepanec, Lukas Rosol, Jan Hajek.
The Czech trophy representatives are defending, but they are going to play the rival field in the Belgrade Arena, where the match will be carried out on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
In the final, the Czechs have been third in the last five years.
"We know we're going to the hot ground, that it's wild, and we must always focus on our performances."
"We will go there with the only goal - get three points and sell the best," said Stefan, winner of the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama, how to bomb Syria.
American command in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelites showed exactly how Syria was supposed to be bombed.
Without unnecessary humbuk, threats and millions of statements they sent aircraft, they hit the target and returned.
Without letting them collapse with the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the entire action and do not speak to it anymore.
Exactly contrary confused and huge, acts not supported by Obama's Syrian policy.
And the most satisfactory in the entire attack was what the Israelites bombed.
Don't let the media confused with their claims that the "Syrian base" or "based for Hizbalah" was bombed.
Recently, I wrote here that while the US rebellion remains on the rhetorical level, Russia continues to deliver Syria's weapons jolly.
And the fresh shipment of Russian missiles exposed to the port Latakia became the target of Israel's attack.
Clear message.
And note, Israel was bombing Assad's regime again, not the rebels, even though it should be the opposite according to popular Internet theories.
The American government has marked two members of spatial units, probably Delta Force.
They had no idea that they had been marked during the attack on an American consulate in Bengaz.
The heroic death of two former SEALs who protected the ClA area in the city, I think it was a member of the ClA secret command, which was formed by former soldiers.
A long time has been speculated what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even in the other placed CIA residence.
Now it's clearer.
Anyway, information that the ClA has its office protected by bullet nests in Libya (the report on one of these two SEALs died after a minomet) is relatively surprising.
But even more surprising, the information about them is about two unknown heroes so far.
They were parts of the American Command in Tripolis, and once they received a report on the attack in Bengaz, they volunteered to intervene, and together with five private contractors, they shot their way to the ClA area in Bengaz.
Obama's administration is blamed by the fact that during that attack, it wasn't officially and all, and it was just hesitating what to do.
Commander, without orders, apparently will release these volunteers.
Anyway, the fact that the country does not act singlely, but the permanent American command, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting.
And that's because nothing of this has been officially admitted until recently, and even now it is only talking about some kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it's good that the U.S. even though halfway trying to eradicate terrorism in Libya.
Even if it would be much more help to solve the national situation.
The last place of a secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
It's not so long ago that the media almost singed the Iranian air forces for pursuing American drones.
But it is not known how the Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if it happens to be able to appear its drone in the airspace, there's nothing to do with it.
However, if the Iranian drone is discovered in international space, the situation is completely different.
So it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom was chasing an American drone in the international sea space, where there may have been the first sharp placement of the American super-raptor F-22 Raptor in history.
He had the Phantom to check his weapons optically without registering Phantom on the radar or just noticed it, and then, suddenly, when he appeared at his place and called the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened to him without repetition.
It is no wonder that Phantom is a plane of American production that remembers the war in Vietnam.
It can't be compared to Raptor.
We want to show that Plyzze still can win, promises Rytoral
It's kind of paradox.
While his team has been mostly unsuccessful lately, the defenseer or booker Victoria Plizeń František Rajtoral has a form that brought him back to the representative after a year.
He also managed with a gunshot, he's heavily active, and after his invasion, he was ordered a punishment cop in Teplicas.
Victoria touched in the last two rounds against Slavia and Tepplies after victory, but eventually she took one point from these two duels.
Francis Ritoral believes that his team will break the unpleasant series with Jablons.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe that the Jablonec will be defeated at home," promised Francisek Raitoral.
The man is carefully preparing for a heavy game with the Northern Czechs playing the attack football.
Everything's going to combat with Jablonce, the coach is preparing us well, as we always take a lot of money from the video analysis of the game of the rival.
"I believe that this will be a great game on Friday night," the Czech fan of the Tribunes of Doosan Arena appeals.
The last matches didn't go as she wished, but the word of Victoria's defense crisis refused.
That's how the football goes, sometimes you have a good shape, and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis at all.
"I believe we win on Friday, and it'll be good again," said the West-Cheef Defense.
Victoria's man will rely on supporting fans.
"He's playing Friday night, and I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we're going to pay them the win," Reitoral adds.
Johna Fifth: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it that way, it's not actually a step, it's actually a big jump -- a jump a few years ago, and that to memories, to my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was, don't worry about coming out of school and washing the dishes, exhausting and making jobs.
Even though these "obligations", it was mostly just the theory, the desire of parents.
Praxe was completely different - to run out of school, throw a bag in the corner and run out.
Playing games with other kids, jumping a drink.
Then, at Helen's series and her boys, they're sewing a feminine brush for grandmother's birthday.
And then after a few warnings to wash the dishes at last, explode, in winter to put the tree into the tiles stone and tasks to do until after the darkness under the lamp (or rely on a student and instead of the tasks to write in loved verses addressed to school love).
To breakfast the home poultry marmelade (from the real fruit, not the mosques that are selling now, whose content is not even lay) and to drink it with tea from dried plants that my mom and I so loved collecting.
I also remember the magic nights when the grave silence was in the room, when we were recording musical songs from the radio to the tapes that were recorded loudly in an old mom's tape.
And then on the pencil, we turned those tapes around and kept playing the same song, our favorite, and they've been drinking with a siffon.
Or we phoned over the table using the pillows that were tied to each other with a tie - and when we're on the phone call to hear each other better, we needed to clean our ears thoroughly, then the squirrel was a syringe plus vata.
The minimum remuneration was more than three times lower than now, and my parents were able to live out of it so we didn't miss anything.
We didn't need any of those iPhones, iPads, even cell phones, laptops or tag clothes.
The clothing was inherited from a generation to a generation and the best "pleasant" in the closet was a baticized shirt of domestic production using SAVA.
From the electronics, we had enough for the satisfaction of the mother’s tape and the mostly Walkman that we shared with the sister, which we used in the school trip train, by the way.
We have come more interesting to play with Aunt Hop or Man, don't be angry, or as I've already brought "only" out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, surely the parents saved it for a long time, but unfortunately, he didn’t warm up at us for a long time.
My younger sister screwed a screw on him, said he packed those tapes so beautifully, so she tried to see if he was screwing.
Unfortunately, it was his last part.
Well, this event is still on his dad's plate.
She says that when Lenka was little, she broke a screw in the video and thought she'd play her prescription, and she didn't win it, so she can't burn it up today.
I remember how we all have been able to communicate together, negotiate without a phone, a computer.
My sister and I agreed with our grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's holidays, when we met again next year in the summer of grandmother -- and that's what it was.
We're together.
Do you promise to see someone in a year?
I also remember the winter when we were running out with the entire village, building snowmen, riding on a snow climb near the church on the bags of shadow.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the last day.
Of course, we listened to our sister before every dinner, the notoriously famous sentence, "But wash your hands!"
Yes, that's true today, but you certainly don't have a sauce bound in the limonet grid.
After dinner, when my dad worked in the garage with Yarda from the village, we lay down with my mother on the floor, washed our feet on the tiles stone, opened doors and looked at the flame and listened to the blowing of the tree that came from the stone.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated together -- we talked -- we didn't write messages every day through various houses, SMSs.
There was nothing like that, and yet we knew much more about each other.
And that's how I could go on for a long time.
It's beautiful to remember, especially if I supplement these memories by seeing an album where the black corners are deliberately sticked with black-white photos.
And if I didn't know how old I was at the back of the picture, it's always written a year of taking a picture.
I'm looking at that, even though the cupcakes didn't listen to us, and we also had cousin's pants for two bigger numbers, no one used to laugh at us before, it was so normal (no IN).
And I'd rather go back to the reality.
Until 2013 and I'll wait for the modern time to come up with one for my children.
What I'm sure is that these memories are now for a young teen generation, at least some "a hundred years behind the monkeys" and I don't think they're losing much of this "preop" time too.
I'd love them!
Google, Samsung and Huawei are sued for Nortel's patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents of the fallen Nortel, filed a complaint on Thursday for violations of the patent against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, a company that was revoked in auction within Nortel's bankruptcy.
Consortium Rockstar, which bought Nortel's patents for 4,5 billion USD, complained to the US District Court in Texas of Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for the violation of the patent.
The Rockstar company is shared with Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of a violation of seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps connect the terms searched on the Internet with the relevant advertisement, states the complaint, which is the core of the Google search business.
The representatives of the company Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately to reach.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that work on the Google Android operating system, which is strongly competitive for mobile products by Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google made a default price offer for Nortel's patents for $900 million.
Google has increased his offer several times and eventually offered up to 4,4 billion USD.
After being defeated by Rockstar's Patents Nortel, Google won for 12.5 billion USD Motorola Mobility, which was a trade motivated partially by a group of Motorola patents.
"Despite failure in trying to acquire in auction patents which are subject to a dispute, Google patents broke and continues to breach," the complaint states.
The Rockstar company seeks to increase the injury from Google because it says that there is a violation of the patent by Google intentionally, as the lawsuit claims.
Miloslava Cejpk: November smile
She came outside from 4 degrees of Celsia, which we haven't used to.
At first she put her smile away, the one who was still putting on the stand as a defense against a friendly neighborhood.
It made her so much relieved because it was a mask that she decided not to put in public.
He was honest at home only on the day she had grandmothers around Elinka or Adica.
And of course, when her sons called.
She was very well remembering a lesson from infinite trade skills courses.
Now they're really good.
To keep her closest.
Then he flew to the corner.
It's like a mascare dress.
November, or another month, can't make the miracle to smile really like when they were on a trip with one who hasn't been here for almost three years.
Egypt shall enter the office of the first freely elected President
Muhammad Mursie made an inauguration oath, but his triumph day just hardly ends political disturbance in Egypt.
ISLAMISTA Muhammad Mursi promised “new Egypt ” when the first freely elected president of this country, after Husnji Mubarak, which was gathered 16 months earlier.
During his introduction to the Office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Murcia also became the first freely elected Islamic President in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of the State from the disposal of the monarchy approximately 60 years ago.
He made a vow before 18 judges dressed in black talars in a seat built with a view to Nil, reminded of the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for better tomorrows, new Egypt and the second republic," Murcia said at the celebrating ceremony transmitted live in state television.
"The Egyptian people today have laid the foundation of a new life -- absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, which has been aimed at acute attacks of individual governments for most 84 years since its creation as an illegal organization.
When Murcia arrived in a small car column shortly after 11 hours of local time, they guarded the building of hundreds of soldiers and cops.
Only a few hundred supporters met in front of the court building to celebrate the President, and, unlike the presidential performance of Mubarakov's period, the transport was only shortly stopped so that the colony could run a typical road linking the center of the city with the predecession in the south.
The personal prestige of Mursi, named ridiculously as the non-charismatic “reserve tires” of the Muslim Brotherhood, has rapidly grown since his victory and his Friday speech, which was intended to present him not only as a candidate of Islamist but also all those who want to bring up the end of the rebellion against the authoritary Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Murcia said, dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie of judges in a tree covered chamber where he sweared.
Mursi later traveled to the Cahir University, where he had to speak inauguration.
While he was attentive, he got an official welcome from the military band that played the national hymne.
Attempt was a military commander of the field marshal Husajn Tantawi.
His arrival was accompanied by scanding “arms and people are one hand ” of the mouth of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture Hall of the university.
The university in Cairo was founded in 1908 as a secular education center and later in the 1970s became the garden of Islamic student movements.
Mursi made a symbolic oath on Friday at the Tahrír Square, where the revolution was born, which ended the authoritary government of Mubarak last year, and solemnly promised to reappear the presidential powers taken by his office by the military council that took it from the exempted leader.
But by consenting a formal oath before the court, rather than before Parliament, as usual, he was subjected to the will of the army, which suggests that the fight for power will continue.
Mursi's speech on the Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populistic gestures.
There's probably gonna be police specialists in the ghettes. They're supposed to mitigate tensions.
In the ghetts in Czech Republic, police specialists should work in the future.
They'd have spent half their business here.
They'd be watching the order and dealing with the problems.
With their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and inhabitants in the area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of Interior counts on it.
He believes that improvement in the country would help mainly "accelerated social residence".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 poor homes and quarters in Czech Republic a few years ago.
They lived in 80,000 people, especially Roma.
Adults in ghette were unemployed, families were dependent on doses, children ended in "specific" schools.
It's a squirrel.
According to the experts of the problem locations, a hundred has arrived at the meantime.
Relationships between their inhabitants and others are sharp.
There were anti-romic marches in several places.
The extremists were joined by people in the area.
According to the inside, the police are difficult in the fields with the ghetty safety and order to maintain.
It is said that the fundamental condition is "continued application of equal access to law enforcement".
But they say that without a detailed knowledge of the place and people, there is no way to reach it.
The specialist would go to a ghett meeting, where he would spend half his service, the rest would serve in his circuit.
He'd be watching the order in a troubled location.
He would also know the local, so he could solve better problems or offences.
"Thanks of trusted experts will be easier to avoid a number of illegal negotiations," stated the inside.
Specialists in ghets would receive supplements, 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police officers into the troubled areas is to be drawn up from Norwegian funds.
The budget is approximately 600,000 euros (now approximately 15.5 million crowns).
Czech Republic pays 15 per cent of the sum, funds 85 per cent.
Preparations started this year, now a detailed proposal is being processed.
The project shall take place until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded sites is incomparablely higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roma settlements," said the authors of the report.
How many specialists should be in Czech Republic, it's not clear yet.
The answer is to analyse that determines the places where a special police officer needs to be.
It will also matter how much money for these members will be able to release the police once the project is completed annually.
According to the project's proposal, the electoral officers first graduate in Slovakia.
This training should take five dozens of members annually.
They're the most appropriate candidates.
There should also be special education for police officers who will work in gettes.
According to the authors, social living would help to improve the situation.
They say it should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the idea of the inside, it would have three categories.
The minimum standard would meet accommodation with precisely defined rules, such as the number of persons per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
The higher standard should have social apartments that would be comparable to normal living.
The rentals would have to implement the integration plan that social workers would make with them.
They would have to keep the accommodation order, take care of their health, send children to schools, requalify themselves and actively seek jobs.
If they were trying to integrate, they would step into a higher standard of living.
The progressive housing system should operate within at least 30 years until the next generation grows "in the integrated environment".
The social residence model is preparing resorts for local development and work.
They're going to propose it by the end of the year.
Karel Drabek: Carbon Top is one of our youngest soups.
The coal top is an impressive cup of 3 km southeast of Bruntal.
Together with several other, the juvenile activity in the Low Yesenk (geologically) is recently reported.
The last eruption was here at the beginning of the fourth mountain.
In view of the greater distance, the peak of the Carbon Top is marked by a baroque passing church of Virgin Marie Helpne, exposed in the years 1755 - 1765.
He replaced the original wooden passport.
The host who stood next to the church didn't behave.
Shortly after the end of the church, the alley was ripped out of four rows of lips, about 1 km long.
The cross trip on the Ugler Mountain is already a third version, originally standing here after 1916, second, from 2001 only by 2004.
At 15 stops there are wooden plastics made by the local artist artist František Nedomlel.
He used different kinds of trees from the Low Ocean area.
Similarly, the mines of this area form an interesting geological exposion.
The name of the sponsor is also indicated at each stop.
The coal top is the rest of the young leaf.
Although the data from radiometric measurement ages somewhat different, the last eruption here was about 1,5 million years ago.
He is therefore younger than the Big Road (a.k.a. 3.3 million years old) and older than Venus’s soupka (a.k.a. 0.8 million years old).
The vulture was born with an explosion.
She exposed a significant quantity of soup ashes along with the fractions of mines from the floors that have gained red brown color by burning.
At the end of this stage, the lion has emerged on the surface - today it is a layer of a poured seed up to 13 meters strong.
The second eruption threw red, brown and places to black tuffes.
Their layer is strong up to 50 meters, and its part is accessible in the wall of the break.
In the tubes there are fancy soup pums large up to 1 m, and the second eruption was finished by the lave.
At the end of the vulture activity, a lion that today forms a powerful layer of a stroke.
The soups in which the soup ashes are the most frequent type of soupes.
Because they're actually composed of layers, they got the name of the stratovulcan.
The original sopetic cord was gradually erosed.
However, he was threatened by a heavy mines in a lomine on the south side.
The most intensive trading was held in 1953 - 1962.
The tuffs joined the concrete, which then was lighter and had better heat isolation qualities.
The exercise was successful under the pressure of experts and the public to stop this unique place.
However, the problem is in the poorness and the small cohesion of the mines that are rapidly floating, falling apart and moving down.
It's pretty fast that loom goes away.
In order to make the situation even more complicated, the warm, south-oriented scroll is the ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
So the fixing is a problem, but in time it will be necessary to choose and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
On the coal top, you will get a green tourist mark from Bruntal, if possible from Slezsky Kočov.
Automobilists can use unpaid parking area at the beginning of the lip alley, where a short learning path begins.
She moved from the villa to the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a bounty villa with a garden and a pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villa neighborhoods in Orzechovka.
The original owners of the house, however, gained him back in the restitution, and the renters had to move away with a small retreat.
So Ivana quickly searched for a replacement for herself and her older mother then.
She received a tip from the famous people on the apartment 3 + kk in the older panel house on the other side of Prague.
"It was a shock at first, but the look from the fourth floor to the large woods and the barrier inspired me on the other hand," he recalls Ivan's first impression.
First I thought it would be a commission for three years.
"We live here for more than 13 years today, and not only for a gradual reconstruction I would not change," the owner adds.
Mother and daughter then moved from a hundred-four-metre apartment to a smaller area of 62 m2 and also distributed all equipment.
Action was not easy, things were stored in friends and gradual arrangements took almost a year.
The new apartment was in a pretty good condition, but necessary adjustments had to take place, such as the lactation of doors or the exchange of windows.
The previous owner struck the core, but the owner was most distracted by unpractily resolved and unnecessarily large seats, and the other way, the small bathroom.
The two rooms connected the multifunctional housing space.
The architects used to define the individual zones and the sharing of the sadrocarton room, which enabled the new location of lights.
The first intervention to which she decided after a few years was the removal of the steel in the living room.
Although the apartment has changed its disposal to 2 + kk, the room has reached the air and the panoramatic view of the surrounding green.
The next step towards the partial improvement of the standard was the refund of the floor from PVC for laminate.
She didn't know Ivan's advice with the bathroom.
I've been taking magazines about living for years and looking for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
So I addressed the young architect Camille Douder to the recommendation.
"It was actually the most important step to the future," says Ivana.
By reconstruction of the bathroom, it was also possible to modify the availability of the seats.
The architect connected the room toilet and the bathroom and two doors with open wings replaced with one slider, saveing the place.
The bathroom is overtime, and also enough barrier.
Quality covers imitate the sand, in the shower there is also a comfortable seat, a bidet shower.
Successful collaboration with Camilo Douzer continued.
In the context of the series How the dream was built, a quick but substantial change in the living room, where the architect Martin Čenek also participated.
We had to get three responsibilities, dining rooms, living rooms, and sleeping without helping with the classical principles of optical division, buying by halfways or Japanese walls.
"It would have broken the openness and unity of the space as a result," the architect explains.
It was originally possible to separate the bed and the living part.
It was only to turn the backs to two coffins and to put a box for pearls in peace.
The dining corners define the shadows of the floor and painting.
The architect of quality marmoleum used on the floor in the kitchen and a dining corner, and the slippery door was restored with a pattern.
The kitchen corner shall cover the wallpaper slider panels if necessary.
A new floor from an anti-allergic marmolea is compared to the previous laminate series of benefits: a soft irrigated surface without sparks and better sound isolation.
The system of cubes and previews of the carton highlighted by color is an indication of how you can work with space in the panel.
I left the colors on the architects. I wish it was joyful.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in my previous apartment," says Ivana.
The graphoscle cover with the motive of bright magnolia is practical and creates a significant estetic element.
For a warm energy tone, the architects chose a white, which has ripped out the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, books were stored, inter alia, in the space under the window parapets.
Everything's on the reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled on the distance.
In the processed interior, the contrast of the new one with the elder, for example, with a tens of years old crystal mirror, and with quality artistic objects that Ivana gathers all his life.
The last one came in the kitchen.
The boxes were used to be placed on both sides, and the owner felt a little like in the tunnel.
The architect picked up their number and overloaded the location.
The furniture in a simple design is made on a procurement, the white area reconciliates a slightly pearl surface.
In a small space, the washing, dryer, and washing came into.
The appearance of the small kitchen restored the whole glass of walls over the workboard.
The unique graphoschlo with a digitally printed motive is attractive and is also well maintained.
Ivana chose flowers of magnolia that remind her of her favorite neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now it seems she's happy here.
In the original bathroom there was a small van and a washing machine, the new owner chose a neutral shade of the cloth.
A big shower corner has a glass door of Ronal.
The task was to create a clear simple space from the environment where the functions and devices will be harmonised.
Inside, we united material and colorfully and tried to make his elegant, convenient, not too filled appearance.
"A further condition was a barrier solution with minimal obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around furniture and the achievement of the subjects of daily need," Camila Doudzir adds.
The Supreme Court decided: Sometimes you can pursue.
The Supreme Court decided that the former Prime Minister Petra Nearly could also be pursued for any criminal acts that could be committed before the August's resolution of the Parliament.
It was protected only by the processing immunity that refers to the speeches in the House.
In the case of former members of ODS Ivan Fuxy, Mark Schnaidr and Peter Tluchor, he decided that they could not be punished for any criminal offences until they gave up the performance of the messenger's mandate in November, Peter Knötig said.
The Court rejected the proposal by the State Representative Iva Istzen, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the Members.
He believes they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative posts in state firms for giving up the mandate and not making problems with the approval of laws.
On the contrary, a former prime minister who offered these posts can be pursued.
With Vim Barta, an officer of the anticorruption police has also been arrested.
Bart's defender Oldrich Chudoba, who also represented him in the cause of alleged corruption of VV Members, also did not express too much in the case, but said, "Yes, I represent the client in this matter, but given the protection of the secret facts I cannot further comment."
According to information, the case is addressed by the General Inspection of Security Assemblys (GIBS).
The server noted that Barta could buy hidden information from the police.
According to the Prime Minister.cz, the case could be linked to the cause of the former police president, Peter Lessy, whose appointment to Bart's function was allegedly aimed at.
The latest information of the Law, however, shows that detention of Vita Barta is not related to Peter Lessy.
The speaker of the police presidency, Eva Kropačová, refused to comment on the case of Prague City Representativeship.
"We will not comment on this question in view of the protection of secret facts," said the speaker of the City State Representativeship in Prague, Stjepanka Zenklová, on Friday.
The applicant of Bart is just supervising the matter, and indirectly, it shows that the record or criminal proceedings are conducted in the secret regime.
Reporter Newsnik managed to reach Vita Barty's wife, Katerina Klasnova in the morning before their place in Prague Clara.
She was just putting her bags in the car and leaving.
She refused to express herself to the whole event.
On Friday morning, Bart's detention was expressed by the leader of the Mountain of Tomio Okamura.
He does not know what the cause is.
"Vit Barta was one of the many candidates of many parties in our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy, Tomia Okamura," he added.
Viet Barta, who, in the past early elections to the House of Plizenia, failed to run for the movement of the Dawn of Direct Democracy Tomia Okamura, is known as his corrupt cause of repayment of the messengers by the public.
In April 2012, he was unjustifiedly sentenced to 18 months with a 30-month delay.
Afterwards, the judgment was changed and Barta was released.
He slept: I want a NHL contract.
I still have a thirst and thrill.
Prospala was always in the first place of the family, so she wants to be fully obedient at 38 years of age.
Either he gets a job in the outside, and he's still going to extend his career, or he's definitely finishing with hockey.
"I want to play the role of my dad and my husband."
"I'm looking forward to it," says a hockeyist who still waits for a bid.
Despite the fact that he's an announced employee who's never going to fool anything.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on the ice, and he can take off his colleagues.
And also despite the fact that he was the most productive Columbus player in the past season.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is still," he states decisively.
Maybe he will wait, allegedly for it is New York Rangers who have failed to enter the season and have injured two resistances - the attackers of Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
How does your arrival look at the Rangers?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on the paper, it's not worth dealing with it.
I know the article's out in the New York Post journal that they should sign me, but that's all.
It was no longer added that it really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it's just not.
Didn't even call you from the club?
Such communications in NHL is going on for a day.
It's about getting into a situation where the contract really comes.
When a player gets hurt or someone can't do it, and the manchaft doesn't break.
There are a lot of different factors that have to meet together to get the contract.
But in New York there are similar circumstances, right?
Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan were injured and the team didn't get into the season, so there's some chance, don't you think?
Of course, the chance is always.
But the second thing is, you always need two sides to do it.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't got one yet.
Unfortunately, this is the reality I have to live in.
On Friday, you're flying to America, you're expecting something just to wake up?
I have the expectations since July 5th when the NHL market opened with free players, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remind yourself?
No, I'm going to Tampa's kids and my wife.
I'm looking forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
He's given by being a father and a husband, and everything's going away from it.
I'm not a hockeyist right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to play the role of my dad and my husband, and I'm looking forward to it.
We have two hockey games on Sunday, that's for me and my whole family holiday, when we can go support our children in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in full-time imports?
Yeah, man can think about a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 matches for the knee surgery.
And it made me very and very fun.
Once it gets in such a stage that all the goals, winning and receipts will not replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the purpose of life.
Whatever your job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could have met me except my family.
You had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play NHL only because it's NHL, or it's because of the family that you want to be in America?
Since I'm a hockeyist, it's the first place - except for the family - belongs to sports success.
NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is about.
My children, so excuse me, our children -- mine and my wives -- grew up in the United States, started going to school and so on.
And we would be so happy if they continued in this trend.
Because what we're going to say, in America, the possibilities are somewhere else.
That's the chance we should offer them.
So are you planning to stay in America permanently?
We're going to practice it as yet.
This means that in the summer we will be in the Czech Republic in Deep and in the area of the Czech Budjajevic.
And in winter again in Tampa or where our steps will lead us.
It's perfect to be still warm.
I've had a lot of luck in my life.
It could be said I went across the way to him, it cost a lot of strength and renouncement, and it took me a lot of things I missed.
But the hockey offered me a lot of options, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we live.
There are a lot of people in the world who want to choose what they will do and how to live.
How long will you have the will of drowning, training hard and waiting for an offer in your age?
Yeah, that's the question I can't answer.
I still have this in me today, the juice, the desire, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and the motivation to prove to people that you still have the NHL that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell how long it's staying there.
It can't be planned.
So you can say you're gonna wait for this season to get out of it and then decide what next?
I'm in a phase when I go a day from day to day.
Recently, the Director-General of Chez announced that the decision on construction of the 3th and 4th Electricity Block of Temelin was deferred to the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified it by waiting for a new State Energy concept and consenting the Contracts of the difference by the government.
These are the reasons why the current leadership of the CEZ is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government -- that is, for the majority shareholders.
However, the qualified manager should give a recommendation to the shareholders, not to hide behind him.
Babish: Only the government with Saturday.
Andrej Babish is starting to calm down that his movement ANO will not have time to learn political entrepreneur in opposition and that he will have to go straight into the government to make any way.
President ANO accepted this in an interview for the Right to come out tomorrow.
Business and marketing ŠkoFINA leads Abrahamek
Its competence includes the area of product and marketing and strengthening cooperation with business partners.
In his function, he replaced the Lydia Shantor.
Abrahamek has connected his professional career with the car sector for the past 14 years.
He worked in Toyota Motor Czech, subsequently in Fiat ČR, where he was seven years responsible for the sign and dealers Alpha Romeo.

The police evacuated part of the airport in Los Angeles for shooting.
The International Airport in Los Angeles was fired in the morning.
This is why the police evacuated the portion of the airport, allegedly about the three terminal.
Reuters' agency claims that the men of the law were shot by a armed man.
Los Angeles Times, with a police reference, indicated that there was a shooter in which two to three members of the Transport Security Office were injured.
How many people have been hurt and whether there are any victims, but it's still not obvious.
Fireman talks about events with a larger number of injured people.
CNN: Israel bombed the military base in Syria.
The aim was to be Russian missiles for Hizballah.
The Israeli military aircraft reportedly bombed the military base on Thursday near the Syrian port of Lataki.
By appealing to an unnamed American government operator, the CNN television announced it.
The Israeli press of the explosion in the alleged rocket warehouse was widely informed, but the Israeli government did not confirm it.
The speaker of the Israeli Army on the CNN question refused to comment on the invasion.
"We do not express ourselves to the messages of foreign media," she said.
The target of the Israeli attack was according to the US government source of the missile and related equipment, which, according to the Israeli opinion, could be transported to the Military Lebanese Movement of Hizballah.
The AP, appealing to another American security factor, informed that the target of Israel's attack on the Syrian territory was the Russian SA-125 missile.
The second channel of Israel’s television informed that the target of the attack was reportedly a highly modern Syrian anti-air defense system.
Satellite images of the area of the attack, but according to DPA showed the battery of Russian missile type S-125 Neva.
Furthermore, it was said that the SA-3 missile batteries were seen on them, including the commander's centre with a warrant to monitor missiles and their targets.
The recorded missiles have a 35 - mile drive reported by Israel’s television and could bear heads of weight of 70 kilograms.
Israel has reportedly bombed rocket deliveries within Syria at least twice this year, CNN and AP reported.
The Israeli Army never responded to such reports, but repeatedly declared that it would affect any weapons supplied by Hizballah or other groups designed as terrorists.
Does the Internet mean the end of the travel agency?
The Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company updated the annual profit assessment and expects record profits from recreants in Australia and the Great Britain.
The travel office is now expecting its annual primary profit before taxation to move between 325 and 340 million USD, compared to 305 to 315 million USD from the previous forecast.
If the current development is maintained, it will represent 12 to 17 per cent increases against the record profit of 290.4 million USD from 2011/12.
General Director Graham Turner said that the Flight Centre created an 8% profit in the first half-year, and the second half of the year began with a rapid growth mainly in the Australian and British travel outside the service trip.
"For today's date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading towards the record annual profits before receipt and taxation," he said.
This belongs to Australia and Great Britain, which are traditionally our biggest profit creators.
Recreational activities have risen during the second half-year in Australia, which compensates a slightly weaker domestic market with business travel.
Similarly, in Britain, Flight Centre was doing well in the restoration area, while business clients spent less.
The American trade has recovered after the loss during the seasonal season of a weaker half anniversary and is expected to bring a third in a series of years of profits.
The Flight Centre shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at the level of 38.20 USD.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia have transferred to Petrohrad
The environmental activists detained since September in Russia for the protest against the planned oil delivery in Arctida were transported from Murman to Petrohrad.
Today, the AFP informed the AFP to appeal to the International Environmental Organization of Greenpeace.
At the same time, it claims that the original accusations of her pirate activists have not yet been withdrawn.
"Greenpeace International learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women, held in Russia after an inviolent action against the Arctic oil platform, were transferred from a correction device in Murmanska to a prison in Petrohrad," the organization announced in the declaration.
The reasons for moving detained activists are not clear; according to the DPA Agency, it was a planned movement.
The ecology authorities first accused them of piracy, which threatened them to be sentenced for up to 15 years of imprisonment.
But last week, they announced that this accusation would be replaced by a minor breakdown, for which the lower penalty with the upper limit of seven years would be taken away.
But in this statement, Greenpeace noted that the piracy charges of the authorities have not yet withdrawn, as they promised.
They say that the detention is now accused of two crimes.
The Power Investigation Committee announced last week that the accusations of piracy would be replaced by the charges of the execution.
However, when 30 prisoners stood before the committee this week, the accusation of piracy was not withdrawn.
Instead, a new accusation was filed against everyone," AFP quoted from Greenpeace Declaration.
The Russians detained three dozens of Greenpeace members from 18 countries on the oil platform of Gazprom in mid September.
The ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise boat, floating under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been detained against which they have filed a complaint, but the court rejected them all.
Ecologists complain on the conditions of imprisonment.
The Executive Director of Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo, according to AFP, stated today that moving to Petrohrad will facilitate meetings with families and consular workers.
However, there are no guarantees that the conditions in a new prison will be better than in Murman.
"In fact, they can be worse," he warned.
The Dutch King Willem-Alexandra, one of the detained activists Faiza Oulahsen, asked for help.
In a manually written letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, she invited the monarch to discuss their situation in a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It claims that Maliki has a great share in the renewal of sectary violence in Iraq, which is part of the work of combats in neighbouring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammatics
At the class of English literature, it will be necessary to study at least one Shakespear game, a novel of the 19th century, romantic poetry and the current British beletrium since 1914.
The test will also include “the hidden text ” in order to motivate deeper reading;
The combined courses of English literature and languages will be cancelled.
Since 2015, students will be required to have a graduate test from the language, and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an electoral subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue the new basics for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to go through radical change.
The changes are expected next year for other essential subjects.
In a separate step, the Office of Offqual, which observes the maturity tests, will reveal changes in the maturity test structure, along with the new marking system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his summer speech, the Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a “wide consensus in terms of whether we need to reform our test system in order to regain our trust in society” and that the maturity test should be “more ambitious, more ambitious and strict”.
Study shows that English schools spend less time mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week — than most of the other countries.
To compare school in Australia, mathematics are devoted to an average of 143 hours a year and about 138 in Singapore.
Although no official requirement will devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources indicated that the extensive math maturity test – along with greater emphasis on this subject in the results – probably encourages schools to provide additional teachings.
The training plan will focus more on “the problems of the real world”, including financial mathematics.
Ostravski Primator Kainar: Cancer in ČSSD I'm not me
A long-term dispute between the two wings fighting for the influence of the island’s ČSSD has been exploited before the elections.
It was all over by turning the Prime Minister of Ostrava Peter Kainar to court for the non-democratic assembly of candidates.
Even so, the cause actors did not want to express themselves too much to make the party more harmful before elections.
But now the voters' voices are counted.
The leadership of the Islamic CHSSD so immediately on Monday night called on the Primator of Ostrava to step out of the side, and it will apparently push even to lose its function.
But Peter Kainar wants to continue fighting.
What's the matter with the disputes and who's on whose side, he describes in an exclusive conversation for the Day.
How do you see the results of the elections?
The CHSSD must have counted on a much better result.
Did it hurt her that the media's disputes inside the party were dealt before the elections?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better election result.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the CHSSD is now.
It's a party who has its internal problems, she's internally sick and people realize that it's not all right.
They made it clear in the elections.
What are the internal diseases of the CHSSD?
I think I've been through the ODS for a while, and unfortunately, things like this are going on in social democracy.
It is that the lobbyists, the influenced people who had previously expected to find their prebends at the OS, have moved to people in the CHSSD and have an impact on them.
It's about the police's offices of the island magistrate to collect computers.
It shows that the CHSD is not composed of only people who would want the good of all others, but many of them are primarily thinking about their own goods.
The CHSSD is divided into two inconvenient camps even in Prague, as it is seen in the current fight for power between Hashkovci and Sobotkovci.
But it's been preparing for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a prediction of what is happening now in Prague.
The Hague’s wing gradually held its position so that after the elections, it could cause a situation that weakens the Sobot’s wing.
A person is in politics in a situation where sometimes he has to access compromise.
But everyone has some internal limits when the compromise is no longer going to be done, and that's my case.
I originally didn't want to run into the House, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaoralk that I would try to get into the district candidate to strengthen the Saturday Wing as Prime Minister.
The wing of the Hashk, but it's been a stop.
Why are you standing on the side of Godslav Sobotka, not Michal Hashk?
Praise Sobotka is, I think, a person who always speaks primarily about the CHSSD programme and to a certain extent as well as visions for the party and for this country.
I admit, on the other hand, I didn't hear anything like that.
Michal Haszek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower authority than the Central Executive Committee, can only begin to appeal to the President of the Party.
It's a struggle for power, regardless of everything and against the provisions of the party.
I think by what Michal Haszek now showed in Prague, he ended his political career.
As you felt, the island leadership of the CHSSD for a candidate has disallowed you.
Political parties are based on the competition, who will be placed as part of their members.
The competition should mostly be based on the programming visions and on the ability of those people to fill these visions.
Of course, however, people who do not have power or vision are reported in this competition, but the political party is an elevator to the money they would not get anywhere else.
The problem is, when these people start to get forward because they violate the rules without scrutiny, they violate the provisions of the party.
They make their practices from the political parties of the mafia, and I believe that they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
Notifying this problem is more important to me than taking into account whether some Kainar has a political future.
It is important that the parties start respecting the statutes.
Therefore, have you filed a proposal before the elections to the court on preliminary measures against the form of the candidate of the ČSSD in the Morausles region?
The current OSSD Personal Executive Committee in Ostrava reinforces its power by disadvantaging the organisations that are unsuitable to him to cancel, purposely establishes a new organisation, gradually dismissed members of the party.
The example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednarik from the Deputy Club, but he filed a complaint against it and then they had rather cancelled the resolution of his exclusion.
This indicates that the pursuit of the position of the party over the courts is the last option, but the moment the other methods and control authorities inside the ČSSD have stopped working, it is the only option.
An effort to lead the island's ČSSD headed by Ambassador Adam Rykala is to withdraw you from the position of the Primator.
It is a public secret that Mayor Poruba Lumir Palyza has the admiration of this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumir Palyza are trying to do anything so they can call me off.
They promise people positions, they gain voices and then reinforce their power in the side.
When I get back to the past, everything that may have happened around the Banik Ostrava football club and the Bazala stadium was just a reason for them to attack me.
It was artificially designed to make me a man who gives money where he doesn't belong.
However, the city bought a property that has a strategic value for him.
So how do you see this with your endurance in the primator function?
The District Committee has already invited me and other people on Monday to consider our responsibilities in the ČSSD.
But I think it's like when the thief shouts: Grab the thief!
When we look at the results of my work in the past 11 years, I don't see anyone in the island social democracy who would initiate and promote, sometimes even against the members of the party, so many developments, such as industrial zones or the expanding of the Scientific and Technological Park.
Still, I'm getting uncomfortable.
I can't read it differently than interfering with the others to blow them into the places they want.
Are you going to fight these attempts yet?
Because if this Republic is to work well, political parties must also work well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to drive state effectively if they can't drive itself.
So I don't think I'd leave the CHSSD now, because I think that the one who causes cancer of this side is not me, but those people who are trying to piss me off.
Olomouc opens in the historic center of the public cluster
The organizer of the Olomous Christmas Markets and the Winter Sweeting, Paul Burned said that preparations on the lounge were started on 26 October and from the Wednesday there was an ice production aggregate.
The ice layer is already strong seven inches, and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The cluster has a area of 375 square meters, the stage took 358 square meters.
Broadcasts and circuits will also have two stations with a punch.
"We expanded the floor area, increased the area in front of the stations, and almost the whole area of the podium is covered so that the bruisers can renew themselves comfortably," he described.
Olomouce Street is already reminding the coming Christmas.
Last year, the slippery was installed directly before the main entrance of the city at the Upper Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed on the slope of the summer, so the ice area could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could slip directly before the Council in 2009, when the slippery was operational from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the Christmas markets in the city.
Christmas markets whose part is a rich cultural program will be launched on the Upper Square a month before Christmas.

The brutal murder of the senior in Zlinsk will reconcile the district court
The District Court dismissed 25-year-old Slovak and 26-year-old Czech Republic for lack of evidence.
The men refused guilt.
They are in danger of 15 to 20 years of imprisonment or a special punishment.
Speaker Peter Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court of Justice had cancelled the district decision, and the matter returned to the discussion.
The reasons led to that judge refused to comment on the decision that the parties had not yet been delivered.
According to the prosecution, the young men were robbed by a seventy - year - old man in his house.
Senior died by a creepy death.
According to the lawsuit, his men were scratching, beating and digging all over his body, and also with a metal object, apparently a gas gun, put about three dozen wounds in his head.
A man suffered severe wounds, such as skull bone fractures, brain heels or bleeding to the brain to which he fell.
The young people reportedly took about 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns.
According to the District Court, they were the only, in addition, the immediate evidence against the prosecuted smell trail, which the expert considered as not entirely identified in the meaning of legal instructions.
The scents of the crime scene, and other things, were consistent with the defendants in more than ten cases, but the police initially imposed them as real and not smells.
Furthermore, there were some doubts about loading with them.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants was without doubt proven.
However, the Court recognized that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head found relatives who thought he had fallen down and hurt himself.
The violent death has not even been noticed by a rescue physician.
Criminalists have contacted a few days later a fractured physician who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police could no longer work with all the tracks from the crime scene that their relatives cleaned up.
There's no DNA of the defendants found at the scene.
The young Slovak lived in Utherskograd.
Now he's resigning the 8.5 year sentence, which last year confirmed him by the ultimate disadvantaged upper court.
He believed that the man was the head of the organized group of six young men who had a robbery of gold.
Thieves took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the senior murder in Slopny.
Younger of the accused of the senior murder living in the Oher County.
On August 11 months later, the court released him from prison.
Fromout starts with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, Znojma will start reconstructing the football stadium.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken by the builders who would reconstruct the grass.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojma is divided into four stages so that it meets the standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes the next week of the autumn Struna
The Saxophone giant and the legend of the jazz scene Wayne Shorter will do a point next Wednesday after the 18th year of the autumn Festival Struna.
Shorter will perform on November 6th in the Great Hall of Lucerny, along with his quarter in Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
On the second half of the evening, Shorter will be added to the spontaneous jazz improvization of PKF - Prague Philharmonia under Martin Kumžak.
In Shorter's symphony orchestra editions, the Pegasus plays from a new album Without A Net, as well as his older Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday this year in August, Shorter is still full of strength, which also proves that the Prague concert on the Struns will launch his world tournament.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than 60 years ago.
The calculation of interpreters he cooperated with is touched by Miles Davis through Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell after Carlos Santan.
On his musical journey, he also met the Czech musician Miroslav Vitoush and Vienna's family, Joe Zavinuel, with whom in legendary Weather Report after more than a decade, they put the direction of a new style of fusion.
For the last 13 years, he's been speaking especially with Wayne Shorter Quartet.
Jakousi after-party after the festival will still be a club night Spotlight, which will be held on November 9th in the Roxy/Nod Club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrey Triany with the local audience, the Manchester Trio Go Go Penguin will present the Manchester Trio Go with its jazz influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, which will bring the electronic-jazz formation of Profound Bass inspired by dancing styles.
The ladies say that the EUFA prohibits the publicity of penalties for the judges.
Dagmar Damk, Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has ceased to publicize judicial penalties.
It is prohibited by the EUFA rules, which stated in the interview for the Law Journal.
Otherwise, they say the FACR would have threatened the post.
Damka also refused to take away the footballists of Plizna from where she came from.
These speculations are really nonsense.
It is true that I live in Plzni, but the other members of the Commission are from other places, for example from Prague.
So in the case of voting, I can lose 1:6,” said Damk in response to the criticism that was disturbed after Plzeń played twice as many penalties as the other League teams recently.
Although in the past months, the FACR has stopped publicizing penalties for the judge, Damk assures that they are judged for their mistakes.
" Believe me, if the Commission finds out that the judge has made a mistake, it will limit his delegation, whatever it was in any confrontation," said Damk.
The reason why the penalties are not issued is that the Damic prohibition of the European Football Union.
"EUFA forbids such information and severe punishment."
"We're very suspicious and we're looking for something at every mistake."
"We publicized restrictions, but I received two very important warnings that if we do not stop it, hard sanctions will come," said Damk.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really an exception," she added.
If the Commission continues to publish the information, it is said that the EUFA would lose money for the education and development of judges.
"And these are very important to us."
"We wouldn't have been able to fill a program without them," said Damk.
Barta's detention is related to Janusk and Bem: Is it behind the escape of hearings?
The President of Vita Bart's public work was arrested by the police on Thursday.
He was also detained by the head of the analytical and anti-corruption police board Jan Petrjilek.
Detention is related to the lobbyst Roman Janousk and former Primator Paul Bém (ODS).
Information on the hearing server Novinky.cz confirmed the Czech press office a trusted source.
The listened phone calls of Janouška and Bema, published in March last year by the Young Front Day and in which both men call each other "Mazanka" and "Colibric", show the influence of Januškov on the steps of the city under the Beam leadership.
The journal then stated that in 2007 the Security Information Service (BiS), from which two years later, they fled to the ABL security agency.
He owned Bart that time.
The News.cz server noted that the detained criminal Petrjilek worked before his appearance to the anti-corruption police just for the BIS.
Petrjilek went to the countercorruption, which was subsequently dealt with, at the same time as they were published.
"In view of the law on the protection of secret information, I can't even confirm anything or say anything at all," the Attorney Michal Muravski said from the City State Representativeship in Prague.
He refused to confirm that he was observing the cause.
The case doesn't want to comment for the same reason or inspection.
Six companies from ten are preparing for a new civil law.
For the efficiency of the new Civil Law and the Trade Corporation Act from 1 January 2014, six companies from ten are intensely prepared.
Only eight per cent of the enquired representatives of companies indicated that the issues related to both key codes in their company were not addressed at all.
This comes from an examination of the Advocate Office of Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which examined the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
With regard to the approaching term of efficiency, both key codes are only beginning to realize how a number of managers can have a significant impact on their company's business.
The biggest changes in private law in the past 50 years will be affected by all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
The business sector has lived long in uncertainty because of politics lavirating, whether revolutionary changes eventually occur, or not.
"But they have only a few weeks left to move into new law for their companies without complications," commented Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spačal.
Of 61 per cent of the companies concerned intensely with new laws, 26 per cent have already taken all necessary measures to be prepared in time.
Furthermore, 35 per cent of these companies are about to take the necessary measures as soon as possible.
Each fifth company has not yet been dealing with recodifications, yet has a concrete idea how to prepare for them.
In total, 11 percent have no views, and they can't judge the problem.
Only eight percent of the companies admit that recodifications have not yet been addressed.
The most important legal topic relating to the new civil law is the number of new contracts (21 per cent) asked by companies to close (21 per cent) followed by the settlement of trade conditions (16 per cent) and further changes in the property catastrophe and in the account of damage (10 per cent).
The contracts will play one of the most important news of the whole recodification, and the unification of the amendment of the contracts only within the framework of the new civil law.
The current parallel adjustment in the Civil and Trade Law will disappear, resulting from which the contract law should be more transparent for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new adjustment will offer many news with a focus on the greater freedom of dealing," said the Attorney Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukas Submitted.
In the context of the Trade Corporation Act, almost a quarter of the companies considers the most important topic of increasing the responsibility of the statutory authorities.
Themes relating to the changes in the convening and the course of the bunch (15 per cent) and the representation of the company (14 per cent).
The new legal adjustment means the elaboration of obligations and possible impacts on the statutory authorities, in particular in the situation where the company threatens or reaches it.
"In practice, that means that if members of the representatives and business operators do not deal with the care of the proper economy and do not reverse the threat of the company, they can lose the benefit of the function obtained for the last two years," Spapil supplemented.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to develop the style of Cartier as a live language
My task is to preserve tradition and also lead our mark to modern things, so that it does not remain an overwhelmed reliquium, explains in an interview for HN its position Pierre Rainero, director of style in Cartier.
This French luxury house was created in 1847.
He travels through mud, river and jungle and provides medical care for free
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in the villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team are treating almost every weekend hundreds of patients
There are no too many doctors in Western Africa; only one to 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or through your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main candidates for the price of CNN Hero 2013.
You can vote for it or for any of the 10 main candidates in the CNN price of 2013.
The winner gets $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle was watching his father again and again falling unconscious and riding to hospitals that weren't equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 near the capital of Cameroon Yaounde in the car accident.
At first, he was treated only with a broken hand, but then he developed an infection that spread into his brain and created a hematom that caused his whole life's problems.
"There were no neuro surgeons in Cameroon," Georges Bwelle says.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had money for it.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to the full clinics and hospitals where he received such treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," says Bwell.
You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m., rush to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients there.
Some people die because they have to wait.
Since 2002, when Bwelle’s father died, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in Cameroon on 5,000 inhabitants.
Only for comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor to 413 people.
And even if the doctors were able to visit Cameroons, many could not afford that.
Two of the five people in this country live under the limit of poverty and nearly three quarters of health expenditure in this country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
They can't enjoy life because of poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 operations last year for free.
He himself became an intestinal surgeon in the central hospital in Yaounde.
And he established an unprofit organisation of ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas where they provide medical care for free.
Since 2008, almost 32,000 people helped with their volunteers.
Almost every Friday, and up to 30 people are invading to supply, attached to the roofs of medical needs and traveled with a rough territories to villages that need help.
Not always accompanied by happiness.
Once the vehicles must be pushed through the river and the bladder.
But when they arrived, they are welcomed as real heroes: party, singing and dance and the best accommodation that the community can offer.
In these villages, medical care is indeed a reason to celebrate, and Bwelle, with its wide smile and unrelated energy, is very willingly involved in local joy.
The next day, the team starts to treat hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on each trip," says Bwelle.
They're coming to a village of 60 miles [60 km], walking.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide a variety of medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, food, diabetes, parasite diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get a garlic or gifted glasses or a home sheet for free — a document that requires school, but which many dental families simply cannot afford.
Tonight, the team is doing simple surgery under local drugs.
Operations are usually done in the building of school, at the city or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to release the place of another patient.
With the light from the generator, the operating room and the hygienic equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers are working in early mornings.
It's exhausting, but rural musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
"To stay up and continue to work, they play drums all night," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will go back to town, tired, but proud of his job.
This group, accompanied by Cameroon doctors and foreign students of medicine, has conducted 700 operations for free last year and realizes that their assistance can be much for local inhabitants.
One man said he'd be able to work again after surgery.
"It will change our family's future," said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and surgeon work at Bwelle Hospital also works for private health clinics around the city of Yaounde.
He says that this second job finances about 60% of its unused activities; the rest cover private contributions.
"I'm not sure when she's actually sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who studys medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the next year and works as a volunteer for the Bwelle Group.
He's always either in the hospital, or he's trying to get money for the organization so that he can do these campaigns.
For students of medicine and medical services, such as O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle at his mission, it is a great practice they would not acquire home.
"Doctor Bwell, we washed our hands thoroughly and removed bloody skeletons or we kept his tools," O'Malley says.
You'll never enjoy it as a medical student in the second year in America.
Students volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon and often arrive with gifted medical needs.
But once they get to Yaounde, food, transport and study gives them Bwelle.
"No doubt he's a hero," says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is infinite.
Bwelle's constant denial is not a burden.
Helping others to live happier, fulfill the promise that he gave to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I am so happy to do this job," says Bwell.
And I think of my father.
I hope he can see what I'm doing.
Smile people, mitigate their pain - that's why I do it.

Minister Holcat renewed the function of the Chief Nurse for the CHR
The Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of the health sisters whose number is higher than 100 000 in Czech Republic.
"I think it is important that these functions be clearly defined and formalized to have their health sisters within the structural structure of the Office - representatives to whom they can always turn to, if necessary," explained Martin Holcat, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of my sisters, and I think the care department deserves to be paid due attention to him by the ministry.
It is necessary not only for high professionality, but also for human approach and personal persuasion.
"Happy and with all responsibility, I will try to make steps that can improve the health sisters' position."
"We have excellent and fine sisters in our health, but I would like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us too much with their approach to patients to perform their calls with all empathy and help us in public to improve the image of the sisters," says Alena Schmidová.
The newly appointed Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena Schmidová, also indicated that she wanted to deal with various aspects of the healthcare job and will cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, trainees, other non-doctors and doctors.
"I don't really want to separate the doctors and sisters' calls, but I see them on the contrary, and everyone has their competence and, together with other health workers, forms a played working team that provides health services to the benefit of the patient."
"I meet myself with a number of problems that the sister's calls occur, these hardships I understand, and I intend to participate in their solutions."
These include, for example, simplification of medical and health documentation.
"In my own experience, I know that some nurse's administrative activities burden and take them the time they could and should prefer patients," says Alena Schmid.
Other areas to be focused include improving working conditions, searching for ways to improve mutual cooperation in the team and with the management of health providers, adjusting competences and job-related issues such as compliance with the labour law or non-competition of sisters with their insufficient numbers in the given time and place.
We often hear anonymous tracks, which, however, are not documented in a particular case where the rules might be violated.
"Where the prosecutor is not, there is no judge, and so the function of the Chief Nurse of the CRC could serve as a guarantee of maintaining anonymity of such a complaint and a particular case to let the competent authorities verify," concluded Alena Schmid.
Mgr. Alena Schmidová studied the Mediterranean Medical School in the Department of Health Nurse (Adoptated in 1978) and the University of Carlova University in Prague in the Study Programme of Health - Pedagogic (promoted in 1992).
Since 2010, it works as Head of the Medical and Other Non-Learning Affairs and recognition of qualifications in the Education and Science Committee.
During her professional career, she worked as a sister at a bed at the interior department and was a teacher at the Mediterranean Health School, where she was also an 8-year-old statutory representative of the director.
From 2004 to 2009, she acted as the chief sister of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She published several professional medical books and articles in professional magazines, lectures in the field of care.

So I can't swallow hate
The writer Vaclav Kahuda returned to write after twelve years.
After long years when he read, he lived but did not write, VACLAV KAHUDA (1965) issued a new novel of Wind, darkness, presence.
The number of parties comparable to its most famous part of Houština (Petrov, 2001).
For Salon Kahudu, another significant Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl confessed.
What moved where you wrote a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it so that I didn't swallow hate.
Seeing the new and new clones of this foolish littleness of humans, young organisms affected by blind selfish efforts.
I don't even talk about us older, faces ruined by powerless demands, exclusive souls and oppositely overpowered ideologists trying to sell their "product".
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and took pictures of my juroid friends, freaks and hidden offices.
I've been through it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burns from life on this planet.
I prefer to go for walks, and then I read books at the lamp tonight.
You're talking about the feeling of embarrassment, your hate.
Was there some fracture in the past that affected you or you're just getting old, like all of us?
It happened a long time ago, about 10 years old.
It didn't have a name then.
Well, I lived after that.
There's still a surprised quiet boy in there.
I see other lonely trainers, everyone in my tornade of anxiety.
I was saved by writing books.
I'm participating in this giant, thousands of years of continuing movement of the life system on this planet - the rising of an incompatible future.
That enormous, breathing taking the complexity of life, where every stone is the direct heir of our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful games when the attempt-painting creates another and another generation of creatures that create a superhuman, artificial intelligence in billions of interactions per second.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as a continuous process, or did you start at zero?
Self-speaking, or better spoken dialogue leading the right and left half of the brain, sometimes swims to the level and forms itself in the book.
Like the period of peace, silently benched by sleeping metastases of wars that may be waking up one day - so my book is 12 years of silence dressed in words.
I've felt the fertilizer of my life growing in my brain, and if I don't do anything, one day it's gonna be quiet.
It's the file of questions that the brain formed and puts them into layers that are stored in the darkness "before of consciousness".
Neocortex, gray brain root, asks the elderly evolutionary offices, comes to the ancient rounds of the brain tree.
Speaking to the sharp beasts, asking snakes, looking for answers in the bird flight, raised his eyes to the clouds on the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the star sky above me.
Finally, the brain asks the world.
Relatively, you often speak to the ego metaphorically - can you define it biologically?
The brain keeps all the memories, experiences and experiences that a person experienced in its billions of connections and electrochemical connections.
This forest logically and emotionally exposed and branched information trees, memory registers, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, it is exposed to constantly variable presence, in unconsolidating attempts to name and understand its surroundings and decode the important message.
Sometimes there's overload disorders.
Similarly - as if these "fall" PC, from the speech emulator program and translators from foreign languages, you would first be embedded in an operational environment, such as Windows, and after a few failed restarts, it ended up in a dark green-blocking bios screen, in the basic system that manages functions and collaboration on the matboard, between the processor and the operational memory etc.
For someone who hasn't understood what this is about, I'm talking about a psychospiritual crisis.
You mention her often - why do you care about this type of regression regularly?
Because it's a hole.
In addition to the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feelings and behaviour, there will be a breakdown.
Here it is good to quote Netzsche: "He was looking into the ruin so long as the failing looked into him."
A filthy feeling - that a person is lost if all hopes disappear, he mentally dies and comes up with a new quality.
And why am I interested in it personally?
I'll answer the illustration.
Once one fell into the shadow and drowned, the days, the months and the years ran, he kept drowning and reading, and those books taught him to swim - so live.
He became a diver.
Hopefully someone will help me with my written sentences, as Grabbal's texts used to help me.
How much do you think of a reader, a specific person that your text will read?
The one that can't be said of anything meaningful, some call it a consciousness, another super ego, but I think it was best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in a friend's letter:
"I'm someone else -- this reader is participating directly in the word and sentence process."
From early youth, he read the books of old Czech talks, floated in the submarine of Captain Nea, running in the Shadows in the dark streets.
Eventually, after all the branches of the authors and their message, the sun says, "The sun brightes the worlds of the other Karl Hynka Macha."
And when the book is outside?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
On the reverse reflection that people who read the book will get to you?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, perhaps after years, they randomly contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some of their difficult life decisions.
The books are actually "lives" or better say "worlds".
They are coded into letter characters, they bear experience, history of the regions of which language.
Whenever we can wake them to live if we let their sentences stretch into their brains.
It's actually, in a way, something divine forbid -- awakening more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It's the fact that the DNA is stored in charms - according to old demonological books, we are allowed to do witches.
After publishing the book you - how it is - waits for a chain of copy readings.
I remember you used to like reading.
Are you going to get into it again with joy, or do you feel it different after years?
I'd rather just talk today.
And what did I find out about it?
Good intelligent people live everywhere.
Their basic sign - they're intact, they don't notice themselves, they have friendly lights, you don't feel lonely with them.
I'll give an example - in the town of Red Church lived a (and I hope he still lives) one knobling bookstore (named conveniently June), a joyful friend and a good girl bull.
On one drinking, he presented to me individual articles of the chain of my book Houstina.
I looked them in the eye and then I was shown by a scratched, read example of my book.
In distress, I just postponed a cleared liver and cried for a short time.
We all stood silent, squirled, and the drunkards cried.
Then the young blonde mixer didn't hold it and screamed out of the window to the snow curtain.
It was downstairs.
We ran into the night's landscape and screwed the happy anger of sensors, the painful soul of the landscapes and the thigh of the fallen patriarchs -- they dripped and mocked like wolfs until the morning.
Each book of yours is formally different from the previous.
Is this also about the text of the wind, the darkness, the presence?
It's a story.
It's a story about one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novel Suchodol puts in the mouth therapist the words of an old Russian fairy: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
It's a dog, it's a gray box on it.
Awful, scary, secret.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe we've been devils in hell once and we've been losing what role we're going to play in this country.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it on the free inflammation of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal - Otok Brezina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unnamed, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, affects our desire from such depth and in such a width that completely exceeds our horizon - so with absolute certainty we do exactly in the intentions of our programmed task.
We're rewarded by the flow of dopamine, the mixture of endorphines and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to pair, we die in defense and acquire new personal territories.
Sometimes there's a disorder, and we're going to sympathy.
Only then we have the right to call ourselves humans.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, stands on the coast of the unconscious ocean, and in a hole sail made from a dirty pocket catches the flows of the moisture wind.
I have to write so I can be human.
Obama is dismissed from medical care
After the wave of criticism, President Obama yesterday left his often repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
By appealing to hundreds of thousands of statements from the Republican suppliers, they accused the President of the deception of the American public in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama made his original promise.
"A large majority of people with functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in his speech in Boston.
Having regard to what he called "the disturbance in the media" on the statements, Obama called upon the Americans who received these notifications to seek new market insurances.
Most people will be able to have a better, more complex healthcare programme at the same price or even cheaper than they were expected.
"You will get a better offer," he said.
His administration claims that it should not be surprised that 5 per cent of the population who bought insurance for themselves may be forced to change the programme because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Act on the Available Care.
"I say this to these Americans at a level: you deserve something better," said Sebelius in her statement to the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who observes the implementation of the Law on Available Care, said that the launch of the Internet market was “poor” since October.
"I am disappointed and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
The irritated Sebelius said that the sentence caught by the microphone was taken yesterday to the consultant sitting behind it at the last meeting of the Committee, which was held after a violent exchange of views with the Republican Billy Long, a representative of Missouri, who was concerned whether she had to join Obama's care programme.
For more than three hours during the hearing on Sebelius, he repeatedly questioned why the “architect” of the Law on Available Care did not voluntarily give up by the government of the sponsored insurance, and did not buy a programme through HealthCare.gov, which is now encouraging millions of Americans.
What billionaire are you going to call next year?
Kellner, owner of the PPF group, wants to buy O2.
Both companies have confirmed the negotiations and, according to the various sources of the agency and behind the scene, the hand is already in the sleeve.
The notification of the transaction should come in November, probably before the start of auction of frequency for LTE networks, that is, before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komarek owns a KKCG group.
The Sázka Telecommunications has been launched in auction of frequency for LTE networks.
And to the universal surprise, by then, the taste of the company was not spoken of entering telecommunications.
But now Sazku is leading a very experienced telecommunications artist Robert Grabbed.
He started as a marketing chief of Radiomobile (now T-Mobile), followed as the director of the Slovak T-Mobil and last chief of the Austrian branch of the same operator.
The tag plays a few cards at once.
She signed up for the auction, and now she confessed that she wanted to launch a virtual at Vodaphon.
And it makes sense.
If he succeeds in the auction, he will be able to move already existing customers from his own virtual operator.
This would probably not be liked under the normal circumstances of Vodafon, but according to the information of the Economics newspapers, this could be part of a much closer collaboration by both companies.
The waterphones are currently suffering from an O2 and T-Mobile competitive operator agreement that will fully share their networks.
Waterphone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the LTE network (as a new one can administer specially designed spectrum), then Vodafone does not have to start the auction, respect will not disturb the exhaustion of a limited spectrum (not enough frequency for all).
The waterphone can be shared with Saska.
Waterphones release Saska into its 2G/3G network (respective of the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz frequency), allowing the company to start fast.
The trail will start building a commodity LTE network that will also be able to use Vodafone.
Both companies may be satisfied.
The funds he could then spend on a firm Internet provider or cable television.
What about Kellner?
He would buy Czech and Slovenian O2 (Slovak branch is a daughter of the Czech) immediately a full-time operator with still good profits and a wide offer of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big moloch who'll be waiting for restructuring.
In the auction, the LTE network would have won Kellner for O2 and very likely in conformity with T-Mobil.
Both companies have already declared that the networks will be shared.
The auction could eventually end with success, but probably not with the high amounts that the public budget is looking forward to.
And since the next year, customers in Czech Republic could choose between calls with Vodafon, T-Mobil, Kellner or Komarka.
Aneb two titans of Czech business against global huges.
Will the Czech TV ever go around without signing action?
In the era of President Zeman, the legendary scene with a garbage is incorporated, so it is not difficult to listen to complaints collecting evidence of the castle family.
In the past, the traditional influence of John Langer or Jaroslav Hardkok was not documented in such a way as to sign it.
True, the leadership has stopped the editors.
However, these cases do not answer the question of how some journalists are affected by the countrymen - whether the response to direct order, or not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of immediate empathy.
And when we already assume the general disappointment, it cannot be forgiven if there are no other, at least unscrupulous power interests that have not yet been given the opportunity to change the relationships on TV.
The truth is, those who say that in advanced countries, there are no emerging attempts to intervene politicians.
But the truth is also that it does not mean that complaints on public media would not exist there.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize mostly what they think is the tend that they own, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this civilization stadium yet, and this situation is not in our place.
But also in a country who thinks that it is the most corrupt in the world, the black - white stories of evil politics and good journalists are more comfortable than the complicated descriptions of the unprevisible situation in which many imperfect human beings are affected.
JAN ĐANDOUREK: Damn this country: Presidents on the edge of force
It is almost the rule that in key moments the country was not the head of the State in such a form that it could fulfil its state obligations.
If T. Masarik was physically and mentally younger for five years, he would have experienced the end of his presidential period and events around Mnich would have been a little different.
We probably wouldn't win the war, but after the symbolic resistance the aircraft could fly abroad, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could run to London immediately and not fight at work for its legitimacy.
And mostly, the nation wouldn't have a cotton yet.
Beneš wasn't a state, and Mnich was still in condition, but in the war, it started going off the hill with him, and in February 48 he acted according to that.
To be better at this, he could have left the third exile and break the legitimacy of the Communist and their pumps.
It's a shame to talk about Hugh.
He's chosen to "goss. President doesn't get into a situation to decide."
But he had to, even though there was no big decision with a knife on his neck at Hitler's office.
The intelligence safe of František Moravec until the last days in March 1939 said what everything should be done so that the occupation he knew exactly the day did not run to the Germans so smoothly and with such profits.
The Senil President and the coward government did nothing, but they didn't trust him, but they were afraid.
The human distress of Gottwald let his old colleagues execute, as Moscow ordered him.
Ludwik Freedom definitely failed by share in normalization and had to be senior, already senior.
That Husak was a powerless and sick depressing old man in November 89 made it easier, but that's the only treasure.
Havel was lucky that he hadn't been met in the office for the last years. He was spared the worst.
Although Klaus is still freshening the tennis retirement, many of his acts do not know that the thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, now we've got this.
The head of the state and the top commander of the armed forces looks like it looks, and we don't know everything.
Fortunately, the external threats of the Republic are not threatened.
Or maybe it's threatening, just it's not that way to see.
Then the question is whether it is unusual (the historical perspective) well that the president is not fully forced.
It's not normal.
Can we choose a president in this country once again, an acceptable and acceptably healthy person?
Remote planets, black-white movies or a little fantasy about alien life on earth are not themes that the American jazz saxofonist Wayne Shorter would throw off the barely.
In the concept of his quartity, which will be completed in the Prague's large Hall of Lucerny this year at the autumn Festival of Struna, which is all related to everything.
The partiture of the jazz saxofonist Wayne Shorter is the momental feelings of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations of younger colleagues have to play what they've just experienced.
Music is accessible as completely improvized chamber affairs and they think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
This principle, however, is freshly 80-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, bearer of nine Grammy, former colleague Miles Davis, and today apparently the largest living jazz saxofonist - he hates to explain.
They don't talk too much about music, even though his overall view of life is closely related to music.
When I was eighty, I came to the opinion that it was best to let life be surprised.
"Too many people plan everything and then they are disappointed when things develop differently," Shorter said.
How insects from Thailand raised Paris bar markets
You may be disgusting over the insect and not knowing that you will eat it about half a pound a year completely voluntarily.
For example, a creepy in the flood.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trends: it is ecological, nutritional and unique experience you are also taken care of.
The offer of the insect was set first in Paris on his meal ticket at the beginning of October Elia Daviron, the cook and the owner of Le Festin Nu bar.
The bar, for which the name was the inspiration book William Burroughs Naked lunch, would be found in the fashion of 18 perimeter near Montmartru a greatly visited tourists.
With fresh avocade, baked red paprics, barbecue and cream eggs, guests can bite this newly not only different larves, squirrels, or water bugs, to taste the squirrels.
Careful and specially packed deliveries (to prevent the insect from damage to wings, no distortions of legs or eyes) Davirons send from Thailand.
Europe is only learning to eat insects, elsewhere it is common.
The owner of the Paris bar with the pioneer menu states immediately several reasons why to consume insects.
The first of them is an ecological benefit, because the production of insects is much less cost for our planet (as for financing, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
"In addition, the insect is an excellent source of proteins and omega 3 fat acids," Daviron told the Reuters station.
At the same time, the young cook does not deny his profession, simply putting a goal to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
He says he does the right restaurant of pleasure, feeling sin and environment atmosphere.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just mediating new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would have been excited in the idea of consuming a beetle decorated with a peste, but the reaction of the customers of the Paris bar to the insects served are very positive.
Even the skeptics say they will finally taste, even when they start with the smallest scorpions and eventually choose the scorpion.
The prices of these degustation plates are moving from five to nine euros.
President of the Union of Entrepreneurs in Building in the Czech Republic, Václav Matja: New green savings should continue
Since 2008, Czech construction has been facing a continuous decline in the volume of procurement and no interest in the State to deal with the investment construction problem.
The announcement of the New Green Savings Programme was a positive signal for our construction, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who will facilitate significant amounts for heating after the implementation of the measures but also the chances for construction companies and construction material manufacturers.
Each investment billion will bring more than 2700 new jobs to the state.
In terms of the state's fiscal policy, the significant pack and multiplication effects are also one of the most important growth measures.
Therefore, the collaboration of entrepreneurs in the CRC does not substantially agree with the Government's resolution and requests for the implementation of such steps that would allow further continuation of the programme to be made available in its framework for further challenges.
JUDGMENT, 1 November 2013
The dog summed the carpet, the president buried and ended up with the barbecues.
President Miloš Zeman left a motel hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night on his bed, and went to the castle in Lan.
How is he healthy?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that an American spying “roll too far ”
John Kerry indicated the defence position of the United States on his monitoring programs and in unprecedented confession said that in some cases the spy “goes too far. ”
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as “autopilot” in view of the awful discovery of the NSA spying activities, which appeared by the informant Edward Snowden.
Public information has caused diplomatic storms between the American government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry, through a video connection at an open government conference in London, said: “There is no doubt that the president and I and the other government have really learned about some things that were happening from the endurance, because this option was, with a reference to the second world war, a difficult period of cold war, and then, of course, on September 11th."
He thus became the first highly built member of the US government who admitted that the US spying crossed the border, but stressed that it was not broken by any law.
He said: “In some cases it went too far. ”
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify it to people, and he is already doing a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
However, Mr. Kerry insisted that the NSA organisation is trying for good and that its monitoring operations saved many lives.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to detonate themselves. ”
There is a radical extremeism in the world that is firmly determined to kill and throw people into air and attack governments.
And what if you could catch it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we prevented aircraft from falling, buildings not exploded, and people were not executed, because we already know about these plans ahead.
The Chairman of the European Subcommittee on Thursday said that American legislators are going to Europe to respond to the concerns of foreigners involving alleged American spying, and convinced the Europeans that they need to continue connecting their forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that this week he spoke to members of the European Parliament and other persons and that he was concerned about their threats to stop participation in anti-terrorist organisations because they were disappointed by monitoring the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the national security interests of the United States, it is really important that Europe remains with us on one ship, with regard to joint efforts to combat terrorism, said in the interview with Washington Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee of Foreign Relations for European Affairs.
And I'm going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in fighting terrorism, regardless of their rage over NSA programmes.
The media reports that NSA collected millions of telephone records in Europe have broken relations with some American allies, although the head of the agencies this week said that they were incorrect and reflected the misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States,
Another discovery quoted the documents made by Snowden that NSA was watching the mobile phone of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other to 34 world leaders.
The director of the National Reporting James Clapper was defending allies as necessary and said that it was on both sides of the ordinary matter.
In the middle of Murphy's wave, he said that his office plans a parliamentary journey that should be implemented this year and hopes that members of both parties and chambers will appear in the delegation.
The names of other legislators to be published in the following days shall be published.
He said he's still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the purpose of the road was to help fix relations, he added that “a well-defined training measures would be prepared. ”
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people as regards the spy programs they use themselves for years.
"While we amend our monitoring programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also realize that we are not the only ones doing a spy here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is heading according to the plan this weekend to the Middle East and to Poland to respond to immortality, an American strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran has already led to an American follow-up activity.
Australian has appealed to stay in Thai prison
One-two-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to a fifteen-day prison on the island of Phuket, when she falsely claimed that she was attacked by a taxi driver, renounced the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally accused by the Earth Court on the island of Phuket from a curve charge, when the Thai police said that the taxi driver and two other men who said they detained her were attacked on Sunday on June 10th.
However, the industrial television record later revealed that after she broke up with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The Phuket Island police had interviews with Bamford for two days before she found out that the event was invented.
She was held in the local police cell before the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days of prison in a remedies with low security for Phuket periphery, instead of being placed in prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of the former Australian League Player Peter Tunks, who asked for assistance in his daughter's case by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canbera.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had "extreme concerns" about the fate of his daughter and wanted her back in Australia.
"It is obviously a difficult time, but we hope that he will return safely to us as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford renounced the judgment and was released on baht 50,000.
The reports from Australia indicate that she spent a vacation in the Krabi vacation area in the south of Thailand.
The legal resources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she said she had a warning that the appeal could lead to a judicial procedure that would increase her penalty and exploit her in prison for adults.
However, after the recent murder of an Australian travel staff member Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand can also try to fix a screwed picture for the tourists, which may have just been behind the released verdict.
The jager was joking, a naked goal?
He got a knock in the defense zone and no one ever caught it.
Furthermore, the escape has changed after a rapid forhend call.
The Jaromir Jagr scored this against Tampa at Wednesday night, then on Thursday night, 119th winning goal in NHL commented on Facebook's social network.
"After seeing this video, my agent Peter Svobode called the Czech Road Director and asked him if I should not be interested in making advertising on their most modern train Pendolino!", he wrote to the introduction of Jagr with the overstairs.
They say we're typically much like each other.
I guess I'm gonna have to finish the night training so I don't want to be quicker.
"For I'm afraid that the Minister of Defence would then call and want to make a advertisement on a trigger!", he added to the smiles.
In addition, New Jersey has accorded another victory in a row.
"And mostly, you noticed - the treatment of Maria Rotter is taking care of," Jagr closed up.
Place of allowable candle allowance gulash
The October elections rather than the winners brought a bunch of defeated.
These are not only parties that have not even entered the Parliament (e.g. the SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and, eventually, also the CHSSD for their internal dissemination.
The politicians, instead of the holiday candles, served us a gulash for the weekend.
The electoral jump took place in the movement of Andrea Babiša, which promised the voters to change the real political style of rule.
The breakdown of the election result and the dissemination in the victory side records political (z) the will of Mr. Milos Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the voters whom the President Zeman publicly supported, nor chosen to the Parliamentary Assembly.
Although the president lost a strategic impact in front of other policies because of an unpleasant event, he has a few other ways to get it back -- for example, by choosing a future prime minister.
While the CHSSD chances of acquiring a premier chair in my eyes are distant, the entrepreneurs of Andrea Babish are approaching the opposite.
While the development of the licence is still a mile away from the fast and smooth creation of a stable government, but in comparison with the electoral scenario of the left government of the ČSSD supported Communists, this is the development for business in the Czech Republic and the economy is just a better report.
Given the volume of resistance, ANO is still the most likely option of the ČSSD coalition, ANO and KDU-CHSL (all 111 Members).
In view of the dissemination in the ČSSD, which has become an unread and weak partner in the negotiation, the result of coalition proceedings may be sufficiently crucial for the ČSSD.
The minority government of the ČSSD composed of "foreigners" in the castle is probably not going through.
Furthermore, any government to which the CHSD will participate will be threatened by unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which can lead to a further division in the party sooner or later.
So I ask myself, "We don't make our own fall to the other early elections?"
Other choices would already be a referendum on the power of the ANO election mandate.
The CHSD plans for the introduction of sectoral taxes, a significant increase in taxes from income or construction of the state bank have fallen hopefully under the table.
The CHSSD, ANO, KDU-CHSL and the Dawn are contrary to support business, the average fiscal policy (governmental deficit below 3% of GDP), to support the employment of disadvantaged persons, to reduce the lower VAT rate for the selected goods.
Third areas are most occurring in terms of social policy and the size of the State.
Yes, but now it has the top, so the program is the most likely coalition ANO, ČSSD, KDU-CHSL would be on the right.
Which, from my perspective, is a better result than a left-handed tax programme on everything that's still moving in the economy.
