The members of the Wales National Assembly are concerned that "seem like maps"
Some of the members of the congregation are surprised by their proposal to change their name to the MWP (Article of the Welsh Parliament).
This comes from plans to change the name of the congregation to the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the congregation of the entire political sphere are concerned that this could be a ridiculous object.
One member of the Labour Party's congregation said his party is concerned that "removing with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't speak welsh: in Welsh twp means "bullshit/fool," and pwp means "how".
Plaid's member said the party was "not happy" completely and suggested alternatives.
The Conservative Party member said his acts were "free" for the change of the name, but he noted that the similarity of the words of the MWP and "mapet" (ang. Muppet) was large.
In this context, welsh letter "w" is said similar to the yorkshire and English excuse of the letter "u".
The Commission of the People's Assembly, which is currently preparing a law on the introduction of name changes, said: "The final decision of any words to be appointed by the members of the congregation, of course, will bring the members themselves."
Wells' government law in 2017 has given the power to the Wells congregation to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of public consultations on proposals indicating great support for the appointment of the congregation as the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the name of the members of the congregation, the Commission prefers members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest support from public consultations.
Members of Parliament propose alternative options, but the fight to achieve consensus can cause headaches to the President of the Assembly, Ellen Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on changes within a few weeks.
The reform law will include other changes in the way of the congregation work, including the disqualification rules of members of the congregation and the design of the committee system.
The members of the congregation will make the final vote on the question of their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
The voters will vote on Sunday about whether to change their country's name to "Republic North Macedonia".
The popular vote was set up in an attempt to resolve the decade dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens insisted for a long time that the name of her northern neighbour is the right to devote its territory and has constantly opposed the attempts of the country to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite to change the name, said he would not take into account the vote.
Nevertheless, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the change in the name is a simple price to pay for EU and NATO entry.
St. Martin's bell has calmed down while the churches in Harlem face problems
"Historically, the old people I talked to say there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"None of them are gone today."
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"The people are socializing in another way today," he said.
"The bars are no more living rooms in the settlements where people go regularly."
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later, will return to the same place they started."
The churches, he added, can be replaced by housing buildings full of people who will not help the remaining sanctuarys in the neighborhood.
"The most people buying apartments in those buildings are white people," he said, "and that will accelerate the day when these churches will be closed completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who enter into those apartments will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of black men — the Metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martin decade later.
The original congregation of white-methists moved out in the '30s.
The Negro Congregation that practices their faith nearby takes the property of the building.
St. Martin was taken by the Black Congregation during the reign of the priest John Howard Johnson, who took the boy of sellers on 125th Street, the main street for shopping in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was very damaged in the fire in 1939, but since Father Johnson's members had plans to build it again, they bought the carilon.
Priest David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and heir in St. Martin, proudly called the Carilon "bell of the poor."
The expert who played on the carilon in July called it differently: "cultural treasure" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carilon in the world to play a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the bigger carilon to the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Mariveter said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What was happening in St. Martin in the past few months was a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, part brought by the inconvenient leaders of the church, and part of the episcopic episode.
The church board - the church leadership body, composed of non-productive leaders - wrote to the eparchy in July with concern that the eryphy "will require the costs to be transferred" to the church committee, although the church board was not involved in the employment of the architects and entrepreneurs sent by the erophia.
Some of the parish members regretted the lack of transparency by the eparchy.
A shark hurts a 13-year-old kid in the diving of lobsters in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while the lobster dive in California, on the day of the opening of the lobster season, the authorities said.
The attack happened something seven o'clock ago near the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told about the KSWB TV in San Diego that he sneaking with his friends about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and then wandered to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel stated that he first thought it was an excitement of catching a lobster, but then “he realized that he cried," he bit me!
You bit me! ”
The whole key bone was seen," Hamel said he noticed since he got to the boy.
"I wanted everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!" Hamel added.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the child's hospital Radio in San Diego, being seduced as a critical state.
There's no idea what shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach savior, Captain Larry Gils, said at the press conference that a few weeks earlier a shark in the area was observed, but they decided that the shark was not a dangerous species.
Gils added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
Authorized authorities closed the beach from the beach Ponto in Kasablad to Swami in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Gils noticed that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans enter the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's takes boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with beauty sheets in the style of goods full of professional assistants.
As part of the significant entering of beauty market in the United Kingdom, which weighs 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow while sales in the fashion and household area falls, large beauty pockets will be tested in 11 shops everywhere in the country and will be presented in several shops next year if they show themselves successful.
The beauty investment appeared after supermarkets began to seek ways to use the area of the police that was once intended for television, microwave ovens and household facilities.
The Sainsbury's said that for the first time they would double the offer of beauty to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands L'Oreal, Mahiline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also restarts its series of make-ups Boutique, so that most of the products are suitable for vegans, something more demanding from younger consumers.
Furthermore, Fragrance Shop trader will test concessions in two Sainsbury shops, from which the first opened in Craydon, South London, last week, and the second opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and the trend of buying smaller foods on a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets should do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coop, Director of Sainsbury's, said that the stores would look more like storage houses because the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl's disconts with more services and products that are not food.
Sainsbury's started putting Argos shops in hundreds of shops, and also introduced numerous Habitat shops after he bought both chains two years ago, which, according to them, increased the sale of supplies and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to reorganize its beauty and farming departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint business with Boots shortly after 2000, but co-operation ended after disagreement on how to divide profits from chemical stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy appeared after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical shops in Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxurious brands for skin care including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hix, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed our appearance and the feeling of our beauty pockets to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be available to offer advice.
Our series of brands are designed to meet any need, and the attractive environment and suitable locations mean that now we are an obligatory destination for beauty that causes the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "wretched" after Holly Willowby retired from an agreement worth 11 million pounds
The star Peter Jones of Dragons Den left "wretched" after TV manager Holly Willowby retired a contract worth 11 million pounds with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willowby has no time for their brand Truly for products and household supplements.
The couple's business is connected to the Goop Brand of Guinet Paltrou.
This 37-year-old leader of the morning program told Instagram that he was leaving.
Holly Willowby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, retiring from their profitable branded lifestyle business at the last moment to focus on her new major deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "anger" when the TV gold girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlov, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts -- worth up to 1,5 million pounds -- mean she no longer has time to devote to their Truly brand for products and household supplements.
The business is connected to the Goop Brand of Guinet Paltrou and said it would double Willowby's treasure estimated by 11 million pounds.
As the 37-year-old Willowby told Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left Britain in one of his houses.
One source said: “Truly was always at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It should have been her long - term future that she would send in the next two decades.
Her decision to retreat all affected have taken them absolutely inadequate.
No one could believe what happened Tuesday, was so close to the opening.
In Marlow's seat, there's a storage full of products ready to sell."
Experts believe that leaving this morning programme manager, one of the most paid stars of Britain, can cost the company millions due to large investments in pillows and clergy products, and to clothes and household products and the potential for further delay.
And that may also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willowby, mother of three children, and husband Dan Boldwin are close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willowby founded Truly with the Cape in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The two go to vacation together and Jones has a 40% share of the Baldwin TV production company.
Willowby should become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant Mcpartlin as the leader of I'm A Celebry (I am a star) of ITV.
Source near Jones said yesterday "We do not comment on his business moves."
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticisms he would get from the media for commenting that some would be considered "unpresidential" and because he was so positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Tramp give up so many things?
Tramp said with his voice converted as "presenter of news".
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in the second meeting after Tramp evaluated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's danuclearisation.
But the denuclearisation negotiations have delayed.
More than three months after the Summit in June in Singapore, the top diplomat of North Korea, Rie Yong Ho, said to the world leaders of the UN General Assembly that the North is not seeing the "suitable response" of the United States on the early moves of North Korea for disarmament.
Rather, he said, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressures.
Tramp takes a much more optimistic view of his speech on the myth.
"We agree greatly with North Korea," he said.
"We should have been in war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this great co-operation."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results -- the missiles samples finished, helped free hostages, and the remaining US soldiers returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach in the conversation of relations with Kim.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter this full arena, we will have 200 people standing right here," Tramp said, pointing to the crowd before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island and took hundreds of lives
In the consequences of the earthquake in Lomboc, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lomboc population has been distributed, no elementary accident was declared, which is a prerequisite for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not looking for international assistance, so it is a challenge," Mr. Sumbung said.
Although "Save Children" comprises a team traveling to Palu, it is still uncertain that foreign personnel will be able to work on the field.
Mr. Sutopo, speaker of the national disaster agency, said the Indonesian authorities assess the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid efforts.
Because of the earthquakes that constantly affect Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for the anger of nature.
Although tsunami shelters in Aceh have been built, they are not common views in other coasts.
Apparently, the lack of siren for a warning from tsunami in Palo, although a warning was issued, likely contributed to the loss of lives.
At the best time, travel through many islands in Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
The hospital ship stationed in Lomboc for the treatment of earthquake victims headed towards Palu, but it would take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
The main point in the election campaign of President Yoko Vido was the improvement of the old infrastructure in Indonesia and he spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko's administration in the eyes of the re-elections next year.
Mr. Yoko also faces the pressure of sectatic tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets, using cats, arrows, and other old weapons.
Look: Daniel Starig from the Liverpool team equals against Chelsea
Daniel Starig saved Liverpool from the loss of the Prime Minister's League with naked in 89th minute on Saturday in Stamford Bridge in London.
Ksurdan Shakiri gave Staridge’s ball about 30 yards from Chelsea's naked, while his team was losing 1 - 0.
He transferred the ball on the left before he directed it to the distant article.
The ball was moving high above the sixteen while he was turning to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally went through the jumped Capa Arizabalaga and fell into the network.
"He was just trying to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shak always give as much as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time as possible," Staridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Cante coming near and I just touched her and didn't think much about it and I was just kicking."
Chelsea took 1 - 0 in half-time after the Belgian star One Hazard gave the naked in 25 minutes.
The "Blue" attacker filed five back to Mateo Kovačic in that attack before throwing the ball to almost half the ground, and then sprinted into the half of Liverpool.
They quickly passed with Kovačich in the middle of the field.
He then pointed the missile, leading Hazard to the sixteen.
Hazard passed the defense and finished the network of the remote statue with a left leg hit by Alison Becker on Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Napoli in the group phase of the Championship League at 3.00 a.m. on Wednesday at San Paolo stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in UEFA League Europe on Thursday in London.
The number of Tsunami victims in Indonesia risen to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were captured in the ruins of buildings falling in the earthquake of 7.5 that hit waves at Friday and caused 20 feet high, the press conference spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was buried by a bullet in the crashed buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was initiated since the body of a woman in Birkhenhead this morning, Merciside.
Forty-four-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with stabbed wounds on Grayson Moves on John Street, and 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police asked people in the area who saw or heard something to make statements.
Inspector Brian Ohagen said: “The investigation is in the initial stage, but I would ask people near John Street in Birkhenhed, who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask people, especially taxiists, who may have taken something on car cameras to contact us because they can have information that's important to our investigation."
The police spokesman that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkhenheed and that she was found in the facility.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is in progress and, as the police said, they will inform the closest people of the victim.
A taximan who lives in Grayson Mows just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him there was no permission to enter or get out of the building.
He lost his words when he found out what happened.
The lodgers now announced that they would spend hours before they could get back.
Someone heard a cop telling a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
There was a woman weakened in tears.
She repeats “this is so terrible. ”
At 2:00 a.m., two police vans were in the border, and one was outside.
A number of police officers were standing in the border and watching the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact anonymous fighters on 0800 555 111, quoting a record of 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament has become the latest memorial strike in the argument for "prewriting history"
Her persecution would be a poetic justice for his "taliban" destruction of a number of cultural and religious artefacts performed by his fanatic puritanian followers.
But Mr. Cromwell's company described Mr. Creek's proposal as "small" and "success to overwrite history".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure before the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The Econoclass of English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor led by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will sacrifice himself for his ancestor, Thomas, in the past century.
The wonderful presentation of Cromwell of Sir William Hamo Thorneicroft is proof of the opinion in the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many believe that it is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: "Mnogy believe, perhaps, more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a parliament defender of external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether this is a totally correct show is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is sure is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a individually recognised figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth glorifying and mentioning."
A pig-killer splits and kills a Chinese farmer
The pig attacked and killed a farmer in the southwest China, according to local media reports.
The husband, identified only by the name "Juan", was found dead with a crushed artery, swallowed in blood near a trunk of the Liupanshui market in the province of Gicou, South China, reported Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig farmer is preparing to put vaccines on pig farms on 30 May 2005 in Xining in Kinghai Province, China.
He seemed to travel with his cousin from the neighbouring province Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and opened the door from the neighbouring pig barn.
He stated that in the brake there was a great squirrel with the blood of the crab.
The forensic investigation confirmed that the squirrel of 550 pounds broke down the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and broken," said a cousin, named "Vu," according to a quote in Guyang's evening news.
The security camera video showed Juan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Juan or his cousin.
The market manager told the evening news that the pig was locked up to prevent attacks on other people, while the police gather evidence at the scene.
Juan's family and market responsibilities are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pigs that attacked people have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries in the husband.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 650 pounds put a welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife expelled the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said to CBC News that pigs were not normally aggressive, but the blood taste could act as a "activator".
"They're just playing."
They want to bite, they're very curious... they don't want anyone hurt deliberately.
You just need to give them enough respect," he said.
The remains of the hurricane Rosa will bring a rain in the southwest part of the United States
As foreseen, the hurricane of Rosa is weakened while moving through the cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain floods in the north of Mexico and the Southwest part of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought winds of 85 mph, a categories hurricane of 1 out of 5 o'clock east of Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenea, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression is beginning to be formed over the Pacific and is moving east to the west coast of the United States, as Rosa approaches the Dolna California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will start bringing a large tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in Mexico's parts on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture with the nearby depression will create huge rains in the southeast in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden floods, ruins flows and possible slips of land in the desert.
The large tropical moisture will cause rain rains that some places will be approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in the parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Maximum 2 to 4 inches rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in the majority of Arizona.
Sudden floods are caused because of rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the divorced nature of the tropical rain.
Especially, it is recommended not to go to the desert walking at the possibility of tropical rain.
The rain may cause Canyons to become rainfall rivers, and the storm with thunderstorms will bring locally strong winds and dust.
The nearby depression will bring a local rain on the parts of the southern California coast.
The rains of more than half inches are possible, which can cause rivers of ruins and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region of their wet season.
The occasional tropical rains will begin to come closer to Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, before the rain spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
The rain will spread into "four corners" on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, temperature changes are expected everywhere in the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the tropical areas remain high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
Excellent example of the dramatic difference in temperatures will be in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There is almost 20 degrees of difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to rebuild and expand.
Most of the central and eastern part of the United States is expected to have a warm beginning of October with high temperatures 80 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our prognosis for a longer period indicates the possibility of overlap temperatures for eastern parts of the United States, up to the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brad Cavano's hearing
More than 20 million people saw the exciting testimony on Thursday of the nominated candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano, and the woman who accused him of a sexual attack that reportedly happened in the 1980s, Christine Blacy Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the non-existent political situation continued, with speakers who interrupted regular programs for the reverse last Friday: Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, made an agreement with the FBI to conduct a weekly inquiry on the charges.
Ford told the Senate's court committee that Cavano was 100% certain that Cavano had a piano and tried to take off her high school party clothes.
Cavano, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, according to Nelsen, saw him on Friday.
The company counted the average visibility of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nelsen usually has difficulties with measuring people who look at offices.
In order to show better, it's an audience with a size similar to a play-playing game in football or awards of the film academy.
The Fox News Channel, whose leaders have severely attacked Cavano's appointment, led to all networks with 5.69 million viewers in average during the full-day hearing, Nelsen said.
ABC was a second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS was 3.1 million, NBC was 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.2 million, Nelsen said.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office announced that he would vote for Cavano, CNN and CBS cameras caught as protesters calling on Friday morning while he was trying to enter the elevator for the hearing of the court committee.
He was standing with depressed eyes for a few minutes while he was disrespected, and all of that was transferred live to CNN.
"They stand here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth on the earth"?
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator's door was closed, there would be more to say during the committee's hearing.
Cable and radio-difusion networks all covered hours later, when the court committee was to vote for the promotion of Cavano's nomination in the voting Senate.
But Flake said he would do it only if there was a deal with the FBI that they would consider the accusations against the nominated one next week, which was requested by the minority of democrats.
Flake was convincing partly by talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Kuns and several senators later, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was very important, because it was obvious that the Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to approve of Cavano without investigation.
President Tramp opened a FBI investigation on Cavanaugh's charges.
British Prime Minister May blames criticists for "playing policy" about coastal
Prime Minister Teresa May accused criticians of her plans for leaving the European Union for "playing policy" with the British future and undermining national interests in the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrived for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to that on the main page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called "Checkers" plan for Bragzit, saying the suggestion that Britain and the EU should collect loan costs is "a totally absurd".
Wade Simms: Police arrested suspect Diteon Simson for the death of a sportsman at Louisiana's state university
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Simms, 20-year-old basketballman at Louisiana's state university.
The twenty-year-old Diteon Simpson was arrested and detained in charge of a second-step murder, Baton Rouge's police department said.
The authorities announced a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and the police said Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses in the crime scene and said they found the DNA of Simpson on them, WAFB partner CBS said.
After the interrogation of Simpson, the police said he confessed that he shot Wade and killed him.
His bail is set to $350,000, the lawyer said.
The office of the patologist of the parish of Eastern Baton Rouge announced the preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death was shot in the head to the neck.
The Division thanks for the refugee unit of Louisiana State Police, State Police Criminal Laboratory, Southern University Police and Citizens from the area of assistance they provided in the investigation that led to arrest.
Athletic director at Louisiana's state university thanked the police for its "activity in pursuing justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The 6,6-foot beck grew in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for Louisiana's state university.
He had a average of 5.6 points and 2.6 captured balls in the game in the last season.
Friday morning's basketball team coach at Louisiana's state university, Will Wade, said that the team was "destroyed" and "in shock" by Simms' death.
"This is what you're worried about all the time," the coach said.
Vulcan throws ashes on Mexico City
The exhaustion of ashes from the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern settlements in Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Sunday not to go to the volcano after it started activity in the crater and 183 gas and ashes were registered within 24 hours.
The center followed more scratches and shakes.
Social media images show a thin ash layer on cars in Mexico’s settlements, such as Socimilko.
Geophysicians observed the increase in volcano activity located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital after the 7.1 earthquake shook Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police conflicted with catalan separatists before the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the protesters of independence confronted with the public order and peace police and after thousands joined the rival demonstrations on the first anniversary of the polarization vote of Catalonia.
A group of masked supporters of separatists held by public order police and peace throwing eggs and colors in dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would usually be filled with tourists.
Later the day, they also exploded fights, and the police used the sticks to combat the fights.
For more than a few hours the independence groups cried "No forgetty, no forgiveness," and the union protesters shouted "How long to live Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for smaller injuries received in protests, local press said.
Tensions remain high in the region that wants independence, one year after Madrid characterized the referendum on 1 October as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist catalons.
Most voters voted for independence, although the exit was small because of the boycott by people who are opposed to cutting.
According to the catalonic authorities, nearly 1,000 people have been injured last year after the police violently attempted to stop the vote in the voting places in the region.
Independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations to support the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but they had to change the route.
Sixty-eight-year-old electrician Narciss Termes, who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he has no hope that Catalonia has a chance of getting independence.
"The last year we experienced one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents crying out of joy because they could vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite the vital, but close victory of regional elections last December, the catalonic independence parties have been tormented to keep the dynamic this year with many of their most famous leaders or in their ownly elected persecution or in detention waiting for a trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the follow-up declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic, Hoan Puig, recording the police support protest, said the conflict was supported by politicians on both sides.
"Everything is intense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine catalonic leaders who are in prison before the trial last year, announced that they would run the elections for the European Parliament next year.
"Bing a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the receipt of democratic values and the reprisy we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.

At one point, it could be shot by arrow from a gun to the car.
Menga's hit brought Livingstone's victory 1-0 against Rangers
The first goal of the Doll Mengo for Livingston has secured victory
The advanced Livingstone stamped the Rangers by signing Steven Gerard, with only two losses in 18 matches, as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
The hit of Dolly Menga showed how important it was while Gary Hold's side climbed up for one level with Hybernian at the second position.
Gerard's country remained without guest winning this season and will face the leaders of Harts next week, behind which they remain with eight points.
Before that, Rangers will be hosts of Rapid Vienna in Europe the League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues unbelievable in the division during six matches, and Coach Holt still has not confronted the defeat since Kenny Miller’s replacement last month.
Livingston missed the chance against the cruel guests.
Holt's team was supposed to lead a long time before they gave the naked, and their directness caused many problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke himself, but he dragged the attack around the naked, then Alan Litg could only direct his efforts away after slipping played the head of Craig Halket over the goal.
The guests welcomed the Rangers to play before them, knowing that they could create problems with their actions.
And that's how the crucial naked came.
The Rangers missed a free strike, and Livingston got the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson were set up together with Menga, who only touched gave a goal from the centre of the sixteenth.
By that moment, the Rangers were dominated in possession of the ball, but they couldn't break the defense of the hosts, so Leam Kelly's goal didn't play mostly.
That scheme continued and in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performs a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to give naked because of the skill of Ranger's goal, Alan McGregor, and Litgov took the ball away from another set action on Livingston.
Livingstone's sixteenman was constantly passed through and was constantly defensed, while two tool requests -- after Halket's controversy on Glenn Midlton's replacement and one for a hand game -- were rejected.
Livingstone’s Fenomenal – Analysis
Alasder Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Arena Tony Macaroni
Fenomenal game and result for Livingston
They were great, continuing to overcome the expectations of this upward path.
Their style and character of playing barely changed after their return to the top, but most of the credit goes to Holt for the way that the team had galvanized from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was incredible, managing super-organized defense, but Menga still kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warral ready.
The Rangers still missed the inspiration.
As good as they used to be under Gerard's leadership, they are now delayed with the same standards.
Their last game was weak -- only once they managed to open the hosts -- and it was a small awareness of Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan got a mixed reception in Colonia
There were smiles and blue sky on Sunday (29 September) when Turkish and Germany leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which is aimed at fixing relations between NATO allies.
They have been worsened because of problems that include human rights, freedom of press and accession of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then went to the Colonia to open a huge new mosque.
The city is a home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police quoted security reasons to prevent a bunch of 25,000 people before the mosque, but many supporters came close to seeing their president.
Thousands of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds also declared, condemning Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome the country.
The opposed protesters reflect the division of the visitor famous as a hero of some German Turks and criticised as a autocrat from others.
Traffic accident on the road to Depford: a bikeman died in a car crash
The velosipedist died after a confrontation with a car in London.
The conflict occurred near the Bestwood and Evelyn street crossroad, a highly disturbed traffic in Depford, in the southeast of the city at about 10.15 BST.
The car driver stopped and an emergency came, but the husband died at the scene of the accident.
A few months after the death of another bikeman in a car accident on Childers Street where the driver fled, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
The Metropolit police said officials are working on the identification of the husband and informing his family.
The road blockages are set and the buses are redirected and the drivers are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six police officers injured in disturbance
Six prison officers have been injured in trouble in a male prison with a high level of security, said the prison office.
The riots exploded at HMP Long Martin in Warchestshire at about 9.30 BST on Sunday and still continues.
The Tornado units were brought to address the riots, which include eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
The cops are treated for small injuries in the scene.
Prison spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff was directed to deal with the current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible for it will be transferred to the police and may spend additional time behind the bars."
HMP Long Lartin has 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison governor received hospital treatment after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the public order and peace police were called to prison to deal with serious disturbances with which the staff was attacked by billion balls.
The hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (may be useful for dry areas)
A tropical depression is rarely happening to hit Arizona, but it will probably happen at the beginning of the next week when the remaining force of the hurricane Rosa will pass through the desert southwest region, bringing a risk of sudden floods.
The state weather station has already issued warnings about possible rapid floods on Monday and Tuesday to West Arizona, all the way to south and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flegstaff, Las Vegas and Sait Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move the direct path through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The state weather station in Phoenix announced on Tweet that “the only ten tropical cycles kept the status of tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katherine (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the State Centre for hurricane are foreseen by 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the edge of Arizona Mongolon.
Other areas in the desert southwest region, including the central parts of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basen will probably have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated places up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside the risk of sudden floods, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, part of this rain is likely to be useful because the southwest region is affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Sushi Monitoring Authority, almost 40 percent of Arizona face extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com said.
First, the trip of the hurricane Rosa led to land strikes everywhere on the Dolna California Island in Mexico.
Rosa, still in a hurricane in Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles an hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north 12 miles an hour.
The storm comes in contact with cold waters in the Pacific and falls down.
Therefore, rains are expected in Mexico with a volume of tropical storm on Monday or evening hours.
Rains in Mexico parts may be intense and are a significant risk of floods.
"The rain from 3 to 6 inches from Low California to northwest of Sonora is expected, with possible 10 inch rain," weather.com said.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona on Tuesday early mornings as tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and south of Utah until late evening Tuesday.
"The main danger expected by Rosa or her remains is a lot of rich rains in Dolna California, southwestern Sonora and the desert Southwestern region of the United States," stated the State Centre for hurricanes.
These rains are expected to bring life-related floods and flows of ruins, as well as slipping the land in mountain regions.
Attack at Midsamer Norton: Four arrested for attempting murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempting to kill after a 16-year-old man was found with stabbed wounds in Sommerset.
The teenager was found injured in Excelsior Terrace of Midsamer Norton around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He's taken to the hospital and is in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in Radstock, the police of Avon and Sommerset said.
The police asked if anyone had the cell phone recordings of the incident, to step up.
Tramp said Cavano "has suffered the greatest evil and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote for Judge Cavano is a vote to reject the most cruel and scandalistic tactics of the Democratic Party," Tramp said at a meeting in Villing, West Virginia.
Tramp said Cavano "has suffered the greatest evil and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Cavano witnessed before the convention on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blacy Ford’s accusations that he had committed a sexual attack on her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford witnessed the hearing of her accusations.
The President said on Saturday that "Americans saw the brilliantness, quality and courage" of Cavano that day.
"The positive vote for Judge Cavano is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a integrity file of public service," he said before the crowd of supporters in Western Virginia.
The President indirectly mentioned Cavano's nomination as he talked about the importance of the Republicans' output at the early elections.
"From five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
I'm not running, but I'm really fighting," he said.
"It's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for excellent candidates."
Tramp said the democrats have a mission to "continue resisting and obstruct".
The first key vote for Cavano's nomination in the Senate is expected not later than Friday, the older CNN GOP manager said.
Thousands of Dead in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the total number of victims increases
At least 384 people died, many were taken away from the huge waves hit by the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island Sulavesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Thousands of people gathered for the beach festival in Palu on Friday when waves of a height of 6 feet (18 feet) hit the coast of the sun, treating many in a safe death and destroying everything on their way.
After the 7-5, the earthquake hit tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, speaker of the BNPB agency for intermediating in Indonesia's briefing.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled through the open sea with 800 miles per hour (497 miles per hour) before hit the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16.700 people were evacuated in 24 centres in Palo.
The air photographs published by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, wrapped and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The recent tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in a area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian technology assessment and application Agency (BPPT) said that the energy released from the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times larger than the energy released from the atomic bomb in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which lies at the end of a long, tight coast, may increase the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, trade centres and hotels had crashed.
The bodies of some victims were found stuck under the shock of the crashed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were disappeared.
Nugroho said the victims and damage could be greater along the coast of 300 miles (190 miles) north of Palu, in the area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communication "was completely damaged without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"There live more than 300,000 people," the Red Cross in the announcement said, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday that she had not informed that tsunami hit Palu, although the authorities said the waves came about at the same time when the warning was issued.
In an amateur video divided by social media, a man in the upper floors of the building can be heard as he shouts insanely, warning people on the street down about the tsunami approaching.
In a few minutes, the wall of water will be stuck on the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't verify the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an end to electricity that cut the communications around Palu, making authorities difficult to coordinate rescue activities.
The army began sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but evacuated persons still desperately need food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city was reopened only for help and will remain in prison until October.
President Joko Vidodo had planned to visit the evacuation centres in Palo on Sunday.
The total number of victims in the tsunami in Indonesia rises over 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision staff from Dongala came safely to town Palu, where employees hide in shelter shelters in the courtyard of their office, they passed through the desolation scenes, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses that were destroyed," he said.
It's so bad.
Even while the aid teams started the dark attempts to start help for the disaster, some regretted that foreign aid experts were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, financial support, supplies and foreign personnel can only begin to come if the scene of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That has not yet happened.
"It is still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Ariani, speaker for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster', we can receive international assistance, but there is still no status."
As the second night fell in Palo after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the missing were still hoping that their beloved would be miracles that would facilitate the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers saved a woman who was stuck under the shock two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesian State Team Coach, trained two missing paragladerists for Asian games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
The others stuck in Roa Roa Roa, added Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragladership, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me how, when he started circulating the news of the ruining of Roa Roa Roa in the paragladerist community, he desperately sent messages to whatsApp to the contestors from Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages ended only with a gray sign of stitching, rather than with a son.
"I think that means the messages are not delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26.750 while filling a bankomat at the Newport of the Cayo
Thieves stolen on Friday morning from a employee in Brink's who supplemented a bankomat at the Newport Cay, according to the press report at the Newport Police Station.
The driver of the car emptyed the bankomat in the fun complex and was preparing to complement it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was busy, another man ran from behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for delivery.
The Witnesses noticed more suspects running from the crime scene, according to the statement, but the police did not give a specific number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identity should contact the Newport police on 859-292-3680.
Kanie West: The Rapper changed his name to J.
The Rapper Kanie West changed his name to her.
The change was published on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote: "The creature known earlier as Kanie West."
Fourty - year - old West was carrying her name for a while and used the nickname for his eighth album, published in June.
The change took place just before his visit to Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to announce his new Yandhi album.
He will replace Ariana Grande's singer at the show that he had to cancel for "emotional reasons," the maker of the show said.
Although he used it as a short of his current professional name, West said earlier that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there means 'ye'," West said at the beginning of this year, discussing the title of his album with the Big Boy Radio.
"It means I am you, I am us, it's us.
He went away from Kanja, which means the only one, to her, to the reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a show of who we are."
He is one of the many known rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Paf Dedi, P. Deedy or Didi, but this year he announced his preference for names Love and Brader Love (Love and Brother Love).
A former colleague of West, J. Z., also uses his name with or without a drawer and all the big letters.
AMLO of Mexico promises not to use the army against civilians
VD President of Mexico Andreas Manuel Lopez Obarador promised that he would never use military force against civilians while the country was approaching 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelko Plaza that "he will never use the army to reprise the Mexican people".
The army fired peaceful demonstrators at the square on October 2, 1968, killing even 300 people in the time when the left-hand student movements enrolled in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador claimed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly assistance to students and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attracts young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, so the United States should double research funds in the field, the investor and practitioner told AI, Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments arrived after various parts of the US government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the United States has no formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: strives to be number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Dubling the budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far before the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Double funds can double the chances that the next major achievement in the AI area will make the United States, Lee said in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Li, whose book "AI Super Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (Superpower in artificial intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the new world system) was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, a general director of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 80s of the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that defeated the highest ranked American steel player, and later he was director at Microsoft Research and President of the Google area in China.
Li thanked for the previous U.S. government technology games as a robotic challenge in the Agency for advanced research projects in the defence and asked when it will be the next match to help identify the following visioners.
U.S. researchers often need to work hard to get state grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies hired universities experts to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to improve their efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think "green cards" should be automatically offered to science doctors after artificial intelligence," he said.
China's state council issued its Plan for the development of the future generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation finances people in academic institutions like the way the Fund for Natural Sciences and other government organizations give money to US researchers, but the quality of work is lower in China, Lee said.
Preceding this year, the U.S. Defence Ministry established the Association Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which should be covered by industrial and academy partners, and the White House announced the establishment of an Authorized Intelligence Committee.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for the initiative called "AI Next".
As for the NSF, they currently invest more than 100 million dollars a year in research of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation demanding the establishment of the National Intelligence Security Commission has not been acting for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum about whether to change the country's name
Macedonia's people voted in a referendum on Sunday about whether to change her name into the Northern Macedonia Republic, a move that would solve a decade dispute with Greece which blocked its EU and NATO membership requirements.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of her northern neighbour is the right to place its territory and put veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
Two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's orthodox population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote at the referendum and the bojcott campaign has questioned whether the output would fulfil the minimum 50 per cent necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question of the referendum ticket was: "You were for NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece."
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to enable access to bodies such as EU and NATO to Macedonia, one of the countries that have appeared after the breakdown of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live free under the soil of the European Union because that means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of Parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-third majority in the parliament is needed to change the name.
The state election committee said there were no irregularities reporting by 1:00 p.m.
However, the output was 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the past parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters gave their vote.
"I went out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Đoše Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Duško voted in Macedonia for a change in the country's name, opening the way for the country to enter NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov prepared a small scene and chairs in front of tents placed by people who would bojcott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with heads raised high and not from the rear entrance," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the euro-Azian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring a lot of necessary investments to Macedonia, which has a rate of unemployment of over 20 per cent.
"I believe that the majority will be for because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said since he voted.
He said the result "yes" would be "a confirmation for our future".
The survey, published last Monday in Macedonia's Institute for Political Research, showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters would participate in the referendum, which is under the necessary output.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonian Television Telma, showed that 57 per cent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent will vote by yes.
In order to make the referendum successful, the output should be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of a referendum would be the first serious impact on the prowest government's policy since they arrived in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City has passed the entire defense of Bryton for goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly overcome Brayton's defense on 2-0 for Manchester City on Saturday of the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian attacker has received the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He passed between three brayton defense players quickly before he entered the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four "green".
Round a defense player before he runs a few others on the edge of Bryton's sixteen.
He then passed on to his left, to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first arrival to the sixteenth to return Aguero's ball, who by his right leg defeated Bryton's golf, Matthew Ryan, with the only hit on the right side of the network.
"Aguero has problems with legs," City manager Pep Guardiola told journalists.
"We talked to play 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky you gave it naked at that moment."
But the starting privilege of "the heavenly blues" gave Sterling in the fight for the Prime Minister of the League.
The naked came in 29th minute.
Aguero got a long ball in Bryton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her a few times before he took Sterling to the distant article.
The attack on the "Sky Blue" introduced the ball into the network before he went out.
City will fight Hoffenheim in the Championship Group on Tuesday 12,55 in Rine-Necar Arena, Germany.
Shercer wants to play a spoiler against Rockys.
Since Nathanels were eliminated by the playoff fight, there was no reason to force another start.
But always competitive Shercer hopes to stand in the central square on Sunday against Colorado Rockys, but only if there are still implications for the playground for Rockys' team, which are leading a game in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
Rockys' team had at least a "joker" to win 5-2 over Neschnels on Friday night, but they still fight to establish their place in the first division.
"If we don't play for anything, at least we can throw away knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level any moment I will face this year.
Why don't I want to compete in that?"
Neschnels still need to announce the launcher in a week, but they are allegedly inclined to allow Shercer to throw in such a situation.
Shercer, who was starting after 34th, trained throwing on Thursday and would throw usual rest on Sunday.
Washington's right is 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strique points in 220 2/3 ininci season.
Tramp mitings in Western Virginia
The President indirectly mentioned the situation about his choice of Brett Cavano to the Supreme Court while talking about the importance of the Republicans' outcoming at the early elections.
"All we have done so far will be put on a cube in November.
Five more weeks to one of our most important elections.
This is one of the great, big - I'm not running, but I'm really fighting, so I'm fighting for excellent candidates everywhere," he said.
Tramp continued, "You see these horrible, horrible democratic groups, you see what's going on right now.
And they are determined to regain their powers using all the resources available to them, to see the wickedness, the disgusting.
They don't care who they're gonna hurt, when they're going to run over to get power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we won't give them."
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "continue resistance and obstruct".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "angerous, wicked, rude and innocent."
He mentioned Senator Diana Fainstein from the lines of democrats, set by the Senate's Judicial Committee, by name, to which the audience responded with the crying of discontinuation.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you post the document?
Oh, ah, what.
No, and no, I wait a minute -- it was a very bad body speech -- the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
Laborists no longer accept different opinions.
Not tolerated by those who express their opinions
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it was almost no surprise.
However, I am only the last member of the parliament from the Laboratory Party to whom we have been told that we are not welcome - only because he expresses his opinion.
My colleague parliamentary Joan Ryan got a similar treatment because he takes a decisive attitude against antisemitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticised me for disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, for Europe, ironicly similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement on the East Lab Party meeting stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the Laborist Party, the Council meetings on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of most meetings, and the promise of a "meeker, gentle" policy has long been forgotten if it really, ever started.
It is increasingly obvious that different opinions are not tolerated in the lab party, and every opinion is determined whether it is acceptable to the leaders of the party.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when the colleagues I thought we had shared similar political opinions have started expecting to fully change my thinking and take the views that I would never otherwise take, whether it was national security or internal protection of the EU.
Whenever I speak publicly, and it really doesn't matter what I say, there's a critical abuse of social media that calls for conviction, denying the central policy, telling me that I should not be in the lab party.
And I'm not the only one with this experience.
In fact, I know that I have more happiness than some of my colleagues because the comments directed to me are usually political.
I have great respect for professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexualist or racist abuses every day, but they never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how abuse levels became normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the lab party should practice culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with any request for "no trust" or changing the rules of selection, the party becomes more tight.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years telling me to keep my head down, not to be so loud, and then “all will be fine. ”
But that's not the reason I came to politics.
32 years ago, when I joined the Laborist Party as a student, provoked by Thacher’s concern that literally left my class to fall down, I fought to improve public services for those who are the most needed, whether as a local advisor or government minister.
I've never hid my policy, including the last elections.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in no way for my political attitudes and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the request on Friday, all I want to say is that when the country goes to the force to Braggzit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy of my loyalty to the leader of the Laborist Party.
But I have a message that is not about Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members of the Laboratory Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how condemning threats or political opontunism I will survive, nothing will distract me from acting in a way I think it's in the best interest of all of you.

Ear 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbelievable Ear goes to the top
Two late points may have changed the final result somewhere, but there is no doubt that Ear deserved the triumph in this wonderful entertaining game on the day of Scotland's Scotland's football Championship.
They're now on the top of the table, the only invincible side of the ten.
Finally, everything is due to their superior defense, as well as to their improved exploitation chances, which brought the home team, and coach Peter Murci has the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested through our games so far and we are still invincible, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christy from Melrose said: “Hallowing for Ear, they had better use their chances than us. ”
The point of Grant Anderson in 14 minutes, converted by Fraser Climo, gave the Eare advantage, but the yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given for the game of Wariors, allowed Melrose to improve the numbers, and Jason Bag had captured an unconverted point.
Climo renewed Ear's leadership with a tool, earlier, just half-time, he reached a point, so he converted a solo point to reach 17 - 5 for the Ear at the rescue.
But Melrose started the second half time well, and Patrick Andreson, converted by God, reduced the leadership to five points.
Then there was a long detention due to a serious injury of Ruarid Nott, who was exposed to the noses, and since the beginning, Ear continued to suffer with the point of Staford McDowal, converted by Climo.
The WD captain of Ear, Blair McFerson, then got a yellow card and again, Melrose paid charges for an additional man with an unconverted point of Bruce Colvin at the end of the time with embarrassed pressure.
However, the home team returned and when Struan Hacinson got a yellow Climo's ball-break card, McFerson is educing a tatchduan from the tool line on the back of the Ear's sharp attack.
Climo converted, as he did again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Row took David Armstrong's hit and sent Gregor Henry's wing player to the fifth point for the home crew.
The Still Game Star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The Still Game Star, Ford Kyran, seemed ready to move to the guest industry after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed company restaurant.
The fifty-six-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular series of BBC, which is a scriptist and plays with a long-year colleague, Greg Hamphill.
Duo announced that the next ninth season will be the last and it seems Kirnan plans for life after Cragleng.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source of Scottish Sun stated that Kirnan was trying to engage in the "successful restaurant" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia surrounded by land hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Navy patrols on a hidden-fake seat in La Paz.
Public buildings set the sea blue flag.
The sailing bases from the lake Titicaca to Amazon are tapped with the motto: “The sea is our right.
It's a duty to come back to us."
Through the soil of Bolivia, the memory of the coast lost for Chile in a bloody conflict for resources in the 19th century is still fresh, such as the desire to swim again in the Pacific.
Those hopes may now be largest in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a decision from the International Court on October 1, after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and calmness and, of course, expects a positive outcome," Roberto Calsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Great Screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will judge in favour of Bolivia's lawsuit, which, after decades of variable talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate in order to allocate a sovereign exit to the sea of Bolivia.
Eva Morales, a charismatic President of Bolivia with a native origin, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, is also very dependent on the sentence on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he celebrated at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not judge in favour of Bolivia and that it will not change much in their favour.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chile's territory and indicates that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
The verdict of the international court comes only six months after the ultimate arguments indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zarate, an expert on international law from Chile.
And for the last four years, they may have reversed Bolivia’s cause instead of improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has used the problem with accessing the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales' military rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining good will, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at a certain point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Welce, Bolivian representative in Hague, rejected the idea that the decision of the court was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "continue 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Calsadia also rejected that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the sea’s problem as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we should overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament if she can't trust the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Rie Jong Ho says his nation will never disarm his nuclear weapons first if he can't trust Washington.
Ree spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep their promises given during the Singapore Summit between rival leaders.
His comments came in time when the US Secretary Mike Pompeo is on the edge of restarting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Yong Un.
Ri says it's a "fiction" to be considered that the continued sanctions and opposition of the United States to declaratively end the Korean war will bring North Korea to the knees.
Washington is cautious to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang to take significant disarmament measures first.
And Kim and the President of the U.S. Donald Tramp want a second summit.
But there is a great scepticism that Pyongyang is serious to cancel the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Tramp summit.
The Paris Fashion Shows reveal the latest line of massive hats that is on the way to the largest stores near you.
If you want to improve the size of your cap collection or completely block the sun, then don't look further.
Valentino Designers and Tom Brown discovered a series of crazy big hats for their SS19 collection on the track that blinded the style set on the Fashion Week in Paris.
Finally, unpractical hats launched Instagram summer, and these designers sent their creatives falling in the eyes of the road.
The piece emphasized by Valentino was a huge be hat decorated with a wide cover in a type of feathers that floated the head of the model.
Other too large supplements included circones, magic hat, and even ananas, but they are not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for the Halloween night.
Many of the colorful masks had sewed lips and were more like Hannibal Lector than high fashion.
One creative was like a diving equipment full with a diving glasses and a diving pipe, and another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Style trackers predict that the huge hats can come to shops near you.
The too large hats came very quickly after "La Bomba", the slamed hat with a wide two-level hat that all of Rianna carry to Emily Rataykovski.
The cultural fashion house behind the too unpractical hat spread through the social media has sent another large creation after the beach, a sham bag of size almost equal to the height of the model that was dragged.
Darkly the orange raphia bag, with a raphia bowl and a white skin handle, was a piece emphasized in the La Riviera SS19 Collection of Jaquemus on the Fashion Sunday in Paris.
The stylist of the famous, Luke Armitage, said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see the large hats and beach bags in the shops next summer, because the designer has caused so much influence that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too large supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic incredibility, and this continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results of the exams, which is only strengthening with individual and group success in sports, art, music and other activities of the community.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide their students and parents the best service.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen their place as global citizens.
As an educational centre that can design and implement adapted school programs, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired as a electoral object in schools.
Nelson Mendela said: “If you speak to a man in the language he understands, it will make him delightful.
If you speak to him in his tongue, it'll hit him in the soul."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely on English only when we want to build ties and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s recent results of the tests can be seen as languages exceed all other subjects with the highest percentage of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who have learned foreign languages have reached a higher estimate of 5+.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of the students have reached a higher "5+" in mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who have learned German, 69 per cent of those who have learned French and 63 per cent of those who have learned Spanish have also reached "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly acquire in the future.
Languages are now seen as an electoral subject at the same level as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programmes as well as elsewhere.
The AOK Employment and Skills Survey in 2014 noted that 17% were due to lack of language skills because of the reasons employers have been induced in the failure of filling jobs.
Thus, language skills become increasingly more obligatory to prepare young people for their future career.
With more jobs that demand languages, these skills are necessary in the globalized world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they learn the second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such lifestyle.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign countries will automatically give the polyglot advantage before competition.
According to the YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults from OK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak foreign language enough to speak, and the French was the only language that spoke over ten percent, i.e. 15 percent of people.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially those in the development economy, will equip children with better chances to find significant employment.
In Scotland, every school will differ according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important in OK when they look at the future by 2020, as mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what interests your child is, there will always be many languages from which you can choose in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scotland's independent schools are dedicated to provide the environment of learning that will prepare children and arm them with skills needed for success, no matter what brings the future.
Currently, it cannot be denyed, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital for the future of the country, so this must be drawn in schools.
In fact, modern languages really should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
"Il faut bien le faire" (this must be done).
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron will take Lakers to debit in San Diego on Sunday.
The waiting is almost over for fans who wanted to see Lebron James launching for Los Angeles Lakers.
The Lakers Coach Luke Walton announced that James would play the first game in the precesion on Sunday against Denver Nagates in San Diego.
But how many minutes he's going to play, it's still not decided.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, wrote a tweet that James would probably play a limited time.
After training at the beginning of the week, James was asked about his plans for six games before the Lakers season.
"I don't need games in the presezone in this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
The Ju-Tube channel for the Tramp miting in West Virginia
President Donald Tramp started a series of mythins as part of the campaign tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five appointments of Tramp next week, including visits in favourable places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote for confirmation of his choice to fill the blank in the Supreme Court is in reconciliation, Tramp is trying to build support for the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, because the Republicans can lose control in the Congress with the vote in November.
What time is the tonight's Tramp show in West Virginia, and how do you see it on the Internet?
Tramp's event in Villing, Western Virginia is scheduled for 7 afternoon. Time zone on the eastern coast tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Tramp's show in West Virginia through the Internet with a live transfer to Yu-Tube.
This week is likely Tramp will address the hearing of a man nominated for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano, which has become tense because of the accusations of sexual behaviour with expected delay in the Senate by a week, while the investigation of the FBI.
The primary goal of the series of mythins is to help the Republicans get a wave for the elections in November .
This is why President Tramp's campaign said that these five mythins next week are focused on "promoting volunteers and supporters because the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the Reuters House," according to Reuters.
"The control of the convention is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to as many federal states as possible at the beginning of the hard campaign season," the Tramp campaign spokesman for Reuters, who refused to be appointed.
Scheduled in the Wesbanko Arena in Villing, the tonight's event could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media," according to metro news from Western Virginia.
Saturday is the second visit to Tramp of West Virginia in the last month, the country in which he won with more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Tramp is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Western Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrise, who remains on the surveys.
"It's not good for Maurice that the president must come to improve the popularity of the surveys," Simon Hyder, a politician from the University of Western Virginia, said Reuters.
Coop Ryder 2018: United States team showed courage in the fight to maintain hopes at the beginning of individual games on Sunday
After three single seasons, the four of them on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what Coop Ryder needed.
Happiness is a totally invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of all in such games.
Who would you say luck is now?
"They had six points leadership, and now they're four, so we're a little lucky assuming," Jordan Spit said after the end of today's competition.
The Europeans have a privilege, of course, of four points leadership and another twelve games.
The Americans, according to Speed, feel that they have a weak wind in the sail, although they have enough incentives, if nothing else then the form of Speed and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each achieved three points of four.
Sleep was great and led with an example.
Those strong screams of celebration were getting strong over his game, with a key strike that led to a balance of four or four when he and Thomas had two missions after two rounds.
His strike with which he got the 15-year-old match was welcomed with a similar shout, which tells you he believes the American team is not out of the game.
"You just have to deepen yourself and take care of your competition," Spit said.
That's all that every player has left now.
18 holes to reach a point.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the uncontrolled story of Coop Ryder.
The strange, but beautiful duo of Europe is four of four and they can't make mistakes.
"Mollywood" were the only couple without bad hits on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad hits and Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
The series and the way they seem to be running their energy until and from this noise group ensures that they are players who win on Sunday and that there will be no other popular players that will provide potential European victory when the sun comes behind Le Golf Nasional, except Flitwood or Molinari.
He prefers both at the same time in different holes.
Nevertheless, talks about European glory remain unreasonable.
Bub Watson and Web Simson quickly dealt with Serjo Garcia, the morning hero of double couples, when he connected with Alex Norren.
A missed strike and two doubles of the first nine buried the Spanish and the Swedish man in a hole from which they never managed to get out.
On Sunday, however, there's no one who can help you get out of the hole.
The two couples and fours are so fascinating to see closely because of the interaction between their partners, the advice they give each other, the advice that they do not listen, and the way the strategy can be changed suddenly.
The Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved a significant leadership in the last day, but the four-year season also showed that the US team could fight even though some, especially Americans, had doubts.
Europeans led with 10-6 on the last day of Coop Ryder
Europe will enter with solid advantage on the last day of Coop Ryder after Saturday leadership in double couples and fours of 10-6 before the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories while Tyger Woods was trying to take the lead by now on Le Golf Nasional at four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who was fighting to keep the trophy lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated in front of an American team who had a lot of failures in the morning double couples and won a series of 3-1.
The Americans gave more resistance in the fours, winning two matches, but they couldn't reach the leadership.
Jim Furic's team needs eight points of 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European starter who wins four points consistently, while he and Molinari, called Mollywood after the senzational weekend, are the second couple at all that won four points in the first four matches in the history of Coop Ryder.
After they "smashed" Woods and Patrick Reid in double couples, they played greatly and beat the exhausted Woods and the US starter Bryson Deshambu with even more explicit results 5+4.
Woods, who broke through two swords on Saturday, played great at times, but now he lost 19 out of 29 matches in double couples and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, rested while the morning's double couples lasted, returned as Henryk Stanson's partner in the fourth defeat with Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coupka -- ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans were not all after their pleasant, wind day southwest of Paris.
The three dominant winners, Jordan Speed and Justin Thomas, set a measure for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They achieved a decisive victory 2&1 over the Spanish John Rahm and Ian Pulter in the double couples and returned later to beat Pulter and Rory McClroy with 4+3 in fours, but lost the initial, two holes.
Only twice in the history of Coop Ryder, a certain team has been recovered from the lack of four points in the individual game, although as the title holders, the Furic team had sufficiently a balanced result to keep the trophy.
Since it was two days, however, the weekly opposite appears to be over them.
North Korea says "No way" to disarm unilaterally without trust
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the prolonged sanctions deepen the lack of confidence in the United States and that there is no way that the country will quit nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ree Jong Ho told the annual World Body General that North Korea has taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear missiles tests, unmounting nuclear test buildings and committed against nuclear weapons proliferation and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see the right answer by the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, it will not trust our national security and there is no way we unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
Although Ri repeated the known complaints of North Korea on Washington's resistance to the accession to nuclear disarmament "in stages", according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because he did not refuse unilaterally, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ree advocated to the joint statement of Kim Jong Un and Donald Tramp at the first summit at all of the current US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim was obliged to work towards the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", while Tramp guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea demands a formal end of the Korean war since 1950-53, but the United States claims Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to drop in the strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"United States insist on "nuclear disarmament above all" and increase the pressure level with sanctions to achieve their goal with force and even oppose "the declaration of the end of the war," Ree said.
"The perception that sanctions can kneel on our knees is a vain dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that existing sanctions deepen our untrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Tramp, which the US leader stressed in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jaye-in in the past five months and added: "If the other side in this problem with nuclear disarmament was South Korea, instead of the United States, nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not end in such an end."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ree's speech was significantly different from the last year, when he said to the UN General Assembly that the direction of North Korean missiles towards the American land was inevitable since "Mr. Worth President" Tramp called Kim "raketar" with a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Tramp, who threatened the "complete destruction" of North Korea last year, much more praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament steps, but said it remains to do a lot of work and that sanctions must remain until nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Tramp said he had no time frame for that, saying "Does it take two years, three or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the sanctions of the Security Council must continue fully and without exceptions until fully confirmed, finally nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously raised sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent the financing of nuclear weapons programmes and ballistic missiles of Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Ree at the margins of the UN General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo's already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time it didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress was made, but he was denied from North Korea only a few hours after "gangster requests".
North Korea committed a meeting with Moon this month for disarmament of a rocket building, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States take "suitable measures".
He said Kim told him that "suitable measures" he was looking for are the security guarantees Tramp gave in Singapore, as well as moves towards normalization of relations with Washington
Harvard students visit courses to get enough vacation
The new course of the Harvard University this year aims to teach all graduates to more sleep in order to fight the growing maco-culture of learning with staying awake all night with the help of caffeine.
A researcher discovered that university students in the world often know nothing about the basic care of themselves.
Charles Chaseler, a medical professor at the Harvard Medical Faculty Faculty and a female hospital specialist in Brigam, designed a course that he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after maintaining a speech on the influence of insufficient sleep on learning.
"In the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?"
She said that no one, never told her about the importance of sleep -- that surprised me," he said to telegraph.
The course offered for the first time this year explains students the foundations of how good sleep habits help in the academic and athletic results and improve the overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of medical psychiatry at Harvard University and executive director of the University's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after they discovered that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a student home where students press on cups of coffee, curtains, shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how insufficient sleep affects athletic results and the importance of routine in bed.
Otherwise, participants learn how the long - term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, depression and cancer.
The map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know about health effects when you choose to smoke cigarette," Professor Chaseler added.
The culture of pride with "work all night" still exists, he said, and also the modern technology and the increasing pressure on students mean that the lack of sleep is a growing problem.
To have enough sleep, with good quality, it should be a "secret weapon" of a student in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid fatty, because the lack of sleep causes the brain to move into a hunger regime, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old student from California of Chemical and Physical Biology, helped Professor Chaseler design the course after visiting one of his classes last year, at his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for courses throughout the student city.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all graduates to complete a similar program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chaseler recommended that students think about setting an alarm about when to go to bed, and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the "Blue Light" emitted from electronic screens and the LED light, which moves the circuit rhythm, which leads to problems with sleeping.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga’s goal has demolished Gerard’s people
Rangers suffered another desperate, sad day when Dolly Menga's hit sent Steven Gerard's team to defeat with 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to register his first victory after the February 4-1 triumph in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team made the second defeat of Gerard's team in 18 games as a manager who left his team with eight points behind the scattered leading Harts team in the Scottish first League.
Menga pointed seven minutes before the semi-time and Rangers' set lost inspiration and the chances of alignment.
Now Rangers fell to the sixth place, and Livingston climbed to the third and they're just behind Hibernian according to the difference in the head.
There may have been additional problems waiting for Rangers since Judge Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance for head injury after he was obviously hit by a subject from a distance.
Gerard made eight changes to the Aer team in the semi-finality of the Bethfried Couple.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 in Livingstone who won the point with Harts last week and would be happy in the way his well-trained set was choking the opponents at every chance.
Rangers may have dominated over the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball than them.
They should have reached a point, two minutes after the start of the first playout of Menga, when Scott Pittman went to Alan McGregor's goal, but the medium player missed the chance.
Then a hit from the distance of Kihan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Litgou could only play openly in defense.
Rangers managed to control the game, but it seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should get a tool in the fifteenth minute when he and Steven Lawles crashed, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not give a sign of approval of the Colombian's complaint.
Rangers were able to reach only two shots to the naked at the first half-time, but the former golfman of Ibrox Liam Kelly did not slip from the head of Lasana Culibali and the weak hit on these Edaria.
Although the beginning of the 34th minute of Livingston may have been opposed to the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved according to their game.
Rangers failed to handle Jacobs' hit again.
Scott Alfred did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who chose Manga with a cold head to a simple end.
Gerard reacted during the semi-time when he replaced Culabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a rapid impact when the wing player passed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from its blockade line.
But Livingstone managed to attract guest players to play the type of game they enjoy, while Litgou and Hackett caught a lot of long additions.
Holt's team could have expanded leadership at the end of the game, but McGregor well set up and prevented Jacobs before Litgou played with a head on the corner.
The replacement of Rangers, Glenn Midlton, had another request for tools since he crashed with Jacobs, but Thompson never approved again.
Almanah: Geiger numerator inventor
And now one side of our almanah "Saturday morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE NUMBER... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Gaiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactiveness, an discovery that led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger numerator.
Since then it became the main resistance of science, the Gaiger's counter became the main resistance of the popular culture, as in the 1950 "Colorado Bell", in which these seemedly unreasonable, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What is that? ”
Rogers: “It is a gaiger numberer used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put the phones, you can hear the effects of the atoms that release radioactivities in minerals."
Evans: “Say, it must be jumping now! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the discovery that brings his name exists.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" offline cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" off-line cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the distant cells as part of the treatment
The method includes extraction of immune cells from the patient and their changes to the lab
You can "see" protein honour in many cancer species and then be restored to the body
The test vaccine gives promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
With a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise the distant cells, the cancer of the ovariums disappeared in 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their changes in the lab, so that they can "see" protein honour in many types of cancer called HER2 and then their return to the body.
Professor Jay Berzofski, from the American National Institute for Cancer from Bethesa, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that promises a lot."
HER2 "incites the growth of several cancer types", including breast cancer, ovariums, lungs and colorectal cancer, explains Professor Berzofski.
Similar approach by extracting immune cells from patients and their “science ” as to targe cancer cells function in treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanie West made a pro-Tramp out, carrying a drop with his motto, after the show on Saturday night live.
That didn't go well.
Kanje West was observed in the studio during a live show on Saturday night, after a useless performance in which US President Donald Tramp praised and said he would run for a function in 2020.
After the third song that night, called the City of Ghosts, wearing a drop with a sign to make America Slavna again, he began to criticize democrats and repeat his support for Tramp.
"Pequently, when I talk to a white man, they say, "How can you like Tramp, he's a racist?"
Well, if I had been worried about racism, I would have moved out of America for a long time," he said.
Saturday, the evening show in live began with a date with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood Star laughed at the testimony of Brett Cavano in front of the Senate's Legal Affairs Commission, involving sexual attacks on Christine Blacey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's scan was placed on social media by comicor Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to laugh at West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that he had hardly passed behind the scene because of his drop.
"I was laughed behind the scene.
They told me, "Don't show up with that drop."
They've been laughing at me!
Then they told me I was in a drowned place, he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Would you like to see the drowned place?" he said he'd "pack his superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His comments attracted distress from the audience at least twice, and the night show team seemed ashamed, reported Varayetti, a man said to the publisher: "The whole studio is taken away."
The West was brought as a replacement at the last moment for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boy, raper McMuller died a few days ago.
West surprised many by playing the song "I love it", dressed as a bottle of Perier.
West received support from the Conservative Group Leader, Candice Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "For one of the bravest ghosts: THANK YOU WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CURE."
But Karen Hunter's housewife wrote on Twitter that West was "in her own and that's absolutely beautiful."
"But I chose not to reward someone (with buying his music or clothes or supporting his art), for which I believe he accepts and expands ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced Twitter that he changed his name, and he's now "formally known as Kaine West".
He is not the first artist who changed his name and follows Deedy’s steps, also known as Paf Dedi, Paff, and P. Deedy.
The rapper colleague, Snoop Dog, has the name of Snoop Lion, and of course the deceased music legend of the Prince, changed his name as a symbol, and then in the artist of previously known as the Prince.

The star of the Tron Game, Keith Harrington, attacked the toxic maleness
Keith Harrington is known for his role as a skilled machete as John Snow in the violent, medium-centural, fantastic game game of Trons.
But the acter, 31, attacked the maco-hero stereotype, when he said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be strong to be respected.
In a statement about Sanday Times' culture part, Keith said he believed that "something is wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic maleness in the age of #SegaWay.
Keith, who recently married the star of the Tron Game, Rosie Lesley, also 31, admitted that he had "potential feelings" on that issue.
"I personally have strong feelings, at the moment - where have we sinned with maleness?," he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up about the problems we see now?"
Keith believes that television may be partially responsible for the growth of toxic maleness, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is learned?
What do you learn from TV and what on the street makes young boys feel like they have to have a certain side of manhood?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
Because it's obvious that something's wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also acknowledged that he would not participate in the Continuation of the Game of Trons when the series ends next summer, saying "he's finished with battles and horses".
Since November, Keith will perform a renewal of the Real West of Sam Shepherd, which is a story of a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently discovered that he thought that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing he had ever done from the Game of Trons.
"I met my wife in this series, so in some way she gave me the future family and my life in the future," he said.
Rose played Igrit, a guy who had love attraction with Keith's face, John Snow, in the fantastic series that won Amy Awards.
The two married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's property in Scotland.
HIV/Sid: China reported 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and Sid.
More than 820,000 are covered in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new events were transferred through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have HIV has thus reduced to almost zero, said the Chinese health authorities at the Yunan Province Conference.
From year to year, however, the number of those living with HIV and Sida in China increased by 100,000 people.
Transfer of HIV through sex is an acute question to the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT people is great.
Because of the country's conservative values, research shows that 70-90% of men having sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inappropriate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxin Waters denies the data reported by a staff member related to the Senator of the Republican Party as "dangerous lies" and "theories of conspiracy"
The US representative Maxin Waters rejected the charges on Saturday that her staff published personal information to three Republican senators in the United States on Wikipedia's websites.
The Democrat from Los Angeles assured that claims are on "ultra-right" sympathy and website locations.
"Lyes, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in Twitter's statement.
The publications reportedly include home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch from Utah.
Information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill while the senator's panel for hearing of sexual behavior against Brett Cavano, nominated for judge of the Supreme Court.
The information reported appeared shortly after Cavano's interrogation by three senators.
Conservative locations such as Gateway Pandit and Redstate announced that the IP address identified by the publication source is connected to Waters' office and information was published on Watters' staff member, Hil reported.
"These unfortunate accusations are completely false and represent absolute lies," Waters continued.
"Article of my personnel -- whose identity, personal information and security are compromised as a result of these untrue and false accusations -- in no way is responsible for the information provided.
The unfortunate accusations are completely false and are absolute lies."
Waters' statement quickly attracted criticisms on the Internet, including the former White House press secretary Ari Flysher.
"Those denials are nervous," wrote Flysher.
"This shows that she has no temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he must not be angry.
He must not be challenged.
He must not ask about the motives of the prosecutor.
He must remain calm and calm."
Fletcher seemed to compare Waters' response to the criticism of democrats related to Judge Cavano, who was accused by criticists because he seemed too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to replace Waters in the middle of the mandate elections, also announced Twitter.
"If it's true, that's a big deal," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office reported "appropriate institutions and police on false claims.
"We will allow the offenders to be discovered," she continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff."
The thought of Johnny English attacks again - undermined the spine frauds of Rowan Atkinson
Now it is traditional to seek Bragzit's elements in every new British film, and it seems to apply to this renewal of the franchise of the franchise of the deceptive, action comedy Johnny English -- which started in 2003 with Johnny English and repeated in 2011 with Johnny English: again born.
Will the careful self - laughing on how obvious we are for nowhere be the new opportunity for exports that the nation has?
Despite this, the face with great eyes and many grims of incompetent Johnny English got a license to "free" things for the second time - his name first means that it is a comic design with a wide range, made for the cinemas in places where it is not speaking English.
He's certainly a sketch of a secret agent who despite his bizarre efforts for a cautious glamour after a little similar to Clouseau, there are drawings of Mr. Bin and part of the boy playing a note of the song of the Coachie of the fire from the Olympic Games ceremony in London 2012.
His foundation is the traveler and the mysterious international man Atkinson who's ever performed in the now forgotten Barclis' TV advertisement, leaving chaos behind.
There's one or two moments in Johnny English's latest edition.
I really liked when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medium - century armor, and the rotor peppers hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy can be seen, but humor seems weak and somehow surfaced, especially because "serious" film brands such as 007 and the impossible Mission itself contain the elements of comedy.
The humor seems to be designed for children instead of adults, and for me, the crazy accidents of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as they are the nems of Bean's character.
The theme that's been inclined all the time is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker infiltrated into the super secret network of spying in Britain, discovering the identity of all British agents in the field, disappointing the agent who is on duty - a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a pomped and fighting figure and has already suffered from a total melting of political inpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything in this character of quasi-Tereza-May, but there is nothing special in the scenario that would work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired ones.
And that means calling himself Johnny English who is now working as a teacher in private school, but "black" gives classes for secret agents: there are a few good boys here, when English offers a school for spying that looks like rock academy.
England was quickly invited to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with the former colleague Bow, who played Ben Miller.
Boo is now a married man, about a submarine commander, a comic role in which Vicki Pepperdin is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, for messing up all things in the Royal Secret Service, they go back to action and meet fatally beautiful Ophelia Bulletova, the guy played by Olga Kirillenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technical billionaire who claims that he can solve British computer problems: the wicked Jason Walta, decepted by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow start their admissions of absurd actions: made as waiters they burn the French restaurant; they make desert after they smuggle themselves on Walta's luxurious yacht; and England starts anarchy when he's trying to use a helmet for virtual reality to get to know the inside of Walta's house.
All brakes are removed for the last sequence, but as kind and noisy, there's a lot of child TV in the whole movie.
Nice moderate things.
And as with the other movies with Johnny English, I can't just think: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson's role to use his talent?
Labs deny that they have a plan to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbin will consider a radical plan according to which the British will work four days a week - but they will be waged for five.
The party allegedly wants company chiefs to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give the workers another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they would take the same salary.
According to sources, the idea "responsive" with the economic agenda of the party and the country's plans to be more favourable to workers.
The transition in a four-day working week is supported by the Union Congress as a way that workers can benefit from economic changes.
Highly ranked party member said to Sanday Times: "The revision of the strategy should be published before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a working week of four days is an effort that is in line with the accession of the Party to re-balance the economy for workers, as well as the whole industrial strategy of the party."
The Laboratory Party will not be the first to accept that idea, the Green Party has been intending for a four-day working week during the parliamentary election campaign in 2017.
However, the aspiration is not accepted by the entire labour party.
The Labour Party's spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not the party's strategy, and the party does not consider that idea."
The Chancellor in Shadow John McDonalle used the laburist conference last week to present his vision of the socialist economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to grab the power of "personless directors" and "professors" in communities.
Chancellor's plans in the shadow also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not get back the whole part because the Labour government could make "deductions" for non-ethical behavior.
He also confirmed the workers' plans to become part of the company's boards and create Inclusive Property Funds, with which 10 per cent of private companies' capital will belong to employees, which will be able to take an annual dividend up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy gives a statement of 60 minutes about whether the FBI investigation for Cavano can reconsider
The FBI investigation against Judge Brett Cavano postponed the final vote on his nomination in the Supreme Court at least one week and updated the question of whether the findings of the bureau can reconsider some Republican senators to withdraw support.
In an interview published on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minuti" Scott Pelly asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham whether the FBI could discover something that would make them think about.
Kennedy was opener from his South Caroline colleague.
"I think so," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Cavano.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, and I said, "Do you do it?"
He was firm, decisive, unequivocated."
Graham's voice, however, looks like a scratched in a stone.
"My decision was made for Brett Cavano and a shocking accusation is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denies energy," Graham added, thinking of Christine Blacey Ford.
"Everything she has appointed could not be confirmed.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new to change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did he do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be held by the Global Citizen Festival, a annual music event in which famous stars appear and has an impressive mission; the end of poverty.
It is now held on the seventh time, and the Global Citizen festival will visit tens of thousands of people who will come to the large poultry in the central park, not only to enjoy the performances of names like Janet Jackson, Cardy B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal to end the extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activeist group who hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (except if they don't want to pay for the VIP bill), participants must fulfil several tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to some world leader, a telephone call or any other useful work that will help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful is the Goluble Citizen because they remained 12 years to achieve the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert a real way to convince people to seek to take something or just another case of "click-activism" -- people who feel that they make a real difference by signing a petition on the Internet or sending a message to Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims that they registered more than 19 million "activities" than supporters, acting for many different purposes.
They say that these activities have helped world leaders to show dedication and strategies that have gathered over $37 billion and that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and insights resulting from their activities, of which 10 billion dollars have already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds in the congregation have a direct impact of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key promises are the power of food, partnership of investors and implementers, with a headquarters in Britain, dedicated to "helping children to use their potential", which promised to provide $35 million for Rwanda for help with disadvantaged food in the country after they received 4.700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens the same as you, we can make social injustice of non-food, a note in history," Ambassador Tracy Ulman of the Power of Food, in front of the people at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities have been undertaken in connection with calls for improving mothers and children in Britain, the government announced the financing of the project, the Energy Power, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
As an answer to one of the often asked questions on their web site "Why do you think you can put an end to extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen answered: “It will be a long and difficult road - we will never succeed.
But as well as the great civil and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Vikend, Sean Mendes, Cardie B, Janel Mona are some of the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, whose host will be Debora-Li Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
America can use the Navy to "block" to prevent Russian energy exports - Ministry of Interior Affairs
Washington can "if necessary" use the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinky found out, as Washington Egzeminer quoted.
According to Zinky, the Russian involvement in Syria -- namely, where it acts after the invitation of a legitimate government -- is a cover-up to research new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they're in the Middle East is because of energy marketing, just as they do in Eastern Europe, Southern Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to the government's representative, there are ways to deal with it.
"United States have the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea roads remain open and if it is necessary by blockade to prevent their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinky addressed the attendance of the event organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumptors, an unprofit group representing itself as "the vote of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that he is effectively the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, to raise the role and replace fuel," he said, while Russia spoke as "one uncomfortable pony" with an economy depending on fossil fuels.
The statement followed after Tramp's administration began the mission to encourage the export of liquid natural gas in Europe, replaceing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
For that purpose, Tramp's officials, including the US President Donald Tramp himself, are trying to convince Germany to resign from the "inappropriate" project for North Tec 2, which, according to Tramp, made Berlin "satellite" in Moscow.
Moscow has emphasized that the North Tek 2, gaswater worth 11 billion dollars, should double the current gaswater capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
Kremlj claims that Washington's firm opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that customers should be able to select suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after the meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American attitude faced a resistance from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leadership of the Industrial Organization in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI) called on the United States not to interfere with European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third party interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kemph, the first man of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will consider carefully" whether to run for president in 2020, Senator from Massachusetts said
Senator from Massachusett, Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she "will consider carefully" whether to run for president after the elections in the middle of the mandate.
During a meeting in the city congregation in Hollioc, Massachusett, Warren confirmed that he was thinking of running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our non-functional government, which means the wife's forehead," she said, according to Hill.
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider whether to run for president."
Warren evaluated the work of President Donald Tramp during the meeting in the city congregation and said he "he leads the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm too worried about what Donald Tramp does to our democracy," she said.
Warren is open in her criticisms towards Tramp and the man he nominated for a judge in the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano.
In Twitter's message on Friday, Warren said "of course we need a FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a number of voters in its election unit think it should not be running in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probably" voters from Massachusetts said the senator should not be running, according to the Centre for Political Research at the University of Safolk/Bostonski Globus.
Thirty-two percent support such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for the nomination of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent support potential nomination, and 48 per cent opposed.
Other famous names by the Democratic Party discussing nomination in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Byden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden said he would officially decide by January, according to Associate Press.
Sarah Paylin talks about Treck Paylin's post-traumatic syndrome at the Donald Tramp event.
Track Paylin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he signed up in September.
He was arrested and accused of a domestic violence incident on Monday night
"With what my son passs through after he returns, I know how other families feel that are disturbed because of the post-traumatic syndrome and wounds with which our soldiers are returning," she said before the audience of the Donald Tramp show in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Peylin called the arrest "elephant in the room" and said that her son and other military veterans "they are returning a little different, they come back strong, they return and wonder whether there is respect for what they and their aircraft companions and every other member of the army gave for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alasca, and accused of domestic violence with a female attack, along with a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons under alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, the police spokesman in Vasila.
18 Federal States and Washington City support contesting new asylum policy
Eighteen federal states and Washington support the controversy of the new American policy preventing asylum to victims fleeing from domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and Washington submitted petition to the court (amicus curiae) on Friday in Washington in support of a asylum seeker that opposes the policy, reports En-Bi-Si News.
The entire name of the prosecutor in the case of Grace v. Parliament, which the American Civil Freedom Union filed against federal policy in August, was not discovered.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang," abused her, but US authorities rejected her asylum request on 20 July.
She was locked in Texas.
The state defender who represents Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many asylum requests come from in the United States as nations with persistent gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy cancels the decision of the Immigrant Appeal Board since 2014, allowing undocumented immigrants who flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The public attorney of Washington Karl Rasin said on Friday that the new policy "is ignored decades of the introduction of laws at the level of federal states, federal and international levels".
"The Federal Law requires all asylum requirements to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the request and such a provision violate that principle," according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
Furthermore, the defenders in the letter claim that immigrants' policy preventing immigrants is harmful to the US economy because they are likely to become entrepreneurs "to offer the necessary workforce".
Public Prosecutor Jeff Seshnes ordered immigration judges not to asylum victims running from domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is a asylum for those who leave their country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a certain social group or political opinion," Seshnes said in the presentation of the policy on 11 June.
Asylum has never been designed as a solution to all problems -- even all serious problems -- with which people around the world face every day.
Desperate efforts to save in Palo because the number of victims doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her male baby in the evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palo.
"Each minute, the ambulance vehicles carry bodies.
There's no clean water."
The inhabitants return to their ruined homes and choose from their alleged objects to save what they can.
Thousands of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who has breakers on the back and shoulder, rested before the Military Hospital in Palo, where patients were treated outside, due to frequently small earthquakes.
The tears came in his eyes when he described the strong earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed in the ruins of the wall, so I think," Harris said to the Associate Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope they're safe."
American Ambassador accuses China of "business" with "propaganda advertising"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper announced a four-party advertisement in the American daily newspaper, counting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador in China accused Peking of using US media to spread propaganda.
The United States President Donald Tramp talked last Wednesday about the payable supplement of China Daily in De Moin Register, the most sales newspaper in Iowa -- after he accused China of interfering with the US convention elections on November 6th, China rejected the accusation.
Tramp's accusation that Peking is trying to interfere with the US elections marked the United States Services for Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although foreign governments are normal to publish commercial advertising, Peking and Washington, they are currently in a trade war in which import tariffs are equipped.
China's revenge tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were directed towards exporters from federal states like Iowa, which support the Republican Party of Tramp, confirmed by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador in China, and former, long-year governor of Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural products in China, said Peking hurts American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a column in the Sunday edition of De Moin Register, "depth the abuse of advertising in our free print."
"In the desemination of propaganda, China's government abuses an educated American tradition of free speech and free media by setting advertising in De Moin Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the nearby newspaper stadium, here in Beijing, you can find only a limited number of opinions and you will not see the real reflection of the desperate opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's difficult economic trajectory, because the media are controlled by the firm hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most read newspapers in China refused his announcement offer" of the column, although he didn't say which newspaper it was.
The Republicans are distant from women's votes before the elections in the middle of the mandate, due to Cavano debaclote, analysts warn
Since many republicans nemo observe or defend Brett Cavano's nomination in the Supreme Court, despite several sexual attack charges, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially women in the upcoming elections of the mandate.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already said that they want to continue voting.
Of such things there is no return," said Grant Riher, a professor of political science at the University of Maxwell at Syracuse University, Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Riher said he suspects that the pressure on the FBI investigation of Senator Jeff Flake (Republican from Arizona) would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget tomorrow or in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, a high adviser and a national speaker of the progressive MoveOn group on on Friday, in front of Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators cried "November coming!" at the protest in the Senate's hall, when the Republicans, who have control in the Legal Affairs Commission, decided to continue the nomination of Cavano despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blacey Ford, Mick said.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of democrats will be high," Stu Rotenberg, a non-party political analyst on the news site.
"The people already say they are tall; that's true.
But they can be higher, especially among independent female voters in the suburb and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which her sexual attack charges against the judge's candidate in the Supreme Court were detailed, the analysts suggest that there may be negative consequences if the Republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Still, former president of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to the news of En-Bi-Si.
"It's not only about the voting in the committee or the last vote or whether Cavano will go to a hearing, it's also the way the Republicans deal with this and how they treated it," said Guy Cesil, director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps picking democrats, for the news channel.
However, the Americans are divided about whom to trust after the testimony of Ford and Cavano, although more people accept the first party.
The new Yu-Gov survey shows that 41 percent of the investigators definitely or likely believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably trust Cavano.
Furthermore, 38 percent claimed that Cavano believed that he probably or definitely lied in the testimony, while only 30 percent thought the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the charges made by Ford, as well as at least one other, Deborah Ramirez, said Gardian.
Ford witnessed before the Senate's Legal Questions Commission, under oath last week that Cavano in a drunk state attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez accuses the judge's candidate in the Supreme Court showed her genitalia at a party while they studied Yale in the 1980s.
World Network Inventor plans to start a new Internet to cause Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Network, begins with a startup business that pretends to be a Facebook rival, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrapt, is a company built on the open code platform of Solid, Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee was joking that Inrust's intention was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said to start-up business.
"It's the historic moment now."
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own " Internet data stock" or shortened sub.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Mycrossoft Outluk, Slack and Spotifay to be available to all of them at the same time.
What is unique for the Internet's personal data storage is that only a user depends on having access to certain types of information.
The company calls it "personal strengthening through data".
The idea of Inrapt, according to the executive director of the company John Bruce, is the company to provide resources, process and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several development developers with a project and community volunteers coders.
Starting this week, technological developers across the world can create their decentralized applications using tools available on Inrapt's website location.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to make complete changes where their business models are completely turned up overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In the media announcement published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrapt mission is to enable commercial energy and ecosystem to protect integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the Consortion of the World Network of the Institute for Technology in Massachusetts.
Recently, Berners-Lee is an influenced speaker in the Internet neutrality debate.
Even when starting with Inrapt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consortion, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am a great optimist for the new era of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: A Famous Victorian Cross Carrier of World War I
The only priest of the English Church who received the Victorian cross during the first World War as a warrior has been celebrated in his home city for 100 years.
Colonel, honored Bernard Van received a confession on September 29, 1918 in Belengliz and Lehaukur attack.
Still, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had received the highest British warmark.
The commerate stone was discovered by his two grandchildren on the parade in Rashden, Northemptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was a "incredible symbol" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather got the delight.
According to the London newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through Channel de Saint Quentin "In the very thick fog and under a strong fire of guns and mitrales."
Later, he ran to the places where he was fired, and with “the greatest courage ” he led forward, before he attacked the top nest himself and disabled three of the servicemen.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the war was over.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's works were "what I know I will never be able to fulfill it, but it's something that makes us modest."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also put a vein after the parade led by the Brantwood Youth Empire band.
Michael Van said "It's a great honour to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of the real hero is shown with the support given by many people."
The fans of combined fighting skills stayed awake all night to watch Belator 206, instead Pepa Prass
Imagine, you're awake all night to watch the Belator 206, without having the possibility of watching the main event.
The list of San José consisted of 13 fights, including six with the main cards shown live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just Gerard Mussasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face, the British viewers remained intimidated when the channel was transferred to Pepa Praise.
Some were not impressed since they stayed awake until early hours for the fight.
One of Twitter's fans described the transfer of a child drawing fill as a "some painful joke".
"The law is that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate, so it had to be transferred to the child program," Dave Schwartz, vice-president of the Belaire for Marketing and Communication, said when he was asked for the transfer.
"Pepper pig," yes"
The President of the company, Belator Scott Cooker, said they would work on a schedule that would include British watchers in the future.
"I think that when I think about regaining, I think we can probably find a solution," Cucker said.
"But there is six o'clock a week and we will not be able to find a solution on Sunday after our time, and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when we were transferred, we received a lot of messages and none of them were flattered.
We were trying to fix it. We thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the number of five fights, instead of six -- as we usually do -- we tried to deliver more for the fans, and we exaggerated.
It's an unfortunate situation
Disks on an empty island: Tom Daily felt "inferior" because of sexuality
The Olympic Jumper Tom Daily says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality -- but it motivated him to be successful.
24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "It's not all like me"
Speaking to the first show of Discovi on the desert island of Radio 4, presented by Lauren Lavern, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being a parent made him less concerned about the winning of the Olympics.
The regular presenter of Kirstie Yang's long-year show took a multimesecular vacation for sickness.
Appearing as a comparable character in Lavern's first program, Daily said he felt "minor" than anyone else while he grew up because "that was not socially acceptable to have sympathy to boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of lower value and difference were things that gave me power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “things, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The Olympic with two bronze medals became a famous supporter of LGBT campaigns and used his performance at this year's Games of the Communvelt in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he was speaking publicly because he felt happy to live openly without division and wants to give “the hope ” to others.
The three-time world champion said about falling in love with a man - American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "I was surprised."
Daily married the Oscar, who is 20 years older, last year, but said that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you go through so many early ages," he went to the first olympics of 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar heights and depths.
Both became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black Daily, and Daley said "all his views" changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was related to "I should win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than a gold medal on the Olympics.
My golden olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears his father Robert, who died in 2011, aged 40, after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daily said that his father did not accept death, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London 2012 — because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be here to be in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized he was invincible," he said.
Next year Dalee competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I dreamed about all my life - to jump in front of the home audience of the Olympic Games, there was no better sense," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song — Heather Smoll’s pride — that he was in his head when he was preparing for the Olympics, and from which he was still grieving.
Disks on an empty island on Bi-Bi-Si Radio 4 is Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Michelson, he's not in shape, he was on the bench during Coop Ryder on Saturday.
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he's playing the 47th Rider game, but he'll have to change the format to avoid an unfortunate turnout.
Michelson, who played the biennial event, the recorded 12th time, was sent to the captain Jim Furic bench during the Saturday double couples and fours.
Instead of being in the center of attention, as often represents the United States, the five-time winner, he shared the time to cheer and exercise his game, on the scope, with the hope that he will fix what he is pushing.
He has never been the best leader, even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not the perfect choice for the narrow playground Le Golf Nasional, where the remote rough strikes are a regular punishment in ignorance.
And if the ground itself is not enough scary, Michaelson, on the ninth game on Sunday, faces the exact champion of British Open Francisco Molinari, who plays in a couple with the starter Tommy Flitwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who lack four points before 12 individual matches, start hard, Michaelson's game can be crucial.
Furic expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, touched me on his back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furic said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's part of the famous and has given a lot about these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's what we thought we had to do.
He wants to play, like everyone else."
Michelson's gonna pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played games of Coop Ryder on Sunday.
It could be the end of the career in Coupet Ryder where he never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Michelson has 18 victories, 20 lost games and seven halfs, although Furrick said his presence was carrying something inadequate in the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, sophisticated, he wants to joke with people and he's a great man at team meetings," he explained.
"I think younger players had fun playing with him, as well as this week, which was fun to see.
He offers a lot more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, from experience knows that a significant leadership in front of individual matches in the last day of Coop Ryder can easily turn into an uncomfortable position.
The Danish debited the Walderama competition in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Ballesteros had five points in front of the Americans, but "their goals only crossed with the noses" with the least 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"I remind myself that we had a great leadership in Walderama; we had a great leadership in Brooklyn, when we lost Walderama, when we won for a little," said Bjorn, paintingly after he watched the class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a lead from 10-6 of Le Golf Nasional.
Well, history will show me and everyone in the team that this isn't over.
You're going ready for tomorrow.
Get out and play right.
This is not over until the game lasts.
We have a goal, and that's trying to win the trophy, and the focus remains on it.
I say all the time, I focus on 12 players in our team, but we are fully aware of the opposite side - the best players in the world."
Bjorn added satisfied with the results of his players in a heavy golf field: "I don't want to give too early estimates on that issue.
The game tomorrow is a different beast.
Tomorrow, individual games are waiting for us, and that is a different job.
It's great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, you test all the ability as a golf player.
That's the message to send to the players, to give their best to tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furic will ask players to play better individually than they play in couples, exceptions are Jordan Speed and Justin Thomas, who won three points of four.
Furrick himself was at the two ends of the last day's changes, because he was part of the victory team in Brooklyn before he ended as a loser when Europe performed "The Wonder in Medina"
"I remember every word there," he said when he was asked about how Ben Krenshaw, the captain in 1999, united the players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to start as at the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the momentum goes in a certain direction, it brings a lot of pressure on medium games.
We set the line properly and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to make magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to resist first and face Rory McClroy's most important competition, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ian Polter with other Europeans in the most important half of the order.
"I decided to play this way with the boys because I think we're going to cover everything," Bjorn said about the election in individual games.
The new German warship has been reconsidered
The latest fregage of the German Navy was to be delivered in 2014 to replace older warships from the cold wartime, but that would not happen until next year because of the wrong systems and growth prices, local media reported.
The shipping of Rineland-Faltz, the leading ship from the new class fregati Budden-Withamberg, is now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to DiCate's newspaper, calling for a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the problem issues after delivery hampered the destiny of the ambitious project.
Four ships from the Baden-Withamberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will be replaced by the old fregates of the Bremen class.
It is known that they will contain a powerful top, a large number of anti-avionic weapons and sailing missiles, as well as some stelt-technology, as a reduced radar, infrared and acustical trail.
Among other important characteristics is the rare maintenance - it should be possible, the latest fregates, to be absent up to two years from domestic ports.
However, continuous delays mean that modern warships -- which should enable Germany to have power over the oceans -- will be already exhausted until they enter the service, Dee Zeit notes.
The F125 unfortunate fate fregate reached the front pages last year, when the German Navy officially refused to receive the ship and returned to the Bloom and Voss shipbuilding in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to a shipbuilding ship after delivery.
It is a little known about the reasons for return, but German media quote a large number of key "software and hardware defects" which have caused the military ship to be useless if it has been sent to a war mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important because the ships from the Buden-Withamberg class will have a crew of approximately 120 sailors -- only half of the crew of the elderly fregates of the Bremen class.
It also turned out that the ship is drastically above the planned weight that reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add upgrades in the future.
"Ryneland-Faltz" weighs 7,000 tons and it is believed to be twice the harder ships of a similar class that Germany used in World War II.
Besides the problem hardware, the price of the entire project -- including the training of the crew -- also became a problem.
It is said that it has reached incredible 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) -- growth from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the latest fregates are particularly important because of the warnings about the reduced naval force of Germany.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Defence Commission, confirmed that the Navy "is out of ships that can be allocated".
The representative said that the problem went worse over time, because the old ships were withdrawn from service, but there are no substitute ships.
He complained that none of the fregates from the Baden-Withamberg class could join the Navy.
The National Structural Listens to the Secret Life of the Squirrels
A new research of the property in the Scotland mountains is being carried out in order to identify how squirrels use the limit in the search for food.
There is hope that discoveries will provide answers to the behavior of unique flying sycerers and will help to manage protection activities in the future.
Study of Scientists of the National Structural Structury for Scotland will follow the ordinary and soprano-lips, as well as brown slippers with long ears and daubenton squirrels in Inverou Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the slippers during the season.
En-Aich-ES staff and volunteers will also carry mobile research using manual detectors.
Expert analyses of sounds of all videos will determine the frequency depending on the species of slippers.
Then there will be a map of housing to create a detailed picture of their behaviour within the border.
Rob Devar, a Nature Adviser in En-T-Es, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of living are the most important for the slippers and how each of the species uses them.
These information will help to identify the benefits of the management of livelihoods, such as the creation of leathers and how best to maintain forests for slippers and other connected species.
The population of squirrels in Scotland and Britain has significantly decreased in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affect beds and the loss of living places.
The winds and lights are also a risk, as well as the sticky flies tapes and some chemical treatments on construction materials, as well as the attacks on home cats.
The slippers are not actually blind.
However, because of their habits of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a capture.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to find insects and obstacles in the flying path.
En-T-Es, who cares for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of the country in the country, takes the slippers very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, inspections of beds, and sometimes rescue.
The organization even creates the first and only reservation for squirrels in Scotland on the property of Triv in Damphreys and Gallowey, which is a home of eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
The estate manager David Thompson says the property is a perfect territory for them.
"There in Triv we have a great area for slippers," he said.
"We have old buildings, very old two and very good places.
But there's a lot of unknown things about the slippers, so the work we're doing here and on other property will help us learn more about what they need to make progress."
He emphasizes that it is important to verify whether there are squirrels before reconstruction of property because unconscious destruction of beds can destroy up to 400 females and infants, and destroy the entire local population.
The slippers are protected and illegal to kill, torture or disturb or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official in the Trust for Protection of Swans, encourages the public to help.
She said: “We still need a lot to learn about the slippers and the other species, we just don’t know how they live. ”
Ronaldo rejected rape charges and lawyers will sue German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo called the accusations of rape "fake news", and added that people "will promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which announced the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American, named Catherine Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid $375,000 to stop talking about the incident, said Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking on a live video on Instagram of its 142 million followers, a few hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldo, 33, rejected reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was presented today is fake news," the five-time winner of the goldball said before his camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of the work.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for accusations, which they called "inadmissible transfer of suspicions from private life", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Shertz said the player would seek damage for "moral damage alongside the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
Apparently, the incident subjected to accusations occurred in June 2009 in the hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After they met at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player’s room, where he reportedly raped her analytically, according to the documents submitted to the court in Clarke area in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" "good boy," but he dropped under that "one percentage".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but there was a consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and photos were made of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to a treaty without a judicial participation because she was afraid of revenge" and was concerned that she would "be publicly ashamed".
The 34-year-old says now demands a change in the deal because there are traumas of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred and this summer moved to the Italian giant Yuventus with an agreement worth 100m euros.
Bregzit: Britain will always regret the loss of car manufacturers
Britain "will always regret" if he loses the world leader's status in car production after Bragzit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "restraining" what Toyota-Brithania reported to Bi-Bi-Si that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production in the Burnastone factory, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of borders in the case of Bragzit without an agreement would cost jobs.
The Burnastone factory - produced by Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think if Britain exited from the EU at the end of March would have a cease of production in our factory," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Burnastone.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concern about how cross-border trade, including Honda, Be-Em-We and Jaguar Land Rover, will function when leaving the EU without an agreement.
Be-Em-We, for example, says he'll close his mini factory in Oxford a month after Bragsit.
The main concerns are linked to what car manufacturers call the risks of the logistic chain in the case of Bragzit without agreement.
Toyota's production line works according to the "accuracy in time", while parts arrived every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for cars according to orders.
If Britain left the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a break on the border which, according to the industry, can cause delays and shortcomings of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day inventory in the Derbishire factory, said the company, so production will stop.
Mr. Clark said Teresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "to avoid such border checks".
"We should have a deal. We need to have the best agreement that will allow us not only the success we will enjoy in the present, but we should grab this opportunity," he said to today's Radio 4 program on Bi-Bi-Si.
"The evidence is not only from Toyota, but also other producers that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains."
Toyota couldn't tell how long the production would be stopped, but warned long-termly that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and cost jobs.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has worked in Burnastone for 24 years and has been a representative of the union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my own experience, as soon as those jobs are gone, they will never return.
According to a government speaker: "We have set up a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Tramp's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, reports the White House
The important meeting of Donald Tramp with Deputy Public Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein can be "deferred for another week" because the fight on the nomination of Brett Cavano for judge in the Supreme Court, White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is supervising the work of special advisor Robert Muller, investigating Russian interference in elections, links between Tramp and Russia's assistants and potential violations of the laws by the President.
Whether Tramp will fire the Deputy Public Prosecutor and thus threaten Miller's independence, encourages talks in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times announced that Rosenstein was thinking of carrying a video machine with Tramp and the possibility to remove the president over the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denyed the report.
But by publishing reports last Monday, he went to the White House with intention to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Tramp was scheduled for Thursday because he was at the time in the United Nations in New York.
Tramp said "I wouldn't" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid a conflict in the hearing of the Senate's Justice Committee, in which Cavano also witnessed and one of the women accused of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blacey Ford.
On Friday, Tramp issued an order to conduct a weekly investigation by the FBI on Cavanaugh's lawsuits, which would further delay the vote in the Senate.
The Tramp Sara Sanders press secretary appeared at Fox News Sunday.
On the question of the meeting with Rosenstein, she answered: “The date of the meeting is still not established, it could be held this week, and could also be delayed for another week in view of all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see how things are going to happen, and I'm always trying to make the press properly informed."
Some journalists contested the claim: Sanders had not been briefing about the reporters in the White House of September 10th.
Chief Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the small number of briefings is not due to the inconvenience of the "great influence" of television journalists, although he added: "I will agree with the fact that they have a great influence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Tramp and the media would rise.
"The President organizes more sessions on questions and answers from any president before him," she said, adding without giving evidence: "We have considered those numbers."
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States, it is far better than to talk to me.
We're trying to do this more often, and you're witnessing that we've been doing it all the time over the past few weeks, and the talks with the President of the United States will replace the briefings for the press."
Tramp regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences visiting high officials.
Rarely participating in single press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may show why it is so with his uncontrolled and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the collected journalists.
Health Secretary to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system on the fears related to Bragzit
The health secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in the Scotland National Health System, expressing the country's gratitude and the desire to remain after Braggsit.
Gene Freeman, a parliamentary to the Scotland Parliament, sent this letter less than six months before the retreat of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scotland government has already bound to cover the costs for resolved applications for EU citizens working in public services at a lower level.
Mrs. Freeman wrote in her letter: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU for withdrawal continued during the summer, with a view to making the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the United Kingdom government has also intensified preparations for the possibility of not reaching a treaty.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the workshop, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues of the entire EU and broaderly share precious experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the healthcare work and are useful for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Cristian Abercrombi subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered head injury
Cristian Abercromby, the defensive player (linebecker) of Tennessee State Tigers was subjected to an emergency operation after the head injury on Saturday when the team lost 31-27 of Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Teнеси Authority said.
Rod Reed, Chief Coach of Tennessee State, told the journalists that the injury occurred just before the half-time.
"He came to the sideline of the playground and just stretched himself on the country," Reid said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercromby oxygen outside the playground, and then put it in the weapons and took it to further evaluation.
The official of the Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV in Neshville, Tennessee, that Abercromby came out of surgery in the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no information about the type/degree of injury" and "Tennessee State" is still trying to find out when the injury actually happened.
Abeccombi is a second year student and plays his first season in a red dress in Tennessee State after transfer from Illinois.
He made a total of five crashes on Saturday before he left the game, which resulted in 18 destructions this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom
According to Tori's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless persons
This move will neutralize the success of Corbin's attempt to attract young voters
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The Ministry expects this move to gather up to 120 million pounds a year, funds to be used for helping homeless persons
Teresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless persons.
This move will be considered as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide accessible home and focus on persons with high earnings.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom, while additional funds will strengthen the Government's efforts to improve the situation with homeless persons.
The additional amount which, in addition to the current administrative fee, includes the higher levels which have been introduced two years ago for the second home and the purchase of property intention to rent it can reach up to three per cent.
The Ministry expects this move to gather up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built property in London are purchased by non-United Kingdom people, which led to increased prices and caused difficulties for those who buy the property for the first time to engage in this process of buying household property.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "grounds of ghosts" because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was published only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked to reduce the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the large construction firms of offering high prices to land holding, but did not use it and asked Mrs. May to change the quotas for access homes in order to fix the "happy situation with home" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive home reforms, including rental controls and ending the evictions without justified reasons.
He also wants the advice to give greater powers to build new homes.
Ms. May said: " Last year I said I would devote my prime ministership to returning the British dream, or life to be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken home market.
Britain will always be open for people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, those who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies can buy homes as easy as worthy British inhabitants.
The dream of owning his own home for many people has become too far away, and the humiliation of homeless persons is too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland."
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, said his "end ambition" is in the future to become the director of Scotland's national club.
The Scotch, 42, enjoys the challenge to resume the northeast club, which is currently in the third place in the first league with only three points less than the top club.
This summer he moved to the "St. Mirren Stadion of Light" after he returned "St. Mirren" back to the Scottish Prime Minister League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it," Ross told Scotland Sportsound of BBC.
"But I grew up constantly watching Scotland in Hampden with my father and something always dragged me back.
However, such a possibility I could only get if I'm successful in the club management."
Some of Ross' predecessors as the manager of the Sunderland are Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keen, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Kanio.
Former head of Alloa Athletic says he has not felt any disturbance, knowing that he should follow such established names in such a big club, since he had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success is currently assessed by "Can I return this club to the Premier League?"
Given the structure and objects in this club, he certainly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not a easy task to bring this club to there, but I'm probably going to think I've achieved success here only if I return the club back there."
Ross is only a manager for three years, in which his career came into since he worked as a assistant of the boss in Dumbarton and after a 15-month engagement as part of the Hearts Coach staff.
Then helped Alloa recover from the third League falling and restored St. Mirren from the edge of the loss of the title in the Championship in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he played in "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St. Mirren" and "Hamilton Academical".
"It was probably a real crusade for me," he recalls the receipt of "Alloa".
"I honestly believed that the career as the manager was the right choice for me, a better choice than the career as a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, making enough money and enjoying some high privileges.
But building a career as a player can be really difficult.
There's a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
I still go through certain things in the sense of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good in the role of the manager.
I always wanted to be the manager, and now I do it, in this role I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life."
You can hear the whole Sportsound interview on Sunday, September 30th of Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST (British summer time)
According to a study, the perfect beer time is at 17:30 a.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the profit of British pubs which are currently in a very difficult situation, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that the pubs and bars observed an increase in sales of 2.7 per cent in July, but the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a CGA company for business consultant services in the identification of these figures, said: "The suntime and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Championship meant that the situation in July was similar to the one in June, when the profits of pubs increased by 2.8 per cent, and the restaurants were significantly reduced.
The drop of 1.8 per cent of the restaurants in June has even worsened during July.
The pubs and bars in which drinks are mostly selling have noticed a much higher increase in comparison with the previous years, in contrast to restaurants where the decline was observed.
The pubs in which food is mostly sold were also badly affected by sun times, although not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to get out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, drink sales increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, and food sales were only three per cent.
Paul Newman, a vacation and hospitality analyst from RSM, said: "This results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sports events remain to be the most important factors when it comes to market sale outside the house.
It is no surprise that the restaurants are still in a difficult situation, although the 4.8 per cent sales fall for a year will be particularly exciting as complementary to the current pressures created by the cost.
The long hot summer could not come at a worse time for local owners who mostly sell food and time will show whether the moderate temperatures we had in August would provide a very necessary breath."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the delay in publishing new brands.

One of the five children has a secret profile of social media that hides from their parents
A study showed that one of the five children, some of whom are 11 years old, have a secret profile of social media that he hides from his parents and teachers
Research included 20,000 high schools showed an increase in the number of "fake Instagram" profiles
The news has raised fear that such profiles are published in sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had one "head" profile that showed to their parents
One of the five children, some of whom are 11 years old, creates a social media profile that he hides from adults.
The research included 20,000 high schools showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Insta" profiles, a shortlist for the Instagram website where photos are sharing.
The news has increased the fear that such profiles are published in sexual contents.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clear "head" profile that they showed their parents, while they had other private profiles.
A mother who randomly found the secret profile of her 13-year-old daughter on the same came to a teenager who asked others to rape him.
The study carried out by the Digital Awareness of the UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistress Conference (HMC) in independent schools showed that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them recognized that one of them was secret.
The chief of HMC Mike Buchanan said: "It is really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Ellid Doyle will be the "sports vote" of the Scottish Athletics board
Ellid Doyle was elected to be an inexecutive director of the Scottish Athletics committee at the annual general meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most excellent athlete in Scotland and President Ian Beatty described the move as an excellent opportunity for those who are part of the leadership in this sport to use its broad experience at the international level acquired during the past decade.
"All in the Scotland, British and World Athletic Community have great respect for Elid and we are sure that sportsmen in Scotland would have great benefits if they become a member of the committee," Bitty said.
Doyle said: "I am ready to be the voice of sportsmen and I hope I can actually contribute to the right direction of sports in Scotland."
The American who won the titles of 200 and 400 meters in the Atlanta Games in 1996, alongside the total four gold medals on the Olympic Games, which now appears regularly as a BBC commentator, could not go after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote to Twitter: “A month ago, I got a brain attack.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would show me whether to recover or to what extent.
The whole process was macorrupted, but I managed to recover fully, and I could go and practice aggression!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
An advertisement for breast pump in which mothers are compared to cows caused a division of Internet opinions
The breast pump company caused a division of Internet opinions when he announced a advertisement in which breast-feeding mothers are compared to cows flipping.
To mark the launching of the product which is said to be the "the quietest breast pump in the world", the user-oriented Technology Company Elvie announced a funny advertisement inspired by music videos to show the freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who breast.
Four mothers dance in a stove full of cows, whose text sounds like this: "Yes, I'm slipping milk, but you don't see the tail" and "If you didn't notice this is not the wind, these are my chests."
The refren continues: "Pomp, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, pump, slip my chest."
However, the advertising published on Facebook the company's website has caused Internet controversies.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, while many have said it stresses the "crowds" of the milk industry.
"It is a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, just like us, should be pregnant and born so they can produce milk, except that their children are stealing from them only a few days after they are born," said one of the comments.
Elvie 's breast pump is discreetly fitted into the breastbrush'('Elvie'/ 'Mother')
Another comment states: “It is understandable that this is too traumatic for the mother and for the baby.
But yes, why don't you use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers that keep their babies?"
Someone added: “Really inappropriate advertising. ”
Others, however, defended the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was really "funny".
"I think this idea is brilliant.
I would've bought a pump like this if I still came.
It made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
It's a brilliant product," one of the comments said.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad for mothers who wet milk (often in their jobs or toilets) and feel like "cows."
This advertisement that fails or condemns the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were dancing while discreet pumps were pecked in their pants.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk pumps say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely silent, no wire, no pipes, and discreetly fits into the breast garlic, giving women freedom to move, keep their babies, or even leave home while wet milk.
Anna Balarin, partner and RDR in "Mather" commented: "Elvie's pump is a really revolutionary product and deserves bold and provocative launch.
By setting a parallel among women who wet milk and milk cows, we wanted to slip milk with pumps and challenges that we can put in the center of attention, showing the amazing sense of freedom that brings the new pump in a funny and closer way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump to be present in all titles.
During the fashion week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Marta Yakubowski wearing the product.
Thousands of children migrants quietly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children migrants in custody has increased significantly, although the crossing of the monthly level remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the fact that sharp rhetorics and policies introduced by Tramp's administration have made the placement of children in sponsors difficult.
Traditionally seen, most sponsors themselves were immigrants and feared to threaten their own stay in the country if they asked to be a child sponsor.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to bear fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albans, a high immigration and customs official last week testified before the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who were proposing for sponsorship of minors without accompanied.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested persons had no previous criminal records.
"Nearly 80 per cent of those who are either sponsors or members of the sponsors' family are illegally staying in the country and many of them are foreigners with criminal records.
Therefore, we continue to pursue those individuals," Mr. Albance said.
In order for children to process faster, the authorities introduced new rules in accordance with which some of them would be requested to appear in court within a month after they were arrested and not within 60 days, as the shelter workers say there was the previous standard.
Many of them will appear through a conference video call, not personally, in order to report their legal status before the judge of immigration.
Those who are considered unlikely to receive relief will immediately be deported.
The longer the children remain in custody, the possibly they will become upset and depressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or escape attempts, say shelter workers and reports that have appeared from the system in the past few months.
Advocates say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Thornilo, where there is a greater probability to ignore the signs that the child faces difficulties.
They added that moving children into the tent city without providing enough time to prepare emotional or to say goodbye to their friends could increase traumas that most of them are already facing.
Syria told US, French and Turkish occupational forces to retreat immediately
In its address to the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has lasted eight years.
Mualem, who also performs the function of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally staying on Syria's territory under an excuse that they participated in the fight against terrorism and "will be treated appropriately."
"They must withdraw immediately without setting conditions," he said to the congregation.
Muallem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost completed" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been moved from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "to lead this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of which train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Asad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in the territory of this country destroyed by the war.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions are good to return and accuse them of "some of Western countries" that they "proliferate irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We invited the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politize the question that should be clean humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria will not be provided for reconstruction aid until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey for setting a tampon-zone in the last large rebellion rebellion in Idlib created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia against a province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the treaty had "free deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military action would be directed towards dżihadists, including fighters from Nusra Front related to Al Qaeda, who "will be eliminated".
UN representative Stefan de Mistura hopes that he will soon appoint the first meetings of the new committee composed of government members and opposition to prepare a post constitution for Syria and open the road to elections.
Muallem established the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "authorising members of the current constitution," and warned about the consequences of further mixing in the same.
Why Tramp won the second mandate
According to that logic, Mr. Tramp will win the elections again in 2020 unless the impichment and scandal are pre-continued in advance, which is likely to be expected by a majority of liberalists.
In what will no doubt be “the dramatic final in presidency that has ever been seen! ”
From now on, there are no signs of tired in the watchers.
Since 2014, the impact rating increased more than double and reached 1.05 million in CNN and almost triplely increased and reached 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
Nilsen says "Fox News" in the average has 2.4 million viewers in the impact time, which is 1.7 million more compared to the period four years ago, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" of "MSNBC" has reached the top cable rating with about 3.5 million viewers in the evening when important news is announced.
"This is like a fire to which people feel attracted because this is not something we understand," says Neil Baer, the chief television producer of the Designed Survivor drama of the ABC for the secretary of the cabinet that becomes president after Capitol was destroyed by the attack.
Nel Skovel, a veteran in the writing of comedies and author of "Just the funny parts: and a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking in the Hollywood Boys Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her she would vote for Mr. Tramp.
She asked why.
"He answered, "Because I think he's really funny," Mrs Scowell said to me.
There is also a certain fun value in all the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories that come from Washington can define the future of Roe's case against Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to be united again, as well as the well as the well-being of the global economy.
Exclusion of all this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet you are no longer an informed citizen when you see a panel of experts who discuss the use of the source of the "deep background" by Bob Woodward for his "Fear" book, a bomber of the leather of Paul Manafort of $15,000 (wear with fat arrogance," as he called "The Washington Post") and the implications of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Tramp's anatomy.
I, for example, will never be able to see Super Mario in the same way.
"The part of what he does and which makes you feel like watching reality show is that every night brings you something new," says Brent Montgomery, the chief executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creation of the Pawn Stars for the rotating team of Tramp's show and the daily turns (carriages with NFL, commendation for Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss any episode because then you won't be able to compensate.
When I visited Mr. Flace this week, it was sunny, and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside and watching the MSNBC while he was filming on CNN.
He could not stop seeing, at least not when Brett Cavano was to face the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was critical.
"I remember we were doing all those crazy shows in the past and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of the west civilization." Mr. Flace told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Outer funds flow in the most severe medium-term elections in the Upper House Race
It is not surprising that the 17th Congress Area in Pennsylvania receives a large amount of funds due to the reorganization of congress areas where there are two candidates in the same place race.
For this recent reconstructed pregrad area in Pittsburgh, a representative of Democrats Connor Lamb is running, who has received a place in another field of extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th Congress Area, which is largely crossing the new 17th congress area.
Maps have been modified since the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that old areas were manipulated for the Republicans, which is contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th Congress area is a difficult competition for funding campaigns among the main parties sponsors, the Congress Committee for the Democratic Party's campaigns ("DCCC") and the National Conference Committee of the Republican Party ("NRCC").
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after the close victory in the extraordinary elections for the 18th Congress area in Pennsylvania held in March, which characterized wide media coverage.
For more than a decade, this place was taken by the Republican, and President Donald Tramp won the area with 20 points.
Political experts give little privilege to democrats.
The United States decided to punish El Salvador for the support of China, and then quit
Diplomatics stressed that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Peking under a small pressure by Washington.
Mr. Tramp had a friendly meeting in June 2017 with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Tramp's management team.
Officials of the State Department decided to withdraw US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "new decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, State Department spokesman in the statement she gave at the beginning of this month.
However, only in respect of El Salvador, the penalties were taken into account, which received US aid from about $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reducing financial assistance and target visa restrictions, would have a harmful impact on the country in Central America and high unemployment rates and murders in it.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar meeting last year which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, high administrative officials stressed that they wanted the conference to progress and in an effective way to end every thinking about the punishment of El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pens should address the conference scheduled for the mid-October as a sign of the importance that the administration assigns to the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three US officials quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news about heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal thinking about the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an external analyst close to the administration and also spoke of the state of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing that could happen is to announce the report of Special Adviser Robert Miller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Tramp, for which there are very strong evidence in public records right now.
Mr. Miller has reportedly also directed his investigation to the fact that Mr. Tramp's campaign is connected to Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the composition of the Congress has changed, Mr. Tramp will have to bear responsibility in that body while preparing to appear again before the voters, or perhaps even before the jury composed of his colleagues.
There are many insecurities here and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Tramp's fall is inevitable, nor his colleagues in Europe.
We all on both sides of the Atlantic should make certain elections that will affect the duration of this fight.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to strike Hitler's state if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaci in Minhen.
We failed and missed the possibility of avoiding the years of the massacre that followed.
The history flows around such changing points and the inconsistent democracy march is accelerating or delaying.
The Americans are now facing several such points of change.
What if Mr. Tramp resigned the Deputy Public Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein is on the hot chair after this newspaper announced that he suggested that the president should be taken secretly last year and speculated that he was inappropriate for the function he performed.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in the Times is incorrect.
"What will we do if the new investigation of Brett Cavano requested by the F.B.I. is incomplete or unfair, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite the reliable accusations of sexual attack and false testimony?
And first of all, will we vote for a congress that will blame Mr. Tramp?
If we fall on all these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I believe that this would not happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew of Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to burn candles for Sabbath at a table with a swastik logo.
With such heritage, how can I not be optimist for the future?"

Graham Dorans from Rangers with a optimistic position in front of the conflict with Rapid Vienna
Rangers are hosts of the rapid Vienna conflict on Thursday, and they are aware of the fact that after the played unsolved game against "Villarreal" in Spain in early this month, the victory of Austrians will strengthen their position to be qualified in Group G in League Europe.
Graham Dorens, a middle-line player due to knee injury, was prevented from showing up in the season until the unsolved 2-2 game with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use that result as a drop-down board to greater achievements.
"It was a good point for us because "Villarreal" is a good opponent," a 31-year-old player said.
"We entered the game, believeing that we can achieve something and returned with a winning point.
Maybe we could give a little more at the end, but the unsolved result was probably fair.
They were better in the first half time, and we did our best in the second half - time and we were better.
On Thursday we are waiting for another great European night.
I hope we'll win three points, but it'll be a hard game because they've had good results in the last game, but I'm sure with the support of the cheerleaders we'll return and get a positive result.
Last year, it was definitely a difficult year, in view of everything that happened, my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a positive factor about the place.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy; training is good.
I hope we can go forward now, leave it behind us last season and achieve success."
Women can't sleep at night because of this fear of retirement savings
Although the research participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be concerned, few talked to their family about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by the Nationalwide said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"The people want their family to take care of them, but they do not take steps to discuss the same," Holly Snyder, vice-president of the Nationwide life insurance company.
Here's where you should start.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not share your desires with them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how to get care because such elections can be a significant factor in the determination of costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay those costs.
Your choices to finance long-term care can include traditional long-term care policy, hybrid life insurance policy, which can help you cover your costs or provide self-insurance with your own funds, if you have them.
Measure your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the beginning.
Extract authorized health care so that you can authorize a person with confidence to supervise your medical care and ensure that health professionals respect your wishes unless you are able to communicate.
Think also about your financial resources.
In this way, you would choose a person with confidence to make financial decisions on your behalf and pay your accounts unless you are able to do so yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your older parents need emergency medical care and are on their way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the drugs he drinks and his allergies?
Please note these details in writing to be prepared.

A man shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracomb
A man was shot several times with a air rifle while he was coming home from the exit.
The victim of approximately 40 years of age was located in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracomb when he was shot in his chest, stomach and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which happened about 2:30 BST (British summer time) as "a random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not dangerous for life, and the police appealed to witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died of a severe earthquake and tsunami affected by the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials reported, expected to increase the number of victims.
Because of the interruption of communications, aid persons can't get information from the Dongala district, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter of 7.5 degrees.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people from Palu were evacuated.
In the continuation of several key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulavesi province, which is located at the end of the net bay on the west coast of Sulavesi, with the estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when he was hit by the earthquake and the tsunami.
Dongala is a district that stretches more than 300 miles (180 miles) on the coast in the northwest of the island of Sulavesi.
The district, which represents the administrative region within the province, has estimated the population of 299.200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the province's economy of Central Sulavesi, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nikel's retrieving is also important activity in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morali, on the opposite coast of Sulaves.
The Indonesian disaster mitigation agency said Palu and Dongala were hit by tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
The tsunami also hit the west Dongala in 1996, and nine people died.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific ring of the fire and regularly affects earthquakes.
Some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province Acheh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, with 226,000 people killed along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them were Acheh's inhabitants.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The landquake of 6,8 degrees hit the South of Java, the most inhabited island in Indonesia, causing tsunami that destroyed the southern coast, and nearly 700 people died.
2009: The earthquake of 7.6 degrees hit the area near Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7,5 degrees hit one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, causing tsunamis that reached up to 10 meters and destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The earthquake with tiny focus hit the district Pidi Jaya in Acheh, causing desert and panic because it reminded people of the fatal earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the earthquake did not cause tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed by fallen buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Lomboc tourist island in Indonesia, and more than 500 people died, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stuck.
Sarah Palin’s oldest son arrested for family violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin was arrested for attack charges.
Palin, 29, from Vasila, Aljaska, was arrested under suspicion of family violence, interference in family violence report and resistance of arrest, according to the report published on Saturday by police officers in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is located in Matt-Su's detention institution with an opportunity to exit if she pays $500, KTUU reported.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "decisively innocent" when he was asked how he was said before the court, they said from the network.
Palin faces three A-class violations, which means he could be sentenced to a prison sentence within a year and a penalty of $250,000.
He is also accused of a B-class violation, punishment with a day of imprisonment and a $2,000 penalty.
This is not the first time the criminal charges against Palin were filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case in front of Alaska's veterans' court is ongoing.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic attacks, mixing into the family violence criminal report and possession of weapons under alcohol in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend said he reportedly hit her in the face.
Sara Palin was criticised by the Veteran groups in 2016, after she said her son's violent behaviour came from PTSN, resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake hit the Indonesian island Sulavesi on Friday.
The 7.5 degrees earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electric energy and communication networks are stopped, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the next days.
The earthquake hit the area near Central Sulaves, located north-east of Indonesia’s capital, Jacarda.
Social media circulate videos that show the moment of strike.
Thousands of people were gathered for the beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for the suspect for the terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death penalty for Cyfulo Saipop, a suspect of a terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people died, a rare sentence that has not been executed in the state of federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30th October, reportedly used a rented truck on Home Depot to attack a bikeway on the West Side Highway in the lower Manhattan, and to cross the walkers and bicycleists who were on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious body injuries, according to the report on the intention of demanding a death penalty delivered to the Southern County of New York.
According to judicial documents, there is a possibility to be sentenced death after both of these grounds by the prosecution act.
Several weeks after the attack, the Federal Large Jury filed a 22-base charge against Saipov, including eight murder charges for request purposes, which usually use federal prosecutors in the cases of organised crime, as well as the charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
To carry out the attack, it was necessary "detal planning and purposes," the prosecutors said, while the way Saipov executed it described it as "grozhy, cruel and perverse."
"Sifulo Habibulovic Saipov has caused, injuries, damage and loss of families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Lore Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Feruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucho," states the State's intention report.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since a death sentence was chased in the Southern County in New York.
The accused, Calid Barnes was sentenced to murder two drug suppliers, but he was finally sentenced to life prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who was executed after being convicted to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both were sentenced to death with an electric chair on June 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, has not shown regret in the days and months followed after the attack, according to judicial documents.
The police said that he told investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack after he watched the ISIS video on his phone.
The police also announced that he asked for the ISIS flag to put in his hospital room.
He stated that he was innocent on all 22 grounds of the charge.
David Patton, one of the allied public defenders representing Saipov said they were "approximately disappointed" by the prosecution decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt and pronounceing a lifetime prison punishment without the possibility of exemption will only continue the trauma of these events for all involved in the same," Paton said.
Saipov's defense has previously asked prosecutors not to seek death penalty.
Deputy from the Tori Party said the NAJGEL FARRAŽ should be responsible for Bragzit's negotiations
Nigel Faraz promised to "mobilize the People's Army" during the protest of the Tori Party's conference today.
Former leader of the Ukip Party said politicians must "sense the heat" of the European skeptics, with one of Teresa May's envoys suggesting that he should be in charge of EU negotiations.
Conservative supporter Peter Bonn on the Birmingham march said the United Kingdom would have been "will be out of the EU" if Mr. Faraz was a secretary for Bragzit.
However, the challenge faced by Mrs. May with regard to the merger of her deeply divided members was highlighted by the contra-Bregzit members of the Tori party who joined a special protest against Bragzit held in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to continue implementing the Checkers plan despite the attacks of pro-Bregzit persons, counter-Bregzit persons and the EU.
Allies insisted that she would continue to try to reach a deal with Brussels despite strong reactions and force Eurosceptics and members of the Labour Party to choose between its package and the chaos.
Mr. Bon said to the Pro-Bregzit meeting "Leave Means Leave" in Solihal that he wants to "free the Checkers plan".
He suggested that Mr. Faraz should be involved and that he should be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge of negotiations, we'd have been out of the EU by now," he said.
The Deputy of Wellingborough added: "I will support Braggsit, but we must reject the Checkers plan."
Speaking his attitude against the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars so that we could now be subjected.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bon rejected the suggestions that the public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British people had changed their opinion and wanted to remain in the EU is completely incorrect."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tori and Pro-Bregzit party, also attended the march and said to the journalists: "I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Checkers plan is not well accepted by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not well accepted by our party and our activists who are actually those who go out on the streets and who are due to our winning elections.
Please quit the Checkers plan and start listening to us."
In a message directed to Ms. May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage of the meeting said politicians must "sense the heat" if they intend to pass the decision taken to the referendum in 2016.
"This is now a matter of confidence between us, people and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to betray Braggsit, and we are here today to tell them that "we won't let you get away with it."
In a message to the excited crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the edge to betray Bragzit, feel the heat.
"We mobilize the people's army of this country that has made us victory in Bragzit and which will not stop until we become independent, self-governmental and proud of the United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, contra-Bregzit persons marched through Birmingham before held a two-hour meeting in the city center.
After the group's meeting, this weekend a small number of activists who were carrying banners with the "Torians v. Bragzit".
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the conservatives about security issues facing the opening of the conference on the application created by the party.
"This are people who tell us they can establish IT systems and all necessary technologies for Canada plus, for a border without control, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is nothing called good Bragzit," he added.

Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that the suspect of shooting and the death of Wade Simms from the LSU team that happened Friday was arrested.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Diteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 o'clock east.
They announced a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man from the video.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wade Simms had a shot wound in the head and as a result of it died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, announced "247sports".

Gran Pri to Russia: Louis Hamilton closer to the world title after the team with its orders provided the victory of Sebastian Vetel
Since Saturday Valtery Botas qualified before Louis Hamilton became clear that Mercedes's orders would play a great role in the race.
From the half position Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on the cedillo while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vetel to attack his companion.
Wetel went first to the box and let Hamilton fight the riot at the end of the group, something that was supposed to have a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the box one round later and came behind Bethel, but Hamilton went forward after the action one to one who forced Ferrari's driver unwillingly to leave the inside of his free risk to stay side after the double move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstapen started from the rear line of the network and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round ended in the seventh place.
Then he led to the majority of the race and directed the tires on his car to quickly reach the finish and reach Kimmy Raiconen, taking the fourth place.
He eventually entered the box on the 44th circle, but couldn't increase the rate in the remaining eight circles, so Raiconen came to the fourth place.
Today is a tough day because Walters did a great job all weekend and he was a gentleman who let me go.
The team made a really exclusive decision to have a couple in the race," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body speech.
President Donald Tramp laughed at Senator Diana Finnstein's song on Saturday on her insisting that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blacy Ford, blaming the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano for sexual assault.
In his speech on the event in Western Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the testimony of Ford in front of the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are "looking and dishonest and dishonest."
"There's only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what happens in the past few days in the Senate, you can see anger, people who are angry and wicked and unreasonable and unfair," he said.
"When you see announcements and flows of information and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Diana Finnstein, did you post this information?
You remember her answer... did you publish the document - "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't announce it."
Wait a minute then.
Did we announce it... no, we didn't announce it," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent to information on Cavanaugh's accusations in July, and it was published in early September, but Phinestein denyed that the information was proliferated from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't announce her story," Fiinstein said to the committee, announced the Hill.
"She asked me to keep them confidential, and I did what he asked."
But it seems that the president did not believe her denial, so he commented on the same meeting on Saturday: "I'll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body speech.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing defending the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that democrats use indications to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to restore the power in any way.
You can see their maliciousness, cruelty, they don't care who they're gonna hurt, who they need to shock to return their power and control," the president said, as he announced, "Mediaite".

Flying Controller died helping hundreds of people in a plane to save from the earthquake
The flight controller in Indonesia is famous as a hero after he died helping a plane with hundreds of people to fly safely.
More than 800 people died, and many disappeared after the great earthquake hit the Sulavesi island on Friday, causing tsunami.
Strong sequential earthquakes continue to desert the area, and many are stuck in the ruins in Palou.
But even though his colleagues fled to save their own life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave the position at the Control Tower at Mutiara Sis Al Juffrey airport in Palo, which was constantly screwing.
He remained in his position to ensure that the Batik Air plane with a flight number 6321 that was at that time on the flight will fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower at the moment he thought the tower was blowing down.
He died later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, speaker of Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision was likely to save hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Ballicpapan to Calimantan to take him to a larger hospital to another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"This news broke our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands of people, the disaster relief agency says access to the towns of Dongala, Siggy and Butong is limited.
"The number of victims is believed to increase because many bodies are still under the ruins, while many cannot even access," the spokesman of the Sutopo Purvo Nugroho Agency said.
The waves that reached up to six meters desolate Palu, where mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Speed help brings bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
The minimarkets are robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "Red Cross in Indonesia is fast to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesian President Yoko Vidodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and ordered the national army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lomboc, and more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane accident in Micronesia: "Air Niugini" now say a man disappeared after the fall of the lagoon plane
The airline that operated with the plane that fell into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man disappeared after he said that the 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the tone plane.
In the Air Niugini statement, they said they can't find the male passenger from Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced that he worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the demands for more details for the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Cheek Island airport.
Officials announced on Friday that seven were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and they were all stable.
The cause of the accident, as well as the correct order of events, remains unclear.
The airline and the American Navy announced that the plane hit the lagoon near the road.
Some witnesses thought that the plane missed the road.
American traveller Bill Janes said the plane flyed very low.
"It's an extremely good job," Janes said.
Jane said that he and others managed to pass through the water that reached them to half and to go to the emergency exits of the plane that drowned.
He said that the stewardes were in panic and screamed, and that he suffered a smaller head injury.
The American Navy announced that the seafarers working near the reconstruction of the port also helped to rescue, while by means of a drowning ship, the people were transferred to the shore before the plane drowned at about 30 feet (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data show that 111 people died in accidents of airlines registered in PNG in the last two decades, but no airline Air Niugini involved.
The analyst established the time frame of the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended presenting the case on Saturday for the retrial of a man who was accused that a woman in Mississippi burned her alive in 2014.
Paul Rovlet, an analyst from the U.S. Ministry of Justice, witnessed classes as a witch in the field of intelligence analysis.
He stressed the jury that he used phone records to connect the movements of 29-year-old Queenton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rovlet said he received data on the location of several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous statements, said the Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was questioned on Saturday and witnessed that day was not in town.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth saying he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he "lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Telis said he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The telephone records show that they only knew one week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted messages and calls from Chambers, as well as her contact information from his phone.
"He deleted it from his life," Hale said.
The defense should present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to decide on the case later the same day.

Another black girl?!
New York Nanny sued a couple because she was fired after sending a "racist" message
The nanny from New York sued a couple because she was fired on the basis of discrimination after she was mistakenly received a message from the mother who complained about the fact that she was “a still a black woman. ”
Marriage couples deny that they are racists, saying that the lawsuit is actually "extortion".
Lyncy Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, was disappointed when in 2016 after the first day of the new career Giselle Morris learned that she was a black woman.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE" Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in the message addressed to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, and that twice.
After she realized what Plasco-Flaxman actually did, feeling "uncomfortable" fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, who is afro-American, was doing a bad job and that instead of her, she expected the nanny to be from the Philippines, announced New York Post.
Ms. Morris was paid for the first day of work, and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris sues the marriage couple and asks for a compensation for discharge of $350 a day for six months, an engagement that will include it to live with the family, what she was originally engaged, but without the conclusion of a contract.
"I want to show them that such things should not be done," she said to the Post on Friday, adding "I know it is discrimination."
The marriage couple replied to the lawsuits that they were racists, saying that the release of Mrs. Morris was a reasonable procedure because they feared that they could no longer trust her after she was insulted.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco said to Post.
"But would you trust your children in face to whom you were rude, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be real."
Saying that the lawsuit is "extortion," Plasco said his wife had born the baby only two months ago and was in "very difficult situation".
"Are you going to attack someone who is in such a situation?
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still in progress, the public immediately condemned the social media couple, criticizing them for their behaviour and logic.
Publishers of Paddington fear that readers will not be able to connect to a bear speaking, revealed in the new letter
Karen Jankel, a daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said about the letter: “It is really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very interesting that we now know all this about the huge success of Paddington.
After she said that her father who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before she got inspired to write a book from a little toy in a form of a bear, he would still be optimistic if his work had not been well accepted, she added that the 60th anniversary of the edition of the book was "and bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
For Paddington, whom she describes as "very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt silent pride about his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and he didn't want to praise at all," she said.
"But because you felt "Paddington" so real, it was almost like having a child who has achieved something in life: and you are proud of him, even though success is not due to you.
I think the success of the Paddington was in such a way.
Although it was about creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the deserves to himself "Paddington."
My daughter was on a mortal bed and I had to say goodbye on her phone.
At a landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nica, where doctors tried to save her life for nothing.
"Nade called me regularly to tell me that the situation is very bad and it is expected to not survive," said Mrs. Eden-Lapperus.
"Then Над called me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medication that the doctors gave to maintain her heart pumping slowly decreased, and they came out of her system.
She died before, and this meant all her systems canceled.
I just had to sit and wait, aware of the fact that all this is happening.
I couldn’t scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to stay safe."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapperus mourned about the loss of her daughter boarded the plane along with other passengers, unconscious of the difficult situation she passed through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head down, and the tears didn't stop.
It's hard to explain, but when I was in the plane, I felt an excessive compassion for Над.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Unfortunate women put cards on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones because of suicide make efforts to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamphreys set cards on the Walsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself when he was 18 years old.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, says her son had a great potential to become a cook, as well as an infected smile.
"Everyone remembered it by his smile.
People always said that his smile could light every room."
However, he quit his work before he died because he was “in a really dark place. ”
His brother, who was 11 then, was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after he took his life.
Ms. Davis said: "I fear that it will have a consistent effect."
Ms. Davis makes cards "to give others to know that there are people outside who can address and with whom they can talk, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to start talking."
Mrs. Humphreys, who's a long-year friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her partner Mark who was married 15 years after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt unhappy or depressed, or he said nothing," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behaviour.
He reached the bottom of the Christmas day when the children opened their gifts, and he didn't even look them in the eye and establish any contact with them."
She said that his death was a huge trauma for all of them, but they must find a way to go through it: “This kind of thing ruins the family.
It leaves us broken.
But we must move on and fight."

Brett Cavano's future is uncertain since the FBI started the investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something similar to what he was looking for, or a limited time investigation, with limited range, we might be able to achieve a small unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears that the committee is "depreciated" under the conditions of the rooted party-exit state.
Why did Cavano and his supporters from the Republican Party not want the FBI to investigate?
Their hesitation is due only to the time.
The medium-term elections should only be held in a few weeks, or on November 6th, and if as the Republicans are expected to fail, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to be elected by their man as a member of the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying Mr. Cavano who worked at Mr. Bush's White House and met his wife, Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are 51 Republicans and 49 democrats at the moment.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Cavano can receive at least 50 votes of the Senate, allowing Vice President Mike Pens to change the insolvency and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea "declined" under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Yong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean deputy.
Park Bjeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Unitedation Ministry, said that last year there were 1.127 crossings to the border compared to 2011 when there was 2.706.
Mr. Park said the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the higher human smuggler tariffs are key factors.
Pyongyang didn't comment publicly.
Most of the north Korean refugees have been receiving citizenship in South Korea.
Seul says that more than 30,000 people in North Korea illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most are running across China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and which can easily be passed into comparison with the well protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them in force.
Relations between North and South, which are technically still in war, have significantly improved in the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the subjects focusing on the delay of denuclearisation negotiations.
This followed the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Tramp and Kim Yong-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal -- the Korean Poluotok without nuclear weapons.
But the Foreign Minister of North Korea Ri Yong-ho accused on Saturday sanctions imposed by the United States for stagnating progress from then on.
"If there is no confidence in the United States; it will not trust either our national security and in such conditions, we cannot unanimously disarm ourselves first," Mr. Ri said in the speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavano "hysterical" and says he is not suitable to serve in the Supreme Court
The leader of minority in the House of Representatives called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Cavano "hysterical" and said that if taking into account his temperament, he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday's "Texas Tribune Festival" in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't think that if a woman had acted that way, they would say she's "hysterical," Pelosi said to her response to Cavano's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally denyed the allegations that he sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blacy Ford when they were teenagers.
Cavano was very emotional at his introduction exhibition, sometimes even screaming and clipping when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling allegations against him "grothesk and coordinated destruction of his reputation" organized by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost at presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Cavano's testimony was proof that he couldn't serve in the Supreme Court because it proved to be astray against democrats.
"I think he disqualifys himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and democrats," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question whether she would try to remove Cavano from the function if the indications against him were confirmed and if democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth before the Congress or before the FBI, then he is not only inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court, but he is not even suitable to serve in the court where he is on the function at the moment," Pelosi said.
Cavano is now a judge at the District Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she is concerned about the possible verdicts that Cavano will bring against the Law of Accession Health or Roe against Wade, because it is considered to be subject to conservative justice.
In the hearings for confirmation of his candidacy, Cavano did not answer questions about whether he would cancel some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, extraordinary man to enter the court and expect us to say, "that is really wonderful, isn't it," Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
It's really acute criticism, months and years of gathering anger, which she can't free from herself without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrs. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continued: “It helped me a woman who was doing an executive function somewhere, and who told me she was crying when she was angry, but she managed to develop her technique, so when she gets mad and crying, she tells the person with whom she talks, “Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she keeps crying.
I think that's brilliant."
The tears are permitted as an exhausted vent for the wrath partly because they are actually misinterpreted.
One of my most clear memories of one of my first jobs in the office where the men were dominated is when I once started crying with an unreasonable anger and an older woman, a cold manager of whom I always had a certain fear, caught me for the neck and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll enjoy the fact that they managed to reach you."
Patricia Schroeder was a democratic congresswoman from Colorado during that period and worked with Gary Hart at his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extra-marriage affair of a ship called "Monkey Business" and retired from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, she realized that there was no reason why she should not consider the idea of running for president.
"It wasn't a well-considered decision," he said 30 years later through the laugh.
"There have already been seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow and Seven Coppers."
Given the fact that the campaign has been launched a long time ago, it has not had enough funds, so he promised he would not enter the race unless he gathered two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She learned that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000, would only give her $ 250.
"Do they think there should be a discount for me?" she asked.
During the speech in which he announced that it would not start a formal campaign, it was so overwhelmed by emotions, or gratitude to people who supported her, frustration from the system that was so hard to gather funds and targe voters, not delegates and anger to sexism, she began to cry.
"If you saw me, you would probably think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalls how the media reacted to the incident.
"You'd think "Clinex" is my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my grave plate.
"She cried?"
As a trade war between the United States and China can be a good job for Peking
The opening of the fire with the beginning of the trade war between the United States and China was deaf, despite the battle is far from finished, the conflict among countries can be useful for Beijing on a long-term plan, experts say.
Donald Tramp, US President, gave the first warning in the beginning of this year by taxing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The situation was significantly escalated during this week by introducing new goods tariffs worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), which effectively taxed half of the goods coming from China.
Beijing returned to nature every time, or recently imposed five to ten percent of American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China promised to return to the United States equally, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will quit the same soon.
To make Washington retreat means accepting his requests, but public worship before the United States would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Peking plays well, pressures from the US trade war can result in positive support for China on a long-term basis because the interdependence of both economies will reduce.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for starting a sudden decline from a economic perspective in which any of the countries is much more dangerous than the observers had previously established," Abigail Grace, a research collaborator focusing on Asia in the Centre for New American Security, which represents a tink-tank.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, Foreign Minister said
Syria says she is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and makes efforts to help renew the country that remains devastated by the long war that lasted over seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem said the conditions in the country improved.
"The situation in the field today is stable and safer, which is due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew the areas devastated by terrorists in order to restore the condition to normal.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilaterally introduced economic measures that affected their daily and life.
UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Additional six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime welcomes the aid to the renewal of the desolate country.
But he emphasized that he would not accept conditional aid or help from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe has achieved a significant victory of Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the United States team at Rider Cup 2018 with a final result of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has already lost six times in a European field and has not won the title of the Rider Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the primate after the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn team reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Michelson who faced difficulties over the majority of the tournament, in his first hole hit the ball into a couple-three hole to the 16th hole, losing from Francesco Molinari.
Italian golf player Molinari was highlighted in all circles, and became one of the four players who achieved the results of 5-0-0 since the tournament began to be organized in the current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Speed lost the results of 5:4 of the lowest rating player of the European team, Torbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest ranked player, lost with 2 and 1 of Ian Poulter from England, who might have played the Rider Cup the last time.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, a participant of eight Rider Cups, became a European who won the most titles of the tournament with 25.5 points during his career.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't stop today.
This year was really hard.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so happy that we brought the title back.
The team game is most important and I am happy to help," the emotional Garcia said after Europe's victory.
He's now departing the place of his fellow John Ram, who on Sunday one beats Tyger Woods, the American golf legend, resulting in 2:1.
"I feel incredibly proud to beat Tyger Woods, and I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four games in France and now he's got a record of 13-21-3 in the Rider Cup.
It's about an incredible statistics of one of the best players of all times, who won 14 large titles, and ranked by Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team has been trying to direct the game to low grass fields all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high quality golf during the whole tournament.
The Captain of the American team, Jim Furic, after the disappointing game of his team, said: "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
In one period this morning, we gave the European team difficulties.
We fought.
The hat down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really good.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Professional Golf Association and our Rider Cup committee, and we'll continue.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to confess to them.
We've been overwhelmed.
